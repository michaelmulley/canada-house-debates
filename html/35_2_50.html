	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that there is unanimous consent for the following 
motion. I move:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint it that this House agrees with

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact legislation 
which would require that a binding, national referendum be held at the time of 
the next election to ask Canadians whether or not they are in favour of federal 
government funding for abortions on demand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 91 is not just about abortion. It 
is about democracy. It is about giving voters a real say in how they 
want their scarce health care dollars spent. It is about voters 
deciding which health care procedures they consider essential. It is 
about voters making these tough decisions for themselves, not 
having politicians and bureaucrats make these decisions for them.
<P>
	We are debating whether voters have the right to direct federal 
government health care funding to medical procedures they think 
are most essential and of the highest priority. We are debating 
whether Parliament should decide for the people or whether the 
people have the right to decide for themselves.
<P>
	Throughout my speech today I will pose key questions that need 
to be answered in relation to this debate. Then I will proceed to 
answer each one.
<P>
	First, where do the people stand on tax funded abortions? In the 
1991 provincial election in Saskatchewan two-thirds of the voters 
in a plebiscite voted to deinsure funding for abortions. A January 
1995 poll conducted in Alberta produced similar results, with 73 
per cent of women and 69 per cent of men opting for defunding of 
abortions. In November 1995 an Environics Focus Ontario survey 
found that 57 per cent of respondents do not think the Ontario 
health insurance plan should pay for abortions.
<P>
	As of this morning in the short time available since my motion 
was presented to the House, I have received 109 petitions with 
2,790 signatures supporting my Motion No. 91. I will start tabling 
these petitions in the House later today. Many other MPs have also 
received petitions from people objecting to their money being 
spent on medically unnecessary abortions.
<P>
	Next, how much do abortions cost Canadian taxpayers? A 1995 
Library of Parliament research paper found that approximately 
100,000 therapeutic abortions are performed each year in Canada. 
About 70,000 abortions are performed in hospitals at a cost of 
about $500 each, a total cost of $35 million per year. Another 
30,000 abortions are performed in free standing clinics at a cost of 
about $250 each, totalling about $7.5 million a year. Physician fees 
were calculated in the 1992-93 fiscal year to be $9.1 million. The 
cost is quite substantial.
<P>
	Next, is abortion only a provincial issue? I disagree with those 
who say this is a matter for the provinces to decide. As long as the 
federal government is paying part of the provinces' medicare bills, 
federal politicians have a responsibility to ensure that scarce 
taxpayer dollars are being spent on medical procedures that voters 
think are the highest priority.
<P>
	In April 1994 Terese Ferri, barrister and solicitor and a member 
of the Ontario Bar, wrote a paper titled ``Legal Issues Concerning 
the Public Funding of Abortions in Alberta and Canada''. Ms. Ferri 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is well established that, while the federal government has jurisdiction to 
make federal funds for health care contingent upon adherence to national 
standards, legislation on matters concerning the provision of health care is 
entirely within the domain of the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2974"> 2974 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	From my review of legal briefs on this issue, I conclude that the 
federal government has the power to set national standards and 
provide federal funding in accordance with these standards. It is 
clearly within the power of the federal government to say which 
medical procedures it will fund and which it will not.
<P>
	Performing abortions is a provincial jurisdiction. Paying for 
abortions is a decision for both federal and provincial governments 
to make independent of one another because they each pay a 
portion of the costs.
<P>
	The Reform Party is on record saying we want to define core 
services which are covered by medicare. Is this a decision best left 
to politicians and bureaucrats or to the people? I say it is the people 
who should decide, which is what would happen if Motion No. 91 
were passed by Parliament today.
<P>
	Next, what does the Canada Health Act say? In the legal analysis 
mentioned previously lawyer Terese Ferri wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under the Canada Health Act, federal funds are available to provincial health 
care plans which, among other things, are comprehensive, universally available 
and accessible. The plan must insure all insured health services provided by 
hospitals and medical practitioners, section 7. Hospital services are defined as 
``services preventing disease or diagnosing or treating an injury, illness or 
disability''. Physician services are defined as ``medically required services 
rendered by medical practitioners'', section 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Section 3 of the Canada Health Act states that the primary objective of a 
Canadian health care policy is to protect, promote and restore the physical and 
mental well-being of residents of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately the Canada Health Act does not include a list of 
medical procedures or services which the federal government 
thinks are services preventing disease or diagnosing, treating an 
injury, illness or disability, or a list of medically required services.
<P>
	I think it is about time the federal government start defining 
which hospital services and physician services are medically 
necessary.
<P>
	Reformers have referred to this list of medically necessary 
services as core services which should be supported by federal tax 
dollars.
<P>
	If it can be proven that a medical procedure or service does not 
protect, promote and restore physical and mental well-being, that 
the service does not prevent disease, is not an illness and is not 
medically required, then this should be sufficient reason to deny 
federal tax funding for such a procedure. Is that not right?
<P>
	Further, if it can be proven that abortions actually jeopardize the 
health and well-being of the patient, the federal government has a 
duty to withdraw tax funding for this procedure because it violates 
the purpose of the Canada Health Act as stated in section 3. Terese 
Ferri's legal analysis concluded that it would be legitimate for  the 
federal government to disqualify from funding those provinces 
which do insure such services.
<P>
	That logically leads to the next question. Is abortion medically 
necessary? Induced abortion as interpreted by the Canadian 
Medical Association is the active termination of a pregnancy 
before fetal viability. Viability is considered to be the ability of the 
fetus to survive independently outside the womb. A fetus is 
considered viable in Canada after 20 weeks of gestation and/or the 
fetus weighs 500 grams at birth.
<P>
	A non-therapeutic abortion is an interruption of a pregnancy for 
non-medical reasons by any means. A therapeutic abortion is an 
interruption of pregnancy for legally acceptable medically 
approved indications. Therapeutic is defined as curative, dealing 
with healing and, especially, remedies for diseases. I find it hard to 
believe that anyone can consider most abortions to be the curing or 
healing of an illness or that a normal pregnancy is considered a 
disease.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Dr. R.M. Ferri, in a 1994 psychiatric brief, reported a 1983 study 
of abortion practices in a typical Ontario hospital which revealed 
that 98.5 per cent of the 704 abortions performed that year were for 
mental health reasons. To show that this 1983 study is false let me 
report on another study.
<P>
	The family planning division of Health and Welfare Canada 
conducted a study of 554 women who received abortions in 
Canadian hospitals. Here are the responses to the question: ``What 
is your main reason for your decision to have an abortion?'' Two 
hundred and eleven of the 554 women, or 38 per cent, did not want 
children at this time, did not want children at all or said their family 
size was complete. One hundred and one of them, or 18 per cent, 
said they could not afford a child or that they did not have the 
money to move to larger accommodations. Ninety-seven, or 17 per 
cent, said they were too old or too young to have a child, that they 
were afraid the child would be abnormal or they feared the 
pregnancy would pose a risk to their health. Sixty-nine, or 12 per 
cent, said they were not married, did not want their friends to find 
out about the pregnancy, that the child was not their partner's, that 
the partner did not want a child or believed the pregnancy 
threatened their mental health. Seventy-six, or 14 per cent, said 
they were alone, did not want to raise a child, would have to quit 
school or a job, or that it would interfere with their career plans.
<P>
	These responses demonstrate that most women seeking 
abortions do so for reasons other than treatment for medical or 
mental health problems.
<P>
	Dr. Ferri concluded from his literature review that, first, abortion 
is not a verifiable remedy which significantly improves the health 
of a patient; second, the safety, efficacy and validity of abortion for 
mental health reasons has not been proven; third, abortions
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2975"> 2975 </A></B>
<P>
performed for psychiatric reasons worsen a woman's mental 
health; fourth, abortion is not therapeutic and is actually harmful to 
women's mental health; and fifth, funding by the government 
under a health care plan cannot be justified.
<P>
	In 1989 The Psychiatric Journal of the University of Ottawa, 
Volume 14, No. 4, published a major Canadian survey of studies on 
abortion for mental and emotional health reasons. The study survey 
was conducted by Dr. Philip Ney, the psychiatric director of the 
adolescent unit of the Queen Alexandria Hospital in Victoria, B.C. 
The study concluded that, first, there is no satisfactory evidence 
that abortion improves the psychological state. Second, mental ill 
health has been shown to be worsened by abortion. Third, recent 
studies are turning up an alarming rate of post-abortion 
complications. Fourth, the emotional impact of these 
complications needs to be studied. These are important 
considerations which we cannot ignore.
<P>
	The committee to end tax funded abortions concluded in its 
January 1995 report that abortion is a procedure that disrupts the 
normal physiologic process and carries a physical risk to the 
woman undergoing the procedure. In spite of the fact that over 23 
million abortions have been performed in North America in the last 
25 years there are no good medical studies demonstrating the 
therapeutic benefit to women on physical, psychiatric or 
psychological grounds. The procedure, therefore, has no proven 
medical benefit and cannot be justified as medically necessary in 
any context other than political. My own review of available 
research leads me to the same conclusion.
<P>
	I do not have time today to touch on some of the other health 
related concerns which abortion raises, for example, the evidence 
that is mounting that abortion raises a woman's risk for getting 
breast cancer, a study that needs to be done more thoroughly.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Would ending tax funded abortions violate the charter of rights 
and freedoms? In preparing for this debate I reviewed three 
independent legal opinions on the question. Would non-payment of 
abortion procedures violate the rights guaranteed by sections 7 and 
15 of the charter of rights and freedoms?
<P>
	First, in his November 1994 analysis Frank de Walle of the firm 
de Walle and McDonald concluded that refusal to fund abortions 
did not restrict access, did not discriminate and did not place any 
government obstacle in the path of a woman choosing to terminate 
her pregnancy.
<P>
	He added that the government is not obliged to finance rights and 
used this analogy to prove his point. A right to freedom of 
expression does not entitle one to demand the government pay for 
press coverage. Just because you  have freedom of speech does not 
demand that you have the right to demand others pay for the 
expression of that.
<P>
	In May 1994 Darren Richards of the law firm Snyder &amp; 
Company arrived at similar conclusions. He said that the 
de-insuring of abortion procedures may not be found to violate 
section 15(1) of the charter. His legal analysis concluded if the 
courts found such an action to be discriminatory that the 
de-insuring of medically unnecessary abortion procedures could 
qualify as a reasonable limitation of rights pursuant to section 1 of 
the charter.
<P>
	Mr. Richards also reviewed section 7 of the charter which 
protects everyone's right to life, liberty and security of the person. 
He concluded that the non-funding of abortion does not place any 
government obstacle in the path of a woman choosing to terminate 
her pregnancy and therefore her to life, liberty and security of the 
person is not violated.
<P>
	The third study I would quote is from Terese Ferri, barrister and 
solicitor in the province of Ontario who concluded that 
de-insurance of abortion would not infringe on the rights 
guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	What does the Criminal Code of Canada say about abortion? 
Section 287 of the Criminal Code made abortions illegal except 
when completed by a qualified medical practitioner in an 
accredited or approved hospital. It was struck down in 1988 by the 
Supreme Court because it violated section 7 of the charter of rights. 
It is still a criminal offence under section 290 to supply a drug or 
instruments to be used to cause a miscarriage.
<P>
	Section 223 of the Criminal Code establishes the point at which a 
child becomes a human being for the purpose of determining if a 
homicide has been committed. This section defines that a child is a 
human being if it has completely proceeded from its mother in a 
living state and provides that a homicide is committed if a child 
dies after meeting the definition of a human being.
<P>
	Therefore any abortion completed before the baby has 
completely proceeded from its mother's womb is not murder. 
While late term abortions are not common, I find it unconscionable 
that the Criminal Code does not prohibit them, but this is a matter 
for another private member's bill.
<P>
	I was at a meeting last year at which the speaker was a woman in 
her late teens. She related some of her objections to abortion. She 
had survived the abortion procedure. This in itself may not sound 
too remarkable unless I go on to explain that she was the unborn 
child that was aborted. We need to change our Criminal Code 
definition of murder.
<P>
	In conclusion, Motion M-91 raises several fundamental 
questions. First, do the people of Canada have the right to a direct 
say in how the government spends their  money? This is a question 
of democracy and the right of people to have input. Second, 
abortion is not a medically necessary procedure in most instances 
and scarce 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2976"> 2976 </A></B>
<P>
health dollars should not be spent on it. Third, approval of my 
motion does not contravene the rights of anyone.
<P>
	It is wrong for a government to avoid talking about sensitive 
issues. The essence of what we do in the House of Commons 
should be to fully debate all issues of concern to the Canadian 
people. The job of government is to carry out the will of the people. 
If we cannot decide the issue here it should be referred to the 
people of Canada and not simply avoided. I therefore make this 
request. I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have my 
motion declared votable.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to permit this 
to be a votable item?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising to speak on Motion No. 91 concerning federal 
funding support for abortion services on demand. I want to address 
the role of the federal government vis-à-vis the Canada Health Act 
with respect to determining insured health services.
<P>
	As one of our greatest national projects, Canada's health care 
system is a defining element of Canadian society. Medicare has 
contributed to a quality of life that is recognized to be one of the 
best in the world. It also gives us a comparative advantage in the 
global marketplace.
<P>
	I am happy to say, as I usually do, that the riding of 
Windsor-St. Clair and my community of Windsor had a great deal 
to do with that, starting with early insurance plans like Windsor 
medical and with the great vision of the Right Hon. Paul Martin, Sr.
<P>
	The health care system represents the best of the Canadian spirit, 
reminding us of the good that we can achieve together. Medicare 
was introduced and developed by a succession of Liberal 
governments, providing a tangible example of the commitment of 
the Liberals to compassionate public policy.
<P>
	The Liberal Party and the government remain firmly committed 
to the five fundamental principles of medicare as set out in the 
Canada Health Act: public administration, comprehensiveness, 
universality, portability, accessibility.
<P>
	The one principle which I particularly want to focus on is 
comprehensiveness. At its most basic, comprehensiveness requires 
that provincial health care insurance plans cover all medically 
necessary services performed by doctors or in hospitals. The term 
medical necessity is a key concept. It is an integral part of the 
understanding and operation of the act. The term medically 
necessary is used in the Canada Health Act in  conjunction with 
other conditions to assure Canadians that once a decision has been 
made that a service is medically necessary, then access becomes 
universal and on uniform terms and conditions.
<P>
	In my view this debate is not just about abortion. This motion 
has much broader consequences than that. It is about which 
government is going to decide that any medical procedures are 
necessary. It is about whether our aging parents will have access to 
oxygen when their respiratory systems fail. It is about whether 
children and adults with disabilities will get the specialized support 
they need. It is about whether our constituents will have universal 
access to any medically necessary procedure.
<P>
	Since the beginning of federal support for health care in 1957 
through the hospital insurance and diagnostic services act, 
decisions regarding what is medically necessary have been left to 
the provinces to determine. This is consistent with the provisions of 
the Constitution. It makes sense because after all the provinces 
manage the health care system. The government does not do that 
and the man or the woman on the street does not do that.
<P>
	The provinces work with the appropriate medical experts. They 
are delivering the service, they are closer to the patients. This 
means that decisions regarding medically necessary insured health 
services are up to the provinces and their medical associations or 
those whom they consult to decide.
<P>
	I might add that there is a remarkable degree of congruence and 
consistency among all provinces and territories on this front. On 
the matter of health insurance coverage for services all provinces 
and territories, particularly for abortion services, have regarded 
them as medically necessary services and insure them on this basis. 
I emphasize that there is almost no service that is not medically 
necessary in some cases. These determinations have been made 
based on the context of the service being provided.
<P>
	The government firmly believes that it is not for Ottawa to say 
that this procedure or that procedure must be covered. This 
responsibility is better left to the provinces and physicians who 
deliver services on a daily basis and who are aware of the 
circumstances under which they are delivered.
<P>
	This approach stands in sharp contrast to what is happening in 
the United States where insurance companies are telling more and 
more physicians what they will cover, what they can or cannot do 
for their patients and even how to do it.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act permits the determination of medical 
necessity at the point of delivery of the service. This approach is 
superior to developing a list of insured health services. Lists are 
simplistic and rigid. They result in some services being insured and 
others not being insured in all circumstances. They also invite a 
steady move to privatization especially if more and more  services 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2977"> 2977 </A></B>
<P>
are covered by private insurance because the government is out of 
them because it is not on the list.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Determining medical necessity at point of service is one of the 
greatest strengths of the Canada Health Act. This approach allows 
circumstances to vary from service to service. It is an approach that 
recognizes the medical condition of the patient. It is an approach 
that ensures Canadians receive services on the basis of need, not on 
the basis of ability to pay.
<P>
	Since the beginning of medicare, medically necessary services 
have been made available without point of service charges. I cannot 
deny that fiscal realities have forced us to make some tough 
decisions regarding our health care system. There is still room to 
make our health care system more efficient.
<P>
	Putting our universal and comprehensive health care system in 
place took commitment. Facing the challenges and finding 
solutions to problems which arose over the years took 
commitment. That commitment is still here today. It is a 
commitment that Canadians want and one that this government 
takes seriously.
<P>
	We will ensure that Canadians continue to receive medically 
necessary services on the basis of need and not on the basis of their 
ability to pay. Access to services is based solely on the medical 
needs of the patient. Medical necessity, not how much money one 
has, should dictate access to medical services. Canadians expect 
that they will have medically necessary services available without 
point of service charges.
<P>
	The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring 
that Canadians receive the care they need. What we can and will 
continue to do is to interpret the Canada Health Act as requiring 
coverage of all medically necessary services.
<P>
	Our national health insurance system is close to the hearts of 
Canadians. It is something too precious to tamper with on a 
piecemeal basis. This is why the federal government cannot 
support this private member's motion. Supporting this motion 
could jeopardize the principles of the Canada Health Act. It could 
jeopardize the constitutional authority of the federal government 
and the provincial governments. More important, it could 
jeopardize the health of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in today's debate on Motion M-91 put 
forward by my colleague from Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	Abortion has long been a matter of concern to the people of 
Quebec and Canada. It is a very sensitive issue that brings into play 
profound and very different convictions on individual rights, social 
responsibility and moral standards. It also raises questions on the 
place of  women in our society. For all these reasons, abortion 
could easily become a divisive issue.
<P>
	This, however, does not mean that the issue of abortion must be 
ignored. Unfortunately, too many governments, lacking the 
courage or the political will to take their responsibilities in 
sensitive matters, go for the easy way out and bury their heads in 
the sand.
<P>
	At that level, the motion put forward by my colleague from 
Yorkton-Melville at least has the merit of trying to move the issue 
forward. The motion reads as follows: That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should enact legislation which would 
require that a binding, national referendum be held at the time of 
the next election to ask Canadians whether or not they are in favour 
of federal government funding for abortions on demand.
<P>
	The idea of asking Canadians to settle the matter is quite 
democratic and may seem interesting at first sight. It would be nice 
to see the Liberal government be as democratic toward the men and 
women of Quebec who want to make Quebec a sovereign country. 
These people will undoubtedly remind them of this in the next 
election.
<P>
	To get back to Motion M-91, one must go beyond mere 
appearances and wonder whether a referendum is really the best 
way to settle this matter. After thinking about this and reading the 
documentation available, I can only conclude that a referendum is 
not the way to go, for several reasons.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	First of all, there is a vast consensus within the public in favour 
of free choice; that is a well known fact. An Environics poll dated 
June 29, 1992, indicated that 79 per cent of Canadians agreed that 
the decision to abort is one that should be made by each woman, in 
consultation with her doctor. In Quebec, 80 per cent of respondents 
also agreed with this statement. Considering that, every year, more 
and more people support freedom of choice, we have every reason 
to believe that these numbers are at least as high, if not higher, 
today.
<P>
	I therefore think that holding a referendum on this issue is 
unnecessary. It is up to us, as elected members, to act accordingly.
<P>
	The public is not the only one in favour of free choice. Year after 
year, decision after decision, the courts reaffirm the legality of 
abortion. An often used argument concerns the rights of the mother 
to be. On August 8, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that no 
presumed rights of the foetus or the father existed or should take 
precedence over a woman's right to decide what happens to her 
own body.
<P>
	This kind of thinking on the part of the courts is observed 
worldwide. In the United States, in England or wherever, it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2978"> 2978 </A></B>
<P>
becoming increasingly obvious that the only arguments against 
abortion that may hold up are moral in nature.
<P>
	The motion before us today also raises a totally different issue, 
concerning jurisdiction over matters of abortion. Under section 
92(7) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the establishment, 
maintenance and managements of health care institutions come 
under exclusive provincial jurisdiction. We can never stress this 
point enough. In addition, the courts have vested in provincial 
legislatures extensive jurisdiction over public health matters of a 
merely local or private nature, in accordance with section 92(16).
<P>
	Regulatory control of all professions, and health care professions 
in particular, also fall under the provinces' jurisdiction over 
property and civil rights, in accordance with section 92(13) of the 
aforementioned act.
<P>
	For these reasons, which leave no doubt as to the fact that 
Quebec and the other provinces have jurisdiction over health, the 
federal court of appeal ruled, in 1983, that the general issue of 
abortion comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial 
authorities.
<P>
	Therefore, we wonder why it should be necessary to ask 
Canadians whether or not they are in favour of federal government 
funding for abortions, as proposed in the motion moved by the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	Let us be clear: health comes under provincial jurisdiction. It is 
only because it acted in a roundabout way that the federal 
government managed to get involved in this sector, thanks to its 
spending power. Of course, eligibility for federal funding depended 
on certain conditions being met. We all know the story very well.
<P>
	Upon reading the motion moved by the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville, one also wonders about the appropriateness of 
holding a referendum at the same time as a general election. The 
themes, the stakes and the whole dynamic surrounding an election 
are many and varied, and are not necessarily given the same 
weight.
<P>
	Imagine for a moment that the motion is passed, that the 
government enacts a law, and that a referendum is held in Canada 
and in Quebec on federal funding for abortions. What do we do 
with the results? How do we interpret them?
<P>
	For example, if a majority is in favour of federal funding for 
abortions, which conditions should apply? Who can perform these 
abortions? Where? When? How? For what reasons can a woman 
get an abortion? Who ultimately makes the decision? All these 
questions remain unanswered because the current wording of 
Motion M-91 only deals with the financial issue.
<P>
	By contrast, if a majority opposes federal funding, does it mean 
these people are opposed to abortion? Not necessarily. People may 
be in favour of abortion, but opposed to its funding.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the motion before us raises more questions than it 
answers. Given the costs of a referendum, we seriously wonder 
about the appropriateness of the wording of Motion M-91, not to 
mention that we would first have to ask the Prime Minister to tell 
us which percentage, in his opinion, would be required, since he 
seems to be in the process of redefining democracy.
<P>
	The issue of abortion is much too important for women and for 
society in general to be treated as a mere funding issue, particularly 
through a referendum to be held at the same time as a federal 
election. For all these reasons, and for other ones, I cannot support 
Motion M-91.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on the motion presented by the 
hon. member for Yorkton-Melville which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact legislation 
which would require that a binding, national referendum be held at the time of 
the next election to ask Canadians whether or not they are in favour of federal 
government funding for abortions on demand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will generally debate the basis of what services our public 
health care system should be required to pay for. I will also speak 
on the issue of allowing Canadians to decide how their tax dollars 
should be spent.
<P>
	This is a federal and provincial issue. The federal government 
has the power to set national standards for health care and provide 
federal funding in accordance with these standards. It is clearly 
within the power of the federal government to say which medical 
procedures it will or will not fund. Performing abortions is a 
provincial jurisdiction. Paying for abortions is a decision that 
provincial and federal governments make independent of one 
another because they each pay a portion of the costs.
<P>
	As an aside I will talk about the federal government portion 
relative to that of the provincial government. When the Canada 
Health Act was set up, funding for health care was 50:50. Now 
approximately 22 per cent is paid by the federal government and 
the rest by the provincial government. By the time the recent 
budget of the finance minister is implemented, the federal portion 
of funding will be reduced to approximately 17 per cent. It is an 
ever decreasing amount.
<P>
	Getting back to the motion, it really does not matter which 
government is involved, in the end the same taxpayers are paying. 
One would think that federal and provincial governments would 
target spending of taxpayers' money based on the good it will do or 
the need for the service. In this case where health care spending is 
involved the main consideration should be the impact of making 
people healthier or preventing disease or injury.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2979"> 2979 </A></B>
<P>
	How are decisions regarding health care set out in the Canada 
Health Act? The Canada Health Act requires the provinces to 
provide and pay for medically necessary procedures. In most cases 
abortion is not medically necessary. It is a service which does not 
make people healthier or prevent injury or disease. In fact, it does 
the opposite. It disrupts a normal physiological process and poses 
a risk to the woman undergoing the procedure.
<P>
	Surveys demonstrate that the vast majority of women seeking 
abortions do so for reasons other than the treatment of a medical or 
mental health problem. The member who proposed the motion has 
already mentioned a study by Health Canada which I believe is 
well worth repeating.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	It was a study of 554 women who received abortions in Canadian 
hospitals. Here are the responses given to the question ``what is 
your main reason for the decision to have an abortion''. 
Thirty-eight per cent said they did not want children at this time, 
did not want children at all or that their family size was complete. 
Eighteen per cent said they could not afford a child or that they did 
not have money to move to larger accommodations.
<P>
	Eighteen per cent said they were too old or too young to have a 
child, that they were afraid the child would be abnormal or they 
feared that pregnancy would pose a risk to their health. Twelve per 
cent said they were not married, did not want their friends to find 
out about the pregnancy, that the child was not their partner's, that 
the partner did not want a child, or that they believed the pregnancy 
threatened their mental health. Fourteen per cent said they were 
alone and did not want to raise a child, would have to quit school or 
a job, or that it would interfere with their career plans.
<P>
	Even abortion providers admit abortions are generally not 
medically necessary. For example, Henry Morgentaler told a 
Vancouver radio audience in 1988 that fewer than one-tenth of one 
per cent of abortions are necessary to save the woman's life.
<P>
	Irvin Cushner of Planned Parenthood Federation of America 
testified before a Senate hearing that more than 98 per cent of 
abortions are done for non-medical reasons.
<P>
	Notice that none of these studies was done by pro life groups or 
was even commissioned by pro life groups. It is exactly the 
opposite.
<P>
	Through two decades of widespread abortion experience, 
doctors have increasingly described it as a surgery that carries risks 
to the woman's fertility, risks of chronic pelvic pain, breast cancer 
and in subsequent pregnancies premature labour or miscarriage. 
Studies show that even abortions performed for psychiatric reasons 
worsen women's mental health.
<P>
	Motion No. 91 is not just about the funding of abortion. It is also 
about democracy. Politics has clearly become increasingly further 
removed from the people. This clearly shows a need to give voters 
a real say in how they want their scarce health care dollars spent.
<P>
	Decisions regarding important social issues should be made by 
voters, not politicians and bureaucrats. The Reform Party is clear in 
its policy. It was presented during the last election campaign and it 
will be presented in the next election campaign. The Reform Party 
clearly says the role of a politician is first to tell their constituents 
during an election campaign what their view is on an issue such as 
this, providing public funding for abortion, of which I am not in 
favour.
<P>
	We should hold a national referendum. That is exactly what this 
motion requests. It would give the public a direct say rather than 
leaving the issue in the hands of politicians and, in many cases, in 
the hands of bureaucrats. This will give people a direct say.
<P>
	Barring a referendum, the opportunity for people to vote 
directly, Reform MPs are committed to ensuring public debate 
takes place across the country. Reform MPs will ensure the media 
is involved in these discussions. The media plays a very important 
role in the debate. Through some formal mechanism such as a 
public poll or a householder survey we will determine the will of 
the majority of constituents. In all cases Reform MPs will vote with 
the majority view in their constituencies.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Old style politics and the style of politics being done in the 
House by the governing party are anything but democratic. What 
the government feels is a free vote is really, rather than MPs voting 
the will of their constituents, voting their own consciences in most 
cases.
<P>
	I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have this motion 
referred to the Standing Committee on Health.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to have the 
motion referred to the standing committee?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this motion shows a misunderstanding of the process by which 
medical services are determined for funding. It assumes the federal 
government plays an active role in this determination. This 
assumption runs contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	This act respects the role of the provinces in the delivery of 
health services and recognizes that provincial health care systems 
must address the unique needs and circumstances of each province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2980"> 2980 </A></B>
<P>
	This allows each province and territory latitude to make 
necessary decisions. This also gives provinces and  territories 
latitude in the application of the five Canada Health Act principles 
and the ability to make decisions consistent with their own 
priorities and capacities.
<P>
	In January 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada, interpreting the 
charter of rights and freedoms, struck down the Criminal Code 
provisions involving therapeutic abortion committees. This 
removed all administrative apparatus associated with this 
procedure.
<P>
	This decision invalidated the entire legislative scheme for 
limiting women's access to abortion, leaving the matter of abortion 
to be decided by women in consultation with their doctors.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act requires that medically necessary 
hospital and physician services are insured. The operation of 
provincial health insurance plans and the delivery of health 
services to residents are within the purview and decision making 
power of the provinces and territories. In short, the provinces and 
their doctors will decide whether services are medically necessary. 
Provinces are then responsible for insuring and delivering these 
services to residents.
<P>
	As a statement of federal policy, the Canada Health Act respects 
that the provinces must have flexibility in deciding how to best 
organize, finance and deliver health services. The federal criteria 
provide the framework, but it is the provinces and the territories 
that are responsible for these basic decisions.
<P>
	This division of relative roles and responsibilities has given us 
the excellent health care system we have today. It is certainly one 
of the reasons the Canada Health Act received unanimous approval 
in the House of Commons in 1984.
<P>
	The federal government's role in health financing has been 
instrumental in shaping our health care system while providing the 
provinces with the scope necessary for determining how best to 
allocate federal transfers to address the health needs of their 
populations.
<P>
	It is important to consider what provincial flexibility really 
means in terms of the Canada Health Act. The provinces are 
responsible for deciding in partnership with their health 
professionals which services are medically necessary and which 
should appear on the list of insured services.
<P>
	Each province receives its advice from licensing bodies as well 
as medical associations on a scientific and professional basis for 
these decisions. Each province has its own consultative 
mechanism. On the basis of such considerations, the various 
services have been determined to be medically necessary and 
therefore are insured in every province and territory in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The challenge that continues to face us is the prevention of 
unwanted pregnancies. We know the reasons women seek abortion 
include lack of information  about or access to birth control 
measures or sex education. These can be addressed through 
research, education, counselling and other forms of assistance 
through organizations which provide information and support.
<P>
	One of our goals must be to secure for Canadians the widest 
possible range of choices about whether and when to have children. 
Unintended pregnancy is a particularly troubling and frustrating 
issue since it is largely avoidable. Despite recent advances in 
education and accessibility of contraception, unintended pregnancy 
still occurs.
<P>
	The heaviest burden of unintended pregnancy rests on those who 
are the most disadvantaged, the young, the poor and those without 
the support of a caring family. Youth are particularly vulnerable. 
We must make it a matter of high priority to educate our young 
people to be responsible. We must promote responsible behaviour. 
The importance of education and birth planning as well as policies 
and programs that inform Canadian families and reduce the need 
for abortions cannot be underestimated.
<P>
	Health Canada will continue to make resources available where 
our limited funds permit for activities related to sexual and 
reproductive health issues. These include community based 
projects funded through the health promotion contribution program 
and grants provided to national heath organizations. It is important 
that government and voluntary organizations work together to 
respond effectively to health information needs, especially of high 
risk or hard to reach populations.
<P>
	We recognize the federal government has the legal authority to 
conduct national referenda and that the federal government 
contributes to the funding of provincial and territorial health 
insurance plans.
<P>
	However, we also recognize it is not within the constitutional 
authority of the federal government to dictate the specifics of the 
operation of provincial health plans. The federal government does 
not fund specific health care services or types of services on a 
national scale in the manner this motion suggests. Both as a matter 
of law and as a matter of policy the federal government would not 
intervene in the operation of provincial and territorial health 
insurance plans so long as the principles of the Canada Health Act 
are respected.
<P>
	The government does not have any choice but to oppose this 
motion within the context of the Canada Health Act. The 
determination of what services to insure is a matter of provincial 
and territorial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, responsibility for determining insured health services has 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2981"> 2981 </A></B>
<P>
always been with the provinces. We must stress that time and time 
again because apparently  our colleagues from the third party are 
not in harmony with this concept.
<P>
	The responsibility is determined in conjunction with the 
respective medical associations. The Canada Health Act principle 
of comprehensiveness requires that all provincial and territorial 
health insurance plans provide coverage for medically necessary 
services.
<P>
	Let us be clear. The responsibility for determining which 
services are medically necessary is a provincial one. Even though 
the decisions regarding medical necessity are the responsibility of 
the provinces and territories which manage their own health care 
systems, we find that insured medical and hospital services are 
more than evident between and among provinces and territories.
<P>
	The federal government's role in part is to assume responsibility 
for setting national criteria to ensure Canadians receive the care 
they need. This is exactly what the Canada Health Act does. It 
ensures residents of Canada have reasonable access to necessary 
health care services on a prepaid basis.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Provinces administer their own health insurance plans. They 
manage their own systems. They are in the best position to make 
decisions regarding insured health services. This is particularly 
important given that there is almost no service that is not medically 
necessary in some situations. Why should we fix something that is 
not broken?
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility to promote and 
preserve the health of all Canadians. However, it cannot make the 
kind of decision this private member's motion is asking for. To try 
and use the spending power of the federal government in this way 
would be contrary to how this federation functions.
<P>
	What we should do and will continue to do is to use our spending 
power to ensure that the five principles of the Canada Health Act 
are maintained. There is in this country a longstanding partnership 
between the federal, provincial and territorial governments with 
regard to health care. It is a partnership that we continue to develop 
and promote. Supporting this private member's motion would 
disrupt this historical distinction and balance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
realize there is not much time left so I will take as little time as 
possible. I will raise a couple of points that the member for 
Yorkton-Melville wanted to say before he ran out of time.
<P>
	The hon. member points out to members of the House of 
Commons and to the nation that a number of individuals in Canada 
prefer not to support some things financially and they feel they 
should have a voice. He is trying to give them that voice through a 
referendum. If it is not possible to do it through a referendum, the 
hon.  member would have liked to have done it through a vote by 
the members in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Bloc member said we do not need a referendum and that in 
the House of Commons we should represent the people. I find it 
very difficult to represent the people when we are denied a vote in 
the House of Commons by the voice of one individual. I find that 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I also find it rather strange to hear the government members 
rigorously talking about the provinces' responsibility to decide 
whether or not they want to fund abortions or the provinces' 
responsibility in making a number of decisions when not too long 
ago I heard the Liberal members say point blank that the provinces 
would do as they tell them or their funding would be stopped. How 
hypocritical can they get? One day they are saying it is up to the 
provinces to decide how they want to run their system and the next 
day the federal government is going to take away all their funding 
if they do not do what they are told.
<P>
	It boils down to when important issues come before the people of 
Canada, the one thing most Canadians do not realize is that they are 
being denied democracy by this Liberal government. They have 
been denied democracy for the past 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. 
Canadians want it to stop and I agree with them. It is time that 
democracy started ruling this House instead of the dictatorial 
attitude of certain individuals who sit on that side of the platform. 
The sooner that happens, the better off we will be.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1996">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1996</A></H3>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-31, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
March 6, 1996, as reported (with amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard)</B> moved that the bill be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to launch third 
reading of Bill C-31, the 1996 budget implementation act.
<P>
	Of all the legislation proposed by a government, it is budgetary 
measures that stand at the core because they define the bottom line 
capabilities and concerns of government itself. This is especially 
true of Bill C-31. It is legislation dedicated to dramatic discipline 
change, change in the way government operates, change in how 
government spends and change in how government establishes and 
addresses its priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These changes were not proposed just for the sake of it. Our 
initiatives reflect a reality experienced by governments in Canada 
as well as elsewhere in the world: they have to reassess their roles 
and responsibilities.
<P>
	This does not mean that we have to give up the activities that are 
the government's reason for being: promoting job creation and 
economic growth as well as protecting people who are suffering 
great hardships because of change. Both these missions remain 
sacred for our government.
<P>
	However, in this era of diminishing resources and intense global 
competition-a reality that has an influence on the operation of our 
economy-we must examine ways to fulfil these responsibilities 
more efficiently and more economically. We must also make better 
decisions about the priorities that are under our jurisdiction and 
about those that are more obviously the concern of other 
stakeholders in our society.
<P>
	Getting the government right: that is the challenge at the very 
heart of this bill. I would like to point out to the House very briefly 
a few examples taken from the bill itself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill includes measures to allow the Minister of Transport to 
privatize the government's fleet of grain hopper cars. Other clauses 
will remove the 10-year ceiling that was imposed on the repayment 
schedules for students who borrowed money under the Canada 
Student Loans Act. This will benefit students and may well save 
the government money by reducing the number of loan defaults. 
We propose to amend the Radiocommunication Act allowing the 
Minister of Industry to obtain greater revenues by auctioning off 
radio spectrum licences.
<P>
	An important thrust of our government is to develop alternative 
ways to deliver services. That is why we will be introducing new 
service agencies and other mechanisms to deliver services to 
Canadians with the emphasis on better service and greater 
efficiency. To aid in this process, this bill includes legislative 
amendments to give the government the administrative 
mechanisms necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new 
service delivery modes.
<P>
	For instance, changes proposed to the Canada Labour Code and 
Public Service Staff Relations Act will permit the introduction of 
successor rights. That means unions will continue to represent their 
employees as they move from public service employment to other 
employers within federal jurisdiction. Collective agreements of 
course will continue to be in force until the terms expire.
<P>
	We also want these new service agencies to have the tools they 
need to operate effectively and affordably. We will amend the 
Financial Administration Act to allow for multiyear appropriations 
for these organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the future, we will certainly not be able to improve the 
efficiency and the effectiveness of the federal administration 
without giving consideration to our employees, the people 
providing the services Canadians expect.
<P>
	As we all know, collective bargaining in the public service was 
suspended when the previous government implemented the Public 
Sector Compensation Act. This act will expire, as provided for, in 
February 1997, when the collective bargaining system will come 
back into force.
<P>
	However, when we negotiate conditions of employment with 
labour unions during the next three years, it will be necessary, in 
our opinion, to suspend binding arbitration for dispute settlement. 
We simply cannot afford having independent arbitrators, who are 
not accountable to Parliament, making decisions that do not reflect 
our financial situation.
<P>
	Employees of the House, of the Senate, of the Library of 
Parliament and of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service are 
exempted. This is because they do not have the right to strike and 
are dependent on binding arbitration. In their case, arbitrators will 
have to take into consideration salary settlements in similar 
occupational groups in the public service.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will provide authority for a 2.2 per cent increase for 
non-commissioned members of the Canadian forces. This measure 
will address the disparity in wages between members of the forces 
and public service employees, a disparity that existed before the 
wage freeze.
<P>
	We are amending the Public Sector Compensation Act to 
reinstate performance pay after a five year suspension in annual 
increments for those employees for whom it  was suspended when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2983"> 2983 </A></B>
<P>
we introduced the in-range increment freeze two years ago. The bill 
also contains reform measures regarding public service pensions.
<P>
	All public service employees, those who will be transferred out 
and those who stay, will benefit from changes we propose to the 
Public Service Superannuation Act. This includes the two year 
vesting of pension benefits and new lock-in provisions. Pension 
benefits of public servants transferring to other organizations will 
be fully protected.
<P>
	I must underscore the fact that the government will consult on 
the details of these proposals before they come into effect. 
Amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act will also 
give us the flexibility to extend coverage under the act for a limited 
term to employees who are transferred out of the public service.
<P>
	There are two further measures we are taking so we can deliver 
better service while being fiscally responsible. First, we will 
modify the Financial Administration Act to give Treasury Board 
the authority to establish group insurance plans for the public 
service, to set terms for the management of those programs and to 
acquire such programs by contract. This will allow these programs 
to be managed in a way that is more consistent with insurance 
practices in the private sector.
<P>
	Second, we propose to amend the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act so that the government can better meet its ongoing youth 
employment responsibilities. We plan to provide students with 
learning opportunities and facilitate their transition from school to 
work. Their employment benefits will reflect their training status.
<P>
	This is legislation centred on change. It is also legislation that 
will provide new certainty in an important area of Canadian 
activity, that is, federal support to provinces to better secure this 
country's social programs. This bill will amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. We propose to 
provide secure stable funding for the Canada health and social 
transfer for an additional five years through to the year 2002-03.
<P>
	As I have said before, and as the minister has emphasized, there 
should be no mistake about our commitment to this funding. In 
fact, in the three years beginning in April 2000, CHST levels are 
projected to rise. By 2002-03 total CHST entitlements are expected 
to be $2.3 billion higher than the level set for the fiscal year 
1997-98. To provide additional assurance to Canadians, this 
legislation sets a floor, an ironclad guarantee that cash transfers 
will be maintained at or above the $11 billion level.
<P>
	This proposed legislation also provides a new formula for 
allocating the CHST among provinces. Under this new formula 
which will be phased in over five years, existing disparities and per 
capita funding across provinces will be cut in half. Let me point out 
that the gradual phase-in of the new formula not only gives  
provinces time to adjust, it gives them maximum certainty in their 
planning.
<P>
	It is also worth repeating that this single consolidated block 
transfer represents a more flexible and mature approach to 
federal-provincial fiscal relations. It gives the provinces extra 
flexibility as they design and administer their own programs while 
safeguarding the social programs Canadians rely on and support.
<P>
	I remind hon. members of changes that this bill proposes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. Effective January 1 of this year the 
maximum insurable earnings are to be reduced to $750 per week in 
comparison with the $845 level which would have resulted under 
current legislation. Similarly, the maximum weekly benefit drops 
from $465 per week to $413. These measures will save $200 
million in the second half of this year and reduce the UI payroll tax 
burden on working Canadians.
<P>
	This bill also amends the Old Age Security Act to lengthen the 
period of time before newcomers to Canada become entitled to full 
guaranteed income supplement or spouse's allowance. Under the 
current system, some immigrants obtain full benefits with as little 
as one year's residence in Canada. Restricting this easy access will 
improve the fairness of the system and lessen the burden on 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	There is a final issue this legislation deals with which is part of 
an important national initiative announced just a few weeks ago, 
and this is adjustment support for the Atlantic provinces in 
harmonizing their sales taxes with the federal GST. Some voices in 
the country have tried to make political hay of this decision. 
However, I am convinced, and the government is convinced, that it 
is acting in a fair and responsible way and in the long term interests 
of Canadians.
<P>
	This bill provides approximately $960 million in adjustment 
assistance to the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Labrador over a four-year period. This is 
intended to cover a fair share of the initial revenue losses they 
experience under the harmonized sales tax regime.
<P>
	The government firmly believes, given the benefits that will 
flow from harmonization, that the total cost is reasonable and 
responsible. It is fully in keeping with firmly established practices 
of providing assistance when federal initiatives entail major 
structural change for provinces. Let me emphasize that this 
adjustment assistance will not jeopardize our deficit targets. These 
targets are secure.
<P>
	In addition to the three provinces previously mentioned, Prince 
Edward Island, Manitoba and Saskatchewan would also qualify for 
assistance should they agree to harmonize their sales taxes. 
Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec would not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2984"> 2984 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This deserves one last comment, more particularly in view of the 
remarks made in the House and the media when the Quebec finance 
minister recently sent a bill to the federal government.
<P>
	In a nutshell, this is a totally groundless request that has 
everything to do with a separatist project and nothing to do with 
facts, history and economic common sense.
<P>
	We are providing this adjustment assistance only to provinces 
that experience, through tax harmonization, a drop of more than 5 
per cent in revenues from their retail sales tax.
<P>
	But Quebec did not lose any money when it harmonized. 
Therefore, it is not entitled to any assistance.
<P>
	Quebec has decided to spread the harmonization process over six 
years, and has been able to increase its revenues in the process 
because of the wider tax base of the value-added tax, while it kept 
taxing many business inputs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the basis of the partially harmonized sales tax system in place 
between 1992 and 1995, Quebec would not have qualified for 
assistance and once fully harmonized it still will not qualify.
<P>
	The three Atlantic provinces that are now harmonizing have 
decided to move to a single tax all at once. This means they will not 
have the option of boosting revenues during the phase in period. 
Therefore, the adjustment assistance is essential to ensure they 
have the opportunity to participate in a single sales tax system on 
the same basis as Quebec and the other larger provinces.
<P>
	I have taken up more time than normal at this stage of legislation 
but Bill C-31 deserves the effort because it will implement wide 
ranging beneficial change in so many areas.
<P>
	Let me conclude with the same observation I made to the House 
finance committee. This bill is the heart and soul of the 
government's fiscal agenda as laid out in the budget. The story here 
is quite simple: getting government right. It is one we should all 
agree on in principle. I trust that the House will provide its 
approval so we can get on with meeting that goal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague caught me a bit by surprise. He usually 
takes a lot more time to explain things. With all the nonsense he 
said in the last part of his speech on Bill C-31, about us, separatists, 
acting in bad faith, I was hoping his speech was going to take much 
longer. However, I have to admit that he caught me by surprise.
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in the third reading stage debate on Bill 
C-31, a piece of legislation the official opposition considers very 
important, especially-and here is what I want to focus on-the 
part dealing with the compensation paid to three maritime 
provinces within the partisan initiative launched by the Minister of 
Finance to harmonize the GST in that region of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Before tackling head on this compensation issue, I want to go 
over some historical facts about the GST, although this part of our 
history is recent, well, maybe not so recent, since it only dates back 
to the time the Liberals were in the opposition, but that is still a part 
of our history which is, in my view, full of contradictions and 
cover-ups about the commitments made by the Liberals concerning 
the GST. When addressing such an issue, I think it is always 
important to remind the people of Quebec and of Canada of the 
many commitments made by the current government.
<P>
	First of all, let me remind the House that, when the Liberal Party 
of Canada was in the opposition, when its representatives were 
sitting on this side of the House, they energetically decried the new 
goods and services tax introduced by the Conservative government. 
At the time, how many Liberal members made a big fuss and even 
raised quite an uproar just to condemn this Conservative policy? 
Even during the election campaign, at the end of which 54 
members of the Bloc Quebecois were elected and now sit in the 
official opposition, the current Prime Minister made some pretty 
clear commitments concerning the GST. He said that it was out of 
the question for him to keep the GST if he ever was elected head of 
government.
<P>
	I remember that, four or five months after he was elected, the 
Prime Minister even said, I think it was on May 2, 1994: ``We hate 
it and we will kill it''. There are people in Quebec as well as in 
Canada who voted for the Liberal Party because they hated this tax, 
because they believed in the commitments of Liberal members, 
because they believed that the Liberals, then in the opposition, 
were going to fight this tax with all their might and eventually, as 
the Prime Minister and many officials had promised-including 
the Deputy Prime Minister who was forced to resign lately because 
of this promise-because they believed that the Liberals were 
going to abolish the GST as promised. Instead, the government is 
resorting to the usual smoke screens and introducing the first phase 
of an in depth reform of the GST signed by the three maritime 
provinces, that is, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Not only is this in complete violation of the Liberal election 
promise but this agreement, this vague attempt at a reform of the 
commodity tax will be extremely costly for all Quebecers and all 
Canadians. Why? Because the agreement announced 
approximately one month ago but the technical details of which 
have not been released yet provides for the payment to the three 
maritime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2985"> 2985 </A></B>
<P>
provinces  of a $961 million compensation over the next four years, 
that is, almost $1 billion.
<P>
	This is $1 billion that all Quebecers and all Canadians outside 
the three maritime provinces will have to pay to compensate for a 
loss of revenue due to the harmonization of the GST, to this vague 
attempt at a reform, to this mockery of an attempt at keeping their 
words by the Liberal Party of Canada, when they had in fact 
promised to kill the GST.
<P>
	The government is spending $1 billion to make us believe that it 
is doing something about the GST. One billion dollars to make the 
GST disappear, not disappear in the true meaning of the word, but 
to hypocritically bury it in the price of products in the three 
maritime provinces. Frankly, it is unacceptable.
<P>
	That is not what Quebecers and Canadians had understood 
during the election campaign. In fact, two government members 
resigned recently precisely to show that the Liberal government did 
not fulfil its promise, its campaign commitment to abolish the GST. 
These two Liberal members had the courage of their convictions 
and decided to inform the public that they could not live with the 
fact that their party did not fulfil its promise when it signed that 
agreement with the three maritime provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	What precisely are the terms of this agreement? Just like the 
Government of Quebec, the Government of Alberta and the 
Government of Ontario, we tried to know the exact terms of the 
agreement the federal government concluded with New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. We tried to get the details, but all 
our efforts have been fruitless. Why is the Minister of Finance 
hiding the exact terms of this agreement from the people of 
Canada?
<P>
	We know, in general terms, that the compensation principle 
applied by the federal government is as follows: the federal 
government decided, unilaterally, that the provincial sales tax and 
the federal GST together could not be more than 15 per cent. It has 
also decided unilaterally, without any consultation, that it would 
compensate the maritime provinces if the provincial sales tax and 
the GST combined exceeded 15 per cent. If you look at the three 
maritime provinces, you will see that the PST and GST combined 
are just over 19 per cent.
<P>
	So the federal government has decided unilaterally that the new 
harmonized sales tax would not exceed 15 per cent and that it 
would compensate the provinces for the difference between 15 per 
cent and 19 per cent. The federal government has decided to 
compensate the governments of the three maritime provinces for 
this loss of four percentage points in sales tax, even though it 
represents tax relief for consumers in these provinces.
<P>
	How did the government estimate this loss? We do not know. We 
do not know where it got the figures with  regard to tax revenues 
and to the cost of this harmonization exercise, but the finance 
minister is asking us to trust him, to give him a free hand, just like 
he does every time he makes deals behind closed doors and then 
imposes these things upon us, begging us not to ask too many 
questions. He is telling us to trust him.
<P>
	The government is giving close to $1 billion to three maritime 
provinces for a partisan policy, a policy whose sole purpose is to 
show that the government is doing something about the GST. Do 
you not think it is a bit expensive? Do you not think it is expensive 
for Canadian taxpayers outside these three maritime provinces and 
also for Quebec taxpayers? Between $200 and $250 million of that 
sum will come from Quebecers. And the remaining $700 million 
will come from taxpayers from the rest of Canada.
<P>
	If, in the opinion of several government representatives 
according to a member of the Liberal Party, we have to pay such a 
price every time we need to harmonize policies, every time we 
need to improve the economic and commercial operation of the 
federation, I wonder what is the value of the federalism these 
people have been defending desperately since we have come to this 
place. I wonder what it is worth if a part of the population of 
Quebec and Canada have to pay such a price every time people on 
the other side of the House want to improve the tax system.
<P>
	I will quote someone I do not quote often because our ideas 
rarely coincide, particularly on constitutional matters. However, I 
want to quote the chief editorial writer of <I>La Presse</I>, Mr. Dubuc, 
who, of course, supported our point of view last week-end when he 
wrote: ``The federal government and its Minister of Finance made 
a huge blunder when, in order to convince them to harmonize their 
sales tax with the federal GST, they promised the Atlantic 
provinces to give them $960 million''. That was written by Alain 
Dubuc.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	He added: ``The Chrétien government had to buy them to 
convince them to adopt the GST system because he absolutely 
needed their support to be able to claim that he replaced the GST 
with an harmonized tax of 15 per cent. In other words-and I am 
still quoting Alain Dubuc from <I>La Presse</I>-$1 billion in public 
funds were spent in a partisan way for the sole purpose of allowing 
the Liberal government to claim that it was fulfilling its promise''.
<P>
	Seeing the official opposition in agreement with Alain Dubuc is 
like, in Quebec, seeing Gérald Larose in agreement with Ghislain 
Dufour. Suffice it to say that opposition to the Liberal 
government's ridiculous GST policy is pretty much unanimous.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2986"> 2986 </A></B>
<P>
	More and more Canadians are saying no to this sort of short 
sighted policy, this one step at a time strategy of claiming 
successes at various levels. I would say the Liberal Party is a past 
master at this game.
<P>
	Quebec harmonized its provincial sales tax with the GST in 1991 
and has had one system since then. The two systems of taxation 
were combined, with one administrative body, the Government of 
Quebec, administering its own sales tax in addition to the goods 
and services tax for the federal government. It did not cost the 
federal government one red cent, except, of course, what it 
understandably pays for relying on the services of the Government 
of Quebec to administer the federal goods and services tax.
<P>
	There was never any question of the sort of compensation that is 
part of the agreement between the three maritime provinces and the 
federal government. Why was that? Because in Quebec, everyone 
recognized-business and the public alike-that some degree of 
harmonization was necessary in order to facilitate commercial 
transactions and the operation of the economy. We understood that 
and we did not need a $1 billion nudge from the federal 
government. We understood that and we did not need to be bribed 
to improve the Government of Quebec's system of collecting and 
administering taxes.
<P>
	Why must there now be compensation of close to $1 billion for 
three provinces that are very cosy with the federal government? 
Why must Canadians in other provinces and Quebecers be made to 
pay for this local agreement between the federal government and 
the three maritime provinces? There is something not right about 
this policy.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians need to understand what the federal 
government might do for these three provinces further down the 
road. Not only is there compensation of close to $1 billion paid for 
nothing-partisan compensation from federalists who normally 
support this government-but, furthermore, four years from now 
when the federal compensation comes to an end, it is not 
impossible, and it is even probable, that equalization payments will 
take over where the federal government's subsidy leaves off.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Why is this likely to happen? Why must Quebecers and 
Canadians alike see hundreds of millions of dollars more added on 
to this bad and partisan contract between the federal government 
and the three maritime provinces in the next few years? For a 
number of reasons.
<P>
	I shall not go into the complex details of the equalization 
formula, but allow me to give an overview of how it works.
<P>
	There is an equalization system in Canada, which affects certain 
provinces, including Quebec, in order to ensure that the poorest 
provinces, the ones which cannot  raise sufficient tax revenues to 
ensure equivalent levels of services from east to west in Canada, 
can provide those services. When a complex formula is applied to 
calculate the taxation base for each province, the ability to collect 
taxes, this is where equalization payments come in for the poorest 
provinces.
<P>
	One of the criteria for applying equalization payments is the tax 
base. In other words, if a province or provinces-in this case the 
three maritime provinces-have their tax base reduced by a federal 
policy related to the changes in the GST, equalization kicks in 
automatically to replace this reduction in the tax base.
<P>
	In other words-returning to what was said at the beginning-at 
this time, when you take the average of the sales taxes in the three 
maritime provinces and add the GST, you get a taxation rate of over 
19 per cent. The Minister of Finance decided it would be 15 per 
cent in future, so he is lowering the three maritime provinces' tax 
base by more than 4 points, more than 4 per cent. By doing so, 
however, by voluntarily reducing consumption taxes by 4 or 5 
points, under a partisan agreement that hits all taxpayers in the 
pocket book, the equalization formula will necessarily kick in 
because the tax base has been lowered.
<P>
	Once the $961 million are paid to New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, there is a mechanism which will 
force all Canadians and Quebecers, with the exception of the 
Atlantic provinces, to continue to pay this average compensation, 
hundreds of millions of dollars through equalization payments, 
because the Finance Minister has decided, in the name of the 
government, to show off. By doing this he wanted to prove that his 
government is going ahead with the tax reform, that it has begun to 
hold its promises on the GST. In fact, the government is doing no 
such thing since it had actually promised to abolish the GST once 
in power.
<P>
	This agreement is getting costly. First of all, it settles nothing, in 
terms of sales tax harmonisation. There is still going to be a sales 
tax and there is no single system for the consumption tax in 
Canada. Second, equalization will come into play in the coming 
years to add to the first billion dollars paid by the federal 
government. Third, there is this whole mess created by the finance 
minister and the government through this agreement.
<P>
	As if the constitutional muddle he created was not enough, the 
Prime Minister added to it, through the finance minister, by signing 
secretly, behind closed doors, this agreement on the GST with three 
Atlantic provinces, knowing full well that Quebec had harmonized 
its tax in 1991, at no cost. They did not boast about it. When 
Quebec costs nothing and Quebec is the most efficient and even 
one of the most effective partners in the Canadian federation in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2987"> 2987 </A></B>
<P>
trade and economic terms, they try to keep it under wraps, 
because the nasty  separatists do not make good trading partners 
in this federation.
<P>
	We are trying to find out more about this agreement. We are 
trying to find out more about the subject of our remarks this 
morning, that is, the part of Bill C-31 on the $961 million in 
compensation paid to the maritime provinces. What is distressing, 
however, is that we have had no response from the government. We 
asked for the detailed agreement between the federal government 
and the three maritime provinces. And we, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
official opposition, are not the only ones to ask for it. The 
Government of Quebec asked for it, as did the governments of 
Ontario and Alberta. Instead of responding, making things clear 
and revealing the details of the agreement, the Minister of Finance 
hid behind terms that needed tidying up, saying it would have to 
wait until next year, perhaps.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This is unacceptable. The Minister of Finance signs an 
agreement with some members of the Canadian federation that 
costs us $1 billion, and he refuses to tell us how he reached the 
figure of $1 billion. This is not normal. He will say: ``You know the 
details. Sales taxes are at approximately 19 per cent in the 
maritimes at the moment. I have decided unilaterally that the 
combined tax, the new GST, will be no higher than 15 per cent, and 
I have decided to make up the difference''.
<P>
	There are a number of other questions the Minister of Finance is 
refusing to answer. The first one that comes to mind, which I 
mentioned earlier, concerns the real cost of the agreement. We are 
not talking simply about $961 million. There are other implications 
in terms of equalization payments.
<P>
	The second question is: ``How were the calculations made?'' 
Any figure can be arrived at, it is only a matter of working from 
solid assumptions. But on what basis, on what assumptions was 
this deal with the maritimes reached, and how was the famous 
figure of $961 million arrived at?
<P>
	For example, what is the anticipated revenue from the new goods 
and services tax in the three maritime provinces for the coming 
years? Do we at least have projected revenue for 1997-98, 1998-99, 
1999-2000 and the following years? It is essential to know this. It is 
essential because, in addition to reducing the rate in the maritimes 
from 19 per cent to 15 per cent on average, the tax base has been 
extended, the new tax has been extended and will from now on 
apply to services in New Brunswick, in Nova Scotia and in 
Newfoundland. What more will this bring in, in terms of revenue? 
Is the extension to services of a 15 per cent tax-which was not 
applicable to services before-going to generate so much revenue 
that it will compensate for the reduction of the present tax on goods 
from 19 per cent to 15 per cent?
<P>
	It is important to know this. If this extension generates extra 
revenue, could it be, this is the third question, that the 
compensation of nearly $1 billion-$250 million and $700 million 
of which are paid respectively by Quebecers and people in other 
Canadian provinces-is not necessary? The Minister of Finance 
said that it was necessary. This is not the way to govern a country. 
This is not the way to inform the public about the activities of a 
government, about justified actions of a government.
<P>
	People need to be given explanations, they need to know this 
kind of detail to be able to judge the appropriateness of this deal. 
For the moment, the impression we have-not only us but people 
like Alain Dubuc, who are not necessarily and even rarely on the 
side of the official opposition or the Bloc Quebecois-is that it 
looks suspicious. Not only does it seem partisan, we have 
indications that it really is, according to the consensus reached 
outside the maritimes, in particular in Quebec, Ontario and 
Alberta.
<P>
	Another question deserves an answer from the Minister of 
Finance, namely: ``What were the alternatives?'' Considering what 
happened in Quebec, where both taxes were harmonized without it 
costing the rest of the country a single cent, where Quebec 
succeeded in balancing its tax base and found different ways of 
managing its taxation system effectively, how is it that no 
alternative was considered to the agreement reached between the 
Minister of Finance and the three maritime provinces?
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Could it be that, if the Minister of Finance had done his 
homework, if it had not been only a partisan matter for the federal 
government, there could have been other ways of compensating for 
lost revenues in the three maritime provinces within their own 
taxation systems?
<P>
	If the finance minister had acted properly, and had wisely and 
competently analyzed the evolution of the tax burden as well as the 
present tax burden of taxpayers in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
and Newfoundland, he would have easily realized-it does not take 
a rocket scientist for that-that, by lowering the consumption tax 
from 19 per cent to 15 per cent with his new policy, he was doing 
them a favour.
<P>
	However certain adjustments to the provincial income tax in 
these three provinces might have been necessary. Without 
increasing the total tax burden of people in these three maritime 
provinces, personal and corporate income taxes could have been 
slightly increased in these three provinces in order to offset the loss 
in revenue from the consumption tax. It would have been 
legitimate, efficient and normal since taxpayers in these three 
provinces will see their consumption tax reduced by four to five 
points over the next few years and, unless it is decided otherwise, 
forever.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2988"> 2988 </A></B>
<P>
	Would it not have been more logical to find a local solution 
to a local problem of tax harmonization and efficiency? I think 
so, and I believe it does not take much figuring out to reach this 
conclusion. I believe that if the finance minister had really wanted 
to contribute to improved taxation and to the harmonization of a 
new tax across Canada, he would have gone about it differently. 
It would not have been difficult.
<P>
	I am extremely disappointed by the government's handling of 
this issue. As I said before, until now we have not succeeded, just 
as the Quebec government and other provincial governments have 
not succeeded in obtaining details of this agreement.
<P>
	Today, in this House, I would like to present the government 
with a formal request. Would it be possible to shortly obtain all the 
documents, not only the press releases and the media 
documentation, but also the technical data at the basis of the $961 
million figure, the technical data which would support some sound 
projections on tax revenues in the maritimes and a cost projection 
for the harmonization?
<P>
	When we spend $1 billion, it seems only reasonable that people 
know what they are paying for. Until now the finance minister's 
attitude has been outrageous. This scandalous decision comes after 
others like the $2 billion invested in family trusts which crossed 
over to the United States without a penny being paid in taxes on 
capital gains.
<P>
	For two and a half years now, we have been asking the 
government to act on that issue. For two and a half years, we have 
been saying it is inadmissible, but the government does nothing; 
they sit there and say family trusts are unimportant. That is why $2 
billion from two family trusts were transferred south of the border 
tax free. Today, the government realizes the problem and says 
maybe we should review the taxation system. For two and a half 
years, we have been saying that the taxation system makes no 
sense. Now the government is asking the finance committee to find 
a solution. It was high time.
<P>
	To avoid repeating the mistakes due to its incompetence, why is 
the government not listening to the official opposition, the 
Government of Quebec, the governments of Ontario and Alberta, 
Canadians and Quebecers who are asking that it suspend the 
process leading to the payment of a billion dollars in compensation 
to three maritime provinces, and that the whole question of 
harmonization of the GST be submitted to the next meeting of 
finance ministers which is to be held around June 18?
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that the process would be somewhat more open if 
the government were to table all the relevant data relating to the 
GST and make them available to all representatives of the 
Canadian provinces  and Quebec, so they could talk about it and 
find ways to improve the federal tax system and the provincial tax 
systems.
<P>
	It seems to me that, for once, it would be nice to have the 
Minister of Finance follow his own logic. We are talking about 
harmony, not just harmonization, between the federal government 
and the provinces, but when the time comes to make concrete 
decisions, goodbye harmony. As my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata would say: poof! harmony.
<P>
	It seems to me it is high time that, for such important questions 
regarding taxation of consumer goods and services, the Minister of 
Finance be more open, that he table the technical documents we 
request and, moreover, that he discuss this question of 
harmonization of the GST and provincial sales taxes with his 
provincial counterparts at the next conference. In the meantime, he 
should stop implementing processes like this one which involves 
payment of $1 billion in compensation.
<P>
	I think that most Quebecers and Canadians would be better off if 
the Minister of Finance were to listen to us, for once, and stopped 
acting that way. For all these reasons, on top of asking for 
suspension of the payment of $961 million, I urge all my 
colleagues in the official opposition, in the Bloc Quebecois, to vote 
against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak at third reading of Bill C-31, the budget implementation act. 
In my speech I will critique the latest Liberal budget on how it 
responds to the wants and needs of Canadians.
<P>
	I will focus on the main concern of all Canadians, namely, the 
creation and preservation of long term sustainable jobs. I will 
critique the Liberal government's performance in creating jobs, 
which is what it promised during the last election and since, and 
compare the results with the Reform Party's plan for economic 
prosperity.
<P>
	A government budget is more than a forecast of spending 
practices. It is a game plan, a master plan which tells the people 
what are the intentions, the priorities and the goals of their 
government. It is a promise of performance.
<P>
	The previous budgets of this government have been small steps 
in the right direction. The intention: deficit reduction. The priority: 
job creation. The goal: a better economic future for Canadians.
<P>
	Even though the route taken by the Liberals has been slow, 
arcane and convoluted, on this side of the House we felt that they 
were headed in the right direction with past budgets. The 1996-97 
budget is a much different story. The intention: to pull the wool 
over the eyes of Canadians. The priority: to maintain the status quo. 
The  goal: to lead Canadians to believe that it has delivered on its 
promises in order to get re-elected. Canadians are smarter than that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2989"> 2989 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has promoted its political interest by 
subordinating the interests of hard working, tax paying Canadians. 
The government and, in particular, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance should be ashamed of themselves. We in the 
Reform Party feel that it is our obligation as elected representatives 
to get to our electorate to find out what our constituents want and to 
represent them in the manner in which they want to be represented. 
As this is not the practice of many members opposite I will take a 
few moments to tell them what Canadians wanted from this budget.
<P>
	Canadians wanted five things. They wanted long term 
sustainable jobs, tax relief, long term sustainability for social 
programs, an increased standard of living and to know when the 
government will balance the budget. Many Canadians have come 
to realize that the first four items on their list cannot be achieved 
until the government stops adding to the debt and the interest 
payments to service the debt. This list cannot be achieved if the 
debt is not stabilized and then reduced.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	This list is not too much to ask from a government that 
campaigned on creating opportunities. Canadians were not 
expecting the government to create for them the opportunity to file 
bankruptcy or the opportunity to watch their jobs head south of the 
border or the opportunity to see their payroll and gas taxes 
skyrocket. It is probably not very comforting for Canadians to 
know that all of these opportunities are considered to be acts of 
God by our Prime Minister.
<P>
	Rhetoric aside, let us take a closer look at this taxpayers' wish 
list to see how well this budget comes through for Canadians. First 
is the area of long term sustainable jobs. Canadians want work. 
They want to pursue employment opportunities created through a 
healthy and prosperous economy.
<P>
	The government claims to have created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs. In the year ended December 31, 1995, employment had grown 
only a meagre 8,000 jobs. That is a fact. This number represents 
half a per cent of the labour force. Of course, these jobs were not 
created by government-nor should jobs be-but rather by 
companies and individuals.
<P>
	The national unemployment figure is hovering just shy of the 
double digit range and does not take into account those who are no 
longer looking for work. The actual percentage of unemployed 
Canadians is approximately 13 per cent when including those who 
have given up looking for work. This figure is doubled when 
applied to unemployed youth.
<P>
	The government has said that it is dealing with student 
unemployment. The budget contains a new initiative to  spend $250 
million on jobs for a few lucky students. These jobs will provide 
summer employment for a minute percentage of our youth. 
However, the initiative will not help to create real employment 
opportunities after graduation.
<P>
	I would have thought that after the huge success-I say this with 
tongue in cheek-of the national infrastucture program, the 
government would have realized that throwing money into make 
work projects does not create meaningful jobs.
<P>
	The second thing Canadians want from a budget and from a 
government is tax relief. The level of taxation in this country is one 
of the major job killers. This happens on many different fronts. 
Many corporations that are looking to expand operations do not 
consider Canada because of the outrageous level of taxation. It is a 
killer of potential jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Many companies in Canada cannot afford to maintain the size of 
their workforce due to the taxation cost per employee. This results 
in mass layoffs and downsizing and is the killer of present jobs.
<P>
	In 1995, based on an average family income of $57,000, this 
family paid over $27,000 in taxes of one type or another. That is a 
taxation level of 46 per cent. Some estimates show the level at over 
50 per cent when all types of taxation are considered. The average 
Canadian family's tax bill has increased by over 1,000 per cent 
since 1961 under successive Liberal and Conservative 
governments. That is not double, nor is it increased by a factor of 
10. It is a shameful record. This budget does not provide tax relief.
<P>
	Third, Canadians expect the budget and the government to 
preserve social programs. Canadians are concerned that the 
funding available for social programs such as health care, old age 
security and unemployment insurance will be swallowed up by 
debt servicing costs, that is, the interest payments on the debt. 
Currently Canada wastes close to $50 billion a year servicing the 
debt. That $50 billion is no longer available for social program 
spending on important programs such as health, education and 
pensions.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	This has resulted in tax grabs and clawbacks, especially from our 
seniors. The changes to the mandatory withdrawal of RRSPs and 
the clawback on federal pensions at $40,000 are robbing our retired 
seniors of the savings they struggled for decades to accumulate.
<P>
	The government promised to maintain universality of social 
programs. During the last election campaign the Reform Party 
proposed reducing and eliminating pensions for seniors who were 
above the average Canadian household income of $53,000. When 
we came out in the open and presented very honestly our zero in 
three plan the Liberals condemned us to Canadians for wanting to 
end universality of social programs. In the finance minister's last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2990"> 2990 </A></B>
<P>
budget he, the same person who condemned us for our zero in three 
plan, ended universality of seniors pensions.
<P>
	The dishonesty is astounding. I think Canadians should know 
about it and consider it as we get into this next election period.
<P>
	By not dealing with the deficit in the budget and with the debt 
continuing to grow and therefore the cost of servicing the debt, the 
government is jeopardizing the social programs which are most 
important to Canadians.
<P>
	The fourth thing Canadians wanted and expected from the 
budget was an increase in the standard of living. For the last two 
decades Canadians' standard of living has been dropping. That is, 
take home pay after taxes and other payroll deductions has been 
decreasing steadily for the last couple of decades. Since 1989 
Canadians have suffered an 8.6 per cent drop in real disposable 
income. That is just since 1989. This is attributable to an ever 
increasing tax bill. Due to ever growing levels of taxes and payroll 
deductions Canadians have less money to invest, to buy a car with, 
to buy a home with or to take that elusive dream vacation.
<P>
	The Canadian standard of living has stagnated and regressed to 
the point where present and future generations will be worse off 
than their parents. This scenario is courtesy of the tax and spend 
policies of the present and previous Liberal and Conservative 
governments. Clearly the blame is to be laid on previous Liberal 
and Conservative governments and on this Liberal government.
<P>
	The budget does not allow for an increase in the Canadian 
standard of living, the fourth thing Canadians wanted and expected 
from the government and the budget.
<P>
	The fifth thing they wanted was a definite date for balancing the 
budget. In a recent poll 66 per cent of Canadians surveyed 
expressed the belief that the government has not gone far enough 
with its deficit reduction plan. The Liberals are content to delay the 
inevitable, bleeding red ink at a rate of over $80 million a day. This 
means the government spends $80 million a day, still more than it 
brings in; this is in spite of huge increases in tax revenues over the 
term of the government.
<P>
	Every legislative body in the country has made a commitment to 
get its financial house in order except for the federal government. 
Because of this inaction the national debt is barrelling toward $600 
billion. Currently the debt load is over $40,000 for every Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	The government blames the private sector for not doing its part 
to create jobs. Instead of lecturing the business community on how 
to create jobs, the government should work hard and make the 
difficult decisions necessary to balance its books by the end of this  
mandate. In doing so it would create an environment conducive to 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	I quote the finance minister from his budget speech of February 
1994: ``For years governments have been promising more than they 
can deliver and delivering more than they can afford. This has to 
end and we are ending it''.
<P>
	The question that comes to mind now is when. When will the 
government end the ever increasing debt which requires the ever 
increasing interest payments to service?
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The government's budgets have left Canadians with a deficit of 
over $30 billion. Since the Liberals took power in 1993 the national 
debt has grown by over $100 billion. The only thing the Liberals 
are putting an end to are jobs, economic growth, disposable income 
and certainly not the ever increasing debt.
<P>
	It is not my intention to paint a dismal picture of Canada. 
Canadians are creative, industrious, hard working people who 
deserve a government which will legislate changes in their best 
interests.
<P>
	Canada has the potential to be one of the economic powers of the 
global market. However, until the financial crisis is under control 
this potential of prosperity is in jeopardy. Do not take my work for 
it. This is what the experts are saying about this past budget of the 
finance minister, the budget which this legislation we are debating 
today would implement.
<P>
	Diane Francis of the <I>Financial Post</I> stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberals are not doing the cutting fast enough. By failing to cut deeper, 
faster, the Liberals ignore the real possibility that another recession will hit in a 
year or two and land us back in the deficit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From Ernst &amp; Young's budget analysis:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government did not seize a most important opportunity to clearly 
reinforce its resolve to deal with our national finances. It is important that all 
Canadians not only understand when a balanced budget will be realized but also 
when surpluses will be created to facilitate tax reductions, systemic debt 
retirement and greater flexibility with our important social programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From Catherine Swift, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we are going to see some enduring job creation and not just some political 
quick fixes like some of our youth initiatives, then we have to see a reduction in 
taxation on jobs, and we did not see that in this budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From the business editor of the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>, Stuart McCarthy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are all left sitting on a ticking time bomb which grows by the second 
called the national debt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Granted, it is easy to sit back and criticize another's work, but it 
is much more difficult and credible to offer an alternative. That is 
what we in the Reform Party did when we published the taxpayers 
budget. I find it strange  that the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister continually avoid our questions in question period by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2991"> 2991 </A></B>
<P>
asking us where our new budget is. When you do it right the first 
time, you do not have to redo it.
<P>
	We did it right the first time with our taxpayers budget. The 
taxpayers budget is a logical, comprehensive, efficient plan to 
balance the federal budget. We stood behind it when it was first 
released in early 1995 and so did many of the experts. We still 
stand behind it because it works.
<P>
	When asked difficult questions regarding cuts to social 
programs, the finance minister often refers to the so-called cold 
hearted Reform Party. He would have Canadians believe that I and 
my colleagues would sell our dear mothers down the river in the 
name of deficit reduction. It is the finance minister who has not 
only sold mothers down the river but has sent the farm with them.
<P>
	The Reform Party's taxpayers budget established an old age 
pension clawback for those seniors whose yearly household income 
is $54,000 or higher. We felt these seniors were able to live 
comfortably without the assistance of the federal government. This 
was a difficult decision to make but we were forthright and had the 
courage to state our objections in writing.
<P>
	The Liberal plan for old age security, and I have referred to it 
already, establishes a clawback for seniors benefits at $40,000 a 
year and ends universality of seniors pensions. Surely the finance 
minister must be apologetic to our mothers and fathers who find 
themselves paddleless on that infamous creek.
<P>
	The finance minister is suddenly and conspicuously quiet on the 
subject.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Why is he so quiet? My guess is he has finally taken time to read 
our taxpayers budget and is trying to steal our ideas without our 
noticing. I have news for the finance minister. He can have them. 
We presented the taxpayers budget for him to look at and to learn 
from. That was our intent.
<P>
	He would do well to take them and put them in effect. We would 
see the positive results of that budget. To make it absolutely clear, 
the Liberal government has cut about $3.5 billion more in the areas 
of health care, education and welfare than the Reform Party 
proposed in our taxpayers budget.
<P>
	The same government, Prime Minister and finance minister who 
call Reformers heartless have themselves reduced federal 
government payments for health care, welfare and education by 
$3.5 billion more than the Reform taxpayers budget.
<P>
	What would Canadians gain through the implementation of the 
taxpayers budget? If I wanted to be curt, I could mention 
everything they have lost through the irresponsible practices of the 
present and  past Liberal and Conservative administrations. 
Unfortunately it is not that simple.
<P>
	The most important aspect of the taxpayers budget is that it takes 
place over a relatively short time period. Canadians would regain 
control of their financial lives quickly. Canadians would be freed 
from the strains of our overburdened tax system and would be able 
to plan for their futures in a stable economy with sustainable, 
universal social programs.
<P>
	The taxpayers budget offers deficit elimination and tax relief 
which would stimulate long term private sector job creation. It 
offers a more secure society established through the 
re-examination and reform of social programs, the unemployment 
of individuals and families and the decentralization of social 
program delivery.
<P>
	Reform's formula is one that will eliminate the deficit in a quick, 
calculated, humanitarian way. Debt reduction and increased 
consumer activity will lead to job creation. However, there are 
other essential components to creating employment opportunities.
<P>
	These are spelled out in Reform's five R plan in the taxpayers 
budget: reduce the federal debt, relieve Canadians of their tax 
burden, restore labour market efficiency and reduce social program 
dependence, remove barriers to internal and external trade, and 
renew Canada's physical and intellectual infrastructure.
<P>
	The combination of these components is a sure fire way to create 
an environment in which the private sector can thrive and in so 
doing create long term, sustainable employment.
<P>
	I have already spoken of the importance of reducing the deficit 
and relieving Canadians of their tax burden. Notwithstanding the 
importance of the previously stated issues, I will focus the 
remainder of my speech on an area of job creation which I am 
particularly interested in.
<P>
	As the Reform Party internal trade critic, I am quite concerned 
about the lack of action taken by the government in dismantling 
barriers to internal trade. We in the House recently debated Bill 
C-19, implementing an agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	The government stated in the red book and in both throne 
speeches that it is committed to the dismantling of the barriers to 
internal trade. If this were truly the case, why did the government 
pass Bill C-19 two weeks ago, 10 months after the agreement on 
internal trade came into effect?
<P>
	While the agreement on internal trade is weak and in some areas 
actually tends to enshrine barriers, exactly the opposite of its 
intention, at least it was a start. Yet the legislation to implement the 
agreement was not passed in the House until 10 months after the 
agreement came into effect, almost two years after the agreement 
was reached in the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2992"> 2992 </A></B>
<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadians jobs and money. 
These are the two criteria budgets traditionally address, jobs and 
money. A budget is supposed to outline what initiatives have been 
undertaken to stimulate the economy, resulting in jobs and money.
<P>
	This budget is a sunshine budget. The message of don't worry, be 
happy does not wash with me or with Canadian taxpayers. We are 
supposed to believe the government is doing all it can for 
Canadians. To listen to the finance minister, he has not left a stone 
unturned in his search for job creation and debt reduction.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Unbelievably, the Prime Minister stated last week in Calgary 
that high unemployment is unbeatable. The Prime Minister has 
thrown up his hands and has said that we will have to live with 
unemployment because we cannot beat it. Canadians are stuck with 
high unemployment under this government. If the Prime Minister 
is throwing up his hands and surrendering to unemployment, then 
he should step aside. There is plenty which can be done right here 
at home to deal with the high unemployment rate.
<P>
	To start with, quick action should be taken to remove barriers to 
internal trade. These barriers between the provinces are a serious 
hurdle on the road to economic prosperity. Business groups, think 
tanks and academics across Canada all agree that it is in the 
economic best interests of all Canadians for trade barriers to be 
eliminated.
<P>
	According to the Fraser Institute, if Canadian firms were able to 
operate freely across the country, the average Canadian household 
income would rise by as much as $3,500 a year. This is another 
means of putting dollars back in the hands of Canadians. This is a 
matter that this government refuses to address in a serious way.
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the Fraser Institute, 
the C.D. Howe Institute and others estimate that internal trade 
barriers cost Canadian businesses between $6 billion and $10 
billion a year. It amazes me that this situation has not been 
addressed in any substantive way by the government. Stephen Van 
Houten, president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, 
said that trade barriers result in lost sales, lost investment and lost 
jobs.
<P>
	Many Canadian businesses have had to resort to going through 
the United States, through American companies, in order to do 
business with businesses in other Canadian provinces. It is sad that 
it is easier to do business with the United States and Mexico than it 
is with other provinces.
<P>
	Members may ask how this will affect job creation. Many 
companies are forced to leave Canada because they simply cannot 
afford to stay. When they leave they take with them Canadian jobs. 
Businesses leave Canada,  certainly for many reasons, all of which 
must be eliminated.
<P>
	I have already talked about the high taxes and payroll deductions 
driving businesses and jobs out of Canada. Excessive government 
regulation and interference is another factor causing businesses to 
leave this country. The restrictions and barriers to internal trade are 
another. We are not talking about a few dozen jobs. We are talking 
about tens of thousands and probably hundreds of thousands of jobs 
all lost because government in this country will not eliminate the 
barriers to internal trade.
<P>
	I will cite one example. I will not use the company's name 
because I have not asked permission to do so. There is a company 
in northern Ontario that specializes in the high tech industrial heat 
treating of materials. This company is state of the art. Its workers 
are highly skilled at their trade. The company entered into 
tendering competitions for government contracts in Manitoba and 
Quebec. In both cases, the Ontario company could provide the best 
product at the lowest price. There was no doubt about that.
<P>
	In both cases it was awarded conditional contracts. In Manitoba, 
the job would be awarded if this company would post an enormous 
payroll bond to cover its workers, a bond which was completely out 
of reach for this small company. In Quebec, the contract would be 
awarded only if Quebec workers were used. This is a highly 
specialized company which has spent a lot of time and money 
training staff to do a highly specialized job very efficiently. In both 
cases, the cost of doing business in Canada was too high.
<P>
	The company is now contemplating taking its business and its 
high paying jobs to the United States where it can use the NAFTA 
agreement to gain access to Ontario and Manitoba. Does this make 
any sense? This kind of nonsense has to end and it must end 
quickly.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I could literally go on for hours citing examples of unjust trade 
restrictions within Canada. They would all draw the same 
conclusion: we must do something to rectify the situation. 
Patriotism should not be the sole rationale for doing business inside 
Canada.
<P>
	With regard to internal trade barriers many companies have 
stated that the only reason they are staying in this country is that 
they are patriotic Canadians. One after another have said that 
patriotism can only go so far and that if things do not change, these 
companies will move their businesses to the United States, Mexico 
or elsewhere.
<P>
	I will now summarize the government's approach to budgets to 
date. In the 1994-95 budget the Liberals tried to grow out of debt 
through make work projects. In the 1995-96 budget the Liberals 
tried to tax their way out of debt through payroll and gasoline taxes. 
The 1996-97 budget is really a do nothing budget intended to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2993"> 2993 </A></B>
<P>
stupefy the masses into believing that all is fine and that the 
problem has been solved.
<P>
	I will conclude by reading an excerpt from the C.D. Howe study, 
``Deficit Reductions-What Pain, What Gain''. This study should 
be required reading for anyone who believes that we can first, grow 
our way out of debt; second, tax our way out of debt; third, do 
nothing about our fiscal crisis. The study concludes by stating that 
short term sacrifice for deficit elimination can yield a rich, long 
term return.
<P>
	The long term benefits of balancing budgets in a quick and 
efficient manner will accomplish the following: First is income and 
job security. A balanced budget will put an end to the downward 
spiral that we have seen in take home pay over the past 20 years. 
Second, it will provide tax relief. By controlling spending and 
balancing the federal budget, taxation levels would be reduced in 
conjunction with deficit and debt reduction. Third is social 
program security. By ending the continual increase in interest 
payments on the debt, tax dollars could be directed to maintaining 
social programs such as health, education and pensions which are 
so important to Canadians.
<P>
	The answer is quite clear. The environment for job creation can 
be achieved through the taxpayers budget or a similar approach. It 
also will require dealing with and eliminating internal trade 
barriers. This can and must be done.
<P>
	Through my speech today I have shown that the 1996-97 Liberal 
budget and the Liberal government's entire approach to fiscal 
reform is ineffective and does not respond to the needs of 
Canadians which have been stated quite clearly across the country. 
In this budget Canadians wanted job creation, not vote creation. I 
believe that Canadians can see through the statements of the 
finance minister and others that the problem has been solved. The 
budget will not end up being a vote creator.

<P>
	Then-as now-, Canadians wanted their governments to spend 
their money and to make savings in a sensible way, according to 
their values. And their values were undeniably reflected in the 
principles guiding our budgetary decisions.
<P>
	These principles, underlying the bill being debated today, were 
set forth by my colleague, the Minister of Finance, in his budget 
speech.
<P>
	The first principle stated that the government had to put its house 
in order. In other words, the budget had to focus on reducing 
program spending, rather than increasing taxes.
<P>
	Another principle emphasized the need to be fair, fair toward the 
various regions of this country and its different citizens.

tions that were set out for  the three year period total $25.3 billion 
and we took care to ensure that the burden was shared fairly.
<P>
	Some $16.9 billion, or two-thirds of the total cuts, are to come 
about because of program review actions announced in the 1995 
budget. This top to bottom re-evaluation of what government does 
and how government spends is now well under way and reflects an 
important reality of the 1990s.
<P>
	In today's world where resources are limited, there is no 
question that government must change. If we are to do a better job 
of meeting key priorities we must reduce our presence in areas 
where others can do the job better.
<P>
	The results of our actions in all three budgets introduced by this 
government speak for themselves. In 1993-94 federal program 
spending stood at $120 billion, or almost 17 per cent of GDP. By 
1998-99 the money we spend on programs will be down to $105.5 
billion, or 12 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	From the start we set out tough deficit targets and we are firmly 
on track to meeting them. Our milestone is a deficit equal to 3 per 
cent of GDP for this fiscal year and 2 per cent next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned previously, most of our decisions focused on 
reducing expenses. But, given the size of the challenge, we could 
not avoid a reform of the tax system.
<P>
	In the budget speech, the minister pointed to the fundamental 
principle guiding our tax policy: taxes involve more than just rates, 
there is also the question of fairness.
<P>
	With this in mind, we introduced a number of tax measures 
increasing the fairness of the system. We did not, however, increase 
personal income tax rates. In fact, we have not changed these rates 
in any of our three budgets, because we are well aware of the deep 
exasperation felt by many Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I would like to briefly describe a number of measures we are 
proposing in the bill before us today.
<P>
	I am sure all members will agree that fiscal equity begins with 
the collection of all taxes payable. We cannot allow some 
Canadians to evade their duty at the expense of other taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Measures in this budget will protect the collection of source 
deductions made for income tax, Canada pension plan 
contributions and unemployment insurance premiums. Let me 
explain.
<P>
	There have been cases where taxpayers are encouraged or even 
forced by third parties in a position of influence not to remit source 
deductions and similar withholdings. This can happen, for instance, 
where a secured creditor  of a taxpayer in financial trouble controls 
the disbursements of the taxpayer's business. In an attempt to 
recoup its own losses, the creditor permits the payment of wages 
but refuses the remittance of source deductions and similar 
withholdings.
<P>
	To protect source deductions in these and similar circumstances 
the government proposes amendments that would make such 
secured creditors liable to pay unremitted source deductions, along 
with any interest and penalty charges, just as the taxpayer is liable.
<P>
	It is also proposed to allow Revenue Canada to exchange 
business name and address information with other federal 
departments and the provinces when they adopt the business 
numbers to identify corporations, partnerships or certain 
associations of taxpayers. This will allow federal departments and 
provinces to cut duplication, simplify business registration and 
develop joint business services. From the business person's point 
of view it will reduce the cost of compliance and give access to 
more effective government services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the measures in this bill that 
propose changes to the tax system itself, changes that will make the 
system fairer. For example, we propose to change the tax system on 
investment income of private holding companies by eliminating 
the attractive deferral opportunities that existed until now.
<P>
	Also, the current film incentive measure will go from the present 
tax shelter, which profits high income investors, to a new 
refundable credit offered directly to Canadian film producers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is also acting to eliminate tax advantages 
flowing from family trusts. This includes repealing the previous 
government's decision to allow deferral of the 21-year rule.
<P>
	I will now turn to other tax issues. First, measures in this bill 
affect the tax assistance the government provides to Canadians to 
encourage them to save for retirement. In last year's budget it was 
announced that the contribution limit for RRSPs would be reduced 
to $13,500 for this year and next, then allowed to rise incrementally 
to $15,500 by 1999.
<P>
	In that budget it was also announced that the contribution limit 
for money purchase registered pension plans would be reduced to 
$13,500 for this year, then rise incrementally to $15,500 by 1999. 
However, in this year's budget the government announced that the 
contribution limits would instead be frozen at $13,500 for another 
six years, that is until 2003 for RRSPs and 2002 for money 
purchase plans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2995"> 2995 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation before us implements the changes to the 
contribution limits announced in the 1995 budget. The further 
freeze in the limits that was announced this March will be dealt 
with at a future date.
<P>
	As well, under this legislation, the amount of over-contribution 
allowed to an RRSP without being subject to the one per cent per 
month tax penalty will be cut from $8,000 to $2,000. There are, 
however, some traditional measures to accommodate taxpayers 
with prebudget over-contributions below the old limit but above 
the new one.
<P>
	The 1995 budget changes will being the limits closer to the 
original pension reform target of providing tax assistance on 
earnings up to two and one-half times the average wage. The 
subsequent 1996 changes will bring this target down to two times 
the average wage, allowing us to better target this assistance to 
those who need it most, modest and middle income Canadians, 
while limiting the cost to the government and all its taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	As we consider the Canada of the future, in the early decades of 
the next century, there can be no question about the need to 
encourage retirement savings. In so doing we help today's wage 
earners prepare for their eventual exit from the workforce and thus 
avoid a too heavy reliance on public pension and income support 
programs in years to come.
<P>
	Let me pause for a moment and mention one measure being 
introduced which affects today's higher income seniors. These 
individuals must repay part of the old age security benefit to the 
extent that their income exceeds an indexed threshold of $53,215 
for this year. Through Bill C-36, instead of having them receive the 
full benefit and then make a repayment when they file their income 
tax, the government proposes to reduce the benefit before it is sent 
out. I want to stress that the level of the clawback is not being 
changed with this measure but simply how it is implemented.
<P>
	Let me now turn to another issue which I wish to discuss in some 
detail, the action to eliminate the deferral of tax on business 
income. Under current law unincorporated business owners can use 
a fiscal year that does not correspond to the calendar year. If the 
year end is, for example, January 31, then all income for the 
remaining 11 months is added to next year's taxable income. 
Needless to say, taxpayers taking advantage of this feature enjoy a 
significant benefit over others. This approach runs counter to the 
general rule for taxpayers that income is taxed in the year in which 
it is earned.
<P>
	To remedy this situation and to treat all taxpayers as equally as 
possible, a new rule was announced that would require all sole 
proprietorships, professional corporations and partnerships to have 
a fiscal year end of December 31. This proposal, however, came in 
for considerable criticism from many business people who  are 
affected by the change and from members of this House.
<P>
	The government has listened to them. It recognizes that some of 
the comments made to us were valid. Many businesses are of a 
seasonal nature and a fiscal year end of December 31 imposes 
hardships on them. Operators of a ski hill, for example, would 
prefer to focus on their business in the winter months, not on their 
accounting.
<P>
	Second, a uniform year end would see much of the demand for 
accounting services concentrated in December and the few 
following months. In contrast, the variation of year ends allowed 
by the current system spreads the work more evenly throughout the 
year to the benefit of small businesses as well as their accountants.
<P>
	The response has been to provide an alternative method of 
calculating income, one that addresses the goal of treating 
taxpayers as consistently as possible and at the same time allowing 
small business to retain a fiscal year end that reflects their needs.
<P>
	Under this method taxpayers with a year end other than 
December 31 will have to adjust their income to take account of 
earnings between their fiscal year end and the end of the calendar 
year. There will be, of course, a transitional provision so taxpayers 
can allocate additional income from 1995 to future tax years. This 
alternative method will be available to individuals carrying on a 
business and to partnerships where all members of that partnership 
are individuals.
<P>
	Let me also mention in passing that the decision to allow 
individuals to retain a fiscal year that does not end on December 31 
has implications for their remittance of collected GST amounts. 
Individuals will continue to have the option of adopting their fiscal 
year for GST purposes.
<P>
	The third area I wish to discuss is changes the budget made to 
corporate income tax rates. The government announced an increase 
in the large corporation tax by 12.5 per cent. As well, it proposes to 
raise the corporate surtax on profits from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. 
Taken together, these two measures will generate an extra $260 
million annually.
<P>
	The goal is to ensure that big companies contribute a more 
equitable share of the burden required to bring the deficit down. A 
temporary tax is being imposed on the capital of large deposit 
taking institutions, including banks. From February 27, 1995 to 
October 31, 1996 the budget anticipated this would raise $100 
million over the covered intended period. Life insurance 
companies, which already pay an additional capital tax, would not 
be subject to this temporary surcharge.
<P>
	Finally, let me mention one amendment that is not targeted at the 
fiscal environment but is targeted at the natural environment. The 
legislation acts to eliminate the current limit on the charitable 
donations credit for the donation of ecologically sensitive land. The 
current limit is 20 per cent of income, a level that may be a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2996"> 2996 </A></B>
<P>
disincentive in some cases where the value of the land is high 
relative to the donor's income.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	This measure reflects the fact that the government appreciates 
not only the vital importance of environmental action, but also the 
growing importance of the charitable sector in Canadian society. In 
this year's budget, for example, a number of additional measures 
were announced that will be introduced in the months ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The tax changes we are proposing in this bill are fair and 
equitable. They are totally in accordance with the principles we 
have set for ourselves to give direction to the tax policy. These 
principles, as I am sure members are well aware, reflect the values 
and expectations of Canadians.
<P>
	As elected representatives of the Canadian people, we would fail 
in our duty if we departed from these principles. That is why I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to participate in the debate at second reading 
of Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of the 
budget-not the last one tabled by the Minister of Finance, but the 
1995 budget.
<P>
	First of all, regarding the government's behaviour, it is quite 
remarkable that, more than one year after tabling a budget, the 
government reintroduces provisions that had been announced at 
that time while focusing on beneficial measures from the 1995 
budget, which may appear small but which are in fact magnified a 
thousand times. This amounts to doing the same thing twice so as 
to heap praise on the government and the Minister of Finance. I 
think the secretary of state has become an expert on this.
<P>
	In the next few minutes, I will go over four of the measures in 
this bill which are especially important. I will talk about two 
positive measures on which the official opposition agrees with the 
government, and about two measures which, in our opinion, are 
highly detrimental.
<P>
	I will first approach Bill C-36 in a general way. When one 
compares the measures in this bill with the responses given by the 
Minister of Finance since the 1995 budget, it is like water and fire, 
like night and day.
<P>
	Since the 1995 budget and again recently, the Minister of 
Finance has often told us: ``Since the 1995 budget, and even since 
the 1994 budget, I have put in place tax reform measures to make 
the Canadian tax system more effective, to correct the inequity, the 
imbalance between businesses that pay no taxes and those that pay 
taxes every year. Since my 1995 budget in particular, I have taken 
steps to correct inequities between individuals who pay too much 
tax and some businesses that do not pay any''.
<P>
	We in the official opposition say again to the Minister of Finance 
that he has done nothing to make the Canadian tax system more 
equitable. He has done nothing to make global or specific 
improvements to the Canadian tax system since taking office, since 
his first budget in 1994 even. He has done nothing to close tax 
loopholes, and this lack of action, this laissez-faire attitude is 
apparent in Bill C-36.
<P>
	Since this bill contains measures relating to tax deferral and 
corporate income tax, why did the minister not take the 
opportunity, in preparing to table his budget, to truly reform our tax 
system, as we have been requesting ever since we were elected to 
this place?
<P>
	If those are the measures on the basis of which he boasts day in 
day out to have ``plugged the tax loopholes'', it is clear-plain as 
day, as we would say back home-that it makes no sense 
whatsoever. Referring to tax deferral measures, he claimed to have 
fixed the problem, rectified the inequity in situations where a 
corporation could defer tax, perhaps indefinitely, in combination 
with accelerated depreciation for instance, so that it never paid a 
cent in taxes. He claims to have resolved the problem. He keeps 
referring to the 1995 budget.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	What does the 1995 budget provide for on the particular matter 
of tax deferral? According to this budget, any corporation that is 
not a business corporation must end its financial year on December 
31 instead of carrying income forward 18 or 24 months.
<P>
	That is not it. If that is the finance minister's basis for stating: 
``Indeed, we have managed to ensure that all corporations pay the 
tax they owe'', it is skimpy. Very skimpy in fact, as it does not even 
meet one tenth of the target the Minister of Finance claims to have 
met.
<P>
	This is so remote from the actual objective that recently, when 
the issue of the capital gains tax was raised, the <I>Toronto Star</I> 
showed the weaknesses of the Canadian tax system, including 
loopholes that were in no way eliminated by the finance minister, 
whether through Bill C-36 or even the February 1994 budget. The 
<I>Toronto Star</I> wrote that ``a Revenue Canada report''-not a Bloc 
Quebecois report, a Revenue Canada report-``released last month 
indicated that, in 1991, assets worth some $60 billion-that is a lot 
of money, a lot of wealth-left Canada without the department 
being able to identify the origin and destination of this money''.
<P>
	The <I>Toronto Star</I> suspected that these $60 billion worth of 
Canadian assets had been secretly transferred to tax havens, thanks 
to the permissiveness and flexibility of the Canadian tax system. 
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about $60 billion worth of assets.
<P>
	If this was the case in 1991, if no corrective measures were 
taken, if the Minister of Finance only kept telling us that we were 
wrong, that the Canadian tax system was  good, that it was airtight 
and that we could rely on it to prevent capital flight and outright tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2997"> 2997 </A></B>
<P>
evasion schemes such as the ones mentioned in the <I>Toronto Star</I>, 
then we have a problem.
<P>
	A number of parties, including the major Canadian banks, were 
identified as having taken part in this massive tax evasion scheme.
<P>
	We keep repeating to the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister 
and the former and current revenue ministers that it is not normal 
that major Canadian banks have some 46 branches in Caribbean 
countries alone, which are considered to be tax havens. It is not 
normal that these banks have twice as many branches in the 
Caribbean as in the rest of the world.
<P>
	Now, we learn that, as regards the tax evasion scheme whereby 
$60 billion worth of assets left Canada, a finger could be pointed at 
the major Canadian banks.
<P>
	Everyone in Quebec and in Canada knows that the official 
opposition energetically accused the government of being too soft 
and decried the tax loopholes, by pointing out the opportunities for 
the businesses and the banks, as well as some of the richer families 
in Canada, to avoid paying their share to Revenue Canada. Even if 
the Minister of Finance said: ``You are exaggerating. It all amounts 
to a few dozens of millions of dollars'', we now know that billions 
of dollars, as stated in a Revenue Canada report, could leave the 
country and dodge income tax, that is evade the Canadian tax 
system.
<P>
	We now have the evidence. The Minister of Finance was proud 
of his 1995 budget as reflected in Bill C-36. He even told us that 
there were no problems.
<P>
	The government has made quite a few blunders, Mr. Speaker. An 
unkept promise about the GST; what amounts even to the most 
federalist of Canadians to a $1 billion partisan agreement to buy the 
maritime provinces; the many more blunders on constitutional 
issues. Now, with flights of capital of such magnitude, we realize 
that the Minister of Finance did not improve the tax system. This 
all adds up to a lot of bad points for the government.
<P>
	So much for the overall approach. Let us now examine the more 
specific measures.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-36 deals in part with family trusts. The Minister of 
Finance is not a fast worker, since it took him more than a year to 
implement last year's budget. In 1995, the Bloc Quebecois called 
the Minister of Finance a ``stand-up comic'' and said that the 
minister was putting up smoke screens.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance pretended to address an issue that is 
close to the hearts of the official opposition members, because it is 
quite a scandal, and said: ``We have taken some measures 
concerning family trusts''. You can take any measure on any 
possible issue and still  not do your work, and that is exactly what 
the Minister of Finance did in 1995.
<P>
	He said he was going to amend the rule allowing taxes on assets 
held in family trusts to be deferred, a rule that had been amended 
by the previous government and that allowed a taxpayer to defer 
taxes up to 80 years. Under the provisions of this rule, it was 
possible to defer tax on capital gains until the death of the last 
exempted beneficiary.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance told us this would be corrected and we 
would go back to the old rules. We were happy, because under the 
old rules you had 21 years, which, while not perfect, was better 
than 80. At least after 21 years, taxes were paid on billions of 
dollars worth of assets that were accumulating in family trusts.
<P>
	But the Minister of Finance immediately followed this up with 
the announcement that the 21 year rule would not take effect until 
1999. If you were a trustee, if you had billions, tens of millions, 
even hundreds of thousands of dollars in a trust, what would you 
do? I ask the question and I will give the answer. I think you would 
investigate all the fiscal options open to you with a view to 
minimizing the tax you had to pay to Revenue Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has given very rich Canadian families 
and large businesses, which also use trusts, an opportunity to 
analyse all the financial and fiscal vehicles available, and he has 
given them four years to transfer their money from family trusts to 
other vehicles, or worse yet, outside Canada.
<P>
	When we voiced our objections, the Minister of Finance said: 
``Well, what do you expect, the official opposition is just a bunch of 
separatists''. The usual attack, and the usual rhetoric we have come 
to expect from this government. There always has to be a scandal 
somewhere, something has to happen. Even though we have been 
saying and shouting for two and a half years that the government is 
losing hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in taxes, it 
always takes a bombshell for the government to finally see the 
light.
<P>
	This bombshell came three weeks ago when the auditor general 
said that two family trusts had transferred $2 billion worth of assets 
to the United States without paying any taxes on these assets. The 
finance minister said that family trusts were not a problem, that he 
would deal with that but we had to give him four years to do it. That 
meant we had to give Canada's richest families, like the ones that 
transferred $2 billion worth of assets to the United States, four 
years to find ways not to lose money.
<P>
	But the ordinary Canadian taxpayers will pay. They are the ones 
who will pay for those $2 billion that were transferred to the United 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2998"> 2998 </A></B>
<P>
States tax free because of this government's laxness. Taxpayers 
will pay, consumers will pay, unemployed people who are the 
victims of this government's cuts in the unemployment insurance 
fund will pay. It is outrageous.
<P>
	Considering the sacrifices that ordinary Quebecers and 
Canadians are being asked to make, that the real taxpayers who are 
supposed to be represented by the members of this government are 
being forced to make, we will continue to ask not only that the 
issue of the 21 year rule be dealt with, but also that the 
appropriateness of maintaining an instrument such as family trusts 
at the expense of Quebec's and Canada's real taxpayers be looked 
at.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	A second aspect of Bill C-36 which has something indecent 
about it. The Secretary of State was saying this morning ``As a 
government, we have met our responsibilities. We have taxed the 
major chartered banks. We have levied a special renewable $160 
million tax''.
<P>
	There is a special tax of $160 million on the chartered banks, 
banks which have amassed some $5 billion in profits. Yet those 
banks, if we can believe a Toronto Star article which reports on the 
contents of a Revenue Canada report on tax evasion and refers to 
the $60 billion in assets siphoned off to the U.S. and just about 
everywhere else, are not paying the federal government, Revenue 
Canada, its just dues. They are taking advantage of tax loopholes to 
transfer part of their untaxed funds into branch operations, 
particularly in the Caribbean. As I have said, there are 46 of these. 
It is easy for them to plan their affairs so as to pay the minimum in 
taxes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, since you are indicating that I have two minutes 
left, I will end with this measure and continue after question 
period. The banks are being hit with $160 millions in taxes-a 
temporary measure-when, at the other end, there is $60 billion in 
tax evasion and $2 billion that went to the United States untaxed 
through family trusts.
<P>
	We should compare the $160 in special tax on the banks to the 
billions it is costing Quebecers and Canadians with the restrictions 
in unemployment insurance, for example, and with the cuts to 
social assistance, post-secondary education and health. I think 
Quebec and Canadian taxpayers will realize that this government is 
working, but not necessarily in their best interest. It is working 
more for big business; for the powerful families, like those that 
succeeded in transferring $2 billion through family trusts without 
paying tax; and for certain financial institutions, including the 
banks. I will return to this in my analysis of Bill C-36.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it being nearly 2.00 p.m., we 
will now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the winds of change conference wrapped up its 
efforts to unite the right this weekend in Calgary, it seemed 
shameful to me that the Prime Minister and his Liberal colleagues 
were not invited to the party. Surely their slash and trash approach 
to social and fiscal policy over the past three years is more than 
equal to the price of admission.
<P>
	If anything, the Prime Minister's relentless march to the right 
should have earned him the role of guest of honour at that winded 
exchange conference and neo-conservative fun fest.
<P>
	While Tories and Reformers spent the weekend only talking 
about tearing the country apart, the Prime Minister has been 
actually doing it. He has gutted social programs, health care and 
UI. He has broken promises on GST and the NAFTA. Last week at 
a Liberal fundraiser he admitted there was no hope in sight for the 
million Canadians who are unemployed.
<P>
	Do not despair, Mr. Prime Minister, Canadians recognize that 
you belonged at that conference. I am sure your invitation got lost 
in the mail.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
widespread belief in Ontario at present that the oil companies are 
gouging consumers through exorbitantly high gas prices. Prices in 
our communities go up and down, mainly up, all at the same time. 
Why, people ask, if each service station has different amounts of 
already paid for gas in its tanks do prices change at the same time?
<P>
	In Peterborough there have been demonstrations at gas stations 
to no avail.
<P>
	It is time something was done about this. I am a great believer in 
keeping government interference in business to a minimum. 
However, it seems my constituents are being manipulated by huge 
corporations.

some time ago, the auditor general drew the attention of lawmakers 
to decisions regarding the transfer to the United States of funds 
worth at least $2 billion which were held in family trusts in Canada.
<P>
	These 1991 decisions did not reflect the legislator's intent. The 
legislator's intent is first and foremost to protect the tax basis 
against possible erosion. This was not the case. Regardless of 
diverging opinions and decisions, the fundamental principle which 
is the protection of Canadian taxpayers was clearly set aside.
<P>
	The operation which frustrated the legislator's intent and the 
lack of documentation and analysis regarding the adoption of such 
significant positions fly in the face of the principle of tax fairness.

why fisheries in Canada are in trouble. Political decisions override 
sound management of the resource and political reallocation on 
both coasts undermines industry viability.
<P>

failed fishery?

his government's intention to bring down specific proposals for 
renewing Canadian  federalism, and those commitments have been 
repeated by government ministers on various occasions.
<P>
	In keeping with the commitments made in the throne speech, 
what proposals does the government intend to submit to the 
provincial first ministers at the June 20 meeting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the agenda is not yet set, but it will be shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's reply is again evidence of the government's 
great talent for improvisation, particularly as regards meeting 
promises made before the referendum and in the throne speech. I 
will just point out that in this case, rather a long time later, six 
months, they are still trying to set an agenda.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs' travels to the 
various provincial capitals have not resulted in any consensus 
whatsoever for the June 20 meeting, what basis is the government 
planning to use for its proposals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not understand why the Leader of the Opposition 
is jumping to conclusions. The agenda will be known shortly and 
can then be debated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the minister admit on behalf of the government that, 
as long as the government is not clear in what it is saying, and as 
long as they use improvisation as their strategy, any meeting with 
the first ministers aimed at trying to reach agreement is doomed to 
failure, because unfortunately the federal government does not 
know where it is headed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the throne speech clearly established the direction the 
Government of Canada intends to propose to Canadians. It is the 
direction of a more modern federation, one which works even 
better that at present, although it will be hard to better a country 
that is one of the best run countries in the world.
<P>
	It can be improved, however, by building on its strengths, the 
strengths of a federation which will clarify the roles between levels 
of government, a federation which will work even better for all 
Canadians. And that is the orientation clearly set in the throne 
speech, which the Leader of the Opposition is welcome to reread.

mental Affairs talking of using other legal means, such as recourse 
to the Supreme Court, to oppose the will of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs explain this 
double strategy: on the one hand, a cloying speech to announce the 
upcoming first ministers' conference, and on the other, the threat of 
recourse to the Supreme Court in order to restrict Quebecers and 
limit their right to determine their future even more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there has never been any question of preventing the 
people of Quebec from deciding whether they want to stay in 
Canada, as we would like, or leave it. At issue is Quebec's claim 
that it can act unilaterally, set and change at will the way the law is 
applied.
<P>
	The basic issue is whether they are acting within the law.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I have a quote for the hon. member: ``We are a country in law. 
Canada and Quebec are not banana republics. There is the 
Constitution, there is international law, and we have all been 
elected to defend the law''. This quote is taken from a debate in the 
National Assembly on May 19, 1994 and was made by the Leader 
of the Opposition at the time, Jacques Parizeau.
<P>
	My question for the member is this: ``Does he want to turn 
Quebec and Canada into banana republics?''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the minister to answer our questions and not 
to ask us questions. Things might be more clear.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs even raised the 
possibility of terminating the Churchill Falls contract between 
Newfoundland and Quebec, by throwing the switch, as he put it so 
well.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge that 
his own irresponsible, antagonistic and in fact banana-republic 
style remarks, form a very poor backdrop to the proposed 
constitutional conference where the Prime Minister says he wants 
to discuss harmony in Canada's future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, see how the opposition twists words. I wanted to 
make the point that the only way for a government to ensure that 
order, justice and law are respected is to respect them itself. 
Anyone outside the law is not in a good position to insist others 
respect it.
<P>
	This is why I gave the example of one province that, as 
compensation for the huge prejudice it considered it had suffered 
from being cut off from the rest of the country, could ask a 
government it considered outside the law to comply with it, 
otherwise it would consider contracts signed with this government 
null and void.

We will start in November''.

Canadians are probably going to have to live with high 
unemployment and less job security. Did the Prime Minister ever 
intend to keep his election promise of jobs, jobs, jobs, or was it like 
the GST, just more Liberal rhetoric designed only to get them 
elected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
may well be the hon. member is not aware of the job creation 
numbers in which case she might want to look at them before she 
asks questions. Since October 1993 there have been 336,000 new 
jobs created in this country, all of them in the private sector and 
mostly full time jobs. There will be further statistics to come in the 
answer to the supplementary question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is one 
thing to talk about jobs created. I wonder how many were lost to 
balance that out.
<P>
	The finance minister can spout off all he likes but Canadians 
know the real numbers in terms of unemployment: 1.4 million 
Canadians are unemployed; 30 per cent of Canadian workers are 
underemployed; and one in four Canadians are living in fear of 
losing their jobs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's statement about perpetually high 
underemployment and unemployment is simply an admission of 
failure. That should sound familiar because that is exactly what he 
told Kim Campbell when she said underemployment and 
unemployment will live with us until the year 2000.
<P>

flip-flop, is such high unemployment the flip or just the flop?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has been a decline in the unemployment rate. It has come 
down 1.8 per cent since we have taken office. This is despite the job 
losses that have occurred at the federal, provincial and municipal 
government levels. There has been substantial job creation in the 
private sector. The government's policies are working. If anybody

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
truth is that this government has broken one promise after another 
since it was elected. The GST was supposed to be scrapped but 
oops, that was a mistake. It is still with us. Jobs, jobs, jobs were 
supposed to be created but the reality of the numbers are that 1.4 
million Canadians are still unemployed. The Prime Minister says 
Canadians are simply going to have to learn to live with it.
<P>
	Will the finance minister admit that he has failed and 
unfortunately Canadians are just going to have to learn to live with 
it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is nobody on either side of the House who takes joy in the fact 
that the unemployment rate in this country as in many other 
industrial countries is too high.
<P>
	The fact is the hon. member has been given numbers which 
clearly demonstrate that what she should really do is ask her 
questions spontaneously and not prepare her supplementaries 
before she comes into the House.
<P>
	The real question is what would have happened if the Reform 
Party policies had been put in place? We would have had the 
decimation of the social safety net and the decimation virtually of 
every positive government program. What would the 
unemployment rate have been with the policies of the Reform Party 
which would eviscerate this government's capacity to create jobs 
and give Canadians a chance?
<P>
	We are very proud of our record. On the weekend the Reform 
Party once again called for massive cutbacks in social assistance 
and massive cutbacks in the government's ability to help 
Canadians. One hesitates to think of what kind of country we would 
have if that bunch ever came into power.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the federal government announced the $1 billion 
agreement reached with the three maritime provinces concerning 
the GST, protest has been growing stronger, particularly in Quebec, 
Ontario and Alberta. While federal-provincial relations are 
deteriorating over this issue, and many others, the Minister of 
Finance stubbornly refuses to make the details of the agreement 
public.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he lift the veil of 
secrecy surrounding the details of the agreement with the maritime 
provinces, so that, at last,  we can all know how and at what price 
he managed to reach this partisan agreement regarding the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the details of the agreement are well known. We released a 
statement explaining all the major points of the agreement.
<P>
	We are now negotiating the final agreement, which is not yet 
ready. I can assure you that, as soon as the agreement is ready, it 
will be submitted to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not right for the federal government to pay almost $1 
billion to the maritime provinces, with taxpayers' money, without 
providing details on anticipated revenues, harmonizing costs and 
the impact of expanding the tax base to include services. It does not 
make sense. This is the information that the Quebec government 
has been asking since the very beginning.
<P>
	I think the Minister of Finance made a mistake. He may have a 
chance to correct it. Why does he not delay any decision on the 
GST until the next finance ministers' meeting, on June 18? He will 
then be able to make, in concert with the provinces, a good, 
transparent and fair decision on the harmonization of the GST, at 
no cost for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the details of the impact to which the hon. member is referring 
were submitted by the Atlantic provinces. If the member wants to 
know these details, I am sure he can ask the provinces. I also want 
to say that, the other day, I confirmed that the whole issue of tax 
and sales tax harmonization will be on the agenda when finance 
ministers meet in June.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Last week in Calgary the Prime Minister said that high 
unemployment was systemic and it is the result of the global 
economy.
<P>
	On behalf of the Prime Minister, would the Minister of Human 
Resources Development tell the House why high unemployment is 
the result of the global economy?

question and I welcome him into his new role. I want to say with all 
humility that if I were able to answer that question I probably 
would be in a place other than this and it would be a lot higher up 
than this altitude.
<P>

<B><A NAME="3005"> 3005 </A></B>
<P>
	I have just come back from the OECD where countries like the 
United Kingdom, France and Italy wondered about the very same 
question. We in Canada are faced with a rate of unemployment 
of 9.6 per cent. It is far too high. We all agree on that. Other 
countries in the G-7 for example suffer from higher rates of 
unemployment and are faced with even greater challenges as they 
try to respond to the global environment we all have to operate 
in.
<P>
	We must all work together. I want to give credit to the provinces 
as well as the Minister of Finance. The direction we are going in 
Canada has certainly taken us to a point where we can now say that 
we have reduced the unemployment rate by some 2 per cent or 
more in the last couple of years. We still have a long way to go but 
unlike a lot of other countries, we are going in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is all well and good but it begs the question: How can 
the global economy be the saviour of our future on the one hand 
and the destroyer of our future on the other? The Prime Minister is 
going to have to get his answer straight because there is a lack of 
confidence in our economy when the Prime Minister makes 
half-baked statements that he does not have a clue about. It 
endangers the prospects of the country.
<P>
	During the 1993 election the Prime Minister ridiculed Kim 
Campbell because she said that high unemployment was systemic 
and would stick around until the year 2000. In Calgary last week 
the Prime Minister agreed with Kim Campbell's assessment. 
Which Prime Minister should Canadians believe: the election 
candidate for Prime Minister or today's Prime Minister who is 
admitting that he does not know what to do either?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would just 
think about what he said, the Prime Minister everyone should listen 
to is the Prime Minister who ran for that office in 1993 and the 
Prime Minister who is in office now. If the hon. member would 
check he would know that when those statements were made the 
unemployment rate was in double digits. In fact, since we came to 
office in October 1993 there has been a substantial reduction in the 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	No one anywhere in the world is not going to have to face the 
global challenges. The difficulty with facing those challenges is 
that choices have to be made. We as a government have made those 
choices. I am afraid the hon. member and his party do not even 
recognize the challenges yet.

is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	In a document made public this morning, Quebec's minister of 
immigration and cultural communities revealed that Montreal had 
become the main port of entry in Canada for refugees. In the last 12 
years, over 120,000 refugees have entered through Montreal. In the 
last two years, the number of refugee claimants was even higher in 
Montreal than in Toronto.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that 56 per cent of claimants 
arriving in Ontario obtain refugee status, while the proportion in 
Quebec is 70 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, you will forgive me if I am a little taken aback by the 
question from the member for Bourassa. Am I to understand that he 
is asking that more refugee status claimants be turned down in the 
Montreal area? Is that what I am to understand? Am I to understand 
that he is asking that the minister intervene with the quasi judicial 
tribunal responsible for making these decisions? If so, I cannot 
share his opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at least the 
minister should recognize that Quebec is much more generous than 
the other provinces when it comes to refugees.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether her government would give 
favourable consideration to future proposals from the Government 
of Quebec regarding a new cost sharing to help with the social 
benefits provided to those seeking asylum, in light of the very 
recent statement by the Quebec minister responsible for relations

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has been 
dragging his feet on making substantial changes to the way western 
grain is marketed. Meanwhile, the recent threat to the status quo 
Canadian Wheat Board monopoly powers resulted in immediate 
and swift action by the minister within one hour.
<P>
	The prairie economy is being cheated out of hundreds of 
millions of dollars by the minister's failure to reform western grain 
marketing.
<P>
	Will the minister act immediately to require the Canadian Wheat 
Board's buy back prices be based on the projected final Canadian 
price rather than significantly higher U.S. prices, thereby allowing 
producers with legal export permits to realize the benefit of better 
prices when they find them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman knows that the 
purpose of the buy back policy as practised by the Canadian Wheat 
Board is to ensure that all western Canadian grain farmers can 
share in the value of the pooling process rather than that value 
being reserved for the limited few.
<P>
	With respect to the general operations of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, that subject is being examined very closely by the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel. The panel is looking at a variety of 
methods by which the board's operations can be made more 
flexible, more responsive and can be enhanced in the very best 
interests of all western Canadian farmers.
<P>
	It is fundamentally important for all of us in this House to 
recognize that we must act in the interests of all of those whom we 
seek to represent. That would refer to all western Canadian farmers 
and not just a select few.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think that the minister of agriculture 
understands that all prairie farmers are getting less money than 
they should right now. Prairie grain farmers are paid two to three 
dollars less for their wheat than American farmers.
<P>
	The minister might have avoided the problem if he had acted 
promptly to correct it. He continues to tell farmers to wait for the 
Western Grain Marketing Panel report. We have heard it hundreds 
of times. We are missing opportunities for these premium prices.
<P>
	Will the minister of agriculture give his word in this House that 
he will act decisively to correct the problems in the marketing 
system rather than make cosmetic changes or delay decisions that 
will continue to hurt all  prairie farmers, hurt the prairie economy 
and kill jobs on the prairies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question contains within it 
some fundamental fallacies.
<P>
	If, for example, there were a whole flood of individual sales 
across the U.S. border aimed at certain specific spot prices that 
might exist for the temporary time being at certain specific 
delivery points, within a very few days those spot prices would 
disappear, the price would be depressed overall and all western 
Canadian farmers would suffer as a consequence.
<P>
	I have indicated repeatedly that the Western Grain Marketing 
Panel process is one that is fully credible and legitimate. I expect 
the panel to produce a very valuable report. I expect that report to 
be available toward the end of June and it is the government's 
intention to respond to that report very quickly.

Why does the minister go along with the fact that her predecessor

Haiti last week on a fact finding mission to determine what the

<P>
	In saying that, it is not possible to answer the question because at 
this point we do not know specifically what will be recommended. 
Options are being considered to substantially reduce the size of the

request to  the United Nations security council. Until we know what 
the request is and what the security council decides it is not our

<P>
	What I can say to the hon. member-and he knows this-was 
that part of my mission to Haiti and other Latin American countries

other countries and the full mandate of international organizations.

	This option is up at the end of June. Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
visited the Prime Minister on the weekend. He definitely said he 
would like Canada to participate in extending this mission.
<P>
	The Prime Minister then said that we need two things. Can the 
minister not assure the House that at least we will have an answer 
to those two questions: international involvement and the UN finds 
a way to pay the bill.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is hardly fair to say it is an ad hoc reaction when I spent 
five days last week travelling to a number of countries in Latin 
America to talk to them specifically about what would be required.
<P>
	We asked a parliamentary delegation to come along with us. I 
invited the UN special representative to come to Ottawa in early 
June to brief Parliament on what might be required. We have 
undertaken a wide variety of consultations with countries around 
the world in order to determine what will be required.
<P>
	Canada is taking a lead in helping to define what the UN will be 
recommending. We are putting together a consensus of other 
countries to make it happen. What we need to have before we can 
make a formal response is a request. One cannot stay if one is not 
asked. Until they ask, we cannot give the right answer.

	The Liberal government was elected on the promise of creating 
jobs, jobs, jobs and offering hope to unemployed Canadians. Last 
week the Prime Minister said that Canadians will have to accept 
and get used to high unemployment, another broken promise.

does not really know why Canada's unemployment levels are so 
high. Will the government please explain to all Canadians, espe-

broken yet another promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
couple of times today people have cited the Prime Minister. I 
would like to read what the Prime Minister said in a speech within 
the past week. ``The Canadian economy has managed to create 
more than 600,000 jobs since the time we were elected''. This is 
very significant.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development talked about the 
problems of the global economy and the problems that other 
countries have creating jobs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister went on to say: ``Believe it or not, Canada, 
not the government, but mainly the private sector has created more 
jobs in Canada than in Germany and France together''. That is an 
indication of what this government has done. Those countries have 
four times our population and we are creating far more jobs than 
they are.

concerns the first ministers' conference that will take place at the 
end of June.
<P>
	It is the fourth time I put a question in the House regarding the

alludes to some elements, but the provinces were consulted and we 
can only presume that this consultation process resulted in 
decisions being made regarding the agenda.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	On September 6, 1995, Mr. Jaswant Khalra, a prominent human 
rights activist, disappeared from his  home in Amritsar, India. 
When Mr. Khalra visited Parliament Hill last year, he expressed 
fear for his life to many parliamentarians. Mr. Khalra's family 
believe that he was forcibly taken by the police.
<P>
	Could the secretary of state give the House an update on Mr. 
Khalra's fate and what action the Canadian government is taking on 
this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has made repeated 
representations to the Government of India on the disappearance of 
Mr. Khalra.
<P>
	During the recent visit of the Team Canada mission to India, 
both the Prime Minister and I discussed the case with our Indian 
counterparts.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	The high profile of the case has led to an order by the Supreme 
Court of India to the powerful Central Bureau of Investigation to 
begin its own investigation of the disappearance. Pending the 
conclusion of the CBI's investigation, the National Commission of 
Human Rights has suspended its own inquiry.
<P>
	In the meantime, officials of NCHR are in regular contact with 
the CBI. They are confident the latter is doing the right thing and 
heading in the right direction.
<P>
	Today, however, there is no news concerning the whereabouts of 
Mr. Khalra. Rest assured Canada is putting a high priority on this 
case and will continue to monitor the whereabouts of Mr. Khalra.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like to ask you whether this question of 
privilege arises from something that took place during the period 
for oral questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Very well. Please proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, during the period for oral questions, 
my colleague, the hon. member for Bourassa, asked a question of 
the immigration minister. The Minister for Human Resources 
Development made unacceptable, unparliamentary remarks to my 
colleague, the hon. member for Bourassa.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bourassa is of Latin American origin. He is 
also a Canadian citizen. He is a sovereignist, and was elected as a 
sovereignist. He is entitled to his opinions, whether or not they are 
to the liking of the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
However, the Minister of Human Resources Development, who has 
a rather odd understanding of democracy, shouted at my colleague 
from Bourassa: ``If you are not happy, get yourself another 
country''.
<P>
	That is unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the Chair did not hear what was 
said. I am not certain that this is a question of privilege. But we 
have the minister with us today and it was he who was referred to in 
these allegations. If he wishes to clarify the situation, he may have 
the floor.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify exactly 
what I did say. The hon. member stood up in this House to ask 
questions on immigration and refugees.
<P>
	What I said in this House, and repeat now, was that he ought to 
decide which country he respects. While it was Canada which gave 
him citizenship, here he is now seated in this House preaching 
separatism. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie rose 
on a question of privilege. If words were exchanged between 
members of Parliament I can see that these words might not be 
acceptable to one side or the other.
<P>
	However, because it was raised as a question of privilege, I judge 
this not to be a question of privilege. It might have been a question 
for clarification or of order, but my ruling is this is not a question of 
privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this a question of privilege or a point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> A point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this a new point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> After what the minister just said-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I have ruled on the question of 
privilege, and it is my opinion that we are now moving on to the 
debates. I do not believe it was a point of order. Sometimes things 
are said in this House, on one side or the other, that are not 
acceptable. In my opinion, this is debate. I would like to close the 
incident here.
<P>
	It is not, in my opinion, a question of privilege. If the comments 
are on my ruling on the question of privilege, I do not wish to hear 
any more about it at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would a clarification.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to understand properly. 
I raised a question of privilege on something said during question 
period, and you declare it is not a question of privilege. I would like 
some clarification. I cannot therefore address the unacceptable 
things said by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
without-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We can get into a debate with any member of the House at any 
time. I have ruled this is not a question of privilege and at this point 
it is not a point of order. There may be a debate on this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Of course, all members have their opinions on what was said and 
what is said; that is why we have debates here in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not want to get into a debate with the hon. member 
who has just spoken or on the Speaker's ruling. It is clear that the 
Chair has settled the matter.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Once the Speaker has made a ruling, I think it is inconsistent 
with our parliamentary traditions to question or otherwise 
comment on the quality of this ruling. The Speaker presides over 
this House and I think he does a good job.
<P>
	From time to time, members on both sides of the House are not 
always complimentary toward one another. A few moments ago, I 
heard a member across the way accuse my colleague, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, an Acadian, of being 
assimilated. I do not think he appreciated these comments either. 
The hon. member has just left the room.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3012"> 3012 </A></B>
<P>
	A few days ago, similar charges were levelled against me. 
Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, whenever we as parliamentarians are 
involved in a dispute, we should come to you for a ruling. You 
did settle this matter and I think it is unacceptable for members 
to question your judgment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I understand that in the heat of debate on what 
goes on in the House certain expressions and words are sometimes 
used. As your Speaker, in debate I give you all the leeway possible.
<P>
	However, when a decision is made by your Speaker it is made 
with the House in mind. I hope hon. members would accept these 
decisions in the spirit with which they are made in the hope that 
true debate can occur.
<P>
	I hope any remarks after I made my decision were not directed at 
the Chair. In my view this would be unacceptable. I ask members 
that after a decision has been made it be accepted as such and that 
we move on.
<P>
	We have debates in front of us today and I propose we move to 
the debates at this time. If there is reason for me to come back to 
the House after I review what has been said in <I>Hansard</I> and on 
television, I will do so.
<P>
	However, like members, I hold the office of the Speaker in the 
highest regard. We must if we are to operate in the House.
<P>
	At this point at least, until I have information to the contrary, I 
believe we should get on with the work of the House which is 
debate.

amendment to remove the rights of denominational classes of 
persons to operate their own schools following a provincial

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a question standing in my name on the Order 
Paper since March 6, 1996. I am referring to  Question Q-19. A 
little while ago, I asked the government whether an answer would 
be forthcoming. Since then, my question has remained 
unanswered. This is a very simple question. I would like to know 
whether or not the government will be answering this very simple 
question concerning the Privy Council. These things are easy to 
assess and there should be no problem in giving an answer on this.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Since March 6, no answer has been provided by the government 
to this very simple question. Is it trying to hide something? Are 
there things it does not want Quebec to know about? I do not know. 
But I am persistent and I will rise in this House every week to ask 
the government to answer my question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague knows, we have 
nothing to hide. The question is in process and we are preparing an 
appropriate answer.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-36, 
an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Office 
of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the Old Age 
Security Act and the Canada Shipping Act, be read the second time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I shall resume my demonstration where I left off when I 
was interrupted by question period. I was trying to make taxpayers 
in Quebec and Canada understand why we oppose Bill C-36 which 
is implementing certain measures announced not in the finance 
minister's latest budget but rather in the 1995 budget.
<P>
	We were noting earlier that many of the measures contained in 
this bill and in the 1995 budget were merely ad hoc measures 
relating to some small and often insignificant aspects of corporate 
taxation. Let me give you an example.
<P>
	Last year, the Minister of Finance told us: ``I am pleased because 
my 1995 budget will ensure that corporations, and large 
corporations in particular, the big companies, pay more taxes. The 
relative amounts paid by taxpayers versus businesses-small, 
medium and big in particular-will be readjusted''.
<P>
	One of the measures announced with great pomp to restore 
equity and efficiency to the corporate taxation system was a special 
tax whereby $160 million would be collected from Canadian 
banks.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would have two remarks to make on 
this subject. First, this special tax of $160 million is ridiculous, 
given that last year major Canadian banks made record profits of 
close to $5 billion. Second, it is also ridiculous that, in Canada, 
major banks, financial institutions and corporations, as well as very 
rich families, can take advantage of the tax system's flaws, 
flexibility and loopholes, as shown by two recent scandals.
<P>
	There always has to be a scandal somewhere. In the first part of 
my speech, I referred to two major scandals that were uncovered: 
one by the Auditor General of Canada, the other by the prestigious 
<I>Toronto Star</I>.
<P>
	The auditor general was very clear. Through family trusts, a 
system which the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, has been 
condemning since it arrived in this House, two family trusts were 
able to transfer $2 billion to the United States, without paying one 
penny in taxes on capital gains, $2 billion.
<P>
	The second scandal, which involves, indirectly if not directly, 
major Canadian banks, was exposed on May 9 by the <I>Toronto Star</I>. 
The newspaper got hold of a Revenue Canada study which had 
been released shortly before to a select group and which stated that, 
in 1991, tax evasion amounted to no less than $60 billion. In other 
words, no less than $60 billion left Canada, possibly to be invested 
in countries deemed to be tax havens.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Since then, there has been no major change in the way capital 
gains are taxed, even though we have been asking the Minister of 
Finance for almost three years now to take action and to overhaul 
the tax system. We are not talking peanuts here. When you think 
that $60 billion in assets in 1991 alone were moved out of the 
country tax free, as if by magic, and there was nothing that could be 
done because of weaknesses in Canadian tax law, and also because 
of weaknesses with respect to relations between Canada and the 
so-called tax havens. You know what that means. That means that 
taxes not collected on this wealth must be found somewhere else.
<P>
	Since his first budget in 1994, and even more so since his 1995 
and 1996 budgets, the finance minister has been trying to get this 
money from the taxpayer, through various means, first, by cutting 
transfers to the provinces for welfare, postsecondary education and 
health. It is always the same taxpayer getting hit. But because the 
minister has not taken a firm approach to tax reform, he must make 
up the shortfall through other cuts.
<P>
	While these wealthy Canadian families and big businesses are 
taking advantage of tax loopholes, the Minister of Finance will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3016"> 3016 </A></B>
<P>
making up the shortfall by dipping into the unemployment 
insurance fund, in complicity with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who certainly showed us how little he 
cared today. He will use the contributions of workers and  
employers to make up for what others are not paying. That is 
Canada's so-called fair tax system.
<P>
	The <I>Toronto Star</I> focussed on certain interesting points 
concerning this $60 billion tax evasion, one of which was that the 
bulk of these transactions were linked to the major Canadian banks.
<P>
	We in the official opposition are not surprised by this. We have 
nothing against the big banks, but they must behave like good 
corporate citizens as far as taxes are concerned. For the past two 
and a half years or so now, we have been criticizing the fact that 
Canadian banks have about 46 branches in the Caribbean alone, 
this area being considered the ideal tax haven. Why do they have 
these 43 or 46 Caribbean branches, twice as many as they have 
anywhere else outside of Canada? This is not right.
<P>
	And now we see why. With branches in these countries which are 
considered tax havens, it is easy to take advantage of the weakness 
of the tax agreements signed with those countries and to ensure that 
profits are not taxed at the fair rate they ought to be.
<P>
	As I recall, when the Minister of Finance tabled his budget in 
1995, the one that has given rise to this Bill C-36, he said: ``We 
have taken drastic measures against the major Canadian banks. We 
will be imposing a special tax of $160 million on them''. Do not 
make me laugh. The Minister of Finance should stop trying to be 
funny.
<P>
	This concerns us, because it took two scandals, one involving $2 
billion and another involving $60 in tax evasions, flights of capital 
abroad, for the Minister of Finance to decide finally to give the 
finance committee openly, not behind closed doors, the task of 
reviewing corporate taxation and particularly taxation of capital 
gains.
<P>
	We on the other hand will continue to monitor very closely the 
Minister of Finance's accession to the demand we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have been making since our arrival here. The experts 
who will be working with the finance committee, with the elected 
members on the committee, were appointed by the minister at the 
time of the latest budget. Some of them at least may be clearly in a 
conflict of interest.
<P>
	Some of them work for firms advising major Canadian families, 
Canada's wealthy families, along with large companies on ways to 
take advantage of tax loopholes, on how to make transfers like the 
one we saw involving family trusts, where $2 billion was moved to 
the United States without being taxed, or the $60 billion in tax 
evasions reported by the <I>Toronto Star</I>. My feeling is that the 
official opposition, and all members of this Parliament, will have to 
be extremely vigilant.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, we are not prepared to take any 
chances with the review process; it is far too important to us. The 
well-being of taxpayers in Quebec  and Canada is far too important 
to us to allow the continued protection of tax loopholes that benefit 
large corporations and wealthy Canadian families at the expense of 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	What we intend to do is to scrutinize the taxation system in order 
to be able to oppose arguments of our own-on behalf of the 
official opposition and on behalf of the people of Quebec and 
Canada-to the arguments put forward by these eight experts, a 
number of whom are in conflict of interest.
<P>
	However, there are two positive measures contained in this bill. 
See how seriously we do our job in the opposition. The first one 
deals with business numbers and allows Revenue Canada to 
exchange business name and address information with other 
federal government departments and the provinces. As part of the 
effort to have corporations actually pay their fair share of taxes, I 
think that this measure may prove positive.
<P>
	The second measure deals with interest rates applicable to 
unpaid taxes. It is a good idea to increase the rate of interest on 
taxes payable to encourage speedier payment, but we were hoping 
the government would take our advice. Ever since we were elected 
to the House of Commons, in 1994, we in the official opposition 
have been suggesting that resource levels should be increased at 
Revenue Canada to really go after those whose taxes are unpaid.
<P>
	Since 1994, we have been told over and over again by the 
Minister of Finance that additional resources would be provided 
because, year after year, approximately $6 billion in taxes payable 
to the Canadian government remain unpaid. That is a lot of money. 
For all the conviction shown by the Minister of Finance and the 
many promises made by the various revenue ministers, out of $6.4 
billion in unpaid taxes, $200 million has been recovered on average 
every year for the past two years. That makes no sense.
<P>
	Government must be streamlined. We in the official opposition 
were the first to say that downsizing is required across government. 
But the idea is not to blindly make cuts across the board, 
downsizing to the same extent everywhere. Some departments, 
including Revenue Canada, might benefit from additional 
resources to recover more revenue, to recover more than $200 
million out of $6.4 billion in unpaid taxes. This does not make any 
sense. The money is not in dispute. Taxpayers-most of them rich 
people, since the average amount of taxes owed has increased 
considerably over the last eight years-do not dispute these 
amounts. They know they owe the money to Revenue Canada, but 
the federal government does not invest in the necessary resources 
to go and recover it.
<P>
	It might not be a bad idea to do like the Government of Quebec 
did and to get the additional resources necessary to recover these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3017"> 3017 </A></B>
<P>
unpaid taxes. These initiatives  are about the only two positive 
measures in the 1995 budget that I see in Bill C-36.
<P>
	I can tell you, as we did in 1995 when the Minister of Finance 
brought down his budget, that we will oppose Bill C-36. First, it 
does not go far enough in terms of a true reform of corporate and 
capital gain taxes. Instead, this government condones, through its 
laxness, the loopholes, the tax evasion schemes, and the fact that 
very rich taxpayers or corporations do not pay their fair share to 
Revenue Canada.
<P>
	We will also oppose the bill because, in spite of the two minor 
initiatives to which I referred, most of the measures, particularly 
those that concern family trusts, are just a joke.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The government tells very rich Canadian taxpayers: ``You have 
four years to invest your assets in other financial vehicles that will 
allow you to save taxes''. This is a rather cavalier way of dealing 
with the issue of family trusts, particularly since we learned, from 
the auditor general, that at least two trusts transferred $2 billion to 
the United States without paying any taxes.
<P>
	It shows an obvious lack of determination on the government's 
part to take action to make very rich Canadian families and major 
corporations pay their due to Revenue Canada, as do small 
businesses and individual taxpayers. This situation is totally 
unacceptable. For all these reasons, and for those mentioned before 
question period, I will ask members of the official opposition to 
vote against Bill C-36.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the title 
of Bill C-36 is an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Excise Act, 
the Excise Tax Act, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions Act, the Old Age Security Act and the Canada Shipping 
Act. The title alone shows that this is just another typical case of 
Liberal tinkering. The Liberals are trying to adjust half a dozen 
different acts instead of addressing the real problems which are 
inherent in the tax system itself because of its complexity.
<P>
	This bill in implementing aspects of the budget is finding more 
creative ways of taxing Canadians. The proof of that is in the size 
of the additional tax moneys that will be collected which were 
mentioned by the member from the government. All that additional 
taxes do is increase unemployment.
<P>
	There was a lot of discussion today during question period about 
unemployment and the Prime Minister having said that we are 
going to have to live with high levels of unemployment past the 
turn of the century. The fact is that the Prime Minister and all of his 
employed for life government colleagues have no idea how jobs 
are  actually created. If they did know they would be busy 
creating them.
<P>
	Certainly members have heard me use the example from time to 
time of New Zealand, the country I originally came from. It had to 
face up to the problems of government overspending and debt 
which became unmanageable. The government in New Zealand 
gave up on acts like Bill C-36 because it realized it could not 
squeeze any more money out of the citizens of New Zealand. The 
entire system was overhauled to simplify it, to bring it down to 
much more of a flat style of taxation and to get control of 
government spending to reduce spending and begin paying down 
the debt.
<P>
	As a result for example, just in the last week the New Zealand 
government has introduced a $100 per month tax reduction for the 
average citizen. There is $100 more per month in every New 
Zealand worker's pocket. Imagine what ordinary Canadians could 
do with $100 more in their pockets every month. That is 
significant. That is not tinkering around the edges saying we will 
give Canadians half a per cent here or take half a per cent from over 
there. It is substantial tax reform which truly makes a difference to 
people's lives.
<P>
	New Zealand has not done everything perfectly. I am not saying 
we should mimic everything that New Zealand does. Because I am 
very familiar with it I am using it as an example of ways we could 
learn methods which have worked to help create employment in 
other countries.
<P>
	New Zealand's unemployment rate is below 6 per cent and has 
been for several years now, since about 1993. The economy is very 
buoyant. I have relatives in New Zealand who own companies. 
They have told me that the wage rates in New Zealand are rising 
quite dramatically because the competition among employers to 
get people to work for them is so high. There is so much 
competition in the marketplace that the workers are now starting to 
reap some benefits from it. A lot of the adjustments and other 
things being done in this bill by the government would not be 
necessary if it would only adopt a realistic approach to the idea of 
job creation.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, as part of the election campaign, the Reform Party had a 
document called zero in three, which we used as a campaign 
document. It was delivered all over the country. In it we detailed 
exactly how we would balance the budget in three years and begin 
showing surpluses. The step following that would be to begin 
reducing taxes. That would put more money in the pockets of the 
people. They would spend more, which creates consumption and 
job creation. Those were the steps. We laid them out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3018"> 3018 </A></B>
<P>
	Here we are three years further downstream. If the government 
had adopted our zero in three program the day it came to office, 
today we would be arguing about  what to do with the surpluses 
instead of arguing about which social program should be cut next.
<P>
	It does not take very much common sense for Canadians to look 
at what is happening on that side of the House: erosion of social 
programs. We heard today how the CBC has actually had bigger 
cuts made by the government than were listed in Reform's zero in 
three program. Why would the government, which claimed that it 
supported the CBC, make bigger cuts to the budget of the CBC than 
were in Reform's supposedly slash and burn budget? The reason is 
that it waited too long to address the problems of overspending.
<P>
	Every day that this type of bill comes forward which tinkers 
around with the system instead of truly addressing the problems 
makes it harder and much more difficult to deal with those 
problems. If the Liberals had only got to work the very day they 
took office they would be running surpluses today and we would 
not be discussing how to reduce contributions to RRSPs.
<P>
	What a ridiculous thing to be doing. RRSPs are people's nest 
egg. It is the tool people use to be able to retire so that they are not a 
drain on taxpayers. It is all very well for the finance minister to 
bring in rules that cut RRSP contributions because he will not be 
around when other governments have to deal with the problems.
<P>
	I watched a documentary on television last year where they were 
interviewing finance ministers of the past from this place. Every 
single one of them admitted they knew that all of these problems 
would come to a head some time in the 1990s and they did nothing. 
They knew it would be beyond their mandate. They would not have 
to worry about it.
<P>
	A whole series of decisions were made in this place that have 
critically affected the future of our children and our grandchildren. 
Those former finance ministers did not care about the millstone of 
debt and deficits they were hanging around the necks of our 
children and grandchildren. They went ahead because it suited 
them to be dipping into the trough full of taxpayers' money when 
they should have been truly addressing the problems.
<P>
	I feel embarrassed when I have to go into a high school as I did 
the other day in Bedford, Nova Scotia to talk about the debt. I wrote 
the debt figure on the chalk board, $583 billion. In the one hour that 
I was in the school it went up $2.5 million.
<P>
	We were talking about the debt. I said to these students: ``How 
long do you think it took to build this $583 billion debt?'' The 
answer is that most of it accrued during their lifetimes. In all the 
time that Canada has existed, most of that debt accrued in the last 
20 years.
<P>
	It was accrued by people who have worked in this place and did 
not consider what they were doing to their children and 
grandchildren. This bill, which tinkers with things like retirement 
savings, reduces people's ability to  plan for their futures. At the 
same time, the government sends delegations around the country to 
tell people the bad news about the CPP. Meanwhile the politicians 
in this place protect their gold plated pension plan that would be 
illegal in the private sector which they can collect after six years 
and retire for good.
<P>
	What about the average person out there who relies on CPP that 
is now being eroded because the people who sat in this place in the 
past did not bother to invest the income for the future. What should 
be done as soon as possible, before it is too late and the whole plan 
disintegrates, is to adopt a plan similar to the one that is used in 
Chile. It gives people their own super RRSP style plan. It requires 
compulsory contributions just like the CPP. The employers deduct 
and remit to the individual plans but those plans belong to the 
individual worker. The money does not go into government coffers 
to be handed out to somebody else.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Government of Chile guarantees to those 
people who are in their forties or fifties that there will be a top-up 
from the taxpayer to ensure they will have a minimum pension 
when they retire. For everybody else there are nest eggs building 
which are completely separate from government control to protect 
them when they retire.
<P>
	That system has been in place in Chile for about 12 years. The 
first people collecting pensions doubled what the government is 
providing under the government scheme. It truly works. It takes 
pension planning out of the government sphere.
<P>
	This ridiculous Bill C-36 is eroding people's ability to save for 
their futures. Chile is 10 years ahead of us in innovation and in 
taking care of those problems.
<P>
	Further down on the list the government plays around with 
corporate tax rates. Has it not learned where jobs are created? The 
Prime Minister stands up and says he has given up. He has admitted 
failure in creating jobs. He is just like Kim Campbell because they 
come from the same political school with the same old, tired out, 
30-year-old theories that do not work. They just will not let them 
go. They think the answer to all their problems is more taxes. They 
think that by taxing the corporations they will fix the problem.
<P>
	What about all the jobs that have left Canada because they drove 
corporations out of Canada? What about the 20,000 people who 
work across the border from Vancouver in Bellingham? Every day 
they drive across the border to work at companies because their 
bosses moved the companies out of the Vancouver area into the 
United States to get away from high taxation.
<P>
	This is not the policy of any party. I simply want to use it as an 
example. Just imagine if we had a zero corporate tax rate in 
Canada. Can you imagine the rush of companies from the United 
States that would establish in  Canada? They would come from all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3019"> 3019 </A></B>
<P>
around the world by the thousands. We would have so many jobs, 
jobs, jobs we would not know what to do with them.
<P>
	Obviously somewhere between a zero corporate tax rate and the 
punitive rates we have right now is a better rate that will 
re-establish those good jobs for Canadians. Bills such as this 
increase the irritation to business with higher taxes that reduce and 
kill jobs.
<P>
	I am from the small business sector in the Vancouver area. I 
owned a company that had 10 employees. I sold that company 
shortly before becoming an MP. Because I am from the small 
business sector I have many friends in that sector. I cannot tell hon. 
members how many of them have scaled down and moved back 
into their homes to operate mom and pop type operations in order 
to get away from taxation and all of the various levies and fees that 
they had to pay when they had employees. When they had 
employees they had to pay the Workers' Compensation Board, CPP 
and UI premiums. They had to remit income taxes. They had to pay 
all the benefits which are legislated. It gets to the point where 30 
per cent or 40 per cent of all the cheques which a small business 
person writes go to various levels of government.
<P>
	Gas taxes affect business. There was a great foo-fa-raw a week 
or two ago about the price of gasoline across the country. A simple 
bit of analysis shows that about 55 per cent of the cost is taxation. If 
governments were not dipping their hands into everyone's gas tank 
the price of gasoline would be about 26 cents a litre. It is 
government greed at every level that has created the problem. Bill 
C-36 is just another case of that.
<P>
	The Liberals claimed during the 1993 election that their $6 
billion infrastructure project would kick start the economy and 
create a job bonanza. The theory was that the people employed by 
this wonderful $6 billion program, although it turned out to be a big 
boondoggle, would spend the money in their communities, boost 
consumption and then the good old days of full employment would 
come back.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	However, anyone with business knowledge knew the plan could 
not work from day one. Why could it not work? It would not work 
because it did not create long term, meaningful jobs. It bought jobs 
using taxpayer and borrowed money, money that was borrowed 
against the future of our children and our grandchildren. It was 
money that we did not have to spend.
<P>
	For at least two decades these old line governments have been 
throwing money into ineffective job creation plans, grants to 
special interest groups, regional development funds and 
government funded training programs without showing the 
slightest concern for the debt legacy and the crippling tax load that 
it has left for our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	If governments could create jobs through deficit spending and 
tax bills like Bill C-36, everyone would have three jobs each by 
now. Twenty-five years of $30 billion deficits and a $583 billion 
debt and what there is to show for it is chronic unemployment and 
terrible fiscal problems. Social programs are being cut and the 
government is scrambling to tax away every little last cent that it 
can get from taxpayers' pockets.
<P>
	I had a call from a constituent last week who runs a yacht 
brokerage in my riding. He sells yachts. There has just been a 
change to the GST rules. Now he has to charge GST when he sells a 
second hand yacht. As he says, that is going to put his business out 
of business overnight. Why would people pay an extra 7 per cent to 
have a broker sell a yacht? It comes straight off the sales price for 
the person who is selling a yacht. They are now going to try to sell 
privately instead of putting it through a broker.
<P>
	The government, in its enthusiasm to try to get that extra bit of 
tax out of yacht brokers, is actually going to put them out of 
business. This is so stupid. That same new tax rule is going to apply 
to auctioneers. Can anyone believe this? We will go to an auction to 
buy a used table and GST will be charged. It is just government 
greed. It has nothing to do with good management of the economy. 
It is typical of the type of thing this bill represents.
<P>
	If the government truly wanted to make amends and get this 
country back on track it would not be passing things like Bill C-36. 
It would be creating meaningful, long term jobs if it could create a 
climate for job creation.
<P>
	Every time the unemployment rate goes down the government 
likes to take credit for all the jobs that have been created. However, 
when unemployment rises it does not want anything to do with it. It 
says it is the global economy or somebody else made the wrong 
decision. It never wants to take credit for rising unemployment.
<P>
	The fact is that the government neither creates jobs nor loses 
jobs but is responsible for the business environment that results in 
job creation or job loss. Therefore, governments should really 
concentrate on the business environment. Unfortunately reversing 
the effects of two decades of government meddling in the economy 
is not without its pain, as those who have ever watched the New 
Zealand situation would know.
<P>
	About three or four years ago, Eric Malling, on the TV program 
``W5'' did a program on New Zealand showing the sort of fiscal 
restraints that New Zealand was going through at the time as it 
adjusted to becoming a free market economy. When I left New 
Zealand in 1979 it was a socialist country. It was cradle to grave 
socialism. The government paid for everything.
<P>
	By 1984 New Zealand had pretty well gone bankrupt. By 1993 
adjustments had been made and New Zealand was on its way back 
to prosperity. Maybe members of this  House saw the program on 
television last week where Eric Malling on his program ``Maver-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3020"> 3020 </A></B>
<P>
icks'' updated the New Zealand situation and showed how private 
enterprise has created so many jobs and how buoyant the economy 
is there.
<P>
	I actually visited New Zealand at Easter. I can confirm what Eric 
Malling showed on that program. The country is buoyant. One can 
feel how successful the country has become, and it has not done it 
with government subsidies, with extra taxes like this. It has not 
done it by suppressing the right to invest in RRSPs. It did it by the 
government getting out of the economy and letting business create 
the jobs. It created jobs by getting rid of marketing boards so that 
entrepreneurial farmers could sell new products.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	For example, I went into a supermarket and there on the shelves 
were flavoured whipping creams. There was brandy flavoured 
whipping cream, Kahlua flavoured whipping cream for special 
occasions. There were specialty cheeses made by little cottage 
industries which operated a tiny cheese making facility that 
perhaps only made spreadable pepper cheese and sold it to a world 
market.
<P>
	In the supermarket there were eggs from farm operations which 
specialized in low cholesterol eggs for which they charged 
premium prices. They were almost three times the price of regular 
eggs. There were eggs from guaranteed free range hens which were 
allowed to wander the fields. They cost two and a half times the 
price of eggs produced under the old marketing board battery hen 
type operations.
<P>
	These are examples of government getting out of the meddling 
aspect of the economy and creating the environment for job 
creation. It is not necessary to pass more bills to grab more taxes.
<P>
	The net result in New Zealand was that so much income came 
from all the prosperity, the government has been running surpluses 
in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion a year, paying down the debt. 
That was responsible for the latest announcement of $100 more in 
the pocket of every working New Zealander's pocket every month, 
the result of a reduction in income taxes.
<P>
	Imagine if we were able to announce in the last budget in the 
House that there was a $100 tax reduction for every Canadian 
worker. We could have done it if we had adopted Reform's zero in 
three program the day we came to the House. The answer to job 
creation and getting around these tax problems is to adopt a 
proactive program of creating the environment for job creation.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Capilano-Howe Sound, 
introduced a private member's bill on March 4, the taxpayer 
protection act. The bill would have required it to be compulsory for 
the government to live within its income and not run deficits and 
that there would be  penalties for politicians if they overspent. They 
would actually lose pay.
<P>
	At least one province has already introduced such legislation. 
The provinces are way ahead of us on this. They realize they cannot 
keep grabbing taxes the way Bill C-36 does. Before question period 
I was updating the House on the B.C. Liberal Party which is 
presently involved in an election. The provincial wing of the 
Liberal Party has promised a taxpayer protection act that would 
guarantee a balanced budget in two years and, if it does not make it, 
pay reductions for the politicians.
<P>
	Look how out of touch the other side of the House is with the real 
world, people saying they have had enough. They do not want to 
pay any more taxes. They are sick of the government overspending. 
It is about time government got on top of the problem and do what 
the people want instead of following its own ideology constantly.
<P>
	I hope that when there is an opportunity to debate a little more on 
my colleague's taxpayer protection act members will seriously 
consider supporting it and get us out of this cycle of tax and spend 
that has been going on for so long.
<P>
	In my opinion the bill we are spending time on today would not 
have been necessary if it had not been for the irresponsibility not 
only of current members on the other side of the House but also of 
the parliamentarians who sat here for the last 25 years spending 
$30 billion more a year than they took in. They just did not care. 
They knew they would not be accountable for the end results. They 
were answering the short term demands of special interest groups 
at the expense of the next generation. It has been the most massive 
intergenerational transfer of wealth in the history of this country. It 
has to stop and the first step along that pathway is to defeat this bill.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with my colleague from Algoma.
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party who made some negative 
remarks about the government's $6 billion infrastructure program 
forgets the almost 100,000 jobs that were created. He forgets the 
large majority of municipal officials throughout Canada would 
love to have that program continue. He forgets business people who 
are aware of it would also like to have it continue.
<P>
	I find it rather strange that all of these people want it and the 
Reform Party does not. It says something about being out of touch. 
If one wants to talk about being out of touch, I assure the House it is 
not this government. Reform has not been popular. It was not 
popular at election time and has been even less popular since then. 
It has been dismembering itself member by member.

<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on 
Bill C-36, the income tax amendment act. I assure the House it 
is not tinkering. As the House is aware, these amendments 
implement certain measures announced in the budgets of February 
27, 1995 and March 6, 1996 as well as Income Tax Act and Excise 
Tax Act amendments released on August 9, 1995 concerning the 
government's business under a number of programs.
<P>
	The bill is very technical in nature and since there are those 
better qualified to address the technical aspects I take this 
opportunity to summarize points addressed by the bill. It talks 
about retirement savings. It reduces the limits on contributions to 
registered retirement savings plans, registered pension plans and 
deferred profit sharing plans and it reduces the allowance for RRSP 
over contributions.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	On fiscal periods, it eliminates the opportunity to defer the 
taxation of business income by selecting an off-calendar fiscal 
period.

	On family trusts, the bill eliminates the election to defer the 
21-year deemed realization rule and the rules allowing the 
allocation of income to preferred beneficiaries.

<P>
	On corporate tax rates, the bill increases the refundable tax on 
investment income of Canadian controlled private corporations. It 
increases the rate of part IV tax on dividends received by private 
corporations and increases the capital taxes on large corporations 
and financial institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	On business numbers, the bill allows Revenue Canada to 
exchange business name and address information with other

	Interest rates provide for different rates of interest on amounts

had read that bill one would know it is not tinkering. It is dealing 
with affairs of the state in a substantial, meaningful and profound 
way.
<P>
	More specifically, I would like to discuss the changes to taxation 
of family trusts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Family trusts allow assets to be held for beneficiaries. Trusts are 
used for various purposes, particularly for business succession 
planning and for meeting the needs of beneficiaries in special cases 
such as old age and disabilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 1995 budget proposed two changes to the taxation of family 
trusts: one, the existing election to defer the application of the 
21-year rule eliminated effective January 1, 1999; two, to restrict 
income splitting, the preferred beneficiary election mechanism be 
repealed for taxation years of trusts that commence after 1995, 
except for elections with respect to persons with mental or physical 
disabilities.
<P>
	On the 21-year deemed disposition rule, the existing provision 
relating to the taxation of trust generally require that assets are to 
be treated for tax purposes as if they were disposed of every 21 
years. The measure accompanied the introduction of capital gains 
taxation in 1972 to prevent trusts from being used to void the 
taxation of capital gains on death.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The previous government passed a provision allowing a special 
election to defer the 21 year rule and the taxation of capital gains 
on trust assets until the last ``exempt beneficiary'' dies. An 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3022"> 3022 </A></B>
<P>
``exempt beneficiary'' essentially means a relative who is removed 
by no more  than one generation from the person who established 
the trust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Effective January 1, 1999 the bill proposes to eliminate this 
special election. Those trusts which have at any time before that 
date elected to postpone capital gains taxation will be subject to a 
deemed realization of trust assets at fair market value on that date. 
This would not apply where all of the trust property has been 
distributed to beneficiaries before that date. Where properties are 
distributed from a trust to an exempt beneficiary, capital gains 
would be realized when the exempt beneficiary disposes of the 
property or when the exempt beneficiary dies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On preferred beneficiary election, the bill provides that, before it 
is distributed among the beneficiaries, the income from a trust fund 
is calculated in the same way as for other taxpayers. The interest, 
dividends and capital gains realizable are all included in the 
calculation of the income from the trust. The taxable income of a 
testamentary trust, and of some trusts created before 1972, is 
subject to the same progressive tax rate structure as individual 
income. The taxable income of other trusts is taxed at the 
maximum rate applicable to individual income.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The preferred beneficiary election currently allows trust income 
to be allocated to preferred beneficiaries defined to include the 
spouse, children and grandchildren of the settlor of the trust and 
taxed in their hands rather than at the trust level. This allows trust 
income to accumulate without the need to pay the income to 
beneficiaries. There is no requirement that the income allocated to 
a beneficiary ultimately be paid to that beneficiary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The selection made by a preferred beneficiary is an exception to 
the general rule that the income from a trust is taxable as a trustee's 
income, except where this income is payable to the beneficiaries 
and thus taxable as their personal income.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The flexibility of the preferred beneficiary election and the 
potential to split income among large numbers of preferred 
beneficiaries make it a significant tax planning tool. The preferred 
beneficiary election allows trust income to be split among family 
members for income tax purposes without regard to the amount the 
beneficiary would ultimately receive.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	For example, where trust income in the form of dividends is 
allocated to a beneficiary such as a young  child with little or no 
other income, substantial amounts can be accumulated on a tax free 
basis because of the dividend tax credit. In addition, the entitlement 
to the $500,000 lifetime capital gains exemption can be multiplied 
because of the preferred beneficiary election.
<P>
	This bill proposes to eliminate the preferred beneficiary election 
except as it applies to those beneficiaries who are entitled to a tax 
credit for mental or physical impairment, or who would be so 
entitled if amounts paid for the remuneration of an attendant or for 
care in a nursing home were ignored. The measure eliminates a tax 
planning technique and seeks to ensure a level playing field 
between property held in trust and property held directly. This 
measure is to apply to taxation years of trusts that commence after 
1995.
<P>
	The recent auditor general's report cited examples of tax 
avoidance and raised concerns about the administration of the 
Income Tax Act involving the movement out of Canada of assets 
held in family trusts. The department is undertaking certain 
specific initiatives to combat and deter avoidance. The finance 
committee is about to begin a study of the administration of the 
Income Tax Act in this regard.
<P>
	Changes such as those made in the 1995 budget discussed earlier 
and including terminating the election to postpone capital gains 
taxation under the 21-year rule will ensure that family trusts cannot 
be used to defer capital gains taxation and ending the preferred 
beneficiary election limits the opportunity for family trusts to be 
used for income tax splitting purposes. The changes will help to 
further close the loopholes.
<P>
	Bill C-36 is an important part of this government's fiscal agenda. 
As my hon. colleague noted earlier, it is the heart and soul of our 
program. It is another step toward our goal of getting government 
right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of interest to the comments of the hon. 
member for St. Boniface.
<P>
	He spoke at some length about family trusts. If there is a 
misconception in this country in terms of what is really taking 
place with family trusts it seems to be one of those things that 
seems to abound at least at election time if not at other times.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could assure Canadians that progress 
has been made, if indeed there has been progress made on this issue 
in ensuring that the abuse of family trusts is no longer ongoing or at 
least if it has been that things have been done to correct the 
inefficiencies in the system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's question is an 
appropriate and important one.
<P>
	It was roughly a year ago that the Minister of Finance indicated 
we needed to review this whole area and to close some of the 
loopholes. Decisions have been made to  do exactly that. As a result 
of a recent event where large sums of money were taken out of the 
country without, according to some individuals, appropriate levels 
of taxation or no taxation, there will be continued work done in that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3023"> 3023 </A></B>
<P>
area. Further loopholes will be closed. In fact this mandate has 
been given to the finance committee of which I am a member.
<P>
	I agree that the matter often comes up at election time. I 
emphasize it is something that is not always well understood. I am 
told by very highly respected people that they can have some 
benefits but clearly they should not give advantages to people who 
have large sums of money to escape a fair rate of taxation. They too 
must contribute to the well-being of this nation.
<P>
	Our objective at the end of this exercise is to make sure that all 
people who earn income are taxed in a fair and equitable way and 
that they make legitimate, reasonable, sensible and meaningful 
contributions to the welfare of this nation and to its people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join my hon. colleagues, in particular the member for St. 
Boniface, a colleague of mine on the finance committee, in 
discussing and debating Bill C-36 which implements the 1995 
budget measures.
<P>
	The details of this legislation should not be overlooked but the 
big picture is also very important. In that regard I draw to the 
attention of the House an article in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I>. The 
headline is: ``Bond buyers give Canada new respect''. Let me cite 
the opening paragraphs:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Something remarkable has happened in the Canadian bond market in recent 
weeks-and Canada's finance ministers can take most of the credit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When interest rates on U.S. bonds charged upwards, Canadian rates followed, 
but at a lesser clip. When U.S. rates levelled off two weeks ago, Canadian rates 
fell sharply.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The result? The spread between Canadian and U.S. rates-a key measure of 
how the world's investors feel about Canada-has plummeted, indicating that 
bond buyers believe Canada is a lovely spot to put their money these days.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	There is another paragraph I wish to set on the record:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bond buyers who shunned Canada as a high debt, high deficit, fiscally 
irresponsible country for most of the 1990s have done an about-face. And it 
takes only a quick look at what Canada's federal and provincial finance 
ministers have done to understand why.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article makes clear that fiscal restraint has become an 
embedded aspect of the Canadian political landscape. It is this 
government and this government's finance minister who have 
played a key role in this transformation. The legislation before us 
helps demonstrate a central aspect of that national sea change. It 
does so in a most interesting way, not only by what is in the 
legislation, but by what is not.
<P>
	It will be noted that the 1995 budget did not include any 
increases in personal income tax rates, nor did the 1994 budget 
before it. That was again the case in the 1996 budget which 
contained no tax increases of any kind.
<P>
	The point here is that deficit reduction and debt control are made 
in government problems and it is government that must be the 
source of the solution. I am convinced that in the years to come 
Canadians will look back at the 1995 budget, the source of Bill 
C-36, as the turning point in our fiscal history.
<P>
	The actions that budget introduced totalled $29 billion over three 
years, more than in any budget since post-war demobilization. It 
set a course so that by the end of the current fiscal year, program 
spending will be $10.4 billion lower than when we started.
<P>
	Just as important, this budget also changed the very structure of 
how government operates. Through focusing on structural change, 
not tax and revenue measures, this government made sure that 
spending will be restrained beyond the two-year target period. The 
deficit will continue to fall, reflecting our commitment to 
eliminating it completely.
<P>
	To achieve these results, the 1995 budget took fundamental 
action across government programs and operations. It implemented 
the results of program review, a comprehensive examination of 
departmental spending. The budget also acted on a new vision of 
the federal government's role in the economy, one that includes 
substantial reductions in business subsidies. Subsidies will drop 
from $3.8 billion to $1.5 billion per year by 1997-98. The 1995 
budget reformed major transfers to the provinces, modernizing the 
federal-provincial fiscal regime, making it more effective, flexible 
and affordable.
<P>
	Today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> article shows that the commitments we 
have made and the fiscal actions we have taken are being 
recognized in real bottom line terms. They have brought lower 
interest rates and greater confidence in Canada. That is being 
translated into growing employment.
<P>
	The inflation rate remains at a very nice low level in Canada. 
What has added resonance to our commitments, what has helped 
win over the world markets is the way we have approached our 
fiscal dilemma. Our action has been dramatically weighted toward 
the spending side, not added to the high tax burden of Canadians. 
That is why the 1995 budget did not increase personal income tax 
rates. However, it did propose measures to improve tax system 
fairness, many of which we see in Bill C-36 today.
<P>
	The budget proposed eliminating the deferral of taxes on the 
investment income earned by private holding companies. We are 
also eliminating tax advantages for family trusts. We are 
temporarily reducing the upper limit on RRSP contributions to 
$13,500 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3024"> 3024 </A></B>
<P>
per year so that  extra benefits do not go to people who earn more 
than two and one-half times the average wage in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Even with these measures we would fall short of our deficit 
targets. That is why the 1995 budget moved to increase the large 
corporations tax and the corporate surtax. The budget also 
introduced a temporary tax on the capital of large deposit taking 
corporations, including banks.
<P>
	Clearly, the 1995 budget was still a budget that placed an 
absolute priority on expenditure reduction. It delivered nearly $7 in 
spending cuts for each dollar of new tax revenue.
<P>
	Again let me underscore our fiscal philosophy and the 
philosophy that guides our tax measures, such as those found in 
Bill C-36. We are tackling Canada's fiscal problem not as a narrow 
goal in and of itself, but rather because it is a fundamental 
component for national growth, new jobs, economic security and 
sovereignty. As the Globe and Mail article highlights, our fiscal 
progress and other actions are paying off. Canada's economic 
fundamentals are strong.
<P>
	With our first two budgets we established rock hard foundations. 
With these measures our 1995-96 and 1996-97 deficit targets which 
will bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP are secure.
<P>
	The steps in this year's budget consolidate and extend our first 
two budgets and further contribute to our economic and financial 
objectives. We have maintained our focus on reducing program 
spending. Because the debt is a problem created by government, 
the solution should focus on cutting in our own backyard. The 
government has shown great leadership in handling public service 
cuts. That is why of the cumulative fiscal actions we will have 
taken from 1994-95 to 1998-99, a full 87 per cent have been 
expenditure savings, not tax measures.
<P>
	Together the three budgets will contribute $26.1 billion in 
savings by 1997-98. This action, together with the reform of the 
employment insurance program, will ensure that we hit our new 
deficit target of 2 per cent of GDP by 1997-98. Our combined 
budget plans will deliver a further $28.9 billion in savings in fiscal 
year 1998-99. This means the deficit will continue to drop and the 
debt to GDP ratio will continue to fall.
<P>
	I have had numerous town hall meetings in my riding of Algoma 
over the last number of weeks and I plan to hold several more. I 
have already had meetings in towns like Espanola, Thessalon, 
Hilton Beach, Little Current and Gore Bay. I plan to hold others in 
Elliot Lake and Goulais River.
<P>
	When people attend the meetings, while they have concerns 
about one issue or another as is appropriate in this day when 
governments are under close scrutiny, they also express confidence 
in the way in which the country's fiscal affairs are being managed 
by the government. There is evidence of it every day. The Canadian 
dollar is remaining stable relative to the U.S. dollar. Interest rates 
are remaining at a very credible level. Inflation is well in hand. The 
economy is producing jobs.
<P>
	We all agree that when unemployment reaches 9.5 per cent it is 
too high. However, our economy is producing jobs. In the months 
and years ahead we will see the unemployment rate decrease by 
many more percentage points because the fundamentals are very 
strong.
<P>
	Bill C-36 expresses the philosophy of the government. It focuses 
on the credibility this government has been able to achieve 
compared to the past government. This legislation will help to 
sustain the successes we have experienced. It will only add to our 
credibility. It will add to the confidence investors have in our 
country, both domestically and abroad. It will improve the equity 
of our tax system and ensure that affluent Canadians and 
corporations do not escape paying their fair share of the Canadian 
tax burden.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	For these reasons, I hope we have the co-operation of the 
majority of members in the House in supporting Bill C-36. The 
government is securing the financial future of the country. We are 
trying to get government right and in so doing we are preserving 
the social programs that are a hallmark of our society. These are 
social programs that Canadians have come to count on, health care, 
social services and pension plans. These are elements of our 
society which make us very special and unique.
<P>
	Those of my colleagues who have had a chance to do any 
travelling outside this country will know we look quite wonderful 
from outside. Sometimes we tend to take it for granted what we 
have here. However, we are the envy of the world. As the Prime 
Minister has often reminded us, the UN has for a number of years 
in a row declared Canada to be the number one nation in the world 
in which to live. We know that in our hearts but we forget it 
sometimes.
<P>
	I urge members to look carefully at how much we have and at 
what the government is doing to make the country an even better 
place not only for our children but for our grandchildren.
<P>
	With that I call on the House, in a majority way, to place its trust 
again in the government.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased today to speak to Bill C-36, a sort of 
omnibus bill amending several aspects of the Income Tax Act, the 
Excise Act and various similar pieces of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3025"> 3025 </A></B>
<P>
	What particularly attracts my attention, and what I would like 
to address in my speech, is the whole question of measures related 
to family trusts. I think it is very important that the public be very 
well informed of where things stand on this issue. I would like 
to give a brief run through of the background. In the 1993 election 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois raised many questions about the 
amounts of money held in these family trusts. At the time, the 
deficit was growing, as it continues to do, and we were also 
wondering how we could ensure that we really received all the 
tax revenues that we thought appropriate.
<P>
	Thanks to information it had gleaned from one source and 
another, the Bloc Quebecois knew that family trusts could contain 
money that the government was missing. Following the election, 
we kept telling the government: ``Before pronouncing on the 
effectiveness of family trusts, let us at least find out the amounts of 
money involved, what information we could obtain''.
<P>
	As a young newly elected MP, I came here in all good faith, 
thinking that, during our work in committee, we could actually 
examine the figures, see what was possible and take appropriate 
action accordingly.
<P>
	But that was my first disappointment with the work of an MP, 
because examining these matters in committee brought us up 
against a wall of indifference, and even a wall of missing 
information from senior public servants. Time after time, they told 
us: ``The figures are not available. That would require giving 
personal information. Most trusts involve families in which there is 
a mentally or physically disabled person who cannot look after his 
own needs. That is how it operates, so there is no reason to go 
poking about in it''.
<P>
	But our representations did get the government to decide to 
make some modifications. For example, allowing families to free 
up the assets they held in family trusts until 1999. We are, of 
course, against that measure. It is like finding a burglar in your 
house and telling him: ``You have an hour and half and then I am 
going to start running after you''. He would have time to empty the 
house before you would have been able to find out just what he had 
taken.
<P>
	There have been examples of this situation in recent weeks, 
reference to trusts containing more than $2 billion which have been 
able to send their assets, their investments, out of the country 
without having to pay any tax on them.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	This is a really negative side of the government's action. The 
fact of voluntarily acting slower than it should have a year or two 
ago leads to situations like this. At a time when we need all the tax 
revenues we can get, the message sent to workers in particular, low 
or middle income earners, is that there are 500 rich families, from 
what it says there, that may have family trusts.
<P>
	There is talk of a tax shortfall of possibly $400 million. Four 
hundred million dollars will not settle Canada's deficit problems, 
but at least in terms of tax equity, Canadians and Quebecers will get 
the message that the government is going after the rich as much as 
it is going after the poor.
<P>
	When unemployment insurance reforms like we have seen 
recently occur in the same days and weeks as we learn that some $2 
billion invested in family trusts has left Canada without being duly 
taxed, people consider this situation clearly unacceptable.
<P>
	Finally, we consider what is in Bill C-36 to be too little, too late. 
It is too little, because the people who have invested in family 
trusts will have had all the time they need to diversify their assets 
and transfer them to other tax evasion possibilities. The Canadian 
government thus does not collect as much tax as it could have. It is 
too little and too late because of the time allowed for recovery.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the recommendations made 
by the Bloc Quebecois in December 1994, about one year after the 
election, as part of a committee study. If these recommendations 
had been carried out at the time, we would not have to deal with 
trusts taking their assets out of the country and trying to find legal 
ways to evade as much tax as possible; whether these tactics are 
legitimate is a different matter, but they are still legal according to 
the legislation put forward by the government.
<P>
	The first recommendation made by the Bloc Quebecois is that 
investigations be carried out to determine the exact value of assets 
managed by family trusts, the value of capital gains from assets 
under family trust management, the value of tax revenues whose 
collection was postponed by deferring capital gains taxes until the 
last trust beneficiary dies.
<P>
	These studies could give us actual figures on the impact of the 
legislative measures taken with respect to family trusts. We must 
recall that family trusts were instituted in 1972 to help families 
facing special and rather unusual circumstances, such as caring for 
a child with a handicap, or even small business by allowing them to 
tax-shelter certain assets. But like in many other such instances, 
this measure is benefiting those who can afford the services of tax 
specialists who found in this measure a tax loophole for avoiding to 
pay taxes.
<P>
	Since then, amendments made to the legislation have actually 
made the family trust loophole wider. Now, efforts are made to try 
to plug the hole, but the measures contained in Bill C-36 certainly 
do not ensure tax equity for families in these circumstances.
<P>
	I would also like to remind you of another recommendation 
making it mandatory to pay taxes on capital gains on a trust paid 
out in favour of the beneficiary. This issue has been close to our 
hearts from  day one, as it reflects the whole battle going on in 
Quebec and Canada around the share of tax revenue that every 
segment of society must pay to restore Canada's economy to 
health. This issue has become a symbol; it is an issue where, as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3026"> 3026 </A></B>
<P>
result of yesterday's measures and carelessness, we find ourselves 
today having to do without desperately needed resources.
<P>
	On the one hand, they claim that the unemployment insurance 
reform will save $2 billion through cuts to unemployment 
insurance recipients and those who make contributions to the 
unemployment insurance plan, employees and employers alike, but 
on the other hand, they are leaving the door open for those who 
should be paying up to $400 million in taxes.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Imagine how much less pressure there would be on the 
unemployment insurance system if the government's financial 
statements showed additional revenues of $400 million from 
family trusts. This would have taken pressure off of the 
unemployment insurance reform. This is significant when we are 
talking about fiscal balance. Sometimes, in debates like this one, 
we hear that the opposition is there to criticize, to find flaws in the 
legislation.
<P>
	In this case, opposition parties are not the only ones making 
recommendations. The Auditor General of Canada also raised the 
issue of family trusts and asked the government to ensure that all 
the information be available, so that future legislative measures 
allow Revenue Canada to recover all the amounts that can be 
recovered. The auditor general is only fulfilling his mandate, which 
is to ensure that the amounts owed are collected and that the 
moneys are spent in the best possible way to meet the objectives 
set.
<P>
	For a long time now family trusts have been used for purposes 
other than to help small and medium size businesses. It is said that 
someone with an annual income of $100,000 or $150,000 is 
unlikely to have any use for a family trust. Who benefits from 
family trusts? It is people whose income is very high. It is a fact 
that these trusts benefit the very rich and that they deprive the 
government of considerable revenues.
<P>
	Family trusts are not the cure-all. Canada's fiscal problems 
would not all be solved if trusts paid their fair share of taxes. 
However, it would allow the government to tell taxpayers: ``We 
made high income people pay their fair share. We asked them to 
contribute and we made sure they all did. We did not provide them 
with any means to avoid paying taxes. We kept a close watch on 
them. Now, we are asking you to also do your share''.
<P>
	That would make all the difference in the world in the situation 
we are facing now, where those receiving unemployment 
insurance, those with low incomes, are being asked to pay $100, 
$150 or $200 in additional taxes on incomes of $20,000, $25,000 or 
$30,000. In  family trusts, we are talking about millions of dollars, 
$400 million in unpaid taxes.
<P>
	That would be seen as a gesture of fairness on the part of the 
government, a gesture not found in Bill C-36. This bill does not 
contain measures that would have made it possible to truly stem the 
flow. The government tells us that it is washing its hands of 
decisions concerning family trusts and capital shifted to the United 
States when the Conservatives were in power, that it is not 
responsible for what went on then.
<P>
	But now, with the deadlines given, with the provisions in Bill 
C-36, with the fact that people will have until 1999 to transfer their 
money into other sectors, is the government not shirking its 
responsibility? It cannot blame the Conservative government for 
not doing its work. Now it is the Liberals who have decided to let 
matters take their own course and to allow people to continue to 
avoid paying taxes that they should be paying.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves why they are doing this. Why, in these 
times when we are so in need of money, are they closing their eyes, 
not listening to reason and allowing wealthy families to continue 
not paying their taxes?
<P>
	I think that one thing that needs to be looked at very closely is 
the question of party funding. Would there not be a link to be 
made-indeed, almost a bank reconciliation-between the 
contributions from these important families to parties which will 
accept money from anyone, whether a physical entity or a 
corporate entity?
<P>
	In Quebec, for some years, nearly 20 in fact, only physical 
entities can donate to political parties. This has led to a complete 
change in political mores. The federal government has not yet 
reached this stage. Significant sums, $50,000 or $100,000, can still 
be received from companies, unions or other organizations.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	You can well imagine, afterward, when the government is being 
lobbied, that the company or family which donated $50,000 or 
$100,000 to the coffers of the party in power is certainly going to 
be listened to because of that contribution.
<P>
	All of the key points in this current situation are in place: a tax 
system that has not been revised, a government that is very timid 
about tax review. It talks about a technical committee. It is because 
the opposition has repeated the same arguments and attacks almost 
ad nauseam that it has managed to get some small changes of the 
type found in Bill C-36, to at least close the loophole in the medium 
term. But the government's measures are very timid, too timid, and 
do not make the restrictions that ought to have been on the family 
trusts.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that the present government does not 
appear to be aware of the urgency of acting in  this area. First of all, 
we have been aware for two years of the necessity of having all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3027"> 3027 </A></B>
<P>
available information on family trusts. We have asked for it 
repeatedly in committee, and senior officials have told us it was not 
available, often in a rather condescending way. Today we find out 
the reason for that reaction. It is because the transactions have 
already been made and some are perhaps being made so that certain 
taxpayers will avoid paying tax and, moreover, will take their 
investments abroad.
<P>
	I think this is unacceptable even to federalist Canadians. So the 
government should have moved, legislated quickly on this. Today, 
moreover, it must turn off the taps in a hurry, because it is clear that 
there are many things that even Bill C-36 will not correct. There is 
no way with this bill to ensure that each of the great families pays 
the taxes it ought with respect to the funds it invests in family 
trusts.
<P>
	This is an important point. There is nothing in this bill to force 
the legislator to act. This is why the Bloc Quebecois will vote 
against the bill. So long as we obtain no assurance that family trusts 
will no longer be a way to avoid paying taxes for people with the 
means to do so, we will continue to press for satisfactory 
amendments from the government. On this point, I hope the 
Standing Committee on Finance will act quickly, now that we have 
proof money is flowing out of Canada and being invested abroad 
without taxes being paid on it.
<P>
	I think that the government should follow the auditor general's 
recommendations as quickly as possible and take appropriate 
action so that, in the next federal budget, the revenue side of the 
sheet will show the amounts that belong there, including taxes 
payable by wealthy families and by those who invest in family 
trusts, so that they pull their weight, and we do not see inadequate 
cuts that crack down harder in the wrong places, for example, 
through very stringent unemployment insurance legislation, on the 
one hand, and a laissez faire approach on the other.
<P>
	This sort of situation must be corrected. I hope that, after hearing 
our arguments, the government will take corrective action and 
bring in tougher legislation, so that people can no longer evade 
taxes that they should be paying.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (for Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-4, an act to amend the Standards Council of Canada Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I was asked to participate in this debate 
about Bill C-4, an act to amend the Standards Council of Canada 
Act, I had to ask what stake my constituents would have in this 
legislation and its implementation.
<P>
	This got me thinking about the role of standards in society and 
how they touch the day to day lives of Canadians. Clearly these 
legislative changes are meaningful to Canadian businesses and 
business because standards have an impact on business practices 
and Canada's capacity to compete in the international marketplace.
<P>
	Standards also matter to Canadians because they contribute to 
consumer safety and health and to the utility of everyday products, 
be they industrial, domestic or recreational. Therefore today I 
direct my comments to the people side of the standards story.
<P>
	In Canada standards setting is based largely on voluntary 
consultation and consensus among a wide group of public and 
private sector stakeholders. Individual citizens and volunteers from 
industry and special interest groups routinely sit on panels and  
committees that develop national standards. A variety of standards 
development organizations accredited by the Standards Council of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3028"> 3028 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, the SCC, bring these groupings of people together to set 
standards affecting every sector in our society.
<P>
	The SCC oversees the five key standards development 
organizations active in Canada and estimates that a further 14,000 
people are involved in some capacity with establishing and 
maintaining standards in Canada. Together these experts and 
concerned consumers establish standards for everything from 
health care products to emergency planning.
<P>
	Their deliberations and decisions set guidelines and standards 
for environmental management practices, the manufacturing and 
marketing of consumer products and electrical devices, 
occupational health and safety, building codes and quality 
assurance procedures. Standards which flow from a voluntary 
consensus based system like the one we have nurtured in Canada 
have the capacity to track the dramatic changes introduced by 
technological innovation.
<P>
	This consultative approach also takes place at the international 
level, and often standards developed here in Canada lead the way 
and become universally accepted.
<P>
	The federal government embarked on an extensive consultative 
exercise to examine standards and their growing importance for 
Canadian consumers and business. That consultation revealed 
significant interest in standards in Canada and support for an 
enhanced role for the SCC. Most stakeholders favoured a broader 
SCC mandate to include economic and environmental management 
issues while maintaining the core mandate which already included 
consumer protection. People told the SCC they were looking for 
leadership, effective management, accessibility and constructive 
Canadian action on the international stage. The bill we have before 
us today reflects those public wishes.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The bill also builds on our national record of achievement in 
creating responsive, consumer driven standards. Without the work 
of standards development organizations in Canada and their many 
volunteers and technical committees we would not be so sure about 
the safety of the light switches in our homes, that propane tank 
under the barbeque and our child's bright yellow bicycle helmet.
<P>
	The Canadian Standards Association, the CSA, one of the 
agencies accredited by the SCC to develop Canadian standards, is 
possibly the standard organization Canadians are most aware of, 
although several other key standards development organizations 
are also at work in Canada.
<P>
	For over 75 years in Canada the CSA has ensured that a plethora 
of electrical devices, chemical products and manufacturing 
processes meet stringent national safety  codes. Of the nearly 1,500 
standards the CSA has on its books, about one third have been 
incorporated into government regulation, and that trend continues.
<P>
	On the high tech side Canada is playing a leadership role in 
co-ordinating the vast network of computer systems that span the 
world. As Canada builds its own information highway, committees 
are at work to match our infrastructure with others in the world. 
One initiative called open systems interconnection, OSI, involves 
the creation and standardization of the unique electronic addresses 
required by information highway users to send and receive 
information. Here good standards equal good human dialogue, not 
to mention technical innovation.
<P>
	Let us talk about the air we breathe and the water we drink. 
Canada provides the secretariat for an international technical 
committee for environmental management which offers 
management systems for corporations that have an impact on the 
environment. As we speak, the committee is at work setting 
standards for environmental waste management, environmental 
audit practices, labelling and product design and safety. The aim is 
to encourage compliance around the world, making it easier for 
companies to plan for and monitor their environmental impacts.
<P>
	On the horizon lie many more opportunities for Canadians to be 
involved in domestic and international standards activities. 
Growing emphasis is being placed on establishing standards for 
management systems, including quality and the environment. 
Canadians from all walks of life continue to participate on 
standards writing committees or consumer advisory panels.
<P>
	Though seemingly complex and bureaucratic, standards setting 
mechanisms do affect our lives, and our powerful international 
alliances have the potential to deliver significant and long lasting 
benefits to the people of the world.
<P>
	I also think these amendments, because they are based on so 
much consultation, set the stage for a standard setting system that 
engages and listens to Canadians. For that reason I think Canadians 
will support the emphasis the government is placing on standards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me this afternoon to speak on Bill C-4, an act to 
amend the Standards Council of Canada Act.
<P>
	What are standards? Standards are measures of dimension, of 
quality, of exactness, serving as examples or principles to which 
others conform or should conform or by which the accuracy or 
quality of others is judged.
<P>
	Many Canadian and international organizations strive to attain 
and maintain a certain level of standardization in fields relating to 
construction, manufacture, production, quality performance, and 
safety of buildings, structures, manufactured articles, products and 
other goods not expressly provided by law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3029"> 3029 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, electric plug manufacturers want their products 
to work safely and efficiently. Therefore they build their electrical 
plugs to fit into standardized wall sockets. These plugs must also 
conduct a standardized level of electricity and allow household 
appliances to work without sparking a fire.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	As members can understand from this example, we need 
standards in the smallest details of our lives. Standards are critical 
in protecting the safety of Canadians and in ensuring their 
economic prosperity and the well-being of their children both now 
and in the future.
<P>
	For instance, how do Canadians know that their children's 
bicycle helmets will protect them when they fall or collide? How 
do Canadians know that the windows in their houses will keep the 
heat in while keeping out the cold of the winter? How do Canadians 
know that their TV reception will not go fuzzy when they turn on 
their home computers? The answer is standards.
<P>
	Standards are crucial in protecting Canadian people and in 
ensuring that goods and services will reach a level of quality on 
which Canadians can depend.
<P>
	In addition, increasing global trade forces Canadian companies 
to agree on international standards. Canadian manufacturers know 
that their products must meet the requirements of various countries 
around the world or they will not be able to export and trade 
abroad.
<P>
	Canada's trade agreements, NAFTA, GATT and the internal 
trade agreement, prohibit the use of standards as trade barriers. 
However, international co-operation relating to standards is crucial 
to Canada's economic growth.
<P>
	The bill before us today deals with the Standards Council of 
Canada. The mandate of this crown corporation is to promote 
standardization with the hope ``of advancing the national economy, 
benefiting the public, protecting consumers and facilitating trade 
and furthering international co-operation''. These all relate to 
standards.
<P>
	What are the main elements of Bill C-4? First, it expands the 
current mandate of the Standards Council to all areas where 
standardization is not already provided for by law.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-4 involves more Canadian volunteers in 
standards activities and promotes communication between 
governments and the private sector.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-4 reduces the number of council members from 57 
to 15 and adds qualifications for private sector representatives.
<P>
	Fourth, Bill C-4 changes in the English version the titles of the 
president and vice-president to chairperson and vice-chairperson 
respectively.
<P>
	Fifth, Bill C-4 specifies the duties of the chairperson.
<P>
	Sixth, Bill C-4 establishes the provincial-territorial advisory 
committee and the standards development organizations advisory 
committee.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-4 specifies that meetings of the council and its 
committees may be held through electronic means.
<P>
	These are amendments to the Standards Council of Canada Act 
that the Reform Party of Canada can support. I will only comment 
on a few elements of this bill.
<P>
	The Standards Council of Canada membership would be reduced 
from 57 to 15. This is an important change. The council would be 
able to meet more often with fewer people. Presently the council 
only meets twice a year for a day each time. This is hardly enough 
time to co-ordinate, develop and administer efficient and effective 
standards, especially in today's electronic world with so many 
rapid changes occurring.
<P>
	Telecommunications and computers are advancing so rapidly 
that it is difficult to develop standards quickly enough to keep up 
with these changes. It is common sense that a smaller membership, 
meeting more frequently, would be an improved means of dealing 
with the complexities of standards implementation in this fast 
changing world.
<P>
	Using modern technology to hold electronic council meetings is 
also a bold step for a crown corporation to take to operate more 
effectively. These kinds of meetings can build efficiencies and save 
tax dollars. We encourage the council to continue to experiment 
with ideas of this kind.
<P>
	The Standards Council of Canada membership would also 
change under Bill C-4. The number of public servant members on 
the council would decrease from six to one. This is a change that 
would hopefully make the Standards Council of Canada more 
representative of the Canadian people and the Canadian industry 
that depend on these standards.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Too often in the past government decisions have been made by 
an elitist and insensitive group of public servants in Ottawa who 
have no direct contact with the desires and needs of the Canadian 
people who are trying to make the economy work. This requires 
change, but it needs to change not only with the Standards Council 
of Canada but with all of government.
<P>
	Public policy needs to be designed and implemented by the 
applicable level of government closest to the Canadians affected. 
Canadians must have a direct say in what government plans and 
what government brings into effect. When this happens, the 
government can in the words of Pericles be called ``a democracy 
because power is in the hands not of the few but of the many''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3030"> 3030 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not suggesting a new idea. The private sector membership 
of the council would also change under Bill C-4. To make the 
council more open, accessible and accountable, members would 
be representative of a broad spectrum of interests and would have 
the experience necessary to assist the council in fulfilling its 
mandate. This change would hopefully allow those most affected 
by the council's resolutions to have a direct say in this decision 
making.
<P>
	I will comment on the Standards Council of Canada's financial 
situation. Its operating expenses this year were estimated at 
$9,847,000. Its revenues were estimated at $4,663,000, but its 
budget for 1996-97 is estimated at $5,184,000. That is quite a 
saving. I congratulate the council.
<P>
	We commend the Standards Council of Canada for its efforts to 
reach full cost recovery, but it has not gone far enough. It needs to 
take further steps by being even more innovative in covering all of 
its operating costs. In doing this the Standards Council of Canada 
would be setting an example for all of government.
<P>
	Therefore we challenge the government and we challenge all 
crown corporations to follow the standards council's lead. We 
challenge them to examine their operating budgets, to find areas 
where they can offer programs more efficiently and to find where 
costs can be fully recovered. More important, we challenge them to 
find ways to become more accessible and more accountable to the 
people they serve. They will be doing what is right for Canada and 
what is fair and necessary for all Canadians.

businesses and others against the abuses of economic power. They 
provide rights and impose obligations on marketplace participants, 
thereby providing certainty and reducing transaction costs. 
Framework laws are therefore essential for creating a climate for 
business that fosters jobs, innovation and growth. They help create 
the proper economic environment in which firms and consumers 
make their decisions.
<P>
	The particular framework laws in the legislation before us 
involve bankruptcy and insolvency, an issue that few Canadians 
want to contemplate. However, when Canadian businesses or 
consumers find that they have need of insolvency protection, they 
want to be assured that Canada's laws help them make the 
necessary decisions to get their lives or their businesses back on 
track again.
<P>
	Canada needs bankruptcy laws that encourage rather than deter 
risk taking and entrepreneurship. This is achieved by enacting 
bankruptcy laws that provide certainty and fairness to both debtors 
and creditors. The health of the Canadian marketplace depends on 
this balance. Lenders and borrowers need the assurance that their 
transactions are backed by framework laws that will treat all parties 
fairly and that will allow innovative solutions.
<P>
	At stake are jobs that rely on a company's ability to carry on 
paying its debts. Good bankruptcy laws give firms and individuals 
in financial trouble greater opportunity to get back on their feet by 
reorganizing their affairs and allowing them to capitalize on 
emerging opportunities. We must also be mindful of the health of 
businesses that rely on the ability of its customers to pay. At stake 
are the interest rates and conditions of borrowing at institutions. 
They must always consider the risk of not getting their loans repaid 
and set the price of their loans accordingly.
<P>
	In sum, this proposed legislation is dealing with the whole moral 
and ethical climate of the marketplace.  Canadians want to be 
assured that no one is slipping away from financial obligations by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3031"> 3031 </A></B>
<P>
using bankruptcy as an easy way out. Canadians want assurances 
that the piper will be paid.
<P>
	Over the years bankruptcy laws have been very difficult to 
reform and modernize. It proved to be difficult because so many 
different and often diverging interests must be taken into account in 
bankruptcy legislation. Consider for a moment the different points 
of view.
<P>
	Consumers abhor bankruptcy. They want bankruptcy laws that 
offer a real and honourable alternative to bankruptcy and asset 
liquidation. Canadian consumers want to be responsible and 
honour their financial obligations but when there is no viable 
alternative, consumers do not want to be harassed or stigmatized. 
They want to turn the page quickly and be given another chance to 
start afresh.
<P>
	Then there is the business community. Business women and men 
need insolvency laws that encourage rather than discourage them to 
be bold, innovative and to take risks, knowing that there will be a 
fair process to negotiate with creditors and reorganize their 
finances if their financial situation deteriorates to a state of 
insolvency. Corporate directors need incentives, not disincentives, 
to make the bold decisions that will save a business in financial 
difficulty.
<P>
	What about lenders? No business, and for that matter very few 
consumers, could go on and contribute to the health of the economy 
without financing being available, and on reasonable terms. 
Without bankruptcy laws that recognize the market realities of 
security lending that treat different classes of creditors fairly and 
equitably, Canadian businesses and consumers would be at a 
competitive disadvantage compared to competitors in other 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Then there are the insolvency practitioners such as trustees and 
receivers. They need adequate protection against personal liability 
for claims that would otherwise lie against the debtor or estate. 
Without adequate protection against personal liability, trustees and 
receivers would either not deal with sensitive estates or would 
systemically opt for liquidation when they would have opted for 
trying to salvage the business and preserve the jobs that depend on 
it.
<P>
	Then there are federal and provincial treasuries that are 
legitimate creditors. Where should they rank among other 
creditors? What priority, if any, should the crown legislatively 
grant itself?
<P>
	There are many different and divergent interests. In the event of 
an insolvency, when it comes time to divide the assets of a 
company, like dividing a pie, each of these interests wants a piece 
of that pie which unfortunately is not large enough to cover all 
liabilities.
<P>
	Where is the balance? What is fair and equitable? Is what is fair 
for one class of creditor fair for another class of creditor, fair for 
the business debtor and its employees, suppliers and shareholders? 
These are the questions that insolvency laws grapple with.
<P>
	At the same time, if the reorganization features of bankruptcy 
laws are effective, the insolvent company can be given breathing 
space to get its affairs back in order. It is as though the baker were 
to say to his creditors ``back off for a bit, then you will all get your 
piece of the pie and there will be more pies to come in the future''.
<P>
	With so many conflicting interests is it any wonder that over the 
past decades bankruptcy and insolvency reform has been among 
the most difficult legislation to pass in the House?
<P>
	The legislation includes more than 70 amendments which 
respond to the needs of the many and varied constituents it exists to 
serve, including the business community and consumer groups. 
The amendments cover a wide range of bankruptcy issues from 
consumer issues to commercial issues, to priorities and privileges 
and to amendments to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.
<P>
	I feel we are on solid ground with Bill C-5. I am confident the 
House will pass the legislation. I am confident for three reasons, 
first because of the wide range of input and advice that we have 
received from the whole spectrum of stakeholders.
<P>
	In 1993, following passage of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act, Industry Canada set up the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Advisory Committee to review insolvency legislation, to identify 
priority issues and to formulate possible solutions to them. More 
than 100 private sector insolvency experts have participated in this 
process. They represented consumers, business, lenders, 
insolvency practitioners and governments. Their voluntary effort 
speaks well of the importance of the legislation as well as the desire 
of the private sector to participate in the process leading to 
legislative reform.
<P>
	I was very impressed by the calibre of the advice the committee 
provided. The vast majority of the amendments before the House 
directly respond to the specific recommendations made by the 
committee.
<P>
	I emphasize this legislation reflects the government's resolve to 
respond to the needs of our clients, those who need and use the 
legislation. Framework legislation must respond to the real needs 
of the marketplace by taking into consideration real situations.
<P>
	By themselves governments do not have the expertise to 
anticipate the impact their regulations may have in the 
marketplace. However, by working as a facilitator to bring together 
the various interests and stakeholders, governments can play an 
effective role in helping to build modern, workable framework 
laws and policies. I am  confident the House will recognize the 
quality of the advice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3032"> 3032 </A></B>
<P>
we have received and see it reflected in the wisdom of the 
amendments before us.
<P>
	The second reason I am very confident in the legislation before 
us is the exceptional co-operation and support received from 
cabinet colleagues. The amendments before us touch on a variety 
of issues and interests. The ministers responsible for those interests 
have provided their support and encouragement for this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	For example, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
not only supports but has also been instrumental in crafting the 
measures to make student loan debts non-dischargeable for a 
period of 24 months after termination of studies.
<P>
	Students who have received financial assistance from taxpayers 
owe it to society and to future generations of students to reimburse 
the loans they have received.
<P>
	At the same time, however, governments and bankruptcy laws 
have to recognize that some students may find themselves in a 
hardship situation. This is reflected in the legislation by limiting 
the period during which student loan debt would be 
non-dischargeable.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice and the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women are both quite enthusiastic about the measures to prevent 
those who have been fined for sexual and other physical assault 
from declaring bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their 
obligations.
<P>
	Under this legislation judgments for wilful damages will not be 
released by a discharge. My colleagues have also supported the 
measures in this legislation that would see spousal and child 
support payments become provable priority claims.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has offered me great advice 
and collaboration in coming to grips with the important issue of 
environmental liability for insolvency practitioners as well as the 
no less important issue of the priority for environmental clean-up 
claims.
<P>
	I am proud to report the provisions proposed in this legislation 
will not only assist business reorganizations but will for the first 
time in Canadian history formally and legally recognize the 
priority of a clean environment.
<P>
	The third reason I am confident the legislation before us will 
obtain the support of Parliament is that Bill C-5 is part of work in 
progress. It is neither the beginning of the process of reforming 
Canada's bankruptcy laws nor the end.
<P>
	Some members will recall the spirit with which the changes to 
the BIA were greeted three years ago. It was regarded as a 
necessary first step in the reform of the framework laws. Some 
members wanted to go further but one of the compromises made 
back then was to commit  the government to bringing bankruptcy 
law forward for a parliamentary review three years after royal 
assent.
<P>
	The three-year review of the BIA was instrumental in obtaining 
stakeholder and parliamentary approval of the 1992 amendments. 
It provided some assurance to those whose concerns were not 
addressed in 1992 that their issues would be dealt with in phase two 
of the amendment process.
<P>
	They were assured further modernization of the statute would be 
considered by Parliament. The time for that review has arrived. 
Members on both sides of the House will welcome the opportunity 
to address many of the issues that were left unresolved on the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was passed in 1992.
<P>
	The legislation before us is very much intended to assist 
Parliament in a statutory three-year review. This legislation fine 
tunes and where warranted rectifies the reforms introduced in 
1992.
<P>
	It applies the spirit of the 1992 legislation and emphasizes giving 
time for reorganization of business and rehabilitation of 
consumers. From 1993 to 1995 over 48 per cent of the 
reorganizations started under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
are still alive. They are now under way with creditors and the 
court's approval.
<P>
	The reorganization provisions have created a framework to 
facilitate discussion and negotiation between creditors and debtors. 
The clear benefit is that the framework has created an environment 
in which possibilities that would have been lost can be explored in 
a transparent manner.
<P>
	In other respects this legislation adds new items to the 
bankruptcy reform agenda such as international insolvency and 
reform of the Company's Creditors Arrangement Act.
<P>
	In 1992 the passage of bankruptcy reform legislation represented 
something of a breakthrough. Much had changed since the last 
reform legislation had been passed some 40 years before. The 
legislation before us represents very much a consolidation of some 
of the reforms passed three years ago.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The 1992 legislation addressed the heart of bankruptcy practices 
by reforming the rules surrounding reorganizations. The legislation 
before us takes these rules further by addressing many crucial 
issues that arise in bankruptcy, issues such as environmental 
liability and director liabilities, issues such as the treatment of off 
farm income and consumer rehabilitation.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues will address these areas in more detail. 
In summary I emphasize the three strategic thrusts the legislation 
before us provides.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3033"> 3033 </A></B>
<P>
	First, Canadian bankruptcy law will continue to provide a 
framework in which it is preferable for consumers or businesses 
to reorganize their affairs rather than declare bankruptcy.
<P>
	Second, the legislation emphasizes the importance of measures 
to promote consumer rehabilitation. We want to create an 
environment in which consumers can act as responsible citizens.
<P>
	Third, the legislation is aimed at promoting fairness to both 
creditors and debtors.
<P>
	The legislation helps minimize the social and economic costs 
that result from insolvencies. It provides framework laws that will 
help business debtors who want to become competitive once more 
and consumers who want to act responsibly.
<P>
	I hope all members will join me in voting in favour of the bill at 
second reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have read with considerable interest the provisions of 
Bill C-5, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
While there are a number of elements in the bill we can support, 
there are a couple of things I want to address this afternoon which 
we cannot support.
<P>
	To review briefly, the bill does provide some rather interesting 
remedies for some difficulties in the business of bankruptcy and 
insolvency. For example, it comes to grips with procedures in 
consumer bankruptcies and proposals. It deals with landlord 
compensation where leases are disclaimed in reorganizations. The 
liability of directors and stays of action against directors during 
reorganizations are dealt with. There is protection for trustees and 
receivers against personal liability for pre-appointment 
environmental damage and other claims. Worker's Compensation 
Board claims are dealt with, dischargeability of student loans and 
so on.
<P>
	A number of these are rather significant. I will address a couple 
of these which are particularly worthwhile noting. First is the 
matter dealing with student loans. Students are responsible for their 
loans two years after they declare bankruptcy. That is significant 
because at the present time there is apparently an opportunity for 
students to escape paying their loan simply by declaring personal 
bankruptcy. This provision alone should save the federal 
government approximately $60 million.
<P>
	Another has to do with divorced spouses. The provision in the 
original draft of this bill was not acceptable, but the minister has 
agreed to accept one of our amendments. Therefore this area will 
be covered very well. It deals with divorced and separate spouses 
who will receive priority ranking among creditors for settlement of 
claims. Spouses are not now considered creditors under the 
bankruptcy laws. I think that new provision is a particularly good 
one and ought to be endorsed.
<P>
	The business of company director liability is also addressed and 
directors are permitted to defend themselves against negligence if 
they can prove they acted with due diligence. They would also get a 
stay of proceedings against them during reorganization 
proceedings. This provides a certain element of protection missing 
in the previous legislation.
<P>
	In the matter of environmental clean-ups, the act becomes clear 
as well. It says environmental clean-ups will get top priority over 
the claims of creditors. Bankruptcy trustees and receivers will have 
to report environmental hazards they notice after a company 
becomes bankrupt.
<P>
	Finally, in securities firms a process is laid out for bankrupt 
securities firms, particularly with regard to securities and debts 
held in the name of their clients. This is particularly significant 
because there have been clients who have been left high and dry by 
a security firm that went bankrupt and the money which was held 
by the company in trust was lost.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	I would now like to look at another area which has to do with 
bankruptcies more generally. While this bill begins to come to 
grips with the ways in which bankruptcies are dealt with, it does 
not come to grips with the causes of bankruptcy. This gives me the 
opportunity this afternoon to suggest that there is a far too high an 
incidence of bankruptcies in Canada.
<P>
	Consumer bankruptcies have soared in the last 10 years from 
approximately 20,000 in 1986 to over 60,000 in 1995. This is a 
threefold increase. Consumer bankruptcies are a sign of the lack of 
jobs that exist and the failure of the government to adequately 
address the problem. As a result, this bill cannot address the issue 
that is really at the heart of what is causing bankruptcies in Canada.
<P>
	The federal debt now stands at between $580 billion and $585 
billion. It is becoming very close to the $600 billion figure. It is all 
very nice for the Minister of Finance to talk about the wonderful 
way in which the deficit is being reduced each year, that the deficit 
this year will be a little less than last year and that it looks like 
eventually the government will get to the point where the deficit is 
reduced. However, he has not promised that he will eliminate the 
deficit.
<P>
	Every Canadian knows that with each deficit the debt gets 
bigger. It does not help to say that the deficit is going down if the 
debt keeps on growing and the interest that has to be paid on the 
debt becomes greater. That is not the only one of the causes for 
bankruptcies. The taxes that are paid by taxpayers to pay the 
interest is constantly increasing and it is therefore more difficult 
for businesses to operate successfully.
<P>
	When will the government recognize that as the debt increases, 
the predatory action of the interest on social  programs and on 
businesses also increases. This bill, while it is a beautiful bill, does 
not go far enough. The reason we have the bill is because there are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3034"> 3034 </A></B>
<P>
too many bankruptcies. The time has come for us to realize that 
Canada must get its financial house in order so that it does not go 
bankrupt and become subject to something like the bankruptcy act 
in terms of the international monetary situation. I hope it never 
comes to that. Certainly it does not have to. I would encourage all 
of us to take the steps necessary to ensure that does not happen.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to three areas where the bill is 
lacking. These are omissions. The first area deals with the lack of 
certain requirements of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies to 
report to the minister. The second area is the omission to provide 
for unpaid supplier accounts. The final area is the omission of 
payment of wages to workers whose employment is terminated 
because a firm went bankrupt.
<P>
	I want to draw attention to the omission of certain requirements 
with regard to the superintendent to report to the minister. The role 
of the superintendent is described in section 5 of the act. It is very 
interesting what this bill does. I want to put this in the context of a 
certain management theory which is rather significant. I want to 
focus it from four perspectives: responsibility, accountability, 
delegation and power.
<P>
	Responsibility is the clarity of tasks and lines of authority and 
communication so that everybody knows which responsibility and 
which outcome they are responsible for.
<P>
	Accountability is who checks the work done, where does the 
final word come from and where does the buck stop. These areas 
have to be clearly identified.
<P>
	Delegation is the assignment of tasks to others because no one 
person can do everything. We must ensure that the delegation is 
such that the whole operation works.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Finally, there is the matter of power; to effect the discipline 
necessary to enforce by placing sanctions or the issuance of a 
reward to those who should be rewarded for the work that they have 
done.
<P>
	The principle that I wish to enunciate is that the elected persons 
are responsible to those who elected them. It is the absolute number 
one requirement. What has this got to do with the bill? I suggest 
that in order to accomplish the governing of a nation, a province, a 
municipality or the administration of a complex organization 
engaged in business or commercial activities, there are certain 
management principles which must be observed in order to assure 
that the goals, purposes and the mission of the organization can be 
accomplished.
<P>
	The principles are the division of tasks to be formed into 
manageable components and to make sure that these tasks are 
carried out to the satisfaction of those in charge. How does this 
come into focus for Bill C-5?
<P>
	Generally speaking, the bill does a reasonable job in meeting the 
requirements that would normally be associated with the 
implementation of these principles. However, it falls short in 
several areas. Two of them are accountability and responsibility.
<P>
	As in several other pieces of legislation which have been 
presented to the 35th Parliament, this bill contains the provision of 
giving to the bureaucracy powers and the assignment of authority 
and responsibility without recognizing the role and the 
responsibility of Parliament and the elected representatives whose 
primary responsibility is to the people who have elected them to 
manage the affairs of this country in their best interest and to the 
advantage of all Canadians.
<P>
	In Bill C-46, for example, which amended the Corporations Act, 
the minister was given in the initial presentation of the bill powers 
to determine the winners and losers by determining programs and 
special assistance in whatever industries, particular industries or 
commercial establishments, organizations or persons who are 
members of a particular category of persons defined by cabinet 
order. The minister changed that later and that is to his credit.
<P>
	Bill C-99, which amended the Small Business Loans Act, 
contained provisions that the amount of liability of the government 
would be decided by cabinet, not Parliament. Again, it was an 
abrogation of the responsibility of Parliament and the members' 
responsibility to look after the best interests of the people who 
elected them.
<P>
	Bill C-5 does not rectify that situation. Powers have been 
delegated to a bureaucrat, in this case the Superintendent of 
Bankruptcy. They should be in my opinion those of the minister.
<P>
	What are some of these responsibilities? I will read from clause 
5 of the bill we are considering:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5.(1) The Governor in Council shall appoint a Superintendent of Bankruptcy 
to hold office during pleasure who shall be paid such salary-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The Superintendent shall supervise the administration of all the estates to 
which this Act applies</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The Superintendent shall, without limiting the authority conferred by 
subsection (2),</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) receive applications for licences and renewals thereof to act as trustees 
under this Act, and, as authorized by the Minister, issue licences and renewals 
thereof to those persons whose applications have been approved;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) keep a record of all licences granted and of the renewals thereof as they are 
issued;</BLOCKQUOTE>
(c) where not otherwise provided for, require the deposit of one or more 
continuing guaranty bonds as security for the due  accounting of all property 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3035"> 3035 </A></B>
<P>
received by trustees and for the due and faithful performance by them of their duties 
in the administration of a estates to which they are appointed, in such amount as the 
Superintendent may determine, which amount may be increased or decreased as he 
may deem expedient, and the security shall be in a form satisfactory to the 
Superintendent and may be enforced by the Superintendent for the benefit of the 
creditors;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) keep such records as he may deem advisable of proceedings under this 
Act;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) from time to time make or cause to be made such inspection or 
investigation of estates as he may deem expedient and for the purpose of the 
inspection or investigation the Superintendent or any person appointed by 
him for the purpose shall have access to and the right to examine all books, 
records, documents and papers pertaining or relating to any estate;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) receive and keep a record of all complaints from any creditor or other 
person interested in any estate and make such specific investigations with 
regard to such complaints as the Superintendent may determine; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(g) examine trustees' accounts of receipts and disbursements and final 
statements.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) The Superintendent may intervene in any matter or proceeding in court as 
he may deem expedient as though he were a party thereto.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	It is a good set of duties but members will notice the number of 
times it says the superintendent ``may''. He may do this, he may do 
that and he may do something else.
<P>
	Let me quote from another clause:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6.(1) The Superintendent may engage such accountants or other persons as he 
may deem advisable to conduct any inspection or investigation or to take any 
other necessary action outside the Office of the Superintendent, and the costs 
and expenses thereof shall, when certified by the Superintendent, be payable 
out of the appropriation for the Office of the Superintendent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It continues down through the rest of that clause. Now comes the 
big, heavy duty clause, clause 7 of the bill which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. When any investigation has been made by the Superintendent or any one 
on his behalf; and it appears that a licensee-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a person or group of persons or a company that is 
authorized to manage an estate.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-under this act has not performed his duties properly or has been guilty of any 
improper conduct or has not fully complied with the law with regard to the 
proper administration of any estate, the Superintendent may make a report to 
the Minister together with such recommendations to the Minister as the 
Superintendent may deem advisable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice that there could be an unlawful conduct, or an omission, 
or not having done something, an omission of some kind. The 
superintendent is not obligated to report. He may report to the 
minister. He may make a report to  the minister together with such 
recommendations as the superintendent may deem advisable.
<P>
	Huge estates could be at stake here. Big companies could be 
forced to reorganize their financial structures. Huge corporations 
could be forced to reorganize their international operations or 
indeed their national operations, affecting literally thousands of 
people's jobs. Perhaps the welfare of many other businesses depend 
on this larger organization to function.
<P>
	If the trustee acts in a manner that is unlawful it is not a 
requirement of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy to cause that 
licensee to have his or her licence withdrawn or even a report to be 
made to the minister. Yet it is the minister who is responsible to 
look after the welfare of the people of Canada and was elected by 
those people to represent their interests.
<P>
	The bill does not address this issue at all. It is silent on this 
matter. The difficulty is not in the range of responsibilities listed 
here, nor is it that the superintendent should not have substantial 
powers to enforce the fair and just administration of the estate of a 
person or corporation that is insolvent or bankrupt.
<P>
	The difficulty is that the superintendent is not held to account to 
any elected official in the event of a licensee who ``has not 
performed his duties properly or has been guilty of an improper 
conduct or has not fully complied with the law with regard to the 
proper administration of any estate''. That is a serious and a very 
significant provision in current legislation and this bill does not 
address it at all.
<P>
	The difficulty is that the application of the powers to assure 
fairness and veracity of trustee's reports is not subject to review by 
law. And it should be. Nor does it appear to be a requirement of the 
superintendent to make available trustee reports in the event that a 
civil litigation be launched and in that litigation perhaps charges of 
unfairness, perhaps bias or maybe even in some cases collusion by 
creditors against a particular bankruptcy. It is not a requirement of 
law that if such should be the case, the superintendent is required to 
present that kind of a report to the courts, and I think it ought to be.
<P>
	The reason why this is so important is that information contained 
in bankruptcy reports can be crucial in the examination of the 
reasons for the bankruptcy or the reorganization requirement of a 
particular enterprise. Therefore it would appear imperative that 
amendments be introduced that would replace ``may'' with 
``shall''. This would effect a shift in power from that of the 
superintendent to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The minister should have the final responsibility on matters such 
as the receiving of reports about the neglect of performance of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3036"> 3036 </A></B>
<P>
duties of licensees who are  administering bankrupt estates instead 
of giving the superintendent absolute discretion in such matters.
<P>
	The problem is exacerbated because it is the minister who issues 
and revokes licences. The minister does that but he does it on the 
advice of the superintendent. With those kinds of powers and with 
that kind of advice it is obvious what the minister will do. Such 
broad power is enough to determine the financial and economic 
success, or at least the viability, of a bankruptcy trustee.
<P>
	In other words, a bankruptcy trustee may make a livelihood of 
administering bankrupt estates. If there are 60,000 of them in one 
year there is a lot of work to do. If the licence should be revoked the 
very welfare of that trustee could be at stake. If the superintendent 
of bankruptcies is the one who has that power, we can see how easy 
it would be for all kinds of things to go kind of funny in the 
background.
<P>
	It also makes it possible for certain trustees to have a virtual 
monopoly on a set of estates or in doing work for a department. 
Determining the success or failure of a litigation, contesting the 
administration of the bankrupt estate, the causes which result in a 
bankruptcy, the fairness of assessing the claims properly and the 
priority of creditors are all related to the work of the trustee who is 
in charge of a particular bankruptcy.
<P>
	Power to abuse is what we have here. There is power to abuse the 
system and that power needs to have checks and balances. I suggest 
those checks and balances rest with the minister and with cabinet, 
not with bureaucrats. Hence I suggest the minister consider the 
addition of the appropriate amendments to the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act to remedy these shortcomings.
<P>
	In matters of this kind there is always the possibility of being 
tempted to exercise power in a biased or discriminatory manner 
because of the money involved, thousands of dollars, hundreds of 
thousands or millions of dollars in some cases.
<P>
	While there are strong provisions in the bankruptcy act to 
discourage this biased practice, such provisions are difficult to 
enforce if other provisions of the act permit certain matters to go 
unreported to those in positions to do something about them.
<P>
	There are two other areas of the bill which suffer from 
inadequacy or from omission. There is the matter of unpaid 
supplier provisions. Suppliers of goods are frequently in situations 
in which a debtor has ordered a considerable amount of inventory 
before being placed into bankruptcy or receivership. The supplier 
is then left with an unsecured claim for the price of goods while 
their value benefits the secured creditors who have charges on the 
business' inventory.
<P>
	This practice of stacking up an inventory for the benefit of 
secured creditors is detrimental to the interests of the supplier. 
There are provisions under the current act to give suppliers the 
right to repossess merchandise  delivered to a purchaser who 
becomes bankrupt or who goes into receivership.
<P>
	Nevertheless, these provisions have received criticism from the 
financial community in which they say the availability of credit 
would be reduced because lenders would no longer be able to count 
on inventory as security for their loans. The matter is not dealt with 
here and probably at some future time it will be. It has been 
presented to the minister on more than one occasion. In each 
instance he has decided not to do anything about it.
<P>
	The third omission is the bill does not provide for the payment of 
unpaid wages to workers whose employment was terminated as a 
result of a bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation of their 
employer. The matter was to have been the subject of a study by a 
special joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate. 
That committee was to report in June 1993. That committee was 
never established.
<P>
	Instead, the wage claim payment program of the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act maintained a preferred creditor status for unpaid 
wages, for unpaid wage claims, and increased the amounts that 
could be claimed.
<P>
	In the interests of the employees who are terminated as a result 
of bankruptcy the matter should be revisited to determine whether a 
fairer and more equitable provision for the affected employees can 
be achieved.
<P>
	There are a number of provisions in the bill which we can 
support and there are a number of shortcomings which have been 
addressed. While in general we will support the bill, I believe the 
minister would be well advised to recognize there is a lot of work 
left to be done to deal with those issues which must be addressed.
<P>
	I underscore again that the real reason bankruptcy is so rampant 
in the country today has to do with the financial situation, in 
particular the fiscal situation, in which the country finds itself.
<P>
	I encourage the Minister of Industry, who is leading this bill, and 
the Minister of Finance together with the Prime Minister to put all 
their efforts into one thrust to eliminate the deficit and begin to 
control the debt so that our interest payments do not continue to 
rise and we can once again have a fair and level playing field in 
which private industry, private enterprise, can build a country 
where all of us will have the economic freedom to spend our money 
the way we want to, with a minimum of government interference, 
and be successful in our endeavours so we will not have to deal 
with bankruptcy.

	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALGERIANNATIONALS">ALGERIAN NATIONALS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to start by commenting on the extraordinary work that has been 
done by the Canadian Council for Refugees. I salute the organizers 
and delegates who are this week, May 29 to June 1, attending a 
four-day conference in Winnipeg. At this conference, hands-on 
workers in the field will be exploring the various avenues and 
solutions to the problems experienced by refugee claimants in 
Canada. I hope that their reflections will  help contribute to 
improving the cause of refugees in Canada and in the rest of the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	This past April 29, I asked a question of the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration concerning the deportation of 
Algerians. For some months the Bloc Quebecois has been 
demanding the suspension of returns to Algeria, given the rise of 
fundamentalism and the atmosphere of violence in that country. A 
report published March 14 by the American Secretary of State is 
very clear on this.
<P>
	In light of this explosive situation, I am seriously questioning 
why the minister and his employees insist on continuing to deport 
Algerian nationals. It is distressing to see that Canada has gone so 
far as to espouse such immigration policies. This lays open to 
question its international reputation as a country which welcomes 
those whose fundamental rights have been violated, including the 
rights relating to their very survival. In so doing, the leaders and 
the public servants of this country, a country that boasts of being a 
great defender of all humanitarian causes, is making a mockery of 
its international commitments.
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to speak out 
vigorously against the methods being used by the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration. The complaints against these agents 
of removal by those deported, by lawyers and organizations 
defending immigrants and refugees are endless and are of the 
highest concern to me.
<P>
	I would like to illustrate these remarks with two examples. The 
first dates back to May 8, when Immigration Canada decided to 
deport Saadi Bouslimani, a 29-year old Algerian denied refugee 
status. Two days later, we learn that he was not deported. He ended 
up in the infirmary at the Parthenais detention centre in Montreal 
for treatment of wounds to his head, neck and feet. He had been 
struck by an immigration official.
<P>
	The second example is that of a Zairian national, Biha Munsi, 
who was drugged in order to be deported on February 23, 1994, 
while she was pregnant. I criticized this practice in the House at the 
time.
<P>
	I wonder who orders the use of drugs and unnecessary force in 
the deportation of a recalcitrant individual.
<P>
	This brings me to the advisory committee looking at conditions 
in countries where people are deported. The aim of this committee 
is to advise the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on 
countries at risk and on the dangers threatening the survival of 
people Canada is preparing to deport to their countries. Since the 
composition, role and power of this committee is totally nebulous 
in terms of the department's organization chart and in terms of its 
operations, we could describe it as a phantom committee.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3044"> 3044 </A></B>
<P>
	Because of the mystery surrounding this advisory committee, 
because of the aberrations and the arbitrary policies emanating 
from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, I would ask 
the minister to affirm her leadership of this department she 
theoretically heads, to look more realistically and objectively at 
the Algerian situation and to review the $500 cost to apply for 
residency on humanitarian grounds.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it does not 
help anyone for the member opposite to give misinformation. He 
knows full well specific cases cannot be discussed in detail in the 
House because of confidentiality. Also he knows full well it is not 
the policy of the government to drug people and to use violence. 
The hon. member knows full well that is not acceptable.
<P>
	I also remind the hon. member that, as the minister has 
previously stated in the House, departmental policy concerning 
removals to different countries must be based on an individual case 
examination. Many countries are troubled by civil unrest and 
terrorist violence but few are so overwhelmed that it becomes 
necessary for the department to suspend removals to that country.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	At present the department has temporarily suspended removals 
to only three countries: Rwanda, Burundi and Afghanistan. The 
citizens of these three countries have faced a level of violence and 
personal suffering so great that they have been forced to flee their 
homes and abandon their possessions. The situation in Algeria, 
while regrettable and distressing, does not compare to that of these 
countries.
<P>
	The decision to suspend removals is made upon the advice of an 
Advisory Committee on Country Conditions for Removals. This 
committee meets on a regular basis to review the overall conditions 
of countries. In making its recommendation, it considers materials 
produced by representatives of the department, the Immigration 
and Refugee Board documentation centre, respected international 
sources like the UNHCR and the International Organization for 
Migration as well as other documents forwarded by 
non-governmental organizations.
<P>
	Removals are only carried out once all rights of appeal and due 
process have been exhausted. Before the department makes the 
decision to remove anyone from Canada, the circumstances of their 
case are carefully reviewed and all factors are considered. All 
people in our society have use of the full extent of the law of 
appeals.
<P>
	In the case of Algeria, the advisory committee recognized that 
despite the obvious risk of living in the area, the majority of the 
population chooses to remain. Industry, commerce and agriculture 
continue. The country's transportation and communications 
systems  function and people travel into and out of Algeria for 
various purposes, including family visits and business.
