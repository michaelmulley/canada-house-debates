</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-273, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(political activities by charities receiving public funds). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, passage of this bill would ensure that 
charities that have charitable status and therefore are able to 
issue tax receipts would have their charitable status revoked if 
they use any of the money for political activities, since the act 
concerned with charitable status specifically prohibits those 
charities from so doing.  It is time to put some teeth into the 
act.

introduce Bill C-274, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act 
(electronic voting). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, back in 1994 I ran an electronic 
referendum in my riding using electronic touch tone voting.  It 
came in for a lot of criticism at the time.  However, in 1996 the 
Harris government wrote electronic voting into the elections act 
for Ontario and subsequently the city of North York carried out 
an electronic referendum in March of this year in which 152,000 
people voted by touch tone telephone in five languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to amend the Canada Elections Act to permit 
Elections Canada to carry out some experiments with electronic 
voting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have three petitions to present to the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one has to do with health warning labels. The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems 
and that fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects 
are 100% preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to mandate 
the labelling of alcoholic products to warn expectant mothers and 
others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

the second petition has to do with the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society and that the Income Tax 
Act discriminates against families who choose to provide care in 
the home to preschool children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, therefore, call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children.

the third petition has to do with everyday heroes, our police 
officers and firefighters on the front lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk on a daily basis and that the public mourns the 
loss when one of them loses his or her life in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to 
establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the 
benefit of families of public safety officers, our police 
officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SAGUENAY—ST. LAWRENCE MARINE PARK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-7, an Act to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
Marine Park and to make a consequential amendment to another Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of presenting the 
bill to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone will agree that our parks and national historical 
monuments are viewed as treasures both here and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, yesterday I attended a meeting of heritage ministers 
from across Canada in St. John's, Newfoundland, and we were in 
unanimous agreement, including the Government of Quebec, that 
Canada's heritage is a great treasure as far as tourism is 
concerned, and benefits our economy, as well as nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to show you just how much of a collaborative 
effort this bill has been for the people of the Saguenay.  Even MPs 
who were not from our party were involved in creating the idea of 
having the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park as the first marine 
park created by Canadians. 
The member for Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean himself was the one who 
conceived this idea and proposed it to the then Minister of the 
Environment, Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That hon. member, André Harvey—my apologies, Mr. Speaker, I 
know we are not supposed to name MPs, but I feel this is important. 
Why?  Because it shows that a Liberal member is now putting the 
finishing touches to a fantastic bill that started out with a 
Conservative minister and has the support of the Parti Quebecois 
government in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows how this country can function when we want it to, 
and how we can work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this happen in the Saguenay?  Why did we create the 
first marine park in Canada?  We Canadians are often the first to 
do things. 
We were the first country to set up a parks department, which is 
now more than a century old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the first in the world to sign an international treaty 
on the environment, the International Transboundary Waters Act, 
which dates, I believe, from 1909.  We have worked with the 
Americans on major environmental matters.  All Canadians in their 
heart feel a bond with the land they live in because of its size 
and because of its complexity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have how many time zones, how many climate zones?  A small 
group of people spread out over a very vast territory, and what 
does that give us?  It gives us a very unique feeling of how we 
and the land are partners together.  That is why we were the 
first country in the world to establish a national parks agency, 
the first country in the world to establish a transboundary 
agreement on the environment back in 1909. Now today we have 
another first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are establishing the first marine park which started off more 
than 10 years ago.  It was the dream of a member of Parliament 
who was not of my persuasion.  He happened to be the local member 
of Parliament for the area.  He proposed the idea to the then 
minister who happened to be a member of the Conservative Party 
but who subsequently joined another party. Now we see it all 
coming to fruition in a way that I hope and believe every 
Canadian can support.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are justified in being proud of our efforts, 
generation after generation, in hanging on to the jewels of our 
natural and historical heritage.  This is in fact the thrust of the 
resolution passed unanimously in Newfoundland yesterday, in which 
all the ministers, regardless of political party said “It is our 
responsibility to preserve our heritage and to improve it for our 
children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same vision and commitment has led us to establish parks 
and historical sites.  Today, they underlie our efforts to create 
a new network of national parks and of marine conservation areas 
comprising 29 natural marine areas within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a role, but it is really the people 
of Canada who are determined to establish legislation to protect 
this extraordinary and vital marine wealth. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we are fulfilling a vision for parks and marine areas 
that is truly pan-Canadian in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past two years alone we have made tremendous progress 
with the signing of agreements to establish Wapusk and Tuktut 
Nogait national parks.  We have also proceeded with the 
withdrawal of lands for future Canadian parks at Wager Bay and on 
Bathurst Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total we have set aside a land mass of over 60,000 square 
kilometres, an area larger than the entire country of 
Switzerland, and we have done that in the past two years alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we work toward completion of our Canadian parks system by the 
millennium we anticipate establishing new parks and conservation 
areas on Baffin Island, in Lake Superior, in Bonavista Bay and 
hopefully in the Torngat Mountains, to name just a few. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is the result of a joint project and 
the fruit of a real partnership, proof that Canadians are quite 
capable of producing grand visions together, when they pool their 
efforts to achieve a common goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park is a reality today 
because of co-operation between members of Parliament, various 
levels of government, the communities involved and the native 
peoples of the region, who played a very important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out the great diversity of 
individuals, organizations and governments involved in this great 
vision. 
The lesson learned was that nothing is impossible and anything is 
possible when people put politics aside and work together for the 
good of the planet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle is what the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is 
all about.  It is about working together.  It is about setting 
aside our political differences and uniting around a common goal, 
that of preserving the ecosystem.  Of course it is what Canada 
and Canadians are all about, people working together in the 
spirit of shared vision and co-operation; people coming together 
as we did during the Saguenay and Red River floods with the 
spirit of co-operation and vision; people from diverse 
communities with various political backgrounds, different levels 
of government, different ideas and interests coming together to 
protect a unique marine environment, to establish a unique marine 
park and to preserve this magnificent part of Canada's national 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through today's legislation we are following through on our 
shared goal of protecting and preserving the natural environment 
contained in the park.  Most significantly, we are ensuring 
better protection for the beluga whale, a threatened species that 
is native to this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beluga whale grows up to six metres in length.  With its 
distinctly white coloration, high rounded forehead and lack of a 
dorsal fin, it is one of the world's most extraordinary 
creatures.  For years they have been known for their remarkably 
varied vocal repertoire. Canadians have listened to their voices 
calling out from the sea for marine protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 500 beluga whales live within the park's boundaries. 
The vast majority of Canadians have never seen a beluga whale, 
but they want to save the habitat for their children and for the 
children of the whales.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In creating this new marine park we are making sure that our 
efforts are working in harmony with our strategy for sustainable 
development and biodiversity.  Together Canadians are moving 
toward that goal. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park will be a meeting place for 
Canadian and foreign tourists, as well as the main attraction of a 
region that is unique, given its incomparable natural beauty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a five-year period, the marine park will result in over $11 
million being invested in the local, regional and national economy, and 
in the creation of 350 jobs in the region. So far, the federal 
government has invested more than $15 million and we are planning to put 
in another $15 million before the beginning of the new millennium. 
The purpose of this initiative is to increase the level of protection of 
the marine ecosystems and to promote public appreciation for the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our natural heritage is an important element that distinguishes us 
as a people and a country. The establishment of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park will allow us to reinforce Canada's identity and 
values, and to become even more responsible as regards nature and our 
common future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today has the support of environmental 
organizations, aboriginal people and local businesses, which have 
already contributed $30 million toward the creation of the park. The 
park is a unique natural treasure in a prime location, not only in the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence region, but in the hearts of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park is also unique in that it is the first federal-provincial 
salt water park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud to live in a beautiful, vast and very 
diversified country, with coasts that cannot be found anywhere else in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can stop environmental degradation in this particular region of 
Canada and we can protect our natural heritage thanks to the efforts and 
the will of all concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a privilege and a thrill this summer which probably most 
people would never have in a lifetime.  I had the privilege of 
sailing a boat from Newfoundland to Boston.  We started from 
Newfoundland and as we came out of the St. John's harbour, within 
a quarter of a mile of the harbour, I was able to pull the boat 
beside an iceberg which towered over us by about 300 feet. What 
you do not see is about 90% of the iceberg below. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did we see this iceberg but as we sat beside it and 
marvelled at its intense beauty as a part of an ecosystem which 
has been there for 20,000 years, a whale jumped out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the graph of a quarter of a mile of our land, we had 
mother nature of 20,000 years and mother nature in the form not 
of a beluga whale but a less endangered species of a whale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when the battles of the workforce in politics or 
otherwise can make you lose site of the bigger picture.  When I 
was there in the boat watching the whales from the pod jump, I 
had to say this is the nature of the land which we have inherited 
from our ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the nature of a land that we have a responsibility to give 
to our children.  That is why I was so proud last night when our 
prime minister in his address in Ottawa underscored the 
environmental challenges we face in the future.  We cannot just 
think of today.  We cannot just think of tomorrow.  We have to 
think of future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the establishment of the first federal-provincial marine park 
in salt water, we are setting a framework to keep this park 
forever, into infinity, not just so we can sail, if we have the 
means—and not everybody does—but so generations of young 
Canadians in the future can see what it is that drew people 
inexorably to this fantastic country called Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When people like Radisson and Desgroseillers travelled through 
Hamilton on their trips to find furs, they experienced a feeling for 
their country that was shared with aboriginal people. We have somewhat 
forgotten the true nature of this country called Canada. This country is 
winter and winter is our country. I believe that with the small step we 
are taking today by establishing the first marine park, we are 
recreating— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A magnet brought people to this fantastic country, whether it 
was several hundred years ago, thousands of years ago over the 
Bering Strait, or as late as this year when thousands of people 
chose to call Canada home.  I think the bill is one of the 
reasons we will continue to preserve a way of life that people 
around the world see as a magnet for their hopes and their 
aspirations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this being my first formal speech in the House of Commons in this 
session, I wish to congratulate you on your position in the chair 
and the Speaker of the House on the democratic process that we 
went through a couple of weeks ago.  I know all of you are 
working very hard to make sure that parliament is conducted in a 
way that we can have our political differences but at the same 
time in a way that all decisions by the Chair are fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to do obviously is to thank the 
people of Kootenay—Columbia for vesting their confidence in me. 
I had a vote of 62% and certainly I thank those people for their 
vote, but I also feel a tremendous responsibility to the other 
38% who chose to vote for someone else, that they would see me as 
representing them in the Kootenay—Columbia constituency and be 
worthy of the trust the people have given me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested in the comments of the heritage minister 
about her personal experience on the Atlantic.  Of all the 
divisions within the heritage department probably parks are 
closest to my own heart.  I have been very fortunate.  My wife 
and I have reared three children on a lake in the Rocky 
Mountains.  It is not unusual on my way home either to see 
muskrat, elk or deer.  We have white swan.  We have loons.  We 
have everything constantly around us.  I have a tremendous 
appreciation for nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the difference—this is perhaps a personal difference 
and a political difference—is the vision I have of parks in 
Canada as creating more of a balance.  There is a tension between 
the side of preservation of what we have in Canada and the access 
citizens and visitors to Canada should have to parks.  Perhaps 
that is where we would end up with a difference of opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the time I have spent at my home and in our own area 
I have personally seen and smelled grizzly bear, seen the caribou 
and the moose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 15 years ago in the fall during the rut I was rather 
chagrined.  I was driving a TransAm.  That car rode very close to 
the road.  As I was driving between two centres in my 
constituency a moose walked out very slowly.  I had just finished 
passing a Greyhound bus and I slowed down to a stop.  The moose 
was absolutely a gigantic, magnificent animal.  He kind of looked 
at the front of the car with that great big thunderbird on it.  I 
was wondering if he saw it as something he wanted to mangle or 
attack.  I was particularly concerned about the bus coming up 
behind me, that somebody might honk the horn in which case this 
animal might do something unexpected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of country I come from and I am very proud to 
represent.  I have a strong feeling about nature and what we have 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with that vision that I speak to the bill before us.  My 
understanding is that this is federally enabling legislation for 
an agreement between Canada and Quebec, signed in 1990, to create 
a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay fiord and the St. 
Lawrence estuary and to conserve and manage its marine resources. 
Bill C-7 does not involve any transfer of land.  The Government 
of Quebec retains ownership of the seabed and subsoil resources. 
The Government of Canada continues to exercise its responsibility 
over navigation and fisheries.  Existing laws remain applicable 
in the park.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative process that we enter into in the House is very 
important.  All steps in the process are very important.  In this 
case the committee work will be a very valuable part of putting 
this important legislation in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is collaboration in the involvement of local and regional 
organizations in protecting the site.  It suggests that there is 
support for this 1,138 square kilometre protected zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be very important for the committee to hear from people 
about the issue so that we clearly understand we have 
representation from people and, if there are two sides to this 
issue, so that we clearly understand where the local people are 
coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding was provided for in the February 1995 federal budget and 
the federal contributions toward development and operating costs 
totalled $20.7 million over three years.  Additional funding from 
the federal government has been $6 million between 1989 and 1993 
and $4 million for green plan funding between 1993 and 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little confused with the funding.  It will also be an 
important part of the job of the committee to take a look at the 
issue of funding.  I have the numbers for 1989-90, 1990-91, and 
so on and so forth all the way up to 1996-97, where I see a total 
of $16.3 million in federal money went into the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two figures in front of me that I find a little 
confusing, $20.7 million and $30.7 million.  I heard the minister 
in her speech talk about the figure of $30.7 million.  I am 
trying to portray the issue of the dollars and cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is noted for looking after the financial 
affairs of Canada and calling the government to account for the 
way it spends its dollars.  The dollars that have been spent to 
this point do not appear to have been exorbitant or out of line. 
However there does seem to be some confusion about them.  I would 
look to the committee to examine expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament must approve all new parks and all changes to 
existing parks.  This should ensure some accountability to 
parliament and ultimately to the public.  Our national parks are 
owned by all Canadians and purportedly managed on their behalf. 
The legislation attempts to put in place a federal-provincial 
management regime that is already operational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had the good fortune, as the minister just indicated, to 
visit Newfoundland this summer.  I was on the opposite side of 
the island.  I was at Gros Morne National Park.  I cite this by 
way of example of the kind of work we must do in committee.  I 
cite Gros Morne as a template.  If we take a look at it we should 
be able to see the kinds of questions we should be asking in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gros Morne is 20 to 25 years old.  It is still in the formation 
stages and is working under an agreement between the federal and 
provincial governments.  The applicable laws and their 
enforcement come under the provincial government because enabling 
legislation has not been brought through the House to bring it 
under Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the good things I saw in Gros Morne Park was the 
relationship of the services being provided either to the park or 
to the visitors of the park.  They were very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Jasper National Park, Banff, or Riding Mountain National Park 
in Manitoba people constantly run into conflict between 
commercial interests providing services to the park and its 
visitors because of an overlay, duplication, and many years of 
trying to jig and redo leases.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beauty of Gros Morne is that the leases that have been 
negotiated have been done on the basis of a percentage of gross 
revenue.  That is something we could take a look at for any 
leases in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Park.  We should be looking 
at simplifying leases, particularly for people who provide boat 
services and things of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very good thing about Gros Morne is that the towns, 
although geographically within the park, are nonetheless not 
contained within the actual park boundary.  This has tremendously 
simplified the relationship of the towns to the park and to the 
park administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we could learn about, for example, when we 
take a look at the conflict we are currently undergoing in the 
town of Banff.  Jasper certainly is not far behind, as are the 
other towns within park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very interesting situation in Gros Morne.  We are 
talking about the moose and land animals there.  They do relate 
to Beluga whales and to the marine life in this marine park.  The 
problem with moose in Gros Morne is that they are literally 
eating the park to death.  I can see a situation forthcoming 
where there may even have to be a cull of moose because the park 
could actually be killed by the overgrazing of moose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One interesting thing about moose in Newfoundland is that they 
are not actually natural to Newfoundland.  They were imported at 
the turn of the century.  I believe the year was 1906.  As a 
consequence they have adapted to an absolutely ideal territory 
but unfortunately are eating the park to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting point is that we can learn from the Gros 
Morne template relative to this act and what happened with 
respect to the agreement on snowmobiles in Gros Morne.  When the 
agreement was negotiated some 20 years ago there was no vision, 
nor could we have had a vision, of how the capability and 
capacity of snowmobiles could be increased to extreme heights in 
terms of speed and carrying people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the agreement negotiated with the people in the area 
at the time is now called into question.  With access to the high 
plateau areas in Gros Morne Park there is actually what I call 
shoulder season problems.  In other words, if the snowmobiles are 
out too soon, or particularly in the spring when the snowmobiles 
are out too late, they are actually causing damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am suggesting to the House and to the committee 
that we must take a look at flexibility in anything to do with 
the legislation so that we do not end up finding ourselves in a 
box with respect to people who are running boats in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot possibly foresee the technological capacity of boats 
that will be in this area.  As a consequence we must ensure we 
have flexibility within any legislation and within regulations so 
that we do not end up with the same kind of problems with boats 
at Saguenay that we are currently experiencing with snowmobiles 
at Gros Morne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated at the outset of my comments, I believe that the 
majority of people in the Reform Party and I have a different 
vision of Parks Canada than the minister and certainly the 
Liberal government.  We see parks as being areas that must be 
properly confined and protected for the benefit of our children 
and our grandchildren and for the benefit of all people in the 
world, which is why Banff is designated a heritage site.  We 
understand that. 
However, we have a lot of difficulty when we try to apply 
preservation techniques and policies on an area where people are 
already coming into the parks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there has to be a better balance and a better approach 
to parks and preserves. My vision of this in committee would be 
to look at it more from the perspective of the people who are 
presently going into this area.  As the minister indicated, it is 
important to protect the beluga and its environment.  At the same 
time we have to take into account that one of the major reasons 
for this park is for all Canadians and all visitors to have the 
potential for the same kind of experience the minister had with 
the whale and the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one criticism that could be considered partisan.  Once 
again the Liberal government is using the House as a rubber 
stamp.  And it is not just the Liberal government. Between the 
Liberals and Conservatives who have bounced back and forth across 
this Chamber frequently there has been the implication that 
because one has a majority government, it will simply bring in 
the legislation in due course, in due time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister talked about “putting the final touches” on 
this legislation, she also indicated there was a Conservative 
initiative to this.  Why does the legislation come at the very 
tag end?  Why is it that when these parties are in government 
they consistently use the House as a rubber stamp? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the details were worked out with the province of Quebec long 
before it was brought to the House for any kind of discussion. 
That is really unfortunate and takes me back to the first item on 
my shopping list for committee.  The people in the area and all 
concerned parties must be heard relative to their support for 
this park.  We have some documentation to back it up but let us 
hear the people in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the implications for commercial and sports fisheries on 
the St. Lawrence?  What are the implications for other uses of 
the river?  It is absolutely essential that the people who are 
presently using that area for its marine life be taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite by way of example a situation in my constituency.  We in 
Kootenay—Columbia are part of one of the major flyways for 
waterfowl that come from northern Canada and head south to the 
U.S. and further.  On the Columbia River are very delicate 
nesting areas.  We have to be very conscious of power boats being 
used in specific locations on the Columbia River, otherwise we 
would be really fouling up the waterfowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, last summer in particular several idiots on personal 
watercraft roared through some of these areas.  I cannot imagine 
what if anything was going through their heads.  The net result 
of these few people who chose not to use their brains, who were 
acting in a reckless and irresponsible way—there was only a 
handful of them—was that the B.C. ministry of environment 
suddenly slapped a 10-horsepower limit on an 80-mile stretch of 
the river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really flies in the teeth of the people in my constituency, 
the vast majority of whom are very responsible, the vast majority 
of whom choose to live there, as I do, because we respect the 
area and we respect nature.  Those people use the river 
responsibly.  Now, all of a sudden out of the clear blue sky, 
boom, a 10-horsepower motor limit. 
That kind of knee-jerk reaction by bureaucracy not only does not 
solve the problem but actually ends up seriously irritating 
responsible people.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that it does not really solve the problem?  If you 
could put a 10-horsepower motor on something like a canoe—which 
you could not do because you would sink it—and ran it full bore 
up the river, you would create as much damage as these personal 
watercraft are creating in these nesting areas.  The 
10-horsepower limit means nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, what are the implications for commercial and 
sports fisheries on the St. Lawrence as a result of this bill and 
particularly as a result of the overlay of park regulations? That 
is another question we must answer to our satisfaction to ensure 
that we do not end up doing things unnecessarily and making 
people angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 10 horsepower limit is seen by myself and many others like 
trying to kill a mosquito with a 10 pound sledgehammer.  It is 
unnecessary and would probably create more damage than was 
intended in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue.  Unfortunately because of the separatist 
aspirations of the BQ and PQ we must take into account what kind 
of implications this bill may have.  We cannot just say “It is 
all drafted and it looks fine”.  We must seriously examine what 
this bill means, what its implications could conceivably be 
relative to the relationship between the federal government and 
the government of the province of Quebec, particularly as long as 
the province of Quebec is represented by people who would break 
up this country.  We must be very careful with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, what precedents does this bill establish for future 
parks?  Probably more important, what precedents does it set for 
the establishment of other marine parks in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation does not happen in a vacuum.  Legislation works 
almost like an onion, layer upon layer.  For the people in the 
rest of Canada who may have a marine park brought forward in 
their area, we must be very careful to determine what precedents 
this bill establishes.  We cannot see the establishment of this 
park and the marine control in isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has already said there is a movement 
afoot—probably a good movement—to establish a full park system. 
If we do not take into account what happens on the west and 
north coasts as it relates to marine life and the use of that 
water by existing and potential future users, we would be making 
a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about a number of things.  We insist the 
committee go through these questions and other questions that 
will be raised by other members.  This will not be a committee 
rubber stamp process, nor do I expect it to be.  The 
parliamentary secretary, the secretary of state and the chairman 
of the heritage committee are fine gentlemen who will see to it 
that this is not a rubber stamp process and that we will have the 
opportunity, in a totally non-partisan way, to establish answers 
to some of the questions I have posed and hopefully some of the 
questions that other members will pose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because we do believe this is a good bill in principle, 
the Reform Party will support it at second reading.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to announce at the outset—and this will not come as 
a surprise either—that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 12, 1996, the governments of Quebec and Canada 
announced they were tabling a bill on the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park before the Quebec National Assembly and the House of Commons 
respectively, to implement the April 1990 agreement between the two 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the two ministers responsible for the bill, that is 
to say Canada's Minister of Canadian Heritage and Quebec's environment 
and wildlife minister, stressed how important their two bills were. 
While identical in many respects, these bills take into account each 
government's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These bills were Bill 86 in Quebec and Bill C-78 in Canada. They 
are aimed at enhancing the level of protection of the ecosystems in part 
of the Saguenay River fjord and the northern St. Lawrence estuary to 
ensure conservation, while at the same time promoting its use for 
educational, recreational and scientific purposes, for the benefit of 
present and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time these two bills were tabled, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage described the legislation as, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the result of several years of concerted efforts between the 
Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the hon. David Cliche, then Quebec's environment and 
wildlife minister, he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of the positive result of our consultations and are 
convinced we have met the expectations of the public and of the 
many partners who will be associated with a project of this 
magnitude. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What therefore was the purpose of the agreement that led to 
the establishment of this marine park, which is located in an 
internationally recognized tourist sector and which will boost an 
already strong and lasting tourist industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine park project was apparently launched in 1985.  On 
June 3, 1988, Canada and Quebec agreed that they should sit down 
together and talk about establishing a marine park in the Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties recognized, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance and the urgency of protecting and preserving 
for the present and for future generations the exceptional 
flora and fauna of the marine territory at the confluence of 
the Saguenay River and the northern half of the St. Lawrence 
estuary and of developing said flora and fauna. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was to be almost another two years before the two 
governments worked out an agreement, which they signed on April 6, 
1990.  Under this agreement, both governments undertook, within the 
limits of their constitutional authority, to cause to be passed 
legislative or regulatory measures for the purpose of, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[...] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) establishing a marine park to be known as the Saguenay 
Marine Park located at the confluence of the Saguenay River 
and the northern half of the St. Lawrence estuary; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) preserving the aquatic flora and fauna, and maintaining 
the integrity of ecosystems in this territory; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) protecting the territory and other resources; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) developing these resources for the benefit of present and 
future generations; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) creating public awareness of these resources. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this agreement created a joint committee that was 
to report to each government within six months of the signing of 
the agreement, in other words around October 1990, regarding the 
legislative or regulatory measures they should pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In article 2, the agreement set out the provisional boundaries 
of the Saguenay Marine Park and both governments gave themselves 
four months to agree on a detailed description of the park's 
provisional boundaries, and a maximum of nine months within which 
both governments would carry out a public consultation prior to 
defining the permanent boundaries of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 3 of the agreement confirmed the rights and 
authorities of each of the governments, which became, as it were, 
co-owners of the park. 
Thus, under this agreement, the Quebec government maintains ownership of 
the sea floor and of surface and subsurface resources, whereas the 
federal government continues to exercise its jurisdiction in matters 
including navigation and fisheries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in fact a first in Canada, since this park will be under 
joint federal-provincial management, and neither party will have to 
relinquish anything to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an increasing willingness to co-operate in the best interests 
of taxpayers who are always seeking an end to useless duplication and 
overlap, the two governments have agreed to harmonize their initiatives 
and the initiatives of their respective departments and agencies. They 
have even agreed, under article 4 of the agreement, to share present and 
future infrastructures, facilities and equipment in the marine park, 
provided that one of the governments makes such a request to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the two governments have created a committee with two 
representatives from each of the governments, whose task will be to find 
ways to further harmonize efforts. 
The committee's mandate is to harmonize initiatives by Canada and 
Quebec, especially in the areas of planning, research, management plan 
development and programming activities, consultation with concerned 
individuals and groups, integration of development efforts, arrangements 
for sharing existing and planned infrastructures, facilities, and 
equipment, scheduling, personnel exchanges, communications and 
organization of seminars, symposiums and exhibits, marine fauna and 
flora and public security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed marine park innovates in three main areas. To begin 
with, it is the first time in Quebec that a park is given the mission of 
protecting a marine environment. Furthermore, it is the first time that 
the governments of Canada and Quebec work together to establish a park. 
And finally, there has never before been such an innovative consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the 
fact that this project originated at the grassroots level and evolved to 
finally reach Parliament, contrary to numerous projects that are of a 
centralizing nature and that originate with the government and are 
imposed on the population. The Reform Party must be very pleased with 
this, because the establishment of this park reflects exactly what the 
population of this region wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a broad outline of the consultation process. 
In December 1990, the two governments held joint public hearings to 
determine the park's boundaries. Following that, they set up an advisory 
committee including representatives from the regional county 
municipalities affected by the project, from the scientific community, 
from the Quebec union for the conservation of nature and from the 
coalition for the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the committee was to advise planners on, first, the 
way the park project was perceived in the area and, second, the content 
of a development proposal.  The committee and the representatives of the 
ministers concerned were able to bring to the fore the issues involved 
and to show the interest the people had for a marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1993, both governments made public the boundaries of the 
park and announced at the same time public consultations on the 
development proposal.  Two months later, at the end of the 
consultations, the governments had received 63 submissions which were 
thoroughly reviewed.  A report was submitted in December 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments had everything they needed to prepare the master 
plan for the marine park, which was released at the beginning of 1996. 
This major consultation effort produced at least two changes: the name 
was changed from Saguenay Marine Park to Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park and the area covered went from 746 square kilometres to 1,138 
square kilometres, almost double the original area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After more than 10 years of talks and negotiations between the 
governments in Ottawa and Quebec, the National Assembly made the project 
official on June 5, 1997, by passing Bill 86 which had been introduced 
on December 12, 1996.  However, the Quebec legislation will only come 
into force once Bill C-7 receives royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-78, which was introduced in the House of Commons in 
December 1996 at the same time as the bill in Quebec City, met with a 
very different fate. Last April, during the 35th Parliament, the Bloc 
Quebecois, which at the time was the official opposition, feeling it was 
becoming increasingly obvious that the Prime Minister was going to ask 
the Governor General to prorogue the House and call a general election, 
made representations on several occasions to the government to speed up 
the process and pass the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as 
quickly as possible before the general election. Instead, the government 
chose to let it die on the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long awaited Bill C-7 before the House today at second reading 
is the result of many years of joint efforts on the part of the 
governments of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park provided 
for in this bill is also the result of the co-operation between the many 
organizations already active in surrounding areas, local and regional 
communities, environmental groups, native peoples and the scientific 
community. Thanks to this co-operation, they were able to set joint 
objectives for the management and protection of the area's rich and 
diverse marine resources, particularly to better protect an endangered 
species, the beluga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management plan tabled in February 1996, after extensive public 
consultation, mentions the existence of a consensus on the conservation 
of marine ecosystems and the development of the park. The Canadian and 
Quebec acts creating the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park are mirror 
images. Both pieces of legislation have the same objectives, namely the 
conservation and development of the marine environment. 
The two bills complement each other, without losing sight of the 
constitutional jurisdiction of each level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into detail, I will recall the main elements of the 
bill as outlined in the summary. This bill creates the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park. It will be the first federal-provincial salt water 
marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sets out the role the federal government will have to play, 
mainly with respect to managing the park in conjunction with the 
Government of Quebec. 
However, a provision in the bill allows the minister responsible for 
Parks Canada to enter into agreements with the other levels of 
government or with organizations, if this is necessary to insure maximum 
effectiveness in establishing innovative partnerships that will help 
achieve management objectives for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It implements the 1990 federal-provincial agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deals with the water column within the park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for joint management of the parks and the 
creation of committees for that purpose. Among other things, the 
governments will jointly establish a harmonization committee to 
coordinate their respective planning and management activities. 
The legislation also provides for the creation of a co-ordinating 
committee, which will give members of the community the opportunity to 
participate in the improvement of the protection measures and the 
promotional activities for the park.  That co-ordinating structure 
involves both levels of governments, the regional stakeholders and the 
band council of the Essipit Montagnais.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the management framework included in the management 
plan published jointly by both governments under the title “Crossroads 
of Life, Site of Exchanges, Wellspring of Riches” states that this plan 
has created a co-ordination zone. The document defines that zone as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine park territory and the surrounding regions form the 
co-ordination zone. 
Besides the territory of the park itself, the zone stretches from 
Chicoutimi to Tadoussac and includes all municipalities bordering 
the fjord.  Along the north shore of the St. Lawrence, the co-ordination 
zone stretches from Saint-Fidèle-de-Mont-Murray to Les 
Escoumins and includes the territory of the Essipit aboriginal 
community.  On the south shore, municipalities along the estuary 
from Kamouraska to Trois-Pistoles are part of the zone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-ordinating committee will be composed as follows: one 
representative for each of the north shore regional county 
municipalities adjacent to the marine park, that is Charlevoix-Est, 
Fjord-du-Saguenay and Haute-Côte-Nord; one representative only for the 
three south shore regional county municipalities concerned by the park, 
that is Kamouraska, Les Basques and Rivière-du-Loup; one representative 
of the scientific community; one representative of the groups concerned 
with resource conservation and preservation as well as with education in 
natural environment and its interpretation; one representative of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage; and one representative of the Quebec 
Department of Environment and Wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires that management plans be prepared and laid before 
Parliament. It provides that a management plan shall be laid before 
Parliament within one year after the establishment of the park. 
Afterwards, the management plan will have to be reviewed at least once 
every seven years and laid before Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates a procedure for changing park boundaries. As 
presently provided, its territory contains 1,138 square kilometres and 
covers a representative part of the marine environment of the fjord and 
the estuary. This territory includes the Saguenay River from the mouth 
of the river up to Cap de l'Est, located about 40 kilometres east of 
Chicoutimi, as well as the north estuary of the St. Lawrence River from 
Gros Cap à l'Aigle, located about 10 kilometres east of the town of the 
same name, up to Pointe Rouge or Les Escoumins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boundaries could be changed by order in council, provided that 
the Government of Quebec has given its approval and that both ministers 
of both levels of government have jointly consulted the public on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that, in this bill, the public is 
directly involved in the management of the park, since both the federal 
and the provincial minister must encourage the people to take part in 
the development of the park's policies and management plan and in the 
examination of all major related issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill reaffirms the protection of natural and cultural resources 
and of the park's ecosystems. Is also includes measures to protect the 
health and safety of all visitors inside the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also stipulates the offences and penalties for every 
person who contravenes this legislation or its regulations. It gives the 
park wardens the same powers of arrest granted peace officers in the 
Criminal Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will complement existing federal legislation that could be 
affected by its provisions, such as the Fisheries Act, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, 
and the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is quite clear. All resource exploration and development 
activities in mining and energy production will be prohibited within the 
park's boundaries. Oil and gas pipelines and power lines will also be 
prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill describes clearly all the management and planning 
activities that will be necessary for proper operation of the park. The 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park will benefit the whole area. Local 
residents will be provided with the means to conserve this area, and its 
flora and fauna. 
The park will generate jobs in the areas of nature conservation, site 
development, territory protection and tourist industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the development phase, there will be jobs in infrastructure 
construction and site development. Scientists will certainly contribute 
to the supervision of environmental aspects of this work. In the longer 
term, there will be job creation for conservation officers involved in 
the protection of the park and the security of visitors, for employees 
in charge of the maintenance of the park and its various sites, and 
interpreters to help visitors enjoy the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine park will be a new attraction that will bring new 
tourists in this area and keep those who had already been going there 
for a longer period. These tourists will generate new benefits for the 
accommodation industry, restaurants, and cultural and leisure 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this park will especially help preserve, for 
future generations, a precious and unique regional ecosystem that is 
found nowhere else in Quebec or in Canada. It is Heritage Canada's job, 
through Parks Canada, to assign resources to the protection of the 
environment, just as Quebec's environment and wildlife department does 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always been protective of its territory and has always 
reluctantly accepted to let Canada settle on its land. Today, the 
Department of Canadian Heritage has given Parks Canada the mandate to 
manage two national parks in Quebec, Forillon and la Mauricie; a 
national park reserve, the Mingan Islands; four navigable historic 
canals; 21 historic sites; and a development program of approximately a 
hundred commemorative plaques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its environment and wildlife department, the Government of 
Quebec already manages 50 ecological reserves and 17 parks, and it has 
reserved 18 territories in the north with the intention of turning them 
into parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the issue before the House today, the Government of Quebec has 
worked in good faith with the Government of Canada because it wanted to 
establish this park, because it did not want to give up any rights—the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park does fall under the jurisdiction 
of both governments—and, consequently, the government could not act 
alone. It had to act in co-operation with the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if Quebec were a sovereign state, the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park would probably have been established by now. 
The establishment of a new partnership with the Government of Canada 
meant that the Government of Quebec had to initiate a whole process of 
discussion, of consultation, of co-ordination and of planning before 
going ahead with this marine park. 
If Quebec had acted alone in creating this park, there would certainly 
have been less discussion, less compromise, no jurisdictional problems 
and, most of all, no need to wait for Ottawa to pass this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, for now, Quebec is still part of Canada. The adoption of this 
bill will allow Quebec to go ahead with the joint project to create a 
marine park and to recover some of the tax money it pays each year to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon my colleagues from all parties to co-operate in order 
to ensure speedy passage of Bill C-7, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to read another excerpt from the 
management plan to which I was referring earlier. 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park is a product of the richness and 
diversity of its natural and cultural components as well as the interest 
expressed by the public in their increased protection—. Today, our 
society is looking to renew its interest in the marine environment and 
all the memories it holds. Like yesterday's explorers and hunters, 
today's visitors relive the excitement of an encounter with marine 
mammals; they become image hunters. A good look at the long-term human 
intervention in the area of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park will 
reveal the importance of the marine ecosystem in humanity's heritage. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very proud today to rise on behalf of my 
constituents of Sackville—Eastern Shore to declare the New 
Democratic Party's support in principle for Bill C-7, an act to 
establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding the significance of our natural surroundings 
affects our very lives and livelihood.  Our streams, rivers, 
lakes, forests and agricultural lands provide sustenance to all 
who reside there.  Whether it is the citizens in the north or the 
citizens in the south, the need to maintain and preserve the 
ecosystem is a belief shared by everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Liberal government's effort to fulfil at least one 
election promise made to Canadians. I am pleased that the 
proposed legislation will enable all Canadians the opportunity to 
visit and enjoy another jewel in our country's natural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 is the reincarnation of Bill C-78 tabled late in the 
35th Parliament which died on the Order Paper with the 
dissolution of Parliament.  Its reintroduction is a continuation 
of the effort which began in the 1970s when the need for marine 
life protection along the St. Lawrence achieved national 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disgraceful state of the river at the time was best 
signified by the dead and dying St. Lawrence beluga whales 
washing ashore.  Toxic contaminants from upriver sources have 
been identified as the primary culprit. The establishment of a 
marine park it is hoped will assist in the recovery of this 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rich diversity of marine life found at the confluence of the 
Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence River supports many species 
and is visited each summer by blue whales, fin whales, minke 
whales and on occasion by humpback and sperm whales.  The whales 
represent the top of the park's marine food chain and efforts to 
correct the damage to this area inflicted by man deserve our 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another fact which may be overlooked.  Millions of 
people depend upon the waters of the St. Lawrence for drinking 
water, recreational and employment purposes.  Given the 
endangered state of the St. Lawrence beluga, a victim of outdated 
practices and environmental impacts, the risk to people is 
acknowledged. The requirement for the protection of this 
ecosystem becomes an absolute necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance of the establishment of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park goes beyond the benefits of this ecosystem. 
It is a hallmark in intergovernmental co-operation.  The process 
to guarantee the conversion of an acknowledged jewel involved the 
active participation and conciliation between the governments of 
Canada and Quebec.  Both levels agreed upon a need to correct the 
errors of the past and to proceed with a common purpose to 
achieve a noble end, the protection and preservation of this 
marine ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both levels agreed to honour their respective jurisdictions. 
Throughout the years which followed, they discussed, consulted 
and overcame adversity. On June 5, 1997 the proposed legislation 
received Quebec legislature assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The degree of public participation and input must also be 
recognized. 
The communities were consulted.  Aboriginal participation was 
ensured.  We hope that the co-ordinating committee, a key 
component toward the park's success, will continue the spirit of 
goodwill to provide input and direction that is both productive 
and proactive. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fine example of how the public consultation principle can be 
incorporated into a decision making process occurred when all 
parties agreed to expand the park boundaries from 746 square 
kilometres to 1,138 square kilometres. Environmental groups and 
marine scientists for the most part were acknowledged and 
listened to beyond political agendas or preferences of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process will not end with Parliament's assent.  A new stage 
begins:  the definition and implementation of the management 
plan. The management plan will define the ability for the 
ecosystem to survive, to thrive and to provide a sustainable use 
of the natural resources.  There are several concerns that 
various stakeholders have expressed on proposed management plans, 
parameters and restrictions.  I look forward to raising these 
important considerations at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the co-operation shown throughout the years 
can continue at committee and the matters related to a 
successful, sustainable marine park management plan specific to 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence area will be included for final 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is agreement between all proponents that it is imperative 
to establish the park for the belugas, for the hundreds of marine 
species, for the preservation and enjoyment of future 
generations.  There is agreement between many proponents that to 
ensure this principle's success, several basic standards are 
absent from the proposed legislation as written today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is very little language in Bill C-7 referring to the 
conservation mandate of the park and Parks Canada.   A suggestion 
from the World Wildlife Fund, active proponents and contributors 
to this process, is the strengthening of the language in the 
preamble and the purpose of the bill.  The park is being created 
not just to protect but to conserve and maintain the integrity of 
the natural ecosystems within the park's boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the initial 
impetus to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park came 
out of the efforts to protect and recover the beluga whale 
population living in that region.  Perhaps we should ask why 
there is no mention of species at risk.  Through the years this 
can be interpreted as a basic oversight easily corrected by 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a second sentence can be added to the purpose of 
the bill or to the preamble to the effect that “this will be 
done by preserving and maintaining the natural ecosystems within 
the park boundaries, and in particular by protecting and aiding 
the recovery of species and populations designated as at risk”. 
Fine words written by our friends and a principal tenet I am 
proud to refer to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents have requested that the bill should include the Parks 
Canada guiding principles to be used as the definitive reference 
to guide park operations.  Proponents have requested that some of 
the zone one areas, those areas deemed as vital for integral 
preservation, be expanded. Concerns on a complete ban on bottom 
trawling to prevent the disturbance of contaminated sediments 
which will cause further ecological damage is proposed also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone to this park's sustainable success will be 
restrictions on recreational and commercial impacts upon breeding 
areas and other areas in this region deemed as critical for 
marine life preservation.  We believe a balance can be struck to 
ensure the economic benefits gained by the surrounding 
communities through ecotourism initiatives.  We believe that the 
environment and jobs are not inconsistent when managed wisely in 
a sustainable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has evolved over many years.  I am confident that 
any conflicts or differing views in management plan procedures 
can be addressed at committee.  A national marine conservation 
areas policy is in its infancy.  Although a national marine parks 
policy was produced over a decade ago, a lack of practical 
experience has led to a continuing study and consultation period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada is recognized internationally for its professional 
standards, its high degree of determination to ensure the 
conservation and preservation of Canada's national parks.  It is 
truly to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of our wilderness areas is often thought of in 
terrestrial terms, semi-closed ecosystems which have defined 
components based on specific locations and limited outside 
impacts.  There are Jasper, Gros Morne, Wood Buffalo, Fundy, 
Kluane, La Mauricie, Grasslands, Prince Albert, Cape Breton 
Highlands and over 20 other national parks in this fine country. 
Banff, the original jewel, was established in 1885. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we refer to committee another effort to preserve a part of 
our national heritage for future generations.   There is a 
significant difference between the proposed Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park and this country's efforts across the past century. 
However, I must explain to my colleagues the responsibilities we 
accept today are on behalf of all Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation recognizes the respect for alternate 
jurisdictions and I join my colleagues to commend the fine degree 
of co-operation demonstrated by the federal and Quebec 
governments toward this noble cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's responsibilities will include the 
overlying water column and exercising its legislative jurisdiction 
over marine resources and maritime transportation activities in 
this territory. The Quebec government retains administration for 
the seabed and subsoil resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water column is the fundamental component for this park's 
success. The water column is a transportation medium for the 
pollutants which contribute to the near demise of the St. 
Lawrence belugas.  The water column is a fluid highway that 
delivers the outfalls and ecosystem degradation from a distant 
point to impact upon our best intentions and efforts which will 
determine a recovery or loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park will 
require close co-operation and collaboration across many 
jurisdictional boundaries. There will be a new era of scientific 
and educational unity which cannot be destroyed by political 
interference or self-serving agendas of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water column has the capacity to transport the nutrients and 
support requirements for the regeneration of this area. Through 
conscious efforts to conserve and maintain the integrity of the 
marine ecosystems within the park's boundaries we have the 
opportunity to improve and contribute to the betterment of 
adjacent and distant regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of the proposed park will require an effective 
management plan and I agree with the concerns raised by my 
colleagues on behalf of concerned Canadians and international 
organizations.  In addition to the aforementioned concerns and 
comments we must accept the responsibility which is this and 
future governments' duty to ensure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans must commit to a 
comprehensive monitoring program in the park.  The department 
must commit to acting in a responsible and co-operative manner. 
This responsibility will include the budget allocation for 
adequate personnel and sufficient equipment to fulfil 
jurisdiction requirements. This responsibility will include a 
comprehensive emergency spill contingency plan and a capability 
for effective implementation. This responsibility will include 
swift response and acceptable enforcement measures on those 
occasions when deleterious and detrimental impacts from beyond 
park boundaries are identified. This responsibility will include 
first and foremost the capacity and sincerity to act within park 
boundaries to ensure the park's success to maintain and preserve 
the marine ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a balance can be struck to ensure the economic 
benefits which can be attained through ecotourism initiatives. I 
believe that jobs and the environment are not inconsistent when 
managed in a wise and sustainable manner.  However, the pursuit 
of one must not damage the effort of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada has stated that an integral component for the 
success and sustainability of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park is the expected tourist income from whale watching 
operations.  The first test of this government's sincerity for 
marine protection will arise during the definition and 
restriction phase of management plan parameters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a balance can be struck to affirm long term recovery and 
park viability.  However, the concerns raised by the scientific 
community cannot be ignored or misrepresented as has been done in 
the recent past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park can succeed if it is 
memories and photographs which are harvested, not the marine 
inhabitants.  Without conscientious efforts to balance tourism 
and the protection and perhaps the expansion of zone 1 areas 
within the park we will end up without marine inhabitants to 
present to tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of one marine scientist we must avoid the project 
becoming “Disney does Beluga”.  I am confident that such 
concerns will be presented at committee and acted upon with 
foresight and objective considerations.  I am pleased to join my 
colleagues across both sides of the House in support to refer 
this bill in principle to committee for final review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our children's future I encourage all my colleagues on both 
sides of this House and in the Quebec legislature to support not 
only this bill but other environmental initiatives that protect 
the future for our children.  On behalf of the New Democratic 
caucus I am pleased to offer my support to referring this bill to 
committee for final review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
just listened to the previous speaker and I am very pleased that he 
approves of Bill C-7, since it is a bill that has its roots in an 
enhanced community consciousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also listened to my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis, who 
explained the mechanisms that will enable local and regional 
authorities to remain actively involved in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already said, and will repeat it here in this House, 
for it is a statement that comes from the heart: my roots are in 
the Bas-du-Fleuve, the lower St. Lawrence, Kamouraska to be 
precise.  This bill touches me particularly, therefore, in some 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much reference to the beluga, but there is also 
much to be said for the beauty of the whales that frequent this 
region, to the delight of visitors. Obviously the population 
density is such that, as there is as yet no recognized park, we 
have visitors who are passing through. But once the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park has been established, I imagine still more 
will come to enjoy the beauty, dare I say the ecstacy, of this 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been reference to the beluga and it must also be 
pointed out in this context that the presence of visitors must be 
properly managed if we want to still have these animals around and 
to be able to observe them.  In the past, and this may be what has 
raised people's awareness, there has been abuse, or at least there 
have been problems in regulating who would show visitors around. 
Now I believe this is a thing of the past, and we will no longer 
have such abuse, once there is a regulated park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for environmental standards was also mentioned in the 
speeches.  I think we have no choice but to tighten environmental 
standards if we are to keep and increase marine animal populations. 
On this subject, people speak of the mouth of the Saguenay. 
However, there is an extraordinary population of marine animals and 
birds along the shore, by Kamouraska.  They have already been 
studied by professors from Laval University and must be preserved. 
This area too has hardly been touched and is largely unknown by the 
public, but interest has been shown in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
Marine Park in developing this aspect and making it more widely 
known.  The Kamouraska archipelago is populated by wild migratory 
birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final point has not been raised.  I am speaking of the 
culture of algae, which is part of the ecosystem and perhaps a part 
of the future. 
On the coasts of Norway and of Europe, people have come to live on, 
use and speak of marine algae.  These people, who enjoy working 
with algae, are delighted by the number and variety of algae on the 
rocks of the Kamouraska archipelago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, which are partly emotional, I admit, 
and partly for the pleasure of tourists, I am delighted at the co-operation 
between the governments of Quebec and Canada on Bill C-7, 
and I invite all members of this House to support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, again I echo the 
comments of my colleague from Quebec. I reiterate that Bill C-7 
is an example of what can happen when federal and provincial 
jurisdictions get together to work with a co-operative nature, 
not just for the marine park for the Saguenay—St. Lawrence but 
also in areas off the coasts of Nova Scotia, Îles de la 
Madeleine, British Columbia and in our various Great Lakes.  It 
is an example of what we can do when we have a vision of the 
future, of what we can do not only to protect other species but 
to protect ourselves as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A true testament of man is not what we have left for our 
children in terms of finances and the type of homes they live in. 
If we see species in our realm today will our children be able 
to witness them as well?  I know my great grandparents read about 
things like the passenger pigeon which is no longer available. 
We in our lifetimes in this House will never get to see such a 
beautiful creature.

sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Chicoutimi who, I am 
proud to say, has been involved with this project since its 
inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is not the first time I rise to speak in this 
House, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters 
of West Nova for having placed their faith in me.  I will do my 
utmost to bring their concerns forward during this 36th 
Parliament and beyond. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an honour for me to be sitting in this House with 
members from all regions of the country. After only two months in this 
House, I have a deeper appreciation for this great country and a new 
respect for the diversity of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Acadian from St. Marys Bay, I am very proud to represent a 
riding where anglophones and francophones have been living together for 
hundreds of years, and where the sea always played a key role in the 
lives of its inhabitants. 
Our ancestors, whether English, French, Scottish, Irish or German, all 
lived off the fisheries in one way or another. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having two distinct or unique marine areas in our backyard, it 
is difficult to think of a marine park and not be reminded of 
western Nova Scotia.  Having grown up on the shores of the 
majestic Atlantic Ocean and the world renowned Bay of Fundy, the 
preservation of our marine ecosystem is very important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada, it is an honour 
for me to speak in support of Bill C-7, an act to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may be aware, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park 
is part of a larger effort to protect Canada's marine 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the PC government approved the national marine park's 
policy.  In 1987 the country's first national marine conservation 
area known as Fathom Five in Georgian Bay was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the government signed a federal-provincial agreement 
with the province of British Columbia to create a national marine 
conservation area at Gwaii Haanas in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 6, 1990 the Progressive Conservative government signed 
a historical and unique agreement between Canada and Quebec to 
create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay fiord and 
the St. Lawrence estuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal-provincial agreement represented years of 
co-ordinated conservation effort, and for the first time the two 
levels of government had jointly agreed to establish a park and 
to co-ordinate their park activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 is a mirror act to bill 86 which was passed by the 
Quebec legislature last year.  Our government also called for the 
creation of an additional four marine conservation areas by the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Chicoutimi will attest to, there is much 
work involved in establishing a marine park.  There are various 
components that need to be examined. Above and beyond preserving 
the marine ecosystem of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence, there are 
impacts such as tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that terrestrial parks brought in large numbers of 
tourists, and therefore it was safe to assume that there would be 
an influx of tourism to this community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government consulted the local residents who would be 
impacted, and we are happy to see that this government has 
continued this consultative approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two very constructive rounds of public consultations were 
conducted.  The first took place in December 1990 regarding the 
boundaries of the park.  This marked the first time the proposed 
boundaries of a park had been increased.  Local residents wanted 
a larger protected area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second round of public consultations to be carried out by 
the Progressive Conservative government was held in June 1993 to 
consider a development plan for the park.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the more people you consult the more ideas are 
brought forward.  More ideas often bring more changes and it 
takes time to make changes to a document.  What I find dismaying 
is that it took the government this long to finally approve the 
management plan for the marine park and to bring forward this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Canadian heritage minister of the day introduced the 
national marine conservation areas policy.  This was followed up 
by the national marine conservation areas system plan in 1995. 
This plan would divide Canada's three oceans and great lakes into 
29 distinct marine conservation areas or NMCAs.  In typical 
Liberal style of environmental one-upmanship, the government set 
a goal for itself of establishing 10 such marine parks by the 
year 2000. To date there are three marine parks on the Canada 
Parks map but only Fathom Five is a legal entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December of 1996 the government introduced Bill C-78, an act 
to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park and to make a 
consequential amendment to another act.  The government must have 
thought it was moving too quickly on this and called an early 
election, effectively killing Bill C-78.  Finally, here we are in 
November 1997 with Bill C-7, which is essentially identical to 
Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock is ticking.  As we approach the millennium we cannot 
afford to waste any more time in this very urgent matter.  With 
less than three years to go, we have yet to establish a marine 
park in each region, let alone the 10 parks promised by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must adopt this legislation as soon as possible.  I look 
forward to dealing with the specifics of the bill when it goes to 
committee, as well as examining the feasibility of other NMCAs. 
I am very excited by the prospect of establishing other marine 
parks, especially in the Bay of Fundy and off the Scotian Shelf. 
Aside from the obvious benefits of preserving the ecological 
integrity of our marine life, marine parks would increase tourism 
and create much needed jobs for the people of my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with you a small story.  In spending some 
time in the waters off Nova Scotia, specifically off Briar Island 
while doing some sailing, I have had the opportunity of seeing 
the majestic whales that many tourists from across the world come 
to see.  I see this as a perfect opportunity to protect this 
environment and make it better than it is at this point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with this government toward achieving the 
main objective of the marine park, which is to preserve our marine 
environment for the present and future generations to enjoy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
a question for the member in regard to the establishment of these 
marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one plan a number of years ago for my riding of 
Charlotte.  It was referred to as the Fundy Isles Marine Park. It 
was to include areas of Campobello Island, Deer Island, Grand 
Manan and the surrounding area.  One of the concerns expressed at 
the time was the question of the marine park versus the 
traditional fisheries and what impact that would have on 
traditional fishing areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, would lobster fishermen be restricted in the areas 
they could trap lobster, or scallop draggers restricted? This 
collision between the park and the traditional fisheries was 
there.  It was a major obstacle at that time. 
Other matters had to be taken into consideration as well the 
debate between fisheries and park officials about the park 
concept, somewhat like the debate which is taking place this very 
day between the aquaculture fisheries and the traditional 
fisheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Has consideration been given to that?  And is it being debated 
at the local level in Nova Scotia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>   Madam Speaker, the comments I made 
regarding looking into a marine park for the areas I described 
were on a preliminary basis.  The points the hon. member raises 
are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A park could not be developed without consultations because it 
is another very important aspect of our economy. Without those 
consultations there would be dangers.  I would say very strongly 
that anything of that nature taking place would be as a result of 
consultations with all parties. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, let me point out 
that my primary reason for rising today is to thank all stakeholders in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is indeed a wonderful day not only for myself but also for 
the people I have the honour of representing. After a dozen years of 
efforts, work and consultations, the government finally agreed to 
designate land located in the heart of my riding as a national marine 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to thank the majority, if not the vast majority of my 
colleagues from all parties, who, so far, have supported this bill to 
formalize the establishment of a national marine park. 
I also wish to thank the ministers, who, one after the other, have 
brought this project to completion. I would like to acknowledge in 
particular the contribution of former federal minister McMillan, who, in 
1985, launched the co-operative effort with the Quebec government then 
in office, including then minister Clifford Lincoln, who is now the 
Liberal member for Lac-Saint-Louis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank them all for their valuable help in developing and then 
selling the project to both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not thank all the stakeholders in the 
vast region affected by the establishment of the marine park, including 
the municipalities that helped promote the idea of this marine park, 
which was probably the park that underwent the largest consultation 
process ever held in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank all the mayors who testified, and also the 
representatives of economic and environmental organizations who did the 
likewise to help further a project which is a model of co-operation 
between the various levels of government and which is the result of the 
positive contribution made by all the community organizations that have 
helped, during the past 12 years, to build the case for the 
establishment of this national marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many investments have been made in recent years by various research 
centres, for analysis and research work on fauna and flora, with a view 
to establish the marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected on June 2, 1997 because I told my fellow citizens I 
was not going to come here and pretend to be representing them, pretend 
to be upset on a daily basis. I am here to promote issues that will 
benefit my region, which is severely affected by major economic 
problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the action plan on the national marine park will be 
revealed soon. We hope that specific measures will be announced, 
especially to increase as quickly as possible the number of visitors to 
the area. We know that the Tadoussac-Baie-Sainte-Catherine area receives 
between 200,000 and 300,000 visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the action plan, which will focus on economic 
development and the need to increase tourist traffic, will be sensitive 
to the needs of local communities and provide for new facilities that 
will accommodate a growing number of visitors to our region, especially 
by building in close cooperation with the Quebec government a highway 
between Baie-Sainte-Catherine and Petit-Saguenay so that visitors will 
not have to drive through Saint-Siméon to get to the fjord and the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are sites that need to be promoted and made more 
accessible. 
I refer in particular to an extraordinary site, which is known 
nationally and almost all over the world, namely Cap Trinité, where the 
population is aging and where it is becoming increasingly difficult for 
people to reach the cape which is located 350 metres above sea level and 
which is probably one of the most unique and extraordinary observation 
sites in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that when the government will reveal its action 
plan, it will be possible at that time to provide input and suggestions 
for the development of infrastructures that will allow the region to 
benefit from increased tourist traffic. An increased number of visitors 
will bring more jobs and economic development. So this is important for 
the whole region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of money will be invested over three years, and we are very 
pleased with this. 
You can rest assured that our regional organizations will follow very 
closely the implementation of the action plan by the two levels of 
government and that the member from Chicoutimi, as he has always done 
since 1984, will play a positive role in improving the action plan so 
that the money to be invested will contribute to the economy of the area 
and of all the communities along the St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is obviously not a good day to engage in partisan politics. I 
would like to thank the minister for her kind words for the member from 
Chicoutimi who, since 1984, has worked on the development of this 
wonderful project. People say that hard work is its own reward. Often 
this work is done quietly, not always in front of the cameras, but today 
is indeed a great day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to point out that back then, our government had a 
very substantial agenda. 
It was substantial environmentally with the acid rain treaty.  It 
was also substantial from a trade point of view with the free trade 
agreement, which enabled us to increase our exports to the U.S. by 
140%.  In addition, it was substantial with respect to fiscal 
reform, particularly with the passage of the GST, the ultimate 
purpose of which was to lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government will also be listening with a view 
to finalizing tax reform, so that all our constituents will benefit 
and see their taxes go down and their employment insurance premiums 
decrease, because back then—I think we must give credit where 
credit is due—there were reforms, there were bills introduced by 
a government with a vision based on structural measures, which are 
now helping us to control the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am obviously very happy to take part in the vote today on 
this bill that, with the support of my regional constituents, I set 
in motion.  Several ridings are affected.  I thank everyone who 
played a role in this wonderful project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured that, in the decades to come, we will not regret 
having created this national marine park, which enables us to 
preserve all living things in our environment, but also to promote 
the economic development of a region sorely in need of assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to speak this morning on Bill C-7, the 
Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that this bill was first 
introduced by Mr. Bouchard when he was Minister of the Environment in 
this House in 1990, at the time of the “beau risque”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind honourable members that it is the premier of 
Quebec who sponsored the bill and the recent agreement between the 
federal and the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on our parks, particularly those in Quebec 
and especially this one. 
Quebeckers, like all other Canadians, love the outdoors. This park will 
be an important tool for tourism development in our region and an 
essential facility for learning about marine life in our province and 
especially in the beautiful Saguenay River, which is almost comparable 
in terms of size and water flow to the great St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One interesting feature of this bill is that it was initiated by 
ordinary people. Local people consulted each other in order to develop 
this provincial asset. Local people, with the help of the provincial and 
federal governments, came together to create an essential facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most interestingly, even today the agreement signed provides that 
the marine park will be administered by local people. Naturally, the 
committee will also be composed of a federal representative, a 
provincial representative, as well as representatives of the surrounding 
municipalities and RCMs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new marine park—which I invite you to visit—will be not 
only a tourist attraction but also a protected area for fish from our 
ocean and our river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all my Bloc colleagues, I support Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to point out—I 
think I mentioned it—that several provincial and federal ministers 
worked on this project in succession and that they all did a very good 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1985 to 1988, federal minister McMillan worked very hard on 
this project in cooperation with Mr. Lincoln, who was then Quebec's 
Minister of the Environment. Out of this came out the St. Lawrence 
action plan and the first millions of dollars to be invested in the 
national marine park project. Mr. Bouchard worked on the project in 
1990, followed by Mr. Charest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that today, we must pay homage to our Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. At the risk of infringing on our rules, I will use her name, 
Sheila Copps. She put the final touches on the bill. 
Those are the words she used this morning to officially confirm that the 
project is now official.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
immediately after my appointment as Quebec's Minister of the 
Environment in 1985, I was visited by two young people, a young 
woman named Léone Pippard and a young man named Bruce MacKay of 
Greenpeace.  This was the first time anyone spoke to me of the idea 
of having a Saguenay Marine Park.  Léone Pippard had been 
monitoring and researching the beluga in the St. Lawrence from a 
base on Île-aux-Coudres.  These two represented a broad range of 
people in the community, scientists and politicians who wanted a 
marine park in the Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, when the federal-provincial agreement was signed 
between the Conservative government of the time and the Government 
of Quebec, the preliminary St. Lawrence plan for 1988-93 earmarked 
$10 million for the establishment of the Saguenay Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate 
those who have been involved over the years in this undertaking of 
such importance, above and beyond political lines: the member for 
Chicoutimi, who gave it its first impetus in many ways, certainly 
in the political arena; Minister Tom McMillan, of the 
Conservatives, who joined in and who signed the 1988 agreement with 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting about this undertaking is that it started 
with the signing of an agreement between a Conservative federal 
government and a Liberal provincial government in Quebec, and now 
it being finalized by a Liberal government in Ottawa and a Parti 
Quebecois government in Quebec.  This is, therefore, an undertaking 
that goes beyond party lines, that rises far above the political 
bickering we see, unfortunately, all too often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a year for this project to come to fruition, to make 
the thing a reality soon with Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay marine park is an exceptional achievement.  It is 
one of the first marine parks in Canada, many would say the biggest 
to date.  It is the result of a unique form of co-operation between 
two levels of government—those of Quebec and Canada—which 
managed to align and complement their respective, complex 
jurisdictions.  It took a lot of negotiations to achieve an 
agreement that reflects both the integrity of the jurisdictions and 
the idea of working together to make them complementary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park stands for environmental protection, conservation 
and most importantly education and scientific research. 
The extraordinary thing, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, 
is that this park is the product of co-operation and perhaps the 
most extensive consultation done on a project in Canada for a very 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a long drawn-out process, a federal-provincial 
agreement that established the interdepartmental groups that pulled 
the project together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, consultation was expanded.  All the groups involved 
were given the basic ideas to work on in order to improve the 
original project, to define the context of the Saguenay marine park 
as well as the guidelines, the regulations and the final 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the two governments involved, there was a 
master plan for the marine park, expressing people's desire to work 
together to develop the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence 
estuary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this park stands for environmental protection, public 
education, scientific research, and sustainable and harmonious land use. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the management plan defines the physical boundaries of 
the park.  Within these boundaries not only are the two levels of 
government working together but the aboriginal communities as 
well.  They have been consulted and have been very much a part of 
the project and will continue to be along with the local 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the defining elements of the park is the constitution of 
a co-ordinating committee.  It is the first time in Canada that 
two governments have worked very closely together with their 
community organizations to form a co-ordinating committee which 
will be entrusted with the management of the park.  This in 
itself represents a tremendous departure from the usual 
stereotype where governments decide and run everything.  This 
will truly be a community project where the government is a 
partner willing to share, listen and help when necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selection of a site is not an accident.  As my colleague 
from Chicoutimi knows far better than I do, this is one of the 
most beautiful and breathtaking sites in Canada or anywhere for 
that matter.  It is the harbour of 54 species of vertebrates and 
248 species of invertebrates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When consultations were extended in 1993 we decided to look at 
the use of that park. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much more complicated to draw up a zoning plan for a marine 
park than one for land environments. Today, the management plan will 
include this zoning plan as well as a tourist route crossing three 
marine ecosystems. This in itself is quite a challenge and shows great 
promise for the future of a kind of sustainable development that will 
make the use of this exceptional marine environment possible, to develop 
a tourist attraction that will greatly benefit the local economy, while 
at the same time incorporating a fairly strong element of public 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park is a model for the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a wonderful model for the future because of its 
composition and because of the way various community groups and 
interveners of all types have joined in the work in this regard. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is in line with the recommendations made by the auditor 
general in his report on Canadian parks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It follows the thrust of the famous Bow Valley study and the 
recommendation of the auditor general's report that the first 
requirement for any park is to ensure its ecological integrity. 
The ecological integrity is the very essence, the very heart of a 
park.  Without ecological integrity all the rest dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need education and that depends on the ecological integrity 
of a park.  We need tourism and that depends on the proper 
ecological use of a park. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 5, 1997, the Government of Quebec passed Bill 86, which 
legislated the establishment of this marine park. We needed to do the 
same on our side. Unfortunately, the election delayed things, but today 
Bill C-7 is finally before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a number of conclusions should be drawn from this project. 
First, successful co-operation among all stakeholders, starting with a 
Conservative federal government and a Liberal government in Quebec, 
followed by a Liberal federal government and a PQ government in Quebec. 
This instance of co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments certainly was successful, positive and harmonious, with 
broader consultation of the public at large, including the first 
nations, the local population of course, as well as all sorts of other 
stakeholders with various qualifications, academics and scientists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we believe that in order to create a lasting 
society, a society that the native peoples would describe as a 
society composed of seven generations, which will live on long 
after we are gone, which will be able to preserve its natural 
heritage, its natural resources for more than one generation, for 
seven generations and more, then we must change our attitudes, our 
behaviours, look at things in a new way, and find new ways of 
preserving this natural heritage. 
What could be better than a marine park to bring this about, to 
rally people around a constructive project, an outstanding 
ecological project, to add a dimension of public education, 
environmental awareness, particularly for future generations?  It 
is an exceptional tool for promoting public awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in a House where more often than not, whether 
during debate or oral question period, we listen to contradictory 
and conflicting arguments on an almost daily basis, how many bills 
are there that we all agree on?  They can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand.  In fact, that might be more fingers than we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see a bill that goes beyond political disagreements, 
that goes beyond social conflict, and that truly unites us. 
Whatever our party, whatever our walk of life, we all rejoice in 
the creation of this outstanding ecological and tourist project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a unifying bill above all.  I myself have felt 
for many years now, well before I was even in politics and became 
environment minister, that the ecology was one of the most unifying 
elements of our society.  Along with health, the ecology is 
something that affects us all.  When it comes to health and the 
environment, political partisanship, and religious and 
philosophical differences are laid aside.  We find our common 
ground through the extraordinary medium of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today gives concrete expression to this 
coming together of ideas and the desire to do something together 
that will benefit the public, and our young people, that will serve 
as a example, that will contribute to sustainable development for 
the future, not just for ourselves, but for future generations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the environment is one of the greatest binding threads 
among us.  This is a concrete example of what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rejoice in the support of all the parties in the House that 
have spoken warmly about this project.  I welcome their support. 
I thank them for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all the parties for their spirit in trying to 
bring about Bill C-7.  It is a gesture of joining together to 
create something which will be unique for Canada, whether we live 
in Quebec or beyond.  I hope all Canadians and people from around 
the world will come to the marine park in the Saguenay to see the 
wonderful ecological heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will all join together to pass Bill C-7 soon.  All the 
very best for the marine park in the Saguenay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the words of my colleague, who is the 
chairman of the heritage committee, by the way. He can count on our full 
co-operation for the speedy passage of Bill C-7. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard messages that are quite self-explanatory. He spoke of 
successful co-operation between all stakeholders. He stated that this 
co-operation, and I noted the three words, was “successful, positive, 
harmonious”. I think that what is interesting in this bill is the basic 
lesson it is teaching us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, several years ago, the Government of Quebec wanted to 
acquire the Mingan Islands, which belonged to a private firm. At that 
time, Mr. Trudeau, who was Prime Minister of Canada and for whom 
politics was always “The sky is the limit”, had put $5 million on the 
table et we lost our bid. 
On our side, we had the impression that the federal government had just 
robbed us of a part of our territory that was dear to us, the Mingan 
Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is one of the provinces with the least number of national 
parks managed by Parks Canada, although we do have many things that are 
managed by Parks Canada, because we are rather protective of our 
territory. I think that the lesson to be learned from this joint project 
that we are about to implement is that from the very beginning, the 
federal government and the Quebec government have respected one another 
and have also respected each other's jurisdictions under the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time did the Canadian government attempt to expropriate land, 
and at no time did the Quebec government attempt to take over an area 
that is the responsibility of the Canadian government. 
I believe that this is the basic lesson that we should draw from this 
project. When there is mutual respect for areas of responsibility, 
Quebec is capable of working within the framework of existing 
arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we look back on history, each time that Quebec is 
rejected for what it is, as a founding nation, that it is rejected for 
its identity and its culture, or that an attempt is made to invade its 
areas of responsibility, each time that the federal government goes 
beyond that limit, that there is a lack of basic respect for areas of 
responsibility, whatever the reasons for the federal government wanting 
to take over a provincial area of responsibility, it is always in such 
a situation that Quebec reels back, jumps on the defensive and adopts a 
rather adversarial approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question to my colleague. Does he not find 
important that the lesson we are learning here, or the experiment we are 
trying with Bill C-7, could be applied also to every area of 
responsibility, and that the federal government could learn to keep 
within its own jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only agree that each level 
of government must stick to its own areas of jurisdiction and that we 
must co-operate in the greatest possible mutual respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that, in any federal-provincial project, in 
any policy change, the two sides, that is the federal government and the 
Quebec government, must respect each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too find that Bill C-7 is a unifying initiative. It should serve 
as a model and I hope it will for all the bills that will come before us 
in the future. I fully agree with the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question or, 
rather, a comment for the Liberal member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are willing to work together to achieve such results. We want 
the federal and provincial governments, for example the Quebec 
government, to work together. If we are to co-operate, as you pointed 
out, a feeling of mutual respect must prevail between the two 
governments. 
It seems to me that seeking separation is not the way of showing we want 
to work together. It is by co-operating, not by walking away, that we 
will achieve something.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, it is by working together that 
we realize that we can succeed. This bill shows that Canada is a country 
where people can work together, where we can have a successful 
partnership and where federalism can be constructive, positive and 
harmonious. Therefore, in this regard, I believe that Bill C-7 is an 
striking example of what Canada must be, and I believe that whatever 
side one is on, this shows that when there is co-operation, it can work 
very well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity as the 
Secretary of State for Parks to address this important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my first opportunity as secretary to have legislation in 
this House.  I believe that when this is passed it will form an 
important step, an important part of what we are trying to do in 
this country to protect our special places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7, the establishment of this park, represents some 
important initiatives, some important achievements.  This is the 
first time ever that we will have a federal-provincial marine 
park established in legislation and I think that is a good 
milestone.  It is a good accomplishment and it is something 
excellent that this House is moving toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is moving on a broader sense to completing and working on 
what we hope to have one day, a national group or national plan 
of marine conservation areas.  We recently published some 
material.  We indicated there are some 29 specific marine 
ecosystems, marine environments that we want to protect and this 
represents one of the steps along that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is an important step in protecting a very critical 
ecosystem in that part of the country where the St. Lawrence and 
the Saguenay meet and in particular, as some other members have 
mentioned, the protection of the beluga whale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned by the previous speaker, it is a good example 
of this government's working with its provincial counterparts to 
achieve some important objectives in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this represents our achieving some very broad 
principles which we are dedicated to as a government.  We believe 
it is important that we work toward protecting our built and 
natural heritage, that we ensure that we can pass on, unimpaired, 
to future generations these special places we have in Canada. 
This legislation is one step toward that important objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we will be doing is honouring what happened over 100 years 
ago when people had the foresight to establish the first national 
park in Banff.  We look back to that over 100 years ago and we 
see how much foresight those people had when they undertook that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope with the actions we are taking in this House today that 
100 years from now generations will be able to look back to us 
and say that we shared the same foresight as the people did over 
100 years ago who first began the national parks in western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note as well that we are doing this, we are 
providing this protection as a public trust in this country under 
a public mandate and to be answerable for all Canadians from 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7, which establishes this marine park, is one part of an 
overall strategy that we are undertaking as a government, that we 
are undertaking as a nation, to protect our special places. 
We undertake that in a large number of ways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I alluded, we have an extensive national park system.  Indeed 
today we have 38 national parks.  We also protect our national 
historic sites.  Through the Historic Sites and Monuments Board 
we have designated over 700 important areas in Canada as national 
historic sites.  Parks Canada operates directly almost 130 of 
them.  We are able to protect and to ensure our heritage for 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a number of important canals and waterways are 
recognized as historic and come under the mandate of Parks 
Canada, waterways such as the Chambly Canal in Quebec, the Rideau 
Canada in Ontario and the Trent-Severn Waterway near my own home 
riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the legislation in terms of co-operation 
with the provinces.  We also operate with the provinces the 
Canadian heritage river system.  We have an opportunity to work 
with our provincial counterparts on important waterways within 
Canada that have been nominated by the provinces that have come 
forward to the federal government.  Between those nominated and 
those designated we have almost 30 such waterways in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also work to protect our national heritage railways stations 
so that a very important part of our Canadian heritage, our 
Canadian history, will be maintained for future generations. 
Parks Canada works with other government departments to protect 
the built heritage already contained within the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased as the Secretary of State for Parks to have the 
opportunity to pursue a number of policies that will help us 
continue to do those types of things in the future and continue 
to protect those special places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One commitment we have made is one that I believe is shared as a 
good objective by most Canadians.  I am referring to the 
expansion of our national parks system.  As I mentioned earlier 
we have 38 national parks.  We have designated 39 specific 
geographic areas in Canada that we would like to see a park 
represented within.  We have 38 parks and we are represented in 
24 of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working actively in co-operation with provincial 
government, with territorial governments, with first nations, 
with other aboriginal groups and with stakeholders to expand the 
park system so that early in the next century we will be able to 
say we are represented with a national park in all 39 regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good progress has been made.  Within the last two years we have 
set aside close to 60,000 square kilometres for protection.  That 
is important progress.  I am pleased we have been able to 
accomplish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later in this session I hope to be able to table amendments to 
the National Parks Act which will provide a legislative framework 
to achieve these accomplishments even more efficiently and with a 
streamlined process that will allow us to provide protection in 
an orderly fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the work we are doing in protecting our special 
places, we are committed to undertake an ecological review of 
existing parks.  We will be proceeding with that objective in the 
near future.  It is important not only to look at expanding the 
parks system but to make sure those parks within the framework 
right now, the ones that exist today, are being correctly managed 
and correctly protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of protecting our special places we announced in the 
1996 budget the movement to a Parks Canada agency. 
This will be a public body reporting directly to the minister and 
accountable to parliament.  It will help to provide new 
organizational, financial and human resources tools to the 
employees of Parks Canada.  It will allow us to apply our 
resources such that we can go even further in protecting our 
special places.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to build on Bill C-7, on the establishment of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park.  We have held extensive 
consultations with Canadians to move forward with comprehensive 
legislation within which other marine conservation areas can be 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has aggressive objectives that we hope to put in 
place over the next several months so that we as a nation, as 
Canadians, can recognize the specialness, the uniqueness of what 
we have.  When we had the opportunity to travel around the 
country we learned very quickly that we have some of the most 
beautiful places in the world right here in Canada.  Part of our 
parks system is to ensure those special places are not only for 
the enjoyment of this generation of Canadians.  The 
responsibility we intend to live up to is to ensure those special 
places are there unimpaired for future generations to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our dual mandate.  That is what we wish to accomplish 
and that is why we are bringing forward this type of legislation 
and the other tools I mentioned that will give us the ability to 
protect those areas for today as well as for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some important principles in establishing this park with Bill 
C-7 can be applied as we move forward in the future.  This is the 
product of an agreement between different levels of government. 
It is important to see that kind of co-operation.  We in Parks 
Canada ensure that we work with our partners, with the provincial 
and territorial governments, with the first nations, aboriginal 
groups and stakeholders, to make sure we have a consensus and an 
understanding of where we want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my time as a secretary of state and in talking to Canadians 
from coast to coast to coast I have noticed a deep desire among 
Canadians to see us move forward with these programs, to see us 
move forward with the protection of our special places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this park and the establishment of other 
parks and other historic sites should represent an expression of 
public will and not government working in isolation.  That is why 
we took so much time, and I think appropriately so, on the 
consultative process.  We wanted to make sure various components 
within the community, such as the public at large, the commercial 
components or the business components, understood, appreciated 
and bought into the types of objectives we were trying to 
achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill helps to protect a very important and fragile marine 
ecosystem in that part of the country.  That is the genesis of 
the bill.  That is why we have moved forward.  That is why we 
have co-operation between governments and the buy in of the 
public.  They see the importance of protecting the ecosystem for 
conservation purposes and for the benefit of future and present 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we operate our existing parks and historic sites, and as we 
move forward to create more, it is important to ensure that we 
have an opportunity through these facilities to educate 
Canadians; that we have an opportunity to provide them with 
recreational opportunities; and that we an opportunity to allow 
Canadians to celebrate the specialness of our unique land and to 
celebrate the specialness of what we are.  That is important and 
that is part of what we do.

will have accomplished one more important step in protecting the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was very interested in the comments of the Secretary of State 
for Parks about this issue.  He will know it is the Reform Party 
position to support the bill in principle at second reading, 
although we have some serious concerns we want to have addressed 
at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it might be instructive to take a look at the 
current practices of Parks Canada with respect to existing parks 
to try to get a feeling of how this park will be treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba, 
we have a situation where people entered into leases with Parks 
Canada.  The leases very clearly and specifically say they are 
renewable and will go on forever.  Now Parks Canada is suddenly 
coming along and saying “No, I do not think so”.  They are 
trying to force negotiation when there is no place for 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the situation in Field, British Columbia, 
where there has been a decision to remove the trailer park which 
is very important as low income housing to people delivering 
services as parks employees or working in the parks.  On one side 
of the coin we have Parks Canada saying “We will leave you 
alone, but if you want to move out of the park and you want to 
sell your trailer to someone else, we will not give you an 
occupancy permit.  We will not stop you.  We will not dismantle 
the trailer park.  We just will not give an occupancy permit 
should you decide to opt out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole situation of the Trans-Canada Highway through 
the Yoho area and the movement of the maintenance facility there. 
I have repeatedly asked for a cost justification from Parks 
Canada not only as the parks critic but also as the member of 
Parliament for the area.  The department has not responded to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the most flagrant one—and there are hundreds of 
examples—has to be the issue of the landing strip in Banff where 
there is a court injunction that clearly and specifically states 
there shall be no action on the part of Parks Canada, its 
employees or agents which in any way would equate to shutting 
down the strip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to a question from my colleague from Yellowhead the 
other day the secretary of state had the audacity to say that 
they are not really shutting it down, but he did admit that they 
are ticketing pilots when they land there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of safety.  This strip happens to be at the 
confluence of three valleys.  When they fly in from Calgary past 
the airstrip and head up toward Lake Louise, there is another 
valley and very frequently a wall of weather comes down there.  I 
have flown to that airstrip with a pilot from Invermere who has 
had to land on that airstrip twice in his career because of 
weather conditions.  He had gone as far as Lake Louise and had to 
turn back rather than being able to reach Springbank, the closest 
airport, because the weather had closed in behind him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the secretary of state tell Canadians how in the world he 
can countenance his employees flagrantly going against a court 
injunction and taking action by way of ticketing and overly 
aggressive inspections, the equivalent of shutting down that 
airstrip, when the court in fact has said no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
across, the critic responsible for heritage and Parks Canada. 
From discussions with him I know he has a deep commitment to our 
national parks system and to the various other things I have 
talked about in terms of protecting our special places.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to get to the specific point on the airstrip in a 
second.  However, speaking in general on the original comments 
made, it goes back to what I said in my speech about the fact 
that there are two major components that the national parks 
system is trying to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, parks are established for the use of Canadians and we 
encourage that use.  Over the past 100 years we have seen the 
traditional use built up, but there is another very important 
component to our mandate.  That is our obligation to pass those 
special places on to future generations unimpaired. That is an 
important mandate and stewardship which we must ensure is 
fulfilled. It means that we need to find a balance between the 
uses that are allowed today and the uses which will ensure those 
facilities will be there in the future. Many of the situations 
the member brought forward have to do with that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned cost justification and wanting to get the 
information.  I will undertake to get that information to the 
member as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today at second reading of Bill C-7, an act to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay region, the Charlevoix region is undoubtedly the 
loveliest region of Quebec, but personally I would say the second 
loveliest region after the Mauricie region. A great number of Quebeckers 
are familiar with that region, which is known in Quebec as Little 
Switzerland, with its majestic landscapes, its remarkable vistas, and 
also as the area where salt water reaches up to the Saguenay, where the 
St. Lawrence's freshwater ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a region that shares many characteristics with the 
Mauricie, because of its river, the Saguenay River, which is a bit 
bigger, a bit more imposing than the Saint-Maurice River. The 
Saint-Maurice River, which today is free from the logs that once 
cluttered it, has also become very majestic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I heard the member from Saint-Maurice in the National 
Assembly, who is the Deputy Speaker there, speak proudly of the 
attributes of the Saint-Maurice River, which can be compared to a 
certain extent to the wonders of the Saguenay River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for our colleague. We know that because of its 
beauty, the site that will be included in the marine park should attract 
numerous international visitors. I would like to know what the input 
from the federal government will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one small point I would like to make, however. All this 
may have been done in harmony, but the federal government's financial 
co-operation should not be referred to today as a gift. 
Quebeckers will be paying $30 billion in taxes to Ottawa, to be 
redistributed, and this is part of good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what part the federal government will play in 
attracting international visitors to enjoy this lovely site that will be 
developed by the whole community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows 
from the work we have done together in the House, tourism as an 
economic generator is important for the area from which I come. 
In my riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka almost 50% of the jobs 
depend on tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the establishment of the marine park in and by itself 
will help to attract individuals to that part of the country.  In 
so doing it will create economic activity which will assist the 
population as a whole.  It will help with job creation.  It will 
help the small business community and it will help to build 
tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal government has made tourism one of its priorities. 
We have established the Canadian Tourism Commission which works 
with partners such as provincial governments and tourism 
associations to help develop and market particular areas.  I am 
sure there will be opportunities through that. 
There is also a regional development agency which operates in the 
province of Quebec which looks for partners from the local 
community and from the provincial government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that with the establishment of this park we will see 
that type of activity take place, while always remembering the 
other side of that balance which is to ensure we do it in a way 
which protects the ecosystem and makes sure it will be there for 
future generations of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to participate in the debate on second 
reading of Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the Minister of Canadian Heritage talked about her 
experience with the wonders of nature in Newfoundland.  My 
colleague from British Columbia talked about his experience in 
the Rockies. I want to add that I grew up close to national parks 
in east Africa.  As such I am a very strong supporter of 
preserving our environment and its unique habitants.  One can 
proudly call them national treasures. These treasures also belong 
to the citizens of the world. Nations fortunate enough to be 
custodians of these treasures must fulfill their obligations to 
preserve this heritage for present and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-7 is to create a marine park at the 
confluence of the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence estuary, 
and to conserve and manage its marine resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents the culmination of an agreement which was 
signed by the federal government and the Quebec provincial 
government in April 1990. The Quebec national assembly ratified 
its commitment to the establishment and maintenance of this park 
earlier this year in June. Its bill will come into force once the 
federal legislation has been enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a first.  Not only is this the first 
federal-provincial salt water marine park, it also represents the 
first time these two governments jointly agreed to establish a 
park and to co-ordinate their park activities. Under the 
agreement made in 1990, the Quebec government retains the 
ownership over the seabed and the sub-soil resources.  The 
federal government maintains responsibility over matters such as 
navigation and fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the agreement was signed in 1990, the two governments have 
worked together on legislative mandates respecting the park, 
compliance strategies, emergency plans and on research and 
education programs to ensure the protection of the area 
designated for the marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of involvement by the regional and local organizations 
in this whole process has shown the general support for the 
creation of such a park.  There has been no transfer of land in 
creating this park as both governments are responsible for their 
own jurisdiction in creating and protecting this park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park comprises a marine environment exclusively and 
measures 1,138 square kilometres.  The boundaries may be changed 
if both governments agree on such changes and only after the 
public has been consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A park management plan must be tabled in Parliament within one 
year of the park being established.  The plan is to be reviewed 
every seven years and must be tabled in Parliament. I will speak 
on these points later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for the park was provided for in the 1995 federal 
budget.  The federal contribution toward the development and 
operating costs is to total $20.7 million over five years. 
Additional funding from the federal government over 1989-93 was 
in the range of $6 million.  Between 1993-95 an additional $4 
million had been set aside from the green plan for the funding of 
this park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament must approve all new parks and any changes to 
existing parks.  Although the auditor general feels that this is 
a cumbersome process, we welcome the fact that we have to debate 
such changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our national parks system is a great source of pride for all of 
us.  I do not think there are too many people who have yet to 
visit our magnificent parks. 
They provide us with a connection to nature and also give us a 
glimpse of our past and even our future. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>National parks are owned by all Canadians and are supposedly 
managed on their behalf. By debating changes to the national 
parks system in Parliament, the government is held more 
accountable for how these parks are managed.  The official 
opposition welcomes this debate and the opportunity to see that 
the government is held accountable for its actions dealing with 
our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there is some concern about the way in which 
this bill came before Parliament.  By the time we as 
parliamentarians were given the opportunity to debate this bill, 
the agreement to establish the park had already been in place for 
several years.  Should there not have been some consultation with 
Parliament before such an agreement was entered into? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is somewhat of a special case and that there 
were extensive consultations with local and regional groups in 
the area in which the park is to be established, but I wonder 
about future cases.  Will the government do the same thing the 
next time?  Are we nothing more than a rubber stamp? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first of many future national marine conservation 
areas which the government set out in 1995 with its sea to sea 
strategy.  At present studies are under way to judge the 
feasibility of establishing 15 more NMCAs and another six within 
the next two years. To date four areas have already been 
established. What guidelines are in place to ensure that there is 
adequate consultation with Parliament and with the areas 
involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I have some concerns with this legislation, most of 
them dealing with the manner in which the government approached 
Parliament, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I believe it is 
important to live up to the agreement made at the beginning of 
the decade to conserve our environment, in this case our marine 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few moments to go over some of the 
specifics of the bill and deal with the concerns which I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill outlines four zones for managing parks resources. Zone 
one deals with the rare, unique, natural and cultural features 
that are sensitive to any type of land use.  Zone two is similar 
to the previous zone, however some form of use can occur.  Zone 
three deals with recreational activities.  Zone four deals with 
land which will be accessible to many human use activities, such 
as commercial shipping and fishing, and natural resource 
harvesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no specific levels of protection described in this 
bill.  They are more clearly outlined in the 1995 management 
plan.  Fortunately this plan goes into much greater detail 
concerning how these regions will be protected and available for 
use.  However as it is only a plan, it is subject to change quite 
easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I alluded to earlier, a new management plan is to be tabled 
in Parliament a year after the park is established and is subject 
to review every seven years by the respective provincial and 
federal ministers responsible. My concern is that the government 
of the day, either due to pressures from certain groups on either 
side of the issue or from economic pressures, may decide to make 
changes in the plan which may be detrimental to the park and to 
the organisms that the act is to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern relates to governor in council appointments 
concerning the administration of federal activities within the 
marine park.  The minister can under the powers outlined in Bill 
C-7 conduct activities to advance ecosystem knowledge and to 
enter into intergovernmental agreements.  The minister would have 
to allow for public participation and could cancel and issue 
permits.  If it is not the minister currently responsible, namely 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage, then it will be up to the 
cabinet to choose who is in control of this park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a related note, some concern also exists with respect to the 
regulations.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the two governments are working to harmonize the 
activities of both levels of government in this park.  This 
harmonization committee currently is comprised of representatives 
from the federal, provincial and four regional governments, the 
affected band council, the scientific community and a 
conservation group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present they are ensuring the goals of the management plan 
established in 1995 are put into place and are serving as a 
consultant to the respective federal and provincial minister 
responsible for ensuring that the strategies and methods outlined 
in the plan are attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main concern here comes with the minister's power to 
determine the composition of this committee.  Although the 1995 
management plan has already established the composition, it is at 
the minister's discretion to change this composition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern deals with the accountability of the minister. 
Will such changes be announced or will there be some consultation 
with Parliament before any changes are made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good portion of the bill deals with compliance issues and 
enforcement officers powers to control unsanctioned activities in 
the park, including their authority to conduct searches with and 
without warrants and to make arrests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fines for individuals range from an undetermined amount for 
minor fines and anywhere from $10,000 and/or and six month jail 
sentence for summary convictions to $20,000 and/or a maximum five 
year jail term for indictable offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For corporations, the fines range from $100,000 to $500,000 for 
more serious infractions.  Courts are also given the authority to 
order compensation for any remedial action necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the general principle of this bill.  Both the federal 
and provincial governments over the past several years have 
indicated that there is at the time a strong commitment to 
conserving this unique area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations and management plan that have been put in place 
appear to give this bill its teeth.  While I can understand why 
these two governments have proceeded this way, as it is much 
easier to amend management plans and regulations when not 
legislated into law, I do hope this practice is maintained by 
future governments and that adequate public consultation takes 
place before any changes are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said already, national parks such as the one proposed here 
are national treasures for all Canadians to enjoy.  It would be a 
shame if actions were taken which would not reflect the sense of 
immense pride we take in our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore join my colleagues on both sides of the House in 
supporting this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, once 
again I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-7, the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already said, this is one of the most beautiful 
regions of Quebec, and what is more, this bill is the result of a 
special collaborative effort by the community concerned.  In other 
words, the people themselves decided to do something, and have very 
ably moved this bill along for several years, so that today we find 
ourselves considering it with a view to enabling the federal 
government to move into this fine project which, as I have said, 
encompasses both shores of the St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to realize that this bill involves three regional 
municipalities, two on the north shore and the other on the south. 
It also concerns a very particular part of the St. Lawrence, as I 
have said, the point at the mouth of the Saguenay where the fresh 
water stops and the salt water starts.  This project is even more 
valuable because its intent is to protect the ecosystem in place 
there, particularly the beluga, the focus of world wide attention, 
and the whales, which attract thousands upon thousands of tourists: 
Quebeckers, Canadians, Europeans, and increasing numbers of Asians.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a region set apart by its beauty, offering some very 
attractive places.  There is, for example, the Manoir Richelieu, 
which has had a casino for a few years now.  There is also the 
Manoir Tadoussac, in Tadoussac, which is really beautiful.  In 
terms of nature itself, all along the Saguenay there are mountains, 
known as the Trois Soeurs, with La Trinité, L'Éternité and another 
whose name I forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth a visit, and I invite those of our viewers who 
have yet to visit this beautiful part of Quebec to do so, whether 
they live in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada.  It is, without 
bragging, an area of international calibre. 
For this reason, I was questioning the secretary of state earlier 
on the government's efforts to encourage international tourism, 
since its responsibility is to draw foreign visitors to Canada and 
hopefully to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not consider the answer particularly clear, but we are 
counting on the past activities of Canada's embassies and 
consulates to promote the merits of Quebec abroad.  Everyone knows 
that 80% of the diplomatic corps coming from Canada and not 
Quebec—as I heard it put recently by an industrial commissioner—does 
not speak French.  I think we must insist that the Canadian 
government, with the money that comes from Quebec pockets, make a 
creditable and basic effort to promote this unique location as a 
site for international tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously mentioned, one should point to the collective effort 
implied in such a project, which found its genesis locally, was the 
subject of public hearings, is already largely supported by the Quebec 
government and can now count on the co-operation of the federal 
government to go ahead even more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This naturally beautiful area deserves to be encouraged. It 
marks the beginning of the St. Lawrence estuary. There is now a 
road along the North Shore, which goes all the way up to 
Natashquan, the birth place of Gilles Vigneault, who composed 
“Gens du pays”, the closest thing we have to a national anthem. 
From Tadoussac a very pleasant road leads to Chicoutimi along the 
Saguenay river, through very picturesque villages—I went there 
over 10 years ago—like the very nice village of Sacré-Coeur. 
The village of Tableau also comes to mind; you come to this place where 
the mountain looks like a blackboard and you almost feel like writing 
something on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This area is well worth a visit. I hope this will entice people who 
are listening today. It is one of the very beautiful areas in Quebec 
and, for the time being in Canada; it is aptly dubbed the Quebec 
Switzerland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague who spoke before me, if he is not 
gone yet—if he is not here, one must conclude he is gone—what his idea 
of the Canadian government's effort was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how hard the Canadian government tries to promote the 
Rockies, and rightly so, it is one of the most spectacular areas in 
Canada, if not the world. 
I would have liked to ask my colleague what efforts if any, in his view, 
according to the information he has, if he has more than us, the 
Canadian government intends to make to promote internationally this 
gorgeous site called the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker,  I encourage the 
government to really promote this unique national park around the 
world.  I agree with the hon. member, as I mentioned in my 
speech, that national parks are a treasure for Canada but they 
are also a treasure for all human races.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-7, an act to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park.  This bill holds a special interest 
for me as I represent the 70,000 people of the riding of Jonquière, 
which is adjacent to this unique park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Rimouski—Mitis said, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports this bill. 
Indeed, more than seven years after the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Quebec signed an agreement to establish a marine park 
where the Saguenay river enters the St. Lawrence estuary, the time has 
finally come to pass legislation establishing that park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that this park will include a unique feature of Quebec 
geography, the Saguenay fjord, where a mighty river flows.  As you know, 
this fjord opens onto the largest estuary in the world.  This is a place 
blessed with a large variety of living organisms.  There are several 
species of plankton and many species of fish, both fresh and salt water 
fish.  This area offers excellent conditions for breeding and feeding, 
and it is also a staging and wintering area for a number of water fowls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, this is a special environment that should be 
protected. 
This is the most beautiful site in our country to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time to pass the marine park legislation has finally arrived. 
I say “finally” because the agreement was signed on April 6, 1990 and 
the local and regional communities, the environmental groups, the native 
peoples and the scientific community, who are all committed to improving 
the management and protection of the rich and varied marine resources of 
the area, had to wait seven years, I repeat seven years, before that 
agreement finally translated into something concrete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that under this agreement both governments are 
committed, within their constitutional jurisdictions, to passing 
legislative or regulatory measures for the purpose of, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the creation of a marine park called “Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park” and located at the confluence of the Saguenay River and the 
northern half of the St. Lawrence Estuary; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the conservation of the marine fauna and flora, as well as 
maintaining the integrity of ecosystems on this territory; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) the protection of the territory and its other resources; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) the development of these resources for present and future 
generations; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) the appreciation of these resources by the public. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I am not talking about the strong pressures exerted since the 
1970s by local people—despite those in this House who would like to 
take the credit—for action to be taken in order to preserve the rich 
and diverse marine life in the Saguenay region. 
It did take the Canadian government some time to respond to the will 
that had been unanimously expressed for a long time by the local people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The least we can say is that this project, which required several 
years of discussions and negotiations between Ottawa and Quebec City 
before coming to a successful conclusion, is hardly the best example of 
an efficient federalist system because of the long negotiations, even 
though the local people have agreed on this since the 1970s.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I would like to elaborate a little bit on some 
features of Bill C-7 which give it a unique character and which should 
be used as a model by the Canadian government in its future relations 
with the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park will be the first salt 
water federal-provincial park, the first park created jointly by the two 
levels of government and for which Ottawa and Quebec agreed on their 
respective management roles. 
This is a unique agreement between the two governments and it was made 
possible because the federal government agreed to recognize the rights 
and jurisdiction of each level of government—and I insist on those 
words “agreed to recognize the rights and jurisdiction of each level of 
government”—without trying to make its own rights prevail over those 
of the Government of Quebec and the people it represents, which rights 
are just as legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example the present government, its Prime Minister and 
its ministers would be well advised to follow in many other sensitive 
matters concerning the future of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to stress another feature of Bill C-7 that reinforces its 
uniqueness: for the first time, the Government of Canada has agreed to 
participate in the establishment of a marine park without claiming in 
return the ownership on the seabed and the sub-soil and ground 
resources. Indeed, the Government of Quebec keeps its property right, 
but this right does not prevent the federal government from continuing 
to exercise its jurisdiction over navigation and fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another fine example from which the Liberal government 
should draw inspiration in its relations with Quebec, and a model of 
respect for Quebec's territorial integrity that should guide the federal 
government in other discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government would have been really ill-advised to claim 
a greater jurisdiction than that recognized in the bill establishing the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
Indeed, is it necessary to recall that, for 61 years, up until 1983, 
Quebec had assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole 
fishing sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a jurisdiction the federal government has encroached upon 
under the pretext that it would be easier to protect the resources of 
the Atlantic region from Ottawa. In the last 10 years, there has been 
little evidence to support the federal government's claim to be in a 
better position than Quebec to protect resources. Besides, the general 
collapse of the groundfish stocks is a direct consequence of the federal 
government's inability to assume its mandate to protect resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important part of this bill that is worth mentioning is the 
involvement of local representatives in the management of this new 
marine park. This bill confirms the mandate of the existing joint 
Canada-Quebec management committee and gives an important role to local 
stakeholders who, as members of the coordinating committee, will be in 
a position to monitor the implementation of the management plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The composition of the coordinating committee will be as follows: 
one representative from each of the three RCMs concerned on the north 
shore, namely Charlevoix-Est, the Saguenay Fjord and Haute-Côte-Nord; 
only one representative for the three RCMs concerned on the south shore, 
namely Kamouraska, Les Basques and Rivière-du-Loup; one representative 
from the scientific community; one for the groups dedicated to the 
conservation and preservation of resources, environmental education and 
nature interpretation; one from the Canadian heritage department; and 
one from the Quebec ministry of environment and wildlife.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These local representatives will have a very important role to 
play, for this bill is admittedly rather sketchy concerning the 
conservation ethics to be observed in managing the park. We have to 
refer to the management plan to learn more about the protection 
strategies that will be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we must admit this is a flaw because it is always 
much easier to amend a management master plan than a law. So this master 
plan could be changed at any time in order to increase or reduce the 
protection of marine resources, in spite of all the good will expressed 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, clause 17 of this bill authorizes the governor in council 
to make regulations for the protection of marine resources, for the 
control of activities, for the issuance of permits and for prescribing 
the fines for offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, I believe that the stakeholders will have to be 
very vigilant—I repeat, very vigilant—to ensure that the 
application of the management master plan is consistent with the spirit 
of Bill C-7, which we are about to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last point I wish to highlight, once again, as a 
source of inspiration for the federal government. It is the accord 
concluded by Quebec and Ottawa on how to finance the creation of the 
marine park and its annual operating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sagueney-St. Lawrence Marine Park is already an internationally 
renowned tourist destination with an enormous tourist development 
potential that, if properly exploited, will contribute to the 
establishment of a sustainable tourist industry in our region, the 
Saguenay. 
I am pleased to see that, in this matter, the federal government is 
getting involved in regional development in Quebec without bypassing the 
provincial government, which is very much to its credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed worth mentioning since, during its first term, this 
Liberal government had shown us another kind of approach which was a lot 
less respectful of the Quebec governement's jurisdiction in the area of 
regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office in 1993, 62% of federal funding for 
regional development came under various agreements with the Quebec 
government. Now, four years later, that percentage has gone down to 33%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that in more than two thirds of regional development 
matters in which the federal government is involved, it bypasses the 
Quebec government, often duplicating what is already being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the members that, since the creation of the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, the Liberal government has been using 
this agency almost exclusively as a propaganda tool to increase its 
visibility in Quebec, hiding behind that agency to get directly involved 
in regional development in that province. And, unfortunately, it has 
been doing so without giving any consideration to the effectiveness of 
its interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, 90% of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development activities duplicate the Quebec government's activities and, 
according to some estimates, this duplication is costing taxpayers $20.7 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that for once the government respected Quebec's 
jurisdiction over regional development, by signing an agreement with the 
province, can only be cause for rejoicing. But let us also hope that 
this approach will become the rule in future federal interventions in 
regional development in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to cooperate so that Bill C-7, 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act, can be adopted as soon as 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, the government's agenda as outlined in 
the speech from the throne sets out the course it intends to take 
to ensure that Canada succeeds in the global knowledge economy of 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda sets out clearly the actions to be taken and the 
partnerships to be forged to ensure that Canada realizes its 
potential in this new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first priorities is to connect Canadians.  The goal 
is to make Canada the most connected nation in the world, making 
sure that all Canadians can have access to the electronic highway 
and the information economy by the year 2000. This is perhaps the 
single most important action that government can take to ensure 
success in the knowledge based economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national strategy designed to give access to the information and 
knowledge infrastructure will enable individuals, rural communities, and 
small and medium size businesses to find new opportunities to learn, 
communicate, trade and develop their economic and social potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 marks a major step in our strategy to connect Canadians 
to the information highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a milestone in this government's strategy to encourage 
competition, innovation and growth in Canada's telecommunications 
industry, which plays a vital role in the knowledge economy and greatly 
contributes to the information infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the telecommunications industry accounts for 115,000 quality 
jobs and 3.36% of GDP. 
We believe it will be one of the key growth areas in the 21th century 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-17 is to pursue the liberalization of 
Canadian telecommunications, which started more than 10 years ago and 
has already greatly benefited Canadians and Canadian telecommunications 
companies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That liberalization began with the licensing of competitive 
cellular telephone service and moved forward with the 
privatization of Teleglobe and Telesat, the introduction of 
competition to long distance telephone service and the passage of 
the new Telecommunications Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two years, this process has been continued with 
the licensing of suppliers of new services, including personal 
communications services and local multi-point communication 
services. 
We have also been pursuing this liberalization agenda at the 
international level to promote global competition and new 
opportunities for Canada's telecommunications sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today paves the way to implement an 
international agreement that Canada concluded last February. 
Members may remember that the Uruguay round of the GATT trade 
negotiations developed new trade rules for the services sector. 
These are known as the general agreements for trade and services, 
GATS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February agreement was reached to extend the GATS to cover 
basic telecommunications.  Following successful negotiations 
under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, 69 countries 
including Canada concluded an agreement to liberalize basic 
telecommunications services.  These countries account for more 
than 90% of the world's $880 billion telecommunications market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GATS agreement on basic telecommunications covers basic 
telecommunication services, including voice and data but not 
broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our key objectives during the negotiations was to gain 
access to foreign markets for Canadian telecommunications 
companies. This we have achieved.  As a result, our 
telecommunications companies will have more secure access to 
major markets such as the United States, the European Union and 
Japan, as well as the developing markets of Asia and Latin 
America.  The agreement also establishes a clear set of 
multilateral rules in a sector that previously had no rules. The 
dispute settlement process provides the necessary safeguards to 
ensure that countries respect their commitments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the agreement, we will be making a few changes here, in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we will lift all restrictions on mobile services 
provided to Canadians worldwide using satellites belonging to foreign 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will put an end to Telesat's monopoly on fixed satellite 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our transparent and independent regulatory and competition regimes 
will be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also put an end to Teleglobe Canada's monopoly on 
international traffic and eliminate the special ownership restrictions 
imposed on this company, which prohibit any investment by foreign 
telecommunications companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will authorize foreign concerns to have full ownership of 
international submarine cable landing facilities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will, however, maintain our general foreign investment 
regulations to ensure that the industry remain in the hands of Canadian 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the changes we promised can be implemented by 
administrative means, while others require that legislation be passed. 
This bill provides the legislative framework required to make these 
changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more important than these details is the overall 
objective to foster competition both domestically and 
internationally.  Competition fosters innovation and innovation 
sparks the development of new products and services, more choice 
for consumers, job creation and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years Canada has made major strides in 
liberalizing its telecommunications industry, and the benefits to 
consumers and businesses have been impressive.  For example, a 
study by the international consulting firm KPMG estimates that 
long distance telephone rates today are 55% below and traffic is 
67% above what they would have been in the absence of competition 
in that market.  Savings to consumers are in the billions of 
dollars.  And the benefit is not just in services.  Investment in 
switches and related hardware is estimated to be more than $2 
billion higher than it would have been under monopoly conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective is to free Canada's telecommunications and 
information technology sectors to be more competitive and dynamic 
both at home and abroad.  It was to further this objective that 
we became parties to the information technology agreement last 
year.  About 40 economies with 90% of the world's trade in 
information technology have endorsed that agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have agreed to eliminate tariffs on some 300 information 
technology products by the turn of the century. Together these 
two agreements have significantly opened up the global 
marketplace in telecommunications services and equipment, 
creating new opportunities for all countries. As a result, 
Canadian telecommunications companies will be able to capture a 
larger share of the global market in telecommunications services 
and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are considering today will also strengthen our 
ability to keep pace with a rapidly changing telecommunications 
environment.  We will be empowering the CRTC to introduce a 
licensing regime to ensure that all providers of international 
services play by the same rules.  We are also strengthening our 
ability to enforce standards for telecommunications equipment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must pass this bill as rapidly as possible.  The agreement 
on basic telecommunications services takes effect January 1, 1998. 
A good number of the amendments to our regulations do not take 
effect before October 1, 1998, but the new regime must be in place 
before then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments proposed in this bill will enable the 
CRTC to establish a licensing regime for telecommunications service 
providers. 
The CRTC will ensure that Canadian and foreign telecommunications 
providers hold licences consistent with WTO rules and Canadian 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has held public hearings on licensing and the whole 
issue of international services.  If the CRTC is to be able to wrap 
up this process and introduce the new regulations by October 1, 
1998, the bill must be passed without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and 
Divestiture Act so as to repeal the provisions concerning the 
special ownership and other regimes related to ending Teleglobe's 
monopoly.  I wish to point out that Teleglobe approves of this 
initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the Telecommunications Act are necessary for us to 
meet our commitments in the area of satellites, undersea cables 
and international services, and also to ensure observance of 
other Canadian telecommunications policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits flowing from the GATS agreement are significant. We 
anticipate that Canadian businesses and consumers will gain 
access to a wide variety of world class telecommunications 
services at competitive prices.  Canadian telecom service 
providers will be able to penetrate new markets on an equal 
footing with local companies and foreign competitors. Canadian 
telecom manufacturers will find a huge new demand for their state 
of the art products as telecom operators around the world prepare 
for a new global environment of open markets and competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to move quickly to realize the economic, 
social and cultural benefits of the knowledge based society. 
International agreements like the GATS agreement lay the 
groundwork for us to construct this society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working on a number of fronts to build.  For example, I 
have invited my OECD counterparts to come to Canada in the fall 
of 1998 for discussions to develop a global framework for 
electronic commerce.  Electronic commerce means using advanced 
communications and computer technologies to do business. Its uses 
range from selling consumer products and services electronically 
to managing investments over computer networks, to transactions 
between major banks that involve large amounts of money and other 
assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce is not only central to a modern knowledge 
based economy, it is also the foundation for future growth and 
job creation.  Given our small domestic market and dependence on 
foreign trade, we must foster a domestic and international 
environment that is friendly to electronic commerce if we are to 
reap the significant trade and investment benefits it offers to 
Canadian firms and citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD Canada conference is an important step in this 
direction. 
It ensures that we can support, participate in and influence the 
creation of an open, transparent, multilateral electronic 
commerce regime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our hope is that this conference will set out the policy 
framework and implementation timetable needed to establish a 
stable, open and transparent environment favourable to the 
development of worldwide electronic commerce.  An integrated 
approach would allow all countries and regions to enjoy the 
benefits of electronic commerce while avoiding duplication of 
effort and the creation of new international trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more if Canada is to be a leader in electronic 
commerce.  That is why the government is also working toward 
using electronic commerce when doing business with its own 
clients.  By being a model user we can encourage the private 
sector and other levels of government to adopt the new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advances in information technologies are transforming industrial 
economies such as our own.  Canada has the opportunity to be 
among the first rank of the new knowledge based economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these new technologies eliminate distance they are taking us 
ever closer to the global village envisioned by Marshall McLuhan. 
They are also creating a world in which knowledge is our most 
important commodity and the key to our economic performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By overcoming the barriers of distance these technologies are 
creating great opportunities for people, communities and 
countries that were once on the periphery, from the developing 
nations of Asia, Latin America and Africa to Canada's own rural 
and remote communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four years, we have defined and implemented a 
information highway strategy, so that Canada can take full 
advantage of these technologies and so that all Canadians can have 
access to the information based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information highway will be Canadian and will offer 
Canadian products and services, but it will be open to the entire 
world.  It will encourage innovation, economic growth, job creation 
and communication throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's priority is to create the conditions 
necessary to encourage the private sector to build this information 
highway. 
Hardware and software suppliers, and designers of related contents 
and services are now among the fastest growing sectors in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opening up competition in the telecommunications services 
sector represents an important component of the Canadian strategy. 
We know that the best, as well as the fastest, way to build an 
information based economy infrastructure is to institute an open 
competition policy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the best overall communications infrastructure among the 
G-7 nations.  We are among the leaders in terms of penetration, 
quality, market development and rates.  For example, Canada tops 
the G-7 in proportion of households with personal computers.  We 
have the lowest residential telephone and Internet access charges 
in the G-7.  We have the highest rate of cable television 
subscribers in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we build the world's best communications infrastructure we 
have also built industries that sell knowledge based goods and 
services around the world.  Our information and communications 
technology industries export to more than 90 countries.  The 
sector is a leader in research and development, accounting for 
one-third of total industrial R and D in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These industries hold enormous potential for jobs and growth. 
Now that we have cleared the way for them to compete 
internationally that potential is growing even greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a necessary step toward the continuing 
process of liberalizing telecommunications trade worldwide.  I 
urge the House to act on it quickly and to secure for Canadians 
their entry into the global telecommunications marketplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be speaking today to Bill C-17 which amends two acts, the 
Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization 
and Divestiture Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will preface my remarks with the encouragement I personally 
take that the minister recognizes the importance of this sector 
and has continually put it forward as a priority for Canada.  I 
and my party may differ with the process to take us there but we 
certainly concur with the priority he places on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to my time in this House I served and worked in the 
telecommunications sector for many years.  I do concur that we 
have one of the finest communications infrastructures that we 
will find anywhere in the world.  I take personal pride in being 
a part of having shaped that in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our telecommunications policy in Canada and that infrastructure 
has largely been born out of an inward looking approach to our 
telecommunications industry.  We have to some degree limited 
ownership in the past to Canadian players and Canadian content. 
We have had a monopolistic approach to the development of the 
industry.  In the past it has served Canadians and did the job 
and allowed for the creation of some infrastructure, but the day 
we are in today is certainly different from what has been in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are facing a greater degree of globalization and 
competitiveness as we have never seen before.  To continue with 
an approach of inward looking, restrictive type policies will 
only serve to restrict Canadians' full participation in the 
global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have much to gain as Canadians. We have equipment and 
competencies in Canada that are second to none.  We are well 
equipped right now to compete in the global marketplace, a 
marketplace which offers an $880 billion industry in which 
Canadians are eager to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The global network that is evolving around the world today has 
changed the way we relate.  Time and distance no longer are the 
factors they were in the past. Our world is changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New agreements need to be put in place to reduce the 
restrictions on trade and to promote investment in this critical 
industry if we are to capitalize on the benefits that are 
available for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to this particular bill, there are some encouraging 
points to this bill that we have long awaited.  The reduction in 
foreign ownership and control requirements and the lifting of 
some of these requirements on submarine cables, earth stations 
and technologies that carry long distance telecommunications 
services outside of Canada are good and positive signs and things 
we personally endorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Teleglobe monopoly wind down and the Telesat monopoly 
divestiture are good signs.  They are things that have been 
called for for some time.  As the minister has alluded to, even 
the entities themselves, such as Teleglobe, embrace the 
opportunity to participate in the global telecommunications 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some changes required if we are to meet our trade 
commitments and adapt to these new realities and move away from 
the restrictive approach of the past.  We need stronger 
legislative controls which are inherent in this bill around 
technical standards for telecommunications equipment, both that 
which leaves Canada and that which comes into Canada, provided 
those controls are applied to telecommunications equipment and 
not to other equipment that may not be pertinent to the 
telecommunications industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally we are supportive of the components within this bill 
that call for the elimination of the monopolies, the relaxation 
of foreign ownership restrictions and greater access to 
international markets.  However we have some concerns with this 
bill and I would like to speak to three of those concerns. 
Unfortunately these concerns are of such a grave nature that the 
positive aspects of the bill, which the industry and this party 
have been calling for for some time, are almost negated by these 
more detrimental aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern is the expansive new authority which has been 
given to the CRTC under this legislation, brand new licensing 
powers over telecommunications service providers.  The process 
around this licensing and how it is applied is undefined in the 
legislation.  There is no mention of costs or fees which may be 
involved in obtaining a licence.  This is another opportunity to 
potentially extract new revenues for the government and to 
further diminish the success of entrepreneurial interests in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the process impartial?  We have no way of knowing from this 
legislation.  There is a clear indication that entities which 
exist in Canada today but do not require a licence will require 
one once this legislation is in place.  There is no criteria 
outlined for granting of licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may think this is an over concern, but when we look at the 
CRTC's track record in other industries and in other areas, there 
is justification for concern.  It has a track record of picking 
winners and losers.  Often those picks are justified by a 
nebulous public interest statement rather than clear guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This significantly greater power given to the CRTC seems to be 
in exactly the opposite direction of what we see in the 
divestiture of the monopolies and the wind down of the monopolies 
of Teleglobe and Telesat.  It is a trade off which is very 
unfortunate in the packaging of this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We prefer a more clearly defined process if in fact licensing is 
even necessary, protecting impartiality in free market forces 
with less potential for abuse and political interference.  It may 
be that none of this is intended, but define the process.  Build 
in the safeguards so that accusations cannot be made.  If that is 
there, it stimulates investor confidence and business 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point which gives us concern about this legislation 
is the brand new administrative powers granted to the CRTC.  In 
the short term the justification for these powers is targeted at 
the administration of the North American numbering sequence for 
long distance calling. On the surface it might seem reasonable 
but I suggest that in the past this work was actually done by 
industry.  Does the CRTC have the skills to manage and administer 
an operational process such as this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is a clause in the legislation for the CRTC to be 
able to appoint a third party to administer this activity.  Our 
concern is that this is an operational type of administrative 
duty which is new to the CRTC.  I would suggest the skill sets 
are not there to effectively manage this and it may not be the 
best place to carry this on.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even beyond that, a greater concern on this same theme is the 
open ended administrative power on a go forward basis granted to 
the CRTC by this legislation which it can impose or as the 
legislation itself says, prescribe for any activity related to 
the provision of telecommunications services by Canadian 
carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC can further delegate powers to a chosen third party, 
including one created by the commission itself.  This means that 
any area of the industry that the CRTC feels needs to have its 
administrative oversight can be subject to a third party 
management that the CRTC puts in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two areas of undefined and extensive administrative power 
go far beyond what is required for increased participation by 
Canadians in the global communications marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that what Canadians have gained in the removal of 
the monopolies and greater access to international markets is 
more than offset by the much greater controlling powers given to 
the regulator here at home.  These are very serious precedents in 
the wrong direction, especially given the CRTC's track record of 
an expensive application process and weakly defendable subjective 
public interest arguments for the chosen winners and losers in 
the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third and final concern relates to what we believe to be the 
very short term nature and short sightedness of this bill.  We 
see within this bill the continued attempt to separate 
broadcasting from telecommunications but the reality is that 
these two technologies are undergoing a convergence at a very 
rapid rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today, broadcast information through digitization is 
being carried by telecom carriers.  As voice data and broadcast 
material is increasingly carried by telecom infrastructures, the 
attempt to partition broadcasting from telecommunications 
regulation will become increasingly cumbersome and increasingly 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this attempt to continue to embrace the 
Broadcasting Act is really driven more by a desire to regulate 
what Canadians watch rather than any efficiencies in the actual 
distribution.  It is again CRTC censorship regarding what 
Canadians will have exposure to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However because of convergence and the attempt to strip out 
broadcast from telecommunications within the industry, I would 
suggest to the minister and to the government that is going to be 
effectively impossible in the days ahead as these technologies 
move together.  There is a better approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when Canadians heard about the prime minister's speech 
last night they were more interested in what he did not say than 
what he did say.  When the prime minister spoke about the Kyoto 
deal he did not rule out a gasoline tax to pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very straightforward. Will the prime minister 
rule out any jump at the pump? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the opposition is always trying to find something to 
attack that does not exist.  It was all excited about a carbon 
tax.  We said a year ago that there was no such plan.  The 
minister of energy of the day, the Minister of Justice, made many 
statements about it.  Having nothing to complain about, the 
opposition invents an issue and tries to make hay out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said there would be no carbon tax.  Should we have an income 
tax increase—

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a difference between carbon taxes and gasoline 
taxes.  My question was not that difficult.  Either the prime 
minister knows how he is going to pay for this Kyoto deal and he 
is keeping it as a Christmas present for Canadians or he does not 
know. And if he does not know, he should say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economists have said the Kyoto deal, only 27 days away, could 
add up to 10 cents, 20 cents or 30 cents for a litre of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is again.  Do not run away, do not make excuses and do 
not change the subject.  Will there be a jump at the pump to pay 
for the Kyoto deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first we have to have a deal.  That is the first point. 
We are going there because Canadians want us to do something 
about climate changes.  The Reform Party is against it.  It does 
not give a damn about the environment but we do on this side of 
the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

you do not know how you will pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal political minister for Alberta was very quiet in the 
House yesterday but outside in the lobby she was quite talkative. 
She told reporters that the Liberals have not ruled out a gasoline

do not know what we have said on that.  They attacked the 
Minister of Justice when they knew very well that the rules of 
this House did not allow her to get up in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

this government is turning a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government was the first to react to the situation of the 
workers who lost their jobs at the mine, the first, in late 
September, to put an offer of a package of up to $3 million in 
active job measures for workers on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was excellent news in the region yesterday.  There was

the minister does not know Quebec.  The Asbestos region is not the 
same as the Thetford region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that, at least in the case of these 
older workers, what is needed is not active measures, but a form of 
income support that will see them through to retirement with 
dignity at the age of 65?  Jean Dupéré and Louise Harel have 
already stated their position.  It is now up to the minister.

on its course of action.  In the past, the Government of Quebec 
decided to intervene in the shipbuilding and clothing industries. 
It did so in its capacity as the Government of Quebec and is 
perfectly free to do so again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have responsibility for certain active measure funds and 
that is what I am offering them.  The POWA was phased out one year 
ago and the workers themselves said it did not interest them unless 
it was improved, which would mean it was no longer the same

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Atlantic

to name just a few.  Some of these have gone from $30 to $7,000 
in a single year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister of fisheries.  Is it the intent 
of the department to put these small fishermen out of business 
and will the minister review some of these owners' fees with an 
aim to providing some relief to the fishermen in Atlantic Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the direct question is no. 
The answer to the second part of the question is we are trying 
very hard to make sure we have a viable fishery in Atlantic 
Canada and indeed on the Pacific and Arctic coasts as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to recognize that as part of the viability 
some fishermen who have in fact quite substantial incomes pay a 
legitimate fee for the product that they use.  For others who are 
smaller fishermen such as the ones referred to by the hon. 
member, we are constantly examining the fee impact. There is a 
three year study which will start next year on the impact of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure the minister's response is going to offer much encouragement 
to the fishermen back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, fishermen are being subjected to electronic black 
box monitoring and on-board video surveillance.  This is akin to 
the electronic bracelets worn by prisoners, but at least the 
prisoners had a fair trial before being subjected to this 
humiliating and patronizing process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

internationally and domestically with the fishing fleet is to get 
accurate information on the stocks that are being fished in 
particular with respect to bycatch and other destructive 
practices that may be taking place. It is therefore important to 
have information on catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the black box the gentleman is talking about is in fact 
a two way radio which keeps the fishermen in touch with shore so 
they can report catch I am not sure.  However where it is 
possible to use technology instead of having a human observer, 
generally speaking costs are saved and the fishermen are 
dramatically advantaged as a result.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK189">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-17, an 
act to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate with 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre who has approximately 15 
minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just to recap from where I left off, I was speaking to Bill C-17 
and our concerns about some of the changes the bill is bringing 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were two changes to the broadened powers of the CRTC 
linked to the bill which sadly limit the benefit of the bill.  We 
are very concerned about the extensive increase to the powers of 
the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also beginning to address a third concern related to the 
bill in that it has a very short term nature.  It is somewhat 
shortsighted in its application of a greater degree of 
competition within the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that is the bill continues to attempt to 
separate broadcasting regulation from telecommunications 
regulation.  In Canada today we are facing an increasing 
convergence within technology where voice, data and broadcast are 
all being carried over telecommunications facilities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is increasingly difficult to try to separate the broadcast 
component from the telecommunications component because of the 
convergence of the technologies.  As the convergence continues it 
will be increasingly difficult to keep these two acts separate. 
Therefore this piece of legislation will have a very short 
lifespan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better approach would be to allow and promote the Canadian 
cultural industry to produce a package of broadcast content that 
Canadians actually want.  This would allow Canadians to select 
the kind of material they want to view rather than what the CRTC 
decides they need to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way we would be able to reduce the requirement of the 
Broadcast Act to control content.  Then the Broadcast Act and the 
Telecommunications Act could be combined so that we would be 
controlling the transmission media rather than the actual content 
through a combined simplified Telecommunications Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than delay the inevitable and hold up the industry from 
being able to capture some of the gains in the telecommunications 
market through simplified regulation, we recommend the government 
take a leadership role and amalgamate the Broadcast Act and the 
Telecommunications Act.  It should harmonize and relax the 
regulations.  It should reduce rather than expand the CRTC 
protectionist role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage a strong Canadian product that will compete well 
locally and internationally.  We are not in a protectionist age. 
We are in a very competitive age.  We need regulations which will 
allow Canadian telecommunications interests to compete. 
Broadcasters must be able to provide the products Canadians wish 
to see rather than the products the CRTC deems we should be able 
to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we move in this direction we will see a much greater interest 
by investors to step into the telecommunications marketplace.  It 
will also generate a substantial amount of business confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary I will deal with some of the positive measures of the 
bill.  We are encouraged because several of the measures are ones 
the Reform Party has long been calling for such as the removal of 
monopoly interests and allowing for Canadian interests to fully 
participate in international carrier services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another positive is the opportunity for greater competition at 
home when accessing long distance services within the 
international marketplace.  This should lead to lower rates for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately these positives are coupled with some very 
significant concerns that we have.  I will list them briefly.  We 
are concerned that more power will be given to the CRTC, beyond 
what is called for by the legislation.  We are concerned about 
very expansive CRTC administrative power over operational 
concerns, which it is not equipped to manage and never has been. 
We are also concerned that there is no recognition of convergence 
between the broadcast and the telecommunications technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a forward looking bill.  It is a reactive bill.  It is 
reactive to industry and technological pressure.  It does not 
take us into the information age as the minister so clearly likes 
to tell us it does.  It continues to attempt to strip out 
broadcasting and the regulations associated with broadcasting. It 
is getting increasingly difficult to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage the government to address these concerns before the 
next reading of the bill.  Then we as a House can take what is 
the good part and the good start that we see in the bill, improve 
it, keep it on track and allow the Canadian industry to become a 
world leader.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite and the minister will entertain these 
changes to the bill and will allow the increase in the controls 
they are calling for within the greater powers to the CRTC to be 
uncoupled and removed from the bill, it will strengthen the 
entire package.  It will also strengthen the opportunity for 
Canadian interests to participate fully in the global information 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the government to entertain that.  I know it would be 
endorsed by many of members of this party and by many other 
members of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair has made a 
mistake in that there are no questions or comments following the

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Chair having done that, recognizes that the Bloc 
member who is supposed to be speaking at this time will have to 
be brought back into the House.  Therefore the Chair is at a loss 
as to exactly what the Chair should be doing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
surprised by the fact that 40-minute speeches can be followed by 
questions and comments.  That is why I have rushed back to my seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I am pleased to indicate that I agree in 
principle with Bill C-17, which eliminates the two remaining 
monopolies in the telecommunications field, that is Teleglobe 
Canada and Telesat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the government is using this bill to give 
additional regulatory powers to the CRTC, and supplementary 
legislative powers to the minister and the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This second aspect is indispensable because it must be clearly 
understood that this liberalization of telecommunications in Canada 
makes Canada and Quebec—and I stress the latter, because as a 
result Quebec has been stripped of all power in this area—two of 
the countries most open to competition. And that competition is 
being carried out right under the nose of a giant.  That giant is 
the United States, a country which makes massive use of 
international communications and one in which giant production 
companies with networks have a very strong presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in addition to these provisions, Quebec has 
supported—and the Bloc is also pleased about—the fact that, in 
negotiating the basic telecommunications agreement with the World 
Trade Organization, Canada insisted on preserving Canadian majority 
ownership and limiting direct and indirect foreign ownership to 
46.7%.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then is support for the underlying principles.  However, 
this bill also provides an opportunity to express three major 
concerns, questions and proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, this liberalization comes with promises for 
business.  Teleglobe had five years to prepare to face the 
international competition, and the loss of its market in Canada is 
amply compensated by an increase in its market share in the United 
States, first, and then in Europe and no doubt in developing 
countries.  We will come back to this, if time permits.  This 
liberalization is therefore favourable and suits business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the two other benefits that are supposed to result, 
namely access to WTO regulatory mechanisms—which has at times 
proven to be an advantage, albeit a less certain one—and 
promises to consumers that rates will drop as competition 
increases, recent events in the telephone and satellite 
telecommunications sectors show that this is not a sure thing.  So 
we invite the minister and the CRTC, who have given themselves new 
powers, to exercise them to ensure this liberalization, this 
globalization, not only benefits business, but also takes consumer 
interests into account.  This is the only condition that will 
ensure the government has the support it needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing a sort of revolution in the telecommunications 
field of the sort they went through at the end of the 19th century 
with the industrial revolution. 
Without a minimum of targeted and well-thought-out regulation, this 
revolution will take place at the expense of those who can afford it the 
least. Fortunately, this is not the 19th century; therefore, while 
creating a favourable environment for business, the government and the 
CRTC will have to protect consumers and ensure access to services at 
affordable rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only question we want to raise, effectively I hope. 
There is also the question of privacy. I would like to point out right 
off that there is a great deal of documentation on the subject. I will 
conclude with a comment, by saying that government ministers across the 
way have promised to introduce legislation on privacy. 
But we are continuing to build this information highway that creates 
extreme risk conditions without giving ourselves the legislation 
required to ensure people's privacy, which may result in Canada becoming 
a country with which the European Union for example will not exchange 
confidential information, especially since it already feels that Canada 
does not properly protect this kind of information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to read in the most lively fashion possible excerpts 
from a few documents. Rather than paraphrasing, I will quote directly 
what Paul-André Comeau, Quebec's privacy commissioner, said on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: “In Canada, the federal government and some provincial 
governments have established legislative frameworks setting out the 
principles that define the protection of personal information held by 
government institutions. 
But, he said, the main designers and owners of the new information 
systems are currently consortia largely made up of private businesses. 
It is these businesses which will soon—this was in 1994, so we are 
there now—with the implementation of the information highway, be in 
possession of all sorts of information on people. This information will 
circulate, it will be disseminated and spread in such a way that it may 
be difficult for people to protect the data relating to them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say: “To protect privacy, voluntary codes of ethics 
are often suggested. Such codes are less restrictive than the regulatory 
framework, especially for businesses. Yet, as interesting and useful as 
they are, these codes have flaws, a major one being that businesses 
refusing to comply with the code leave people totally 
unprotected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul-André Comeau then cites the Quebec legislation: “In this 
respect, Quebec serves as a model and a beacon in North America. 
The Quebec experience, still in its early stages at the time—which is 
no longer the case, although Quebec continues to be proud of this 
legislation—shows that it is possible to protect people's privacy and 
their personal information in the private sector, without adversely 
affecting the competitiveness of businesses and creating obligations 
that would prevent them from operating”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul-André Comeau is certainly not the only one who spoke highly of 
the Quebec law and who stressed the need for Canada to adopt similar 
legislation. In their report, the Fédération nationale des associations 
de consommateurs du Québec and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in 
Canada state that Canadians are quite concerned about the collection and 
use of personal information. People feel there is less control over 
personal information. 
Canadians are particularly concerned by the transmission of personal 
information between various organizations, especially private 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers want to know and control how their personal information 
is being used. The technological changes must not impose a new burden on 
individuals seeking to protect their privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I raising this issue in the context of the legislation on 
Teleglobe and Telesat? 
Because it is precisely through this information highway, through 
the Internet and the Intranet, through old-fashioned telephone 
lines and numerous new means of telecommunications, that 
information about people's private lives may be collected in the 
form of data banks that, if not protected, can seriously compromise 
people's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, businessmen are doing business and are concerned 
with maximizing their companies' competitiveness. 
But the role of the Quebec National Assembly and of the House of 
Commons of Canada is to take account of these concerns, to have a 
vision, to know to what extent this information highway is 
transmitting data in Canada through Quebec and towards other 
countries, to what extent this electronic highway, this series of 
networks requires that a way be found to protect confidential 
information.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that at the level of the OECD, the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, there is a great 
concern for another related issue, and that is to ensure that Internet 
can be used to safely conduct business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of course extremely important to find means to ensure 
reliability. Otherwise, Internet will not develop to meet all the 
expectations it is giving rise to today. But the same thing can be said 
about the protection of personal information. It must be remembered that 
when the Internet is used, there are always traces of these operations. 
These traces are numerous and varied on all existing systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the hon. member for Mount Royal was chair 
of a committee that submitted a report dated April 1997 and entitled 
“Privacy: where do we draw the line?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report stated, last spring: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the country, people are calling for a 
comprehensive and uniform package of rules to protect personal 
information. The scope of this legislation should be as wide 
as possible. Therefore, this committee believes that it should 
apply to Parliament and also all federal government 
departments, agencies, crown corporations, boards, commissions 
and government institutions and to the federally regulated 
private sector. 
The participants at our public discussions stated repeatedly 
that the voluntary application of codes of practice for the 
protection of personal information does not work. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the Government of Canada introduce 
new legislation that would replace the current act. This legislation 
would comply with the requirements of the Canadian Charter of Privacy 
Rights and would apply to all departments and also to all the industries 
and companies subject to the act. This legislation should be enacted by 
the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add this little part that I find very important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are advancing on the information highway, most of 
our daily activities leave an electronic trail that many data 
banks can register. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that current legislation in Canada is inadequate and 
that this situation also affects Quebec citizens in their international 
relations. An important player also added his voice to all these 
concerns, and this is the Privacy Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Phillips, who, 
in his 1996-97 annual report, reminded us of the promise made by the 
then Minister of Justice that legislation would be introduced to protect 
privacy in a concrete and binding manner in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated “The Commission has been calling for such an initiative 
for a long time”, and he added, referring to the report by the hon. 
member for Mount Royal, “that the committee devoted almost a full year 
to the review of the impacts on privacy of new technologies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could continue, but I believe that this act provides the 
opportunity to state clearly that further development of the information 
highway can only be welcomed if we succeed in implementing ways to 
protect privacy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the introduction of this bill affords an occasion 
not only to rejoice that a number of businesses are being given the 
opportunity to be competitive not only in Canada but on the world 
market as well, but also—and I will word it this way—the market 
and the competition alone, I repeat, the market and the competition 
alone, are not sufficient to ensure access for all at a reasonable 
price, as two recent examples have shown: the telephone situation 
and the bankruptcy of Alphastar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, the government, the CRTC, cannot do otherwise 
than to listen to businesses.  I understand this, because we are 
aware that, on the world scale, the biggest Quebec companies are 
only middle-sized or sometimes even smaller. 
So, yes, businesses need to grow and this brings considerable 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible, however, to believe that our businesses' 
competitiveness comes solely from the pockets of consumers, and 
often from the most disadvantaged among them.  We must therefore 
continue to make telecommunications services available, and to 
increase access to them.  This bears repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International services, and all other telecommunications 
services, must be not only accessible, but also affordable.  They 
must be affordable.  The minister, the CRTC, the government and the 
governor in council must face up to their responsibility for 
issuing operating licences to businesses that could not be 
economically viable.  You will realize I am referring to the 
experience with Alphastar, which I shall return to in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the bill contains good news, but if the 
minister intends to exercise the powers he is giving himself, as 
set out in clause 6, there will be an amendment to the 
Telecommunications Act to permit increased charges to set up a fund 
to promote uninterrupted telecommunications services.  We should 
note clause 8 too. It gives the bill teeth, if the minister or the 
CRTC or the government so want, to enact new statutory or 
regulatory provisions.  My understanding is that these provisions 
will prevent a repeat of something like Alphastar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the liberty of pointing out that telephone 
companies denied by the CRTC the increased revenues resulting from 
the rate increases they sought won their case with the government, 
which, rather than doing what the CRTC asked, that is, reducing 
long distance rates, let them keep the whole amount.  We might 
think there was talk of investments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is to be noted that they used it to increase dividends 
to 12.5%. All this is complicated. We know that telephone rates have 
increased tremendously. In the Montreal region, they have gone from a 
little over $12 in 1992 up to $21 now, and if the government agrees with 
the applications being made the rate will climb to $27. I am talking 
about Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis made strong representations to 
ensure that, in northern Quebec, telephone companies, which used to be 
managed by the Quebec company, would no longer be able to significantly 
raise telephone rates and keep the resulting profits. 
What the hon. member asked, and this is absolutely indispensable, is 
that while a competitive market should be allowed, companies interested 
in providing services should all be subject to the same regulations and 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies are once again before the CRTC. There is a movement in 
Quebec and across Canada asking that this new application be rejected by 
the CRTC. The minister has the authority to tell the CRTC that it is 
better for basic services to continue to mean something and that, 
consequently, their costs should not be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring, our former critic who will have the floor after me, 
was already saying that telephone costs should not be increased until it 
was demonstrated that such a measure would not change the meaning of 
basic telephone services. Current rates are taking us away from the 
basic rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that the number of telephone users has not 
diminished, that there have not been a large number of cancellations. 
What I am about to say is true in the case of small and medium size 
businesses, which won their case but could still be subject to rate 
increases, but it is even more true for low and very low income people. 
The telephone can be considered as something so indispensable that if 
people's income is reduced, some will go so far as to deprive their 
children of food to keep their telephone. So, when considering what a 
basic telephone service is, it is not possible to keep talking about 
increases strictly in the context of national and international 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is important for businesses to have conditions that will 
help them, but this is impossible. 
We must look at the overall picture, and it cannot be done. As I said 
earlier, I am pleased to see that the government wants to create a fund 
to subsidize, if need be, regions where costs would be greater, so that 
a basic communication service, including not only telephone but also 
basic telecommunications services, would be maintained.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential, again, so that the population will know, that such 
“economic modernization” not be undertaken at their expense. Why should 
we want to compete in Europe? Why should the government say “I am 
allowing businesses to compete in the United States and Europe”, if this 
results in penalizing the average consumer or the consumer with a small 
income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the issue that parliamentarians, the House of Commons, the 
National Assembly must address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, when things like the Alphastar case are involved, the 
government cannot stand idly by and let the market make the rules. 
Satellite communications today are still considered important because 
there are areas in Quebec that do not have access to cable and where 
there are no digital telephone lines. Therefore, they do not have access 
to Internet and cannot rely on communications that elsewhere are basic 
commodities. There are self-employed workers and also small businesses 
who depend on these. It is always possible for them to be connected, but 
then they have to pay long distance charges, and this makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So satellite communications for access to television are important, 
but the minister has instructed the CRTC by an order in council not to 
consider economic viability when awarding licences to businesses. The 
result was, as observers had foreseen, that Alphastar, which had 6,000 
subscribers in Canada, went bankrupt. 
People were left with lovely dishes with which they could decorate their 
gardens, but which had cost them hundreds of dollars, and also with 
subscriptions that also cost them hundred of dollars and which are now 
useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The market cannot ensure fairness in all cases, and in this case, 
consumer protection required that there be basic safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government is creating appropriate mechanisms 
and we sincerely hope that it will use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is another grave concern that I would like to 
address in relation to this bill. I just spoke about the lack of powers 
in Quebec in the area of broadcasting and telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is worthwhile to take a few minutes of my colleague's 
precious time to go over this. 
We are always well advised to ensure that our colleagues better 
understand Quebec, of which they often get tired, but whose demands are 
always based on the fact that Quebec is a people and a nation. 
Binational countries are rare in this world, and many of them have not 
succeeded in holding together—binational or trinational if we consider 
first nations, as we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind you that communications are a field that 
Quebec claimed very early, I would say from the very beginning, when it 
first appeared, and it was not a bad separatist who did so, at the time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back in February 1929, Alexandre Taschereau, the Liberal 
premier of Quebec, introduced a bill to give Quebec exclusive 
jurisdiction over the emerging broadcasting industry. Those were the 
days, before the CBC, when broadcasts were often drowned out by all 
sorts of interference. Liberal premier Taschereau, who was no doubt a 
federalist, a staunch federalist, claimed exclusive jurisdiction over 
broadcasting and wanted Quebec to operate its own radio stations. This 
eventually lead to the creation of Radio Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around the same time, in Canada, there was a royal commission on 
radio broadcasting, the Aird Commission. It tabled its report in the 
fall of 1929 and recommended that exclusive jurisdiction over radio 
broadcasting be given to the central government. 
Its model was based on the BBC, a publicly owned network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was asked to settle the issue? The supreme court, in 1931. What 
do you think it decided? Naturally, it decided this was an exclusive 
jurisdiction of Canada, but the Government of Quebec, not satisfied with 
this ruling, submitted the matter to the Privy Council, which upheld the 
supreme court's decision in 1932. The first Canadian Radio Broadcasting 
Act was passed in May 1932, and, in 1936, the CBC was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1945, after the war, Maurice Duplessis, the premier of Quebec, 
in the middle of a fight against university subsidization—at the 
time, Duplessis did not want Quebec universities to receive federal 
subsidies—contended this was an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
Duplessis then proceeded to legislate, to introduce a bill, to establish 
a provincial radio broadcasting service. Radio Quebec was born. 
In September 1973, Robert Bourassa, a Liberal premier, and more of 
a federalist than Duplessis, said shortly after being elected: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cultural matters, the decision making centres we need 
for our own cultural security will have to be transferred, 
particularly in the telecommunications sector.  Here again, it 
is a simple matter of common sense, because we cannot leave it 
to an anglophone majority to ensure the cultural security of 
a francophone minority. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was what Robert Bourassa said.  Jean-Paul L'Allier, his 
Minister of Communications, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to Quebec in the first instance to develop a 
global communications policy. 
This policy is indissociable from the development of its 
education system, its culture and everything that comes under 
Quebec's domain. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing in Meech or Charlottetown on this issue, but 
it continued to be discussed.  In 1994, we know that the supreme 
court ruled against Quebec with respect to telephone services and 
the Régie des télécommunications du Québec ceased to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this today because the information highway, this 
telecommunications revolution, is drawing the highway ever closer 
to its contents.  If the medium is the message, what can we say 
about the present information highway and the relationship between 
the road and what travels on it, roads that are closed and small 
roads that are open?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, we agree in principle with this bill, which will end 
monopolies.  We are all the more in agreement because the 
government is giving the CRTC, the governor in council and itself 
greater regulatory powers to ensure that there are controls over 
how this liberalization takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this bill is an opportunity for us to insist, and we 
are going to keep coming back to this, that there be legislation to 
protect personal information, in order to assure consumers that 
this liberalization that is supposed to provide the necessary 
conditions for businesses to position themselves on the market does 
not come about at the expense of those at the low end of the wage 
scale and of outlying regions, or take consumers for a ride, as 
happened in the case of Alphastar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is an opportunity for Quebec to say that it will 
need this jurisdiction for its culture, and the only way we have 
found to advance this to date is by seeking our sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unlike my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, the NDP is opposed 
to Bill C-17.  We do not even favour the bill in principle.  We 
are flatly opposed to this bill, the intent of which is to 
implement the general agreement on trade and services, GATS as it 
is known, and the agreement on basic telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are opposed to the bill is that Bill C-17 is 
part of the process of completing the free trade agreements and 
the implementation of the regulations of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this bill because we opposed the negotiated free trade 
agreements which were against the interests of ordinary 
Canadians. The NDP, unlike other parties that have been all over 
the map on this issue, has consistently stood in opposition of 
these liberalized trade agreements from the beginning of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement to NAFTA and now the MAI.  In 
1997 we are still speaking in opposition to these trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth taking a few moments to look at the context of Bill 
C-17 and the history of these free trade agreements. The trade 
agreements of the last decade, if we look at the overall results, 
have made it easier for corporations to increase their profits 
and harder for workers to keep their wages and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of this is reflected in Statistics Canada reports. 
Corporate profits have increased dramatically, while real family 
income has declined and masses of jobs lost in this country. The 
reality is that deals like the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement 
and the North American Free Trade Agreement encourage 
corporations to go where wages and benefits are lower and where 
environmental regulations are weaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements are designed to increase the mobility of 
capital and goods, making it easier for corporations and the 
wealthy to avoid paying taxes.  In other words, these deals are 
designed to push down Canadian wages and social programs like 
medicare, environmental protection, safety and labour standards 
and the revenue from taxes to pay for our desperately needed 
public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago when the FTA was signed the Canadian people heard 
promises of the jobs that would abound.  We heard the promises of 
greater prosperity for Canada and for Canadians that would result 
from increased trade.  We heard promises of better social 
programs and unimpaired Canadian sovereignty.  All these promises 
stand revealed today as nothing but a fraud. We only have to look 
at the facts to see what free trade has meant a decade later.  It 
has been a disaster for Canada and for Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Canada entered into free trade agreements, we have 
experienced the longest period of sustained high unemployment and 
the worst social and economic conditions since the 1930s. 
That is in stark contrast to the promises and the issues that 
were held out as being the things which would change our economy 
since the advent of these agreements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have experienced 84 straight months of unemployment at 
9% or more.  What kind of record is that under these free trade 
deals?  We have seen the disappearance of 100,000 direct jobs in 
the public sector.  We have seen the decline in labour force 
participation, which has fallen from 67.5% prior to the recession 
to less than 65% today.  That is equivalent to the loss of 
700,000 jobs.  If we included these discouraged workers in the 
official tallies of unemployment, it would bring our unemployment 
rate to something around 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, we have had an appalling crisis for young 
people, whose participation rate has plummeted from 70% before 
the recession to barely 60% today.  If we included the young 
people who have also been discouraged, then the official 
unemployment rate would almost double for young people, going 
from 16.5% to 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have witnessed is the declining quality of jobs in the 
Canadian economy with the NAFTA and a growing emphasis on part 
time work and low wage jobs.  Even our unemployment benefits, 
which used to cover 87% of Canadians who were jobless, are now 
going to only about 40% of people who are unemployed, and 25% of 
Canada's manufacturing base was wiped out in the first three 
years after signing the FTA.  That is the real story of—

Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
understand that Bill C-17, an act to amend the Telecommunications 
Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act, 
is what we are debating this afternoon.  I would ask for your 
guidance that we debate on that subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair was 
following the hon. member very closely.  The hon. member was 
debating telecommunications, its relevance to free trade and the 
effect of this bill on the implementation of free trade.  The 
Chair would consider the debate to be relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for those words. 
In fact, the background of the free trade agreement is very 
relevant to the bill before us today.  In my discussion I will be 
moving right into the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that we wish to emphasize is that the real story of 
the NAFTA, when we look at this bill, has not been a success for 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going to the background of the bill before us today, we know 
that on February 15 of this year at the World Trade Organization 
Canada and 68 other countries concluded a multilateral agreement 
to liberalize trade and investment in telecommunications 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GATS agreement on basic telecommunications followed the 
conclusion of the information technology agreement which 
liberalized trade in information technology equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the GATS the federal government has said that it is 
committed to eliminating the two remaining areas now closed to 
competition, overseas telephone service and fixed satellite 
services.  As a result, Teleglobe's monopoly will end on October 
1, 1998 and Telesat's monopoly will end on March 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, as part of this agreement, has also agreed to remove 
foreign ownership restrictions in satellite earth stations and 
the landing of international submarine cables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key elements of Canada's offer under the GATS agreement on 
basic telecommunications are the elimination of the remaining 
monopolies of Teleglobe and Telesat, the liberalization of 
traffic routing restrictions, the elimination of minimum Canadian 
equity requirements for mobile satellite systems, the elimination 
of the special foreign ownership limits applicable to Teleglobe 
Canada, the elimination of the foreign ownership limits for 
international submarine cables and the adoption of a regulatory 
reference paper which sets out principles of regulations for all 
the signatory countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's position on this?  We have been told by 
the industry minister that the changes contemplated in the bill 
before the House today, along with the GATT agreement, will lead 
to increased business opportunities for Canada's 
telecommunications industry at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that Canada's telecommunications firms will have 
easier access to a more competitive international market and will 
capture a larger share of the $880 billion global 
telecommunications industry. Those are the same old arguments 
that were put before the people of Canada under FTA and under 
NAFTA.  I would suggest that what we are really experiencing, 
instead of the benefits that we have been told that we will get, 
is the Americanization of all aspects of Canadian life as a 
result of these trade deals and now as a result of this bill if 
it is passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a moment to look at what that experience 
has been for some Canadian companies.  Think about the company 
CN, the railroad which once linked our country together and 
pioneered public broadcasting and our national airline. What 
happened to that company?  It was sacrificed as a result of free 
trade.  CN was sold for half of what it was worth and it is now 
owned 70% by Americans.  It is now busy selling off parts of the 
rail network which, I might add, was built at public expense. It 
is being sold to other U.S. companies.  All of the lines of 
northern Manitoba, including the port of Churchill plus two 
Saskatchewan lines, have been sold to Omnitrax of Denver, U.S.A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now virtually impossible for Canadians to buy Canadian if 
they want to do so because whole sectors of our economy, such as 
pulp and paper and advertising, have been taken over by U.S. 
corporations.  Now we are facing the same thing in the bill that 
is before us today.  That is the real history of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of getting out of these agreements and defending 
Canadian business interests and public interests, the Liberals 
ratified Mulroney's NAFTA and are now currently negotiating to 
extend NAFTA's investment section into a large new agreement 
called the multilateral agreement on investment. However, they do 
not have a public mandate to go ahead with the program under the 
MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, we all know that unless there is massive opposition 
by the public that the Liberals are prepared to sign the 
multilateral agreement on investment.  They will be egged on to 
do so by the Reform and the Conservative parties, pushed and 
aided by corporations and their CEOs, to whom these parties are 
best friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely necessary that these trade agreements and the 
bill that is before us today be advanced in terms of the public 
interest and not just corporate interests.  They have to be 
advanced in terms of what will benefit Canadians. Trade 
liberalization should help improve wages and working conditions, 
not drive them down to the levels that exist in developing parts 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be working for trade agreements that will help 
Canadian families and will include the introduction of real, 
enforceable and progressive social, labour and environmental 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be working for stricter measures to prevent corporate 
tax evasion and stronger financial reporting requirements for 
large corporations that are not publicly traded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be working with its trading partners to 
develop international standards for taxation of income from 
capital to counter tax avoidance and evasion by corporations and 
the super wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government should be focusing on instead of 
opening up the flood gates and saying that under trade 
liberalization that we are going to somehow benefit.  The 
contrary is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need the introduction of an international tax to control 
speculative currency trading.  In recent years, such speculation 
has undermined some national economies, forcing up interest rates 
and throwing people out of work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is obvious to anybody who has any understanding at all about how 
jobs are created or who has had any contact with business that 
deregulating these government monopolies contributes to 
tremendous levels of employment and helps people get jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the telecommunications industry prior to becoming a 
member of Parliament and experienced the deregulation of the 
telephone and telex systems which were partially under the CRTC 
and Teleglobe in the early 1980s.  The expansion of the 
telecommunications industry as a result is phenomenal.  Northern 
Telecom expanded dramatically and the telecommunications industry 
worldwide has grown and created huge numbers of jobs as a result 
of deregulation and of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, anyone who has been in business or 
understands how jobs are created knows it is high taxation that 
causes unemployment, that has caused our 83 months of 
unemployment, not deregulation of government monopolies.  It is 
high taxation, over-government regulation and government 
overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government spending could create jobs—it has already 
overspent by $600 billion—we should have three jobs each by now. 
It is totally ludicrous to blame deregulation for high 
unemployment.  It does not make sense to anybody who really 
thinks about the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member thinks that NAFTA is a disaster, what could she 
say to the people in my riding like Mr. Hans Gawenda or Mr. Peter 
Belding?  Like dozens of other small businesspeople, they have 
expanded their businesses up to 50 employees and more from just 
one or two because NAFTA allowed them to do business in the 
United States, to get rid of all the tariffs that prevented them 
from assembling products in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some old, worn out, tired, oversubsidized industries went out of 
action, such as the shipbuilding industry in my riding that never 
could compete, but in its place are thousands of new jobs in 
these deregulated industries, in these new industries available 
through NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member rationalize her position with the 
facts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  Clearly we have a strong difference of opinion on the 
effect of trade liberalization on Canadians, Canadian jobs and 
Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue very strongly that deregulation is part of a global 
agenda that is driving us in a direction where larger 
corporations, multinational corporations, transnational 
corporations are gaining greater control.  The overall effect of 
that has not been to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of fair competition.  We are in favour of 
regulation that sets a level playing field.  That is not what 
NAFTA and FTA are about.  That is not what the MAI is about.  MAI 
and these trade liberalization agreements are about corporate 
rule.  They are about giving more power to corporations and 
driving down wages, ensuring that basically there are no 
environmental standards left.

would argue the opposite.  Canada has had a long tradition in the

see a government committed to industrial infrastructure and to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder how a tax, as the NDP member has termed it, on currency 
trading creates jobs.  Investment and growth in the economy are 
what creates jobs.  But restricting Canada's access to capital 
markets and to currency does not. Is she possibly proposing that 
Canada move to a gold standard rather than having a free floating 
currency?  How does the free flow of capital stimulate investment 
and create jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem we are witnessing is that with agreements 
like NAFTA and now the MAI there will be no rules about the 
movement of capital around the world where huge profits are being 
made. There is more than enough evidence to show that very large 
corporations are making record profits at the expense of jobs. 
There needs to be in the context of a globalized economy some 
international institutions and structures that have the ability 
to ensure that windfall profits are recouped for public benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member cannot understand that and understand that we are 
talking about a matter of financial and social equity, then I 
guess we have a very different view of how things should operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP see that under the trade liberalization we are 
transferring power to very powerful corporations that have 
absolutely no accountability. There are some very undemocratic 
organizations.  Who are they accountable to?  Not to governments, 
not to the people of Canada or any country. The very real issue 
is whether they are creating jobs in the long run. There is a 
small percentage of people who are making enormous profits at the 
expense of millions of ordinary people, workers who are getting 
low wages or people who have been thrown out of work. That is why 
we need to have a fair and open system where we can ensure that 
windfall profits are properly taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked the question and, 
indeed, a lack of understanding of economics was proven by the 
member from the NDP.  I have done a fair amount of trading and as 
far as I know the markets, if Canada were to go ahead and create 
a tax on currency trading unilaterally, we could be guaranteed 
there would be a sucking sound which would be the capital leaving 
this country.  Or capital may never come into the country again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By proposing that we tax these transactions, the member is 
actually encouraging the driving out of capital.  I just do not 
understand how that would create jobs.  Obviously in the member's 
fantasy world the economy has orange skies if she believes that 
this may work in creating jobs.  It will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is really unfortunate 
that the member would dismiss another point of view and other 
arguments as somehow being a fantasy.  If the member would listen 
closely to what really is now developing as a huge concern for 
Canadians about the impact of trade liberalization, then the 
member would not be so quick to judge that these concerns are 
somehow a fantasy or should not be taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the member had been listening closely he would have 
heard that what was being advanced in our comments on the bill 
was the need for international institutions that have the ability 
to also provide regulations.  We are facing globalization. 
Therefore, the issue before us is how to ensure that there is a 
level playing field and that Canadians do not lose out in the 
short run as well as the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member needs to listen carefully to what is actually being 
put forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if Canada was unilaterally 
to go ahead and act against currency trading or if there were to 
be a multinational universal agreement in terms of taxing 
currency trading, all we would be doing is regulating it to 
death.   What would be the point of even having a floating 
currency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for the NDP should suggest a fixed currency in 
terms of a gold standard, for example, rather than suggest that 
somehow the multilateral agreement should end it.  It is not that 
I support it necessarily but then at least it could be credibly 
argued from her point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, very briefly I think it 
comes down to a question of priorities.  The priority for the NDP 
is to ensure that Canadians have good jobs. We have seen a 
drastic decline in that regard under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party has offered in that regard has been no 
different from that offered by the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty,

am pleased to say that the PC caucus will be supporting the 
legislation.  We see it as a way to prove to the rest of the 
world that we can be competitive, can create jobs and can do it 
through a free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that the NDP caucus still fights against the free 
trade agreement.  I guess it is not as changeable as the Liberal 
Party and the Government of Canada are today.  All parties fought 
against the free trade agreement when we brought it in back in 
1988.  Basically it was a big issue.  It was to be terrible for 
Canada.  At least the Liberals had sense enough to realize that 
it was good for Canada.  They have been building on it ever 
since.  The NDP is consistent in its opposition even when it is a 
good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my brief time with the member for 
Compton—Stanstead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 amends the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe 
Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act in keeping with our 
obligations to liberalize basic international telecommunications 
services under the GATS, an agreement which Canada signed this 
past February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of the GATS, Canada agreed to end monopolies 
held in the area of overseas telephone services and fixed 
satellite services.  Canada also agreed to eliminate restrictions 
on foreign ownership in satellite earth stations and the laying 
of international submarine cables.  Bill C-17 ensures that Canada 
fulfils these obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 amends the Telecommunications Act by establishing a 
licensing regime for international service providers to be 
administered by the CRTC.  This is a similar system to that of 
many other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 empowers the CRTC to contract out the need for a 
telecommunications numbering service and overseeing the 
collection and distribution of local subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 also clarifies the Telecommunications Act with respect 
to the role of Industry Canada in the certification and 
inspection of telecommunications equipment for use in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the integrity of our telecommunications 
system under the bill non-certified equipment cannot be used in 
Canada.  The bill also gives Industry Canada powers to set 
technical standards, inspect equipment and enforce penalties for 
those selling non-standard equipment within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act is 
amended by repealing the provisions that create a monopoly 
environment in Teleglobe Canada.  It opens up the 
telecommunications market between Canada and the rest of the 
world, allowing other providers the opportunity to provide 
services within Canada.  This is expected to result in cheaper 
long distance rates due to increased competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opening up of the telecommunications industry is a policy of 
the Progressive Conservative Party which began in 1987 when we 
privatized Teleglobe Canada.  After a few years of functioning as 
a private sector business Teleglobe's management decided to 
expand its operations. 
In 1995 it recognized that its future was in servicing foreign 
markets and it proceeded to do so.  Now two years later it has 
increased its share of telecommunications carrier services 
between several non-Canadian destinations by over threefold.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the PC Party began privatizing many crown corporations 
federal Liberal Party members in particular fought against the 
plans.  They believed we would lose our identity in the process 
but are now expanding on the achievements of our party by further 
opening up markets and allowing non-Canadian carriers access to 
our telecommunications sector.  Is it not odd how they have 
changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we privatized Telesat Canada the official opposition of the 
day also fought against our plans, stating that it needed all the 
government support it could muster to challenge the world in the 
face of global competition.  Reformers have gone now from 
advocating interference to opting for a freer marketplace.  With 
the FTA and the North American Free Trade Agreement the PC Party 
further liberalized trade in telecommunications for Canadian 
businesses.  The official opposition of the day also fought 
against these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They now stand as avid free traders, signing the GATS and 
extending the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Our 
obligations under the GATS mean that Teleglobe Canada will 
relinquish its exclusive access to the Canadian market as of 
October 1, 1998.  Telesat's monopoly will end on March 1, 2000. 
Therefore current ownership restrictions have to be removed from 
the Telecommunications Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus supports the GATS because it is a free trade 
agreement.  We continue to support the principle of free trade. 
The relinquishing of Teleglobe Canada's exclusive rights to the 
Canadian market has led the U.S. to open up access to its market, 
which is what we thought would happen in the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also benefits from greater access to European and other 
developing nations.  Furthermore, as I stated earlier, the 
consumer will be rewarded with the possibility of cheaper long 
distance rates due to increased competition in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Telesat divestiture act was being debated it was argued 
that the 10-year monopoly was not enough; it had to be longer. 
The government now realizes the 10 years was more than enough. 
After 8 years we are debating the opening of the marketplace. 
Industry wants less control in exchange for open access to the 
rest of the world. That is really the principle of the free trade 
agreement.  It will not grow without these changes and the 
government has finally recognized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party is supporting the legislation because it continues 
the process we started of enhancing the competitiveness of 
Canadian firms.  It is because of our initiatives that Canadians 
enjoy the great degree of prosperity we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our evolutionary approach has produced well positioned Canadian 
companies that are today strong enough to compete globally.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to make some comments with regard to the Tory member 
who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those oh so avid free trading Tories are the ones who brought us 
the GST, the ones who did not eliminate the interprovincial 
barriers to trade or make significant steps to that effect.  My 
comments are not strictly reserved for them.  They are also 
directed to the Liberals across the way.  I will say in the NDP's 
defence that it was against free trade then and is against free 
trade now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have flip flopped all over on the issue.  They were 
against it.  Now they are for it.  Now they are continuing it, 
promoting it and extending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Tories, those free marketeers, what a joke.  If they had 
been free marketeers, if they had actually believed in freer 
trade, in smaller government and less regulation, they would have 
balanced the budget in the nine years they had in power.  They 
failed to do so.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Tories across the way not talk about their record in 
terms of regulation and spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, oh those righteous 
Reformers.  They stand and criticize the Liberals.  They 
criticize NDP members for opposing the free trade legislation 
because they think they will build fences around Canada.  The 
Tories opened up Canada to the world.  We showed the world we 
could compete in telecommunications and in many other sectors, 
but now the only people who know anything about managing Canada's 
economy are the righteous Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a long way to go before they can do some of the good 
things the Conservative Party did for Canada.  Free trade was one 
of them and the GST was another.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the country is in decent financial shape because of the

anybody who looks back in an historical unbiased way will say 
that both those actions of the Conservative Party were very good 
for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, years after their government 
fell from 177 seats down to two, lo and behold in 1997 the Tories 
are still proud of their record of introducing the goods and 
services tax.  Nothing ceases to amaze me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of regulation, these free marketeers kept the CRTC 
around through thick and thin during Tory governments, Brian 
Mulroney governments.  As part of its mandate some time after the 
turn of the millennium 100% of all programming in Canada was to 
be Canadian content.  There would not be anything allowed outside 
Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may be proud of some of the programs we produce in Canada, 
but shame on those Tories who supported the idea that people 
should not be able to watch anything other than Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member 
with respect to deregulation.  It is something we all have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a piece of legislation is being presented that deregulates 
and opens up a Canadian industry so that more jobs can be created 
through deregulation.  I cannot understand how the Reformers say 
in one case it is good and in the next case it is bad.  They have 
to be consistent.  In our case we are consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in free trade.  It creates jobs in Canada and we are 
proud of our record on that accomplishment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-17, introduced last week by 
the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Telecommunications Act and Teleglobe Canada Reorganization 
and Divestiture Act follow in the path of removing monopolies and 
trade barriers in the service sector to allow Canadian firms to 
capitalize on their strong reputation in the international 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's $18 billion telecommunications industry provides over a 
145,000 direct and indirect jobs to the Canadian economy.  The 
international telecommunications sector stood at $770 billion in 
value in 1995 and is expected to grow to $1.2 trillion in 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows our Canadian telecommunications sector to serve 
the international community and increase its overall value by 
gaining valuable market access not only to the world's largest 
telecommunications nation, the United States, but also in 65 
other markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada held extensive negotiations with the United States at the 
World Trade Organization last February where 67 countries were 
involved in trade services agreement negotiations.  Canada 
coupled with the United States are important players in the 
international telecommunications industry because we have the 
largest volume of bilateral telephone traffic in the world.  We 
obviously love to talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the days of Alexander Graham Bell and Marconi Canada, 
Canada has been a major in telecommunications.  As with any trade 
objective certain aspects of the bill before us should be given 
serious consideration.  Before I outline these portions of the 
bill I would like to examine the importance of Canada's overall 
trade competitiveness today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note several factors that seem to surround 
our trade partnerships today.  Since the signing of the free 
trade agreement and the subsequent NAFTA negotiations, Canada has 
become a prominent player on the international trade scene. 
Thanks to the foresight of a previous government, Canada has 
recognized the importance of free trade in today's global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the original free trade agreement Canada's ability to 
secure its place in the vast North American marketplace could 
have been lost forever.  Thankfully the once hotly debated issue 
of free trade has even been accepted by many groups and 
individuals adamantly opposed to it in 1998. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of a previous government's initiative Canada's main 
objective of having secure access to the American market is now a 
reality and this bill increases that access. With it comes 
certain consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the American economy is considerably larger than our own, 
we have found ourselves at times willing to trade away reasonable 
access to the American market in return for little or limited 
access.  This has caused some to decry that free trade with the 
U.S. is really only a form of managed trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples where the government has failed in this area. 
The reason lies in the tentative nature in which Canada 
approaches invoking trade remedies and the lack of progress in 
negotiations surrounding this topic. Granted, this can create 
difficulty for certain industry sectors.  However it is part and 
parcel of holding such open access to the American market, a 
position which many other countries would certainly relish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are undeniable.  Canada's exports have grown from $105 
billion before free trade to $245 billion last year.  American 
imports have also grown substantially, from $92 billion to $210 
billion.  Overall, Canada's trade surplus has grown considerably, 
reaching the $40 billion level last year. Furthermore, free trade 
has catalysed significant growth in productivity and has promoted 
economies of scale.  The result has yielded greater Canadian 
competitiveness in export merchandise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill though deals with the service sector and follows the 
World Trade Agreement reached last February in Geneva.  When one 
studies a bill like this, it is useful to know the context in 
which it was signed.  The World Trade Organization agreement saw 
Europe and the United States allow greater foreign control of 
telephone service companies thereby catalysing competition and 
construction of the international networks, thereby following the 
philosophy of the federal trade agreement and ensuring that 
Canadian firms have market access to the larger international 
markets like the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, the government has had to end monopolies held by two 
Canadian companies in key sectors.  Teleglobe Canada's monopoly 
on overseas telecommunications will end in October 1998 while 
Telesat Canada, which now controls all domestic long distance 
satellite phone service, will see its monopoly end in March 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private sector industry officials state that these types of 
concessions were necessary, given that the North American market 
is heading in the direction of open access enabling Canadian 
firms to partner with others to offer international services. 
Furthermore the increase in international market access will also 
benefit telecommunications equipment manufacturers in Canada, 
some being in my own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the government is willing to advocate 
the privatization by the previous Conservative government of 
Teleglobe and Telesat Canada.  At the time the former opposition 
party argued that we would lose our identity if the privatization 
process continued.  This is another example of the Liberal 
government's ability to read public opinion polls and change 
sides on an issue depending on how it will play with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the government is now supporting and 
furthering the policy of the previous government, our party will 
support Bill C-17.  I look forward to having further discussions 
on this bill in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again I cannot resist commenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had Tories standing in the House today talking about how 
they do not like monopolies and how they are encouraged by these 
liberalizing trade initiatives.  However, they still have people 
out and about in my province who are in favour of monopolies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, Harvey Andre, who used to be the government 
House whip and was also in charge of Canada Post, still believes 
in Canada Post and to this day writes letters to Calgary 
publications.  He said that Canada Post should have an exclusive 
monopoly and that nobody else should be able to deliver mail in 
the country, that if there is a courier within a city that can 
deliver mail overnight for 19¢, they should not be allowed to do 
it.  As a result, Harvey Andre was in support of disallowing the 
city of Calgary to deliver bills more cheaply than Canada Post 
could do it. As well, Harvey Andre supports Canada Post using 
Purolator Courier to subsidize its competition against United 
Parcel Service and Federal Express as private couriers.

subsidize, driving its private competitors out of its industry.

little bit further than that, we are looking a little further 
down the road as we always have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is a little scary.  We have come a long way.  The hon.

government.  That would really be a scary thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of the whole thing is that it was the Tory

not think anything else need be said on it.

letters to the newspaper and so on in my riding, not to say that 
there might not be at some stage but there is certainly not right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that at least those PCs who are here in this 
House are talking more and more about taking away these 
monopolies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that I was in the telecommunications 
industry prior to becoming a member of Parliament and was 
directly involved with the CRTC and Teleglobe. Anyone who was 
directly involved in that industry can see the tremendous 
benefits that have occurred from deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prices of telephone calls for example.  We see 
advertisements now on television where calls can be made to 
anywhere in the country on Sunday for 10¢ or 5¢, or whatever it 
is. Certainly in the early 1980s it would be something like $1.60 
a minute.  When we go back those 15 years or more we can see that 
it was really a tremendously expensive exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These deregulations benefit ordinary people, the average wage 
earner tremendously.  I was very pleased to hear from the content 
of the speech that at least the Tories are starting to see that 
taking monopolies out of existence is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a scary thought in 
that I am having to agree with Reform, but I guess there again

telecommunications and liberalizing global telecommunications. 
That agreement covers more than 69 countries with more than 90% 
of the world's $880 billion telecommunications market. It 
liberalizes basic telecommunications services which includes 
voice and data but not broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good deal for Canada.  It will dramatically expand the 
$880 billion world market in telecommunications services, 
creating a demand for Canadian products and services.  That will 
lead to more high quality jobs and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications are vital to Canada and have always been, 
ever since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. 
Canadians have gone on to become leaders in the 
telecommunications industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we already have in place the world's first coast to 
coast commercial microwave network, the world's longest fibre 
optic communications network, the world's two longest competitive 
cellular networks, the world's first national digital microwave 
network, and the world's first domestic geostationary satellite 
telecommunications network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see why the telecommunications industry is an 
essential component of the Canadian economy.  It employs some 
115,000 people and accounts for 3.36% of our GDP.  These are high 
wage jobs with average weekly earnings that are 44% higher than 
in all industries combined. Telecommunications is also a pivotal 
enabling technology that is increasingly an integral part of all 
types of businesses and public sector agencies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill now before the House continues the liberalization of 
Canada's telecommunications market begun more than 10 years ago. 
We have already seen the benefits of that domestic liberalization 
for Canadians and Canadian telecommunications companies.  Now we 
will see them in the international arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the government's key objectives during the GATS 
negotiations was to gain more access to foreign markets for 
Canadian telecommunications companies. That goal was achieved. 
These companies will now have more secure access to markets like 
the United States, the European Union, Japan, and the developing 
markets of Asia and Latin America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the deal Canada will make a number of changes to its 
domestic regime.  We have made the following undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will remove all restrictions on the use of foreign controlled 
global mobile satellites that provide services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will end the Telesat monopoly on fixed satellite services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will maintain our transparent and independent regulatory and 
competition regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will end Teleglobe Canada's monopoly on overseas traffic and 
its special ownership restrictions which prohibit investment by 
foreign telecommunications carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will allow 100% foreign ownership and control of 
international submarine cable landings in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will however continue our overall foreign investments rules 
to ensure that our industry remains Canadian owned and 
controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement on basic telecommunications is also an 
international milestone.  GATS which came into effect on January 
1, 1995 is the first ever multilateral set of rules for trade in 
services.  It covers almost all the service sectors, including 
with this agreement basic telecommunications services.  The new 
agreement establishes a clear set of multilateral rules in a 
sector that previously had no rules.  Licensing processes will be 
governed by clear rules and disputes will be resolved in a timely 
manner through the WTO dispute settlement process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO dispute settlement understanding, or DSU, provides a 
number of mechanisms to resolve disagreements, including 
consultations, panels and reports.  The objective of this process 
is to arrange either the withdrawal of the offending measure or 
if that is impractical, compensation to the injured third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This dispute settlement process provides the safeguards needed 
to ensure that countries respect their commitments.  It is this 
mechanism that underpins the entire agreement. Without it no 
participating nation could have confidence that the terms of the 
agreement would be respected.  And without it no 
telecommunications company could have the confidence necessary to 
make investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute settlement process also provides Canada with a 
guarantee that the improved access we have won to the U.S. market 
is secure.  Under the agreement, reciprocity tests in the FCC 
licensing process will be severely restrained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the most open telecommunications markets in 
the world but the government believes strongly that an open 
market is not just about ownership.  It requires a commitment to 
clear, transparent and consistently applied ground rules that 
ensure access and fair treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this agreement Canada has secured the commitment and the 
many benefits the agreement will bring to Canadians. Canadian 
businesses and consumers will benefit from enhanced services 
provided by an emerging global telephone system by establishing a 
transparent and predictable framework for trade and investment in 
telecommunications services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement will create a demand for Canadian products and 
services as it opens the doors to foreign markets. This will 
support a strong domestic communications industry and ensure that 
Canadians will continue to enjoy excellent communications 
services at competitive prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given our many accomplishments in information and communications 
technology, there can be no doubt that Canada is poised to take 
full advantage of the newly expanded global markets in 
telecommunications services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technologies that are Canadian specialties are already creating 
whole new industries.  Knowledge based industries are growing 
faster than any other sector in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the most wired countries in the world, Canada has the 
communications and network infrastructure necessary to take full 
advantage of the information technologies such as electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government consulted extensively with the telecommunications 
industry and with consumer groups before signing the agreement 
and found strong support for it.  Now it will be up to Canadian 
industry to move forward in the global arena and take full 
advantage of the opportunities presented by this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I urge the House to act quickly in passing this 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. parliamentary secretary for those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is great that we have a gentleman who was a senior 
executive with one of the larger automobile manufacturing 
enterprises here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he could articulate for us exactly 
how the new licensing regime will help the establishment, 
development and growth of small businesses rather than big 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the act specifies that 
the controlling of the licensing is there to have an even playing 
field.  As we change from a monopoly organization into a freer 
licensing factor it allows more people to get licences and have 
the same rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important in this agreement. There are a number of 
things in this agreement which are trying to put forward an even 
playing field.  By having an even playing field this allows other 
entrants into the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in principle I suppose 
one would agree but I am asking myself the question that the bill 
does not in any way suggest how these licences will be granted, 
what the parameters will be and how the actual way in which these 
licences will be given.  How could this then create a level 
playing field when nobody knows exactly what the licences will be 
or what the guidelines will be as to who gets licences and what 
the conditions of the licences will be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one must understand that 
once the act is passed there will be total consultation on this 
subject.  Licensing is not unique to Canada.  In fact, the U.S., 
the UK and the European Union have licensing agreements today and 
they apply them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore under the CRTC we would be consulting with the 
stakeholders and coming forth with the most effective licensing 
arrangement at the lowest costs.  That is always an item which is 
close to everybody's heart, to make sure that fees are very low 
and only for the implementation of the licensing. Those 
consultations will follow and the licensing rules will be 
established. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since this is the first 
occasion in this Parliament that I have had a chance to speak, I 
wish to congratulate the Speakers and to say that I will 
co-operate and respect this office and this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take the opportunity to thank very strongly the voters in 
my riding of London West.  I appreciate their support and I will 
continue to work with the dedication and the integrity and I hope 
the intelligence that they so richly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that as we work in this capacity 
as parliamentarians there is a price in our families. I want to 
thank my husband and my children and also say to my colleagues 
across the floor of the House that I hope that throughout this 
Parliament I can continue to treat them with the respect and 
courtesy that any member of Parliament deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak on behalf of Bill C-17 which supports 
the government's strategy to make Canada a leader in the 
knowledge economy of the 21st century.  Our overarching goal is 
to connect Canadians, to make Canada the most connected country 
in the world and to ensure that all Canadians have access to the 
information highway and the new economy which it supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has correctly identified this as 
perhaps the single most important action that the government can 
take to ensure our success in the knowledge based economy and I 
believe we all know that in our own ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underpinning any strategy to connect Canadians to this new 
economy is a competitive dynamic telecommunications industry. 
This is a very vital sector to the Canadian economy.  It produces 
already 115,000 high wage jobs, high intelligence jobs, jobs that 
are in all our sectors across this country.  It accounts for 
3.36% of our gross domestic product and I see this growing.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take these necessary steps to encourage this industry's 
growth, we can take on the world.  If we do not, we can sit back 
and watch international competitors take our share.  There will 
be no more high quality jobs, no enhanced communications 
services, no new economy.  I know that is not where Canada wants 
to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not sitting back.  As a government we have moved 
decisively over the last four years to continue the 
liberalization of Canada's telecommunications sector.  I want to 
review some of the steps we have taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The liberalization began in 1984 with the licensing of 
competitive cellular telephone service.  It moved forward with 
the privatization of Teleglobe in 1987 and Telesat in 1992, and 
still it advanced further with the introduction of long distance 
competition in 1992 and the passage in 1993 of a new 
telecommunications act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has continued over the last two years with the 
licensing of competitive personal communications services in 1995 
and local multipoint communications services in 1996.  Further in 
1996 the government set out its policy and principles for the 
convergence of cable and telephone services, creating one of the 
most competition driven policy regimes in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation marks the latest stage of this liberalization 
and clears the way for Canada's participation in the GATS 
agreement on basic telecommunications which was concluded last 
February.  The agreement covers 69 countries with more than 90% 
of the world's $880 billion telecommunications market.  It covers 
basic telecommunications services, voice and data, but not 
broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immediate purpose of the legislation is to implement those 
changes to Canada's regulatory regime that are necessary.  The 
longer term objective is to foster competition, one of the 
government's top priorities in this area. We are already a world 
leader in this sector and we will get more of that market share 
when we widen it up with very visible rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is not an end in itself.  We need competition 
because it fosters innovation and innovation leads to the 
development of new products and services, more choice at cheaper 
cost for consumers, Canadians, voters, the people in this country 
who deserve this, and it creates jobs and economic growth.  Still 
a longer term objective of fostering competition is to ensure 
Canadians have the advanced technologies they need to gain access 
to the knowledge economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past four years we have developed and initiated a plan 
to ensure that Canada does take full advantage of these 
technologies.  We are building an information highway where all 
Canadians can connect at a reasonable cost.  We have created 
those conditions needed to encourage the private sector to build 
this information highway.  Hardware and software developers and 
suppliers and content developers are now among the fastest 
growing industries in this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opening competition in telecommunications services is an 
important part of our strategy as a government.  We know the best 
and fastest way to build the infrastructure for the knowledge 
based economy is through open competition.  By developing a 
national strategy for the development of this infrastructure, the 
government will enable all Canadians to find new opportunities 
for business, learning and communicating with one another.  This 
can only be good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to move forward quickly to secure for them 
the benefits of a new economy.  The government is working on a 
number of fronts to do this.  For example, we will have high 
level talks at the OECD conference on electronic commerce coming 
up in the fall of 1998.  Electronic commerce is not only central 
to a modern knowledge based economy, it is also the foundation 
for future growth and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating the best environment for electronic commerce, Canada 
will become the world leader in this emerging field, generating 
increased investment in electronic networks and growth in areas 
such as electronic transactions, multimedia products and online 
services.  The OECD Canada conference ensures we can support, 
participate in and influence the creation of an open, transparent 
multilateral electronic commerce regime.  The government is also 
working toward using electronic commerce when doing business with 
its own clients. 
By being a model user the federal government can encourage the 
private sector and other levels of government to adopt the 
technology.  But it does not stop there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of our national strategy, the government initiated a 
number of programs to ensure that Canadians acquire the tools and 
skills from the earliest age that they need to prosper in this 
new economy.  These include computers for schools programs 
through which government departments, businesses and institutions 
donate surplus computer equipment and software to schools.  It 
includes the student connection program which enables university 
and college students to help small businesses learn to use the 
Internet, as my colleague suggested. The community access program 
connects and will connect every rural Canadian community with 
more than 400 people to the Internet by the year 2000.  And how 
could we forget the SchoolNet program which connects all our 
16,500 schools and 3,400 public libraries in Canada to the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across this country students, teachers, professionals, business 
people and just Canadians are using these facilities because we 
have to ensure Internet literacy and move forward into the next 
century which will be different than the last century. The 
government is going online itself making government services 
accessible to people wherever they are, 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week.  This is being done in every department and agency 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this would be possible without telecommunications 
infrastructure and those supports for it.  We cannot have that 
infrastructure without a strong, dynamic telecommunications 
industry.  This bill before us today is a necessary step toward 
giving our telecommunications sector service companies the keys 
they need to open the doors to the new world, the world market of 
vast proportions.  Once that door is open we can rely on Canadian 
expertise, Canadian entrepreneurship in all our ridings to do the 
rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result will be better telecommunications services.  An 
infrastructure will support us in the next century.  I suggest we 
are on the information highway and we will move forward on that 
highway together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
been both exhilarated and disappointed today.  We have before us 
a bill that on the one hand is being exalted as the greatest 
development that will advance the causes of technology and 
communication that has ever hit the floor of this House.  It has 
given members of the government the opportunity to brag, to extol 
the virtues of how much they are doing to get Canadians on to the 
information highway and to make sure that all communities and all 
Canadians everywhere will be connected to this information 
highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time these very same people recognize that there is 
not the capacity in Canada to do that right now.  It is a noble 
goal, we all agree, and I support that, but the interesting thing 
with regard to this bill is that it has brought together two 
things that I submit do not belong together in the same bill. 
Whatever connection there is is tenuous at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one bill with two parts.  The first part deals with 
amendments to the Telecommunications Act and the other part of 
the bill deals with amendments to the the Teleglobe Canada 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act.  Those two things are 
completely separate.  I submit that it would have been very much 
better if the government had submitted two bills, one which dealt 
with amendments to the Telecommunications Act, the other which 
dealt with amendments to the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and 
Divestiture Act.  It would have been far more successful and far 
more logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue behind this bill is to recognize the principle 
involved.  There is not much doubt or argument about the basic 
principles of increasing competition, expanding the ownership 
possibilities of telecommunications vehicles and ending 
monopolies. 
It is rather encouraging that the Liberals, who tend to govern 
from the top down and intrude into business, have seen this as a 
major principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time that Canadians recognized that government does 
not have all the answers. Yet within this very bill, we are 
reverting to government regulation and control of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hearken back to the Information Highway Advisory 
Committee.  This committee started with one set of 
recommendations in its first volume and then it came up with a 
second volume in which it began to implement things.  One of the 
principles which the committee stated very unequivocally in the 
first report which it presented to the Minister of Industry was 
that the origin of the capital of a particular business, 
particularly a business in telecommunications, ought not to be so 
much the concern of the government, but rather the concern should 
be how that capital is applied.  Is the capital applied in such a 
way that meets the economic and social goals of Canada?  If the 
capital does those things it does not matter where it originated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to focus very carefully and clearly on what it is we 
want to achieve in any legislation, particularly in legislation 
that deals with such a pervasive issue as telecommunications, the 
linking of people talking with one another through electronic 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two parliamentary secretaries expressed great pride in how broad 
the consultation had been on this bill.  I do not know with whom 
they spoke.  I have a report from an Internet service provider 
which arrived about five minutes ago. In fact, the report is from 
the legal counsel to the Internet service provider.  He makes 
this observation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this bill empowers the CRTC to declare that 
something is a basic telecommunications service, without any 
criteria to define “basic”, and then subject the service 
provider to a licensing regime.  This licensing regime overturns 
the previous scheme of the Telecommunications Act in a 
fundamental way.  The previous act—the one now in force—says 
that anyone may operate as a Canadian carrier who satisfies 
ownership criteria.  The new one subjects every service that the 
CRTC wishes to regulate to a comprehensive scheme of licensing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key phrase is whatever service the CRTC wishes to regulate. 
This is a major departure.  It is an intrusion into the operation 
of telecommunications such as we have never seen before. It was 
never a part of the Telecommunications Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Industry gave his speech in defence of Bill 
C-17 we were all enamoured by his commitment, by his seriousness 
and by his total support for the development of 
telecommunications and the whole business of innovation, science 
and technology developments and the application and 
commercialization of new ideas.  He used the telecommunications 
business as an example of how this could be done.  I congratulate 
the minister for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister failed to comment on one aspect of the 
bill which is an intrusion into the affairs of business.  We have 
to get serious about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer directly to the mandate of the CRTC.  The CRTC 
is a body with administrative and quasi-judicial authority.  This 
is no itsy-bitsy committee whose members get together every once 
in a while to talk to one another and have a good time, go out 
for a beer or a coffee or whatever. 
This is a quasi-judicial body that can bind businesses or 
individuals and can determine how much you and I pay for our 
telephone rates.  It can determine who will be the supplier of 
the pipe or the line or the fibre optic or satellite 
communication or wireless.  It has the right to determine these 
kinds of things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has been given a brand new mandate and authority it did 
not have before.  It has been given the authority, in clause 3, 
the new section 16, for new powers of licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting what these powers actually are.  These 
powers establish classes of licences.  That is one thing it does. 
It establishes the classes of services that would require a 
licence.  Now we are hitting on two sides.   First, it tells us 
the kinds of licences we will have. Second, it tell us these are 
the service providers who will be required to have a licence. 
They may be the same but they may also be different. The act is 
completely ambiguous in declaring exactly what is going to happen 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make several observations with regard to this 
ambiguity.  What does this ambiguity permit?  First, it allows 
the establishment of many or few classes.  The more classes there 
are the more administration, the more distributors, the more ways 
in which you find the CRTC getting into various areas.  It 
decides how many of these classes there will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it allows the CRTC to establish classes on an arbitrary 
basis.  It does not provide any indication of the conditions and 
guidelines to be used before a particular class of licence is 
established.  This is a figment of somebody's imagination first 
and then it is how much can fit here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds like someone who is getting ready for a Ph.D. 
dissertation.  He takes a particular position and says this is my 
hypothesis.  Then he draws a conclusion and says that this is my 
conclusion.  He wonders around until he finds enough evidence to 
prove his conclusion given the hypothesis, rather than deciding 
on the hypothesis and looking for the evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very serious.  That is the kind of thing that could 
happen here.  Far worse than that, the classes of licences could 
perpetuate obsolescence.  It puts into a straitjacket the 
conditions that qualify a business or service provider getting a 
licence in the first place.  That is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have the advancement in telecommunications if we 
had had these kinds of constraints placed on new service 
providers, with new ideas and new ways of applying the 
technology.  We should look at this very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC may now establish the conditions for the licences.  Not 
only can it establish the classes of licences, the kinds of 
businesses that would be required to have a licence, but now the 
conditions.  These too have no guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the conditions be?  Will a service provider need a 
particular financial capability?  Does it mean there has to have 
a particular concentration of ownership or if the ownership is 
too concentrated it will not get a licence?  Will it be a 
coverage area that is involved or the range of services that will 
be provided?  Then the question becomes is this a range of 
services that relates to the Internet?  Will this be a service 
that will be on the information highway or could it be something 
that is independent of that? 
Will it have to do with the number of technical people who are 
employed by an organization or will a certain portion of the 
profits have to be be placed into R and D?  Are these some of the 
conditions that are going to be placed on the licensee? We do not

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do know that the government is already on record 
insisting that in order for a certain kind of business to operate 
it must commit a certain proportion of its earnings and revenues 
toward research and development.  I do not think that is 
necessarily a bad requirement.  In fact, we need far more 
research and development in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is well down the list of OECD countries in spending on R 
and D.  As an industrial nation it does not fare well in the way 
that the government presents R and D.  Government does not 
provide as much money to research and development as could be the 
case.  Neither does private enterprise commit to research and 
development in the proportion that it should.  We need that kind 
of commitment. For that to be a possible condition for a licence 
is rather difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the questions on the business of licensing. 
However, there is an even more significant part to licensing.  It 
is not only the people who will get the licences and the 
conditions of licences, the bill goes even further and states 
that the CRTC may establish conditions relative to circumstances 
of the licensee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises all kinds of questions. Does this now escalate the 
problem above and beyond direct political and/or commission 
arbitrariness.  Now we are not only determining the conditions 
but the circumstances that would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could prevent certain people from entering the market by 
making regulations that are so demanding it would be impossible 
for them to ever get into the business.  It is sort of like 
issuing a tender for a motorcycle and setting the specifications 
for that motorcycle in such a way that there would only be one 
possible manufacturer that could meet those specifications. 
These are very serious possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the possibility of capriciousness, which is to set 
different conditions for one class of licence apart from another 
class of licence so that in one case it may be on a certain 
financial base, while on the other side financial basis will not 
matter, but the concentration of ownership will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also bring about that those who would get a licence 
would be friends of the government, those who are friends of 
management or directors of the CRTC, perhaps people in a 
particular management structure.  Who knows? This could possibly 
create different cost structures for different classes of 
licences.  We do not know what the circumstances would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put those four things in the legislative provision of 
licences, we would begin to ask ourselves how could anyone truly 
and honestly and fairly administer such a system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was a bureaucrat and I wanted to establish myself as a 
bureaucratic entrepreneur, that is getting more and more people 
to come under my supervision, I would use this kind of a system. 
It would mean that I could have the whole world before me.  I 
could create the types of licences I wanted, the kinds of 
services that would get the licences and then I could determine 
the conditions and the circumstances.  It would be possible to 
build an empire that would be so great that it would be 
absolutely impossible for anybody to do anything without first of 
all coming to me to ask “How will we do this?” It has 
tremendous and horrendous implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line question in all of this is that it does not 
increase flexibility.  It is the very opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago the CRTC stated in one of its publications that it 
wanted local competition, a development I heralded with great 
support at the time and still do.  I think it is wonderful.  A 
great thing has happened, and I think the bill moves away from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 the commission initiated four different public 
proceedings to put into place conditions for effective 
competition in the local telephone market.  These proceedings 
deal with co-location, local interconnection, network component 
unbundling, local number portability and price cap regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-location is intended to facilitate competition by providing 
competitors with the option of delivering their traffic to local 
switches over either leased or owned facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbundling refers to the requirement that incumbent local 
telephone companies make available at tariffied rates elements of 
their facilities to which competitors would require access to 
effectively enter the local telephone market. This is a 
tremendous policy for the CRTC to develop. It is exactly what 
should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I had the opportunity to meet with a couple of 
entrepreneurs who were doing exactly that.  They have put in the 
ground loops of fibre optic cable which now allows them to get 
into local telephone market.  This will put them in direct 
competition with the B.C. Tels and the Bells that have monopolies 
in these areas.  Finally we have competition.  That is absolutely 
tremendous and the CRTC ought to be commended for it.  The 
legislation indicates what the CRTC did over here but gives it 
the power to frustrate what it had over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC goes on to say that another major element of the Reform 
Party was a series of adjustments to local telephone rates which 
stem from the commission's split rate based decision to bring 
prices closer to the true cost of providing service.  This 
adjustment will produce artificial subsidies to residential local 
service that complicate the introduction of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementation of a price cap regime will also give service 
providers more freedom to price individual services and to reap 
the benefits of productivity improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is tremendous stuff.  In spite of that concern I have 
complete support for the other part of the bill which would 
change or amend the reorganization of Teleglobe Canada 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act.  That should be moved forward 
expeditiously.  Tomorrow we should do that if we possibly could. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I thank the member for Kelowna for his remarks.  I know his 
preparedness as industry critic is always fine tuned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that as the industry critic he appreciates the fact 
Canadians are becoming more and more connected.  More and more 
people are using the Internet and programs like Strategis which 
has well over 2,000 hits a day.  He appreciates the importance of 
telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a number of questions.  If we are to deregulate 
and have more people in the telecommunications business, does he 
believe there should be a level playing field among the 
participants and that new participants should be allowed to come 
in with a certain approval requirement, or does he believe that 
it should be wide open? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe the 
government's role should be to create an environment in which 
innovation and entrepreneurship can express themselves.  The 
playing field should be level in the sense that an opportunity 
exists for all kinds of players to enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let those who are particularly successful and good win the day. 
I do not think governments should decide ahead of time who should 
be the winner or who should be the loser.  That is the difficulty 
with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a short answer, my position is yes, let us let people go in 
and compete. 
We would not have the IBMs.  We would not have the Apples.  We 
would not have various other groups that have brought about all 
kinds of Internet service projects.  We would not have them today 
if we had regulations that said they could not come in unless 
they met some conditions.  They came because they had a service. 
They came because the service met the needs of people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for government to create the overall broad 
framework so that we can succeed in that environment and let the 
market decide who will provide the best service for the least 
cost. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time to 
debate this issue with the hon. member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure people understand that the proposed approach 
is not intended to restrict the entry of new players into the 
market or to exclude players.  I understand the CRTC is doing 
some advance consultation now with the industry.  Its objective 
will be to consult with the industry on what is required to have 
the rules participants will operate under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lesson has been learned in the U.S., in the U.K. and in the 
European Union.  It is not any different from what we want to 
propose in Canada.  If we are to have a level playing field we 
need the rules of the playing field and to let the industry 
decide what the conditions should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to do exactly that.  It wants to make sure 
the rules are understood and the players can compete.  Would the 
member for Kelowna disagree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I picked up a key 
phrase the hon. member opposite mentioned.  He said we should let 
the industry determine.  That is exactly right.  Let the industry 
come into it rather than the government.  I think he really 
believes that and that is why he said it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what the bill says.  I wish the bill would say that. 
If he could prove to me that the bill says that I would 
wholeheartedly agree with him.  The issue he has raised is the 
right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention, because it is brand new, that he said 
the lesson has been learned and the CRTC knows it.  Let me focus 
on what was said in the 1997-98 estimates that we are now working 
under.  The mission statement reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For communication in the public interest we aim to help Canadians 
better understand how their values and diversity shape Canada's 
unique personality in the world.  We do so by regulating our 
broadcasting and telecommunications industries in open, flexible 
ways to foster creative freedom and strengthen the prosperity of 
all our citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now read the mandate of the CRTC and compare the two 
statements.  The mandate reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC is vested with the authority to license, regulate and 
supervise all broadcasting undertakings within Canada and to 
regulate telecommunications commentaries that fall under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  Is this not interesting?  It has made a regulatory 
body its mandate but its mission is to help Canadians better 
understand their values and diversity and to have open, flexible 
ways to foster creative freedom and strengthen the prosperity of 
all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks to me as if the regulation on the one hand and the 
mission on the other, if not in contradiction are certainly 
running in different directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the lesson has been learned the CRTC should demonstrate it. 
It has been known for years that the CRTC has not been the 
facilitator of private enterprise and competition but rather the 
protector of monopolistic interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see a shift here.  I think it is good.  I have 
raised the competitive issue before.  I have talked about 
convergence before.  That is a good idea.  There are vestiges in 
the new provision for licensing ability that move the CRTC back 
further into the regulation.  I think it is a backward move into 
the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for our colleague, the Reform Party telecommunications 
critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much talk in this bill about corporations.  We have 
mentioned equipment manufacturers, providers of telephone services, 
cable distributors.  We have also mentioned the consumer, who sees 
his bill regularly hiked up, but there is no mention of the person 
who is entitled to privacy.  We do not mention the protection of 
personal information. Yet that is the flip side of the coin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one side of the coin is being talked about now, allowing 
the industry to expand worldwide through deregulation.  The flip 
side of the coin: what are the consequences or the potential ill 
effects for citizens whose personal information can be released all 
over the planet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the federal government has no legislation that 
really protects personal information once it is in the hands of 
private business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore asking the Reform Party critic this question. 
What does the Reform Party recommend for protecting private 
information, identifying information, what does it have in mind for 
protecting the public from the misuse by businesses of information 
on each and every one of us? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a superb question, 
one that is not addressed in this bill or in any other bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is asking for my personal opinion, I think that is one of 
the crying needs that must be addressed in the House as the 
electronics and telecommunications industry develops.  We must 
guarantee the integrity, the privacy, the security of personal 
information and confidential information of a business nature. As 
we go to electronic banking, transferring funds from one 
organization to another via electronic means, the security of 
that information is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is ripe to bring forward that kind of legislation.  In 
fact we should do it tomorrow morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for the question.  I certainly support 
the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I meant to address the 
privacy section in an earlier question but unfortunately the 
member walked out and I was unable to ask it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said in the House before that privacy legislation is 
something the government is concerned with.  We are now studying 
it, trying to get a simple, flexible privacy of information 
legislation.  Work is being done not only with the government but 
with the provinces to get as many provinces onside to come up 
with simple legislation to recommend to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the public consultations are completed I hope hon. members 
will be able to add to the government's consultations on the 
privacy section of the legislation that will be introduced in the 
House in due time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for raising it.  I am sure we will be 
debating it in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the government 
brings that legislation forward I hope it will have consulted 
widely, honestly and with integrity, and listened very much to 
the experience of the privacy commissioner over the last number 
of years.  He has a lot of good advice to give us all.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee be appointed, pursuant to Standing 
Order 68(4)(b), to review the provisions of the Criminal Code 
dealing with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide and that 
the committee be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill, in 
accordance with Standing Order 68(5). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, on February 12, 1994 my friend Sue 
Rodriguez died at her home in Sidney, British Columbia.  She died 
with the assistance of a courageous and understanding doctor who 
risked a term of life imprisonment for breaking the law, section 
241 of the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members of this House will know, Sue Rodriguez had 
fought with incredible dignity, strength and courage, to the 
Supreme Court of Canada ultimately, to change this law.  She 
appeared before the House of Commons justice committee.  She made 
a whole nation aware of this profoundly important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While she may have lost ultimately by the narrowest possible 
margin of five to four at the Supreme Court of Canada, for many 
of us it was the words of dissenting Justice Peter Cory that 
resonated most powerfully: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life of an individual must include dying.  Dying is the 
final act in the drama of life.  The right to die with dignity 
should be as well protected as is any other aspect of the right 
to life.  State prohibitions that would force a dreadful, painful 
death on a rational but incapacitated terminally ill patient are 
an affront to human dignity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there may have been division in the Supreme Court of 
Canada, there was unanimity on one issue, that it was ultimately 
up to the House of Commons, the elected House of the people of 
Canada, to make a decision as to what the law should or should 
not state on this profoundly important issue. All the judges who 
considered this issue were unanimous on that point, the Supreme 
Court of British Columbia, the B.C. Court of Appeal and the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, starting in 1991 a number of other members of Parliament 
had raised this issue in the House: Bob Wenman, late Conservative 
member of Parliament from British Columbia, my former colleague 
Ian Waddell and my current colleague from 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the death of Sue Rodriguez in February 1994, within 
days of her death, both the prime minister and the then justice 
minister, currently the Minister of Health, promised that there 
would be a free vote in this House on this important issue. Four 
days later the justice minister said: “I am sure that doctors 
could tell us that a number of people right now are facing 
terminal illness who would want to have a clarification”. He 
went on to say: “We will have a free vote as soon as we possibly 
can”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you that we will find a way to introduce 
something in the House that will not be theoretical and that 
will be significant.  If that means proposing legislative 
changes, so be it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost four years later we have finally achieved that objective 
of ultimately this House's being able to have a free vote on the 
issue.  In May 1994 it was the national convention of the federal 
Liberal Party that passed almost unanimously a resolution urging 
the government to allow a free vote on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well in the spring of 1994, again shortly after the death of 
Sue Rodriguez, the Senate established a special committee chaired 
by a very distinguished former senator, Joan Neiman.  The 
committee reported in June 1995, after having held extensive 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to all members of that committee for their 
work.  It was a very important committee and an excellent report 
called “Of Life and Death”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today MPs will have an opportunity following three hours of 
debate on my motion to vote on this issue and I thank my 
colleagues from all parties for the opportunity that we have been 
given for this vote, and it will be a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain very carefully and very precisely what this 
motion seeks to achieve.  The motion does not set out the terms 
for new legislation.  It calls for the establishment of a special 
committee of this House. Obviously it could be decided that the 
standing committee on justice may be a more appropriate forum, 
but in any event it calls for a committee of this House to review 
evidence, certainly not to redo all the work of the Senate 
committee, to review the findings, the evidence and the 
recommendations of that committee and then to make 
recommendations back to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those recommendations could be very broad or very narrow.  As I 
said, the Senate committee has already done much of the work in 
this area.  The Senate committee was unanimous on a number of 
recommendations, including the importance of support for 
palliative care, pain control, and looked at the issue of 
sedation practices, the so-called double effect, withholding and 
withdrawal of life sustaining treatment and advance directives. 
It was able to arrive at unanimous recommendations for changes in 
those areas of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Sharon Carstairs, one of the members of that committee, 
tabled a bill last year, Bill S-13, which was strongly supported 
by Dr. Wilbert Keon, another member of the Senate and one of 
Canada's foremost heart surgeons. That bill would have clarified 
the Criminal Code with respect to a couple of key elements.  What 
it would have done was clarify the practice of providing 
treatment for the purpose of alleviating suffering that may 
shorten life.  It would also recognize explicitly and clarify the 
circumstances in which withholding and withdrawal of treatment is 
legally acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that is as far as this special committee of the House 
is prepared to go.  I would hope that the committee would go 
further and recommend comprehensive changes to section 241 of the 
Criminal Code, those changes that were supported by four of the 
nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, three of the seven 
senators on the special Senate committee, one of whom was Dr. 
Keon, and a substantial majority of Canadians in every region of 
Canada who also support these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition has stated that if a government 
bill were to be presented to Parliament, and presumably that 
would apply to a private member's motion as well, permitting 
physician assisted suicide under the conditions which he had set 
out in his consultation with his constituents, he would vote for 
that bill.  That was because when he surveyed his own 
constituents he found that something like 82% of those 
constituents supported this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want in urging the House to change the law to pay tribute to 
the many dedicated groups and individuals working for this change 
in the law, including the Right to Die Society and John Hofsess, 
Dying with Dignity and Marilyn Seguin, groups like Goodbye, the 
Unitarian Church and many others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note as well the issue is being debated in other parts of the 
world.  In fact today we will learn the results of a referendum 
in Oregon.  Earlier in the Australia Northern Territory Premier 
Marshall Perron courageously fought to bring forward a bill, only 
to see it ultimately overturned by the national parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that I believe that the current law is profoundly 
cruel and unjust and must be changed?  Let me first make it very 
clear that this is not a debate about choosing between palliative 
care on the one hand and physician assisted suicide on the other. 
I strongly support the unanimous recommendations of the Senate 
committee on this issue, which talked about far more resources 
for palliative care programs, national guidelines and standards, 
training of health care professionals, an integrated approach to 
palliative care and more research into palliative care, 
especially pain control and symptom relief.  All of those are 
fundamentally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best palliative care in the world cannot respond in all 
circumstances to all suffering, indignity and anguish.  I note 
the Canadian Palliative Care Association has acknowledged that. 
It pointed out that in something like 16% of cases of terminal 
illness, the patients must be so sedated that they are 
“incapable of meaningful interaction with their families”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some patients, some terminally ill people, Sue 
Rodriguez among them, who did not want to live or to die that 
way.  I argue that in those narrow circumstances in which 
palliative care cannot respond to the suffering, the pain and the 
anguish the issue is one of choice, fundamentally of personal 
autonomy, whether we accept the right of competent adults to 
decide for themselves how their lives will end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands under the current law, the choice is either to 
continue that suffering and anguish or to be sedated into a state 
of pharmaceutical oblivion, or to find a doctor who is prepared 
to break the law and risk life imprisonment, as in the case of 
Sue Rodriguez, or if you cannot find a doctor, as we have seen 
tragically in some circumstances, to leave your own country.  We 
saw that with Austin Bastable in 1996.  We saw that just recently 
with my constituent, Mr. Natverlal Thakore, this year. You should 
not have to leave your country and your family to die in peace. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it particularly cruel and barbarous that Mr. Tahkore 
had to leave his own country and his family to go to die in a motel 
room in Michigan with the help of a doctor he had probably never 
met.  This is not acceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we ended the hypocrisy in this area and admitted 
that assisted suicides are happening now.  They are happening 
with no guidelines, with no review, with no safeguards 
whatsoever.  Tragically, people are ending their own lives, 
committing suicide while still wanting to live longer. But they 
are doing it because they are afraid that when the moment comes 
at which they are totally incapacitated, they will not be able to 
seek the assistance they desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. Persons with AIDS Society pointed out that this is a 
very serious concern within that community as well.  Its 
spokesman said in his evidence before the Senate committee that 
people with HIV disease choosing assisted death as a medical 
option are being forced as a result of current legislation to 
seek backstreet euthanasia.  He talked about violent methods of 
euthanasia such as heroin overdoses, razor blades, guns and 
suffocation using plastic bags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. social worker Russel Ogden has confirmed in his studies the 
widespread resort to assisted suicide among people dying of AIDS. 
The Ontario chief coroner has confirmed that many people are 
assisting in suicide in this province.  Dr. Ted Boadway of the 
Ontario Medical Association stated at a Canadian Medical 
Association convention “Doctors are doing it entirely 
underground and entirely unrecognized, in great fear and 
anxiety”.  One doctor talked about how in his words “you can 
make a person comfortable with 50 milligrams of Demerol and you 
can make a person very, very dead with 500 milligrams of 
Demerol”, and about giving a suffering, terminally ill patient a 
prescription for sleeping pills but instead of giving her the 
normal 12, he gave her 40 as she requested. 
It is happening now but in the shadows, behind closed doors with 
no safeguards.  When people ask what about the slippery slope, 
those dangers are clearly already there.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there must be strict safeguards in place.  The 
Canadian Medical Association's committee on ethics made a number 
of recommendations, as did the Senate committee that studied this 
issue.  These are some of the safeguards that have been 
recommended which I strongly support: the importance of a 
person's request; being informed, voluntary, enduring and free of 
any coercion; the importance of the physician ensuring the person 
is competent and not suffering from any disorder that impairs his 
or her ability to make the decision; exploring the reasons in 
detail in incurable illness and severe suffering; the physician 
not being compelled in any way to participate in euthanasia or 
assisted suicide and not in a position to gain in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also respond briefly to some of the serious concerns that 
have been raised by people with disabilities and organizations 
representing people with disabilities, such as the Council of 
Canadians with Disabilities.  They voiced very eloquently their 
fear that if legislation were brought in that in any way 
diminished the importance of their lives or devalued their lives, 
they would strongly oppose it.  They are deeply concerned about 
some of the arguments they have heard around the Tracy Latimer 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that what is being debated here is fundamentally 
different.  What is being debated here is the right of a 
competent adult who is terminally or incurably ill to make that 
decision for himself or herself, not by another person, not by a 
doctor, not by relative, not by a parent but for himself or 
herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the B.C. Coalition of People with Disabilities that 
supports changes to this section of the Criminal Code.  It states 
in its recommendation to the Senate “we support changes that 
would make it legal to assist in the suicide of adults who know 
and understand all of the support options available to them and 
who are physically unable to take their life without 
assistance”.  I was pleased that the coalition intervened in 
support of Sue Rodriguez in her struggle before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the most powerful arguments for change in the law come 
from the families and friends of those who have lost a loved one 
in terribly agonizing circumstances.  Following the death of Sue 
Rodriguez, I received literally hundreds of incredibly moving 
letters.  I will share a couple of examples. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a letter from the son of Quebec author and actor Doris 
Lussier.  His son is Pierre Lussier.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Papa, do not let the politicians, barbarians by any other 
name, tell me that your horrible cry of mortal pain on the eve 
of your death, even unconscious, when we were far from your 
room at the other end of the corridor, was a sign of comfort. 
I shared in the agony of a charming, joyful, cultivated, 
reasonable human being, whom I loved more than anyone in the 
world, with no possibility of releasing him from his suffering 
as he so often asked of me. 
He was a total advocate of civilized death. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could read from many other letters.  I could read the letter 
of a man who wrote to me about his daughter who was in agony most 
of the time.  He said that her jaw would sometimes dislocate when 
she yawned.  She could not move her bowels so her sister had to 
evacuate her manually every second day.  Several huge bed sores 
developed which never healed.  She tried to kill herself by 
refusing to eat.  Finally she had a stroke which prevented her 
from using her communicator and she spent the last few years of 
her life in total isolation wailing dreadfully, pleading for an 
end to her suffering.  That is no way to die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult experiences I have had to live with 
has been the calls and letters I have received from people who 
plead with me to find a doctor to help them. 
I cannot respond to that, but what I can do is to plead with this 
House to ensure that the law is changed so that we have humanity 
and justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to appeal to all members of the House. 
Palliative care in and of itself is not enough.  Sue Rodriguez 
had superb palliative care.  Let an all-party committee hear from 
Canadians on all sides of this issue, review the evidence and 
recommendations of the Senate committee and then report back to 
the House with legislation to be voted on in a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a tragic mistake to close the door at this stage to 
any further debate.  Respected doctors like Dr. Keon, nurses and 
other health care workers, and most of all our own constituents, 
are asking that the law be, at the very least, clarified and 
hopefully changed to reflect humanity and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing the debate on my previous bill in September 1994 I 
quoted the final words of my friend Sue Rodriguez and I want to 
honour her memory by doing so again today.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that my efforts will not have been in vain and that the 
Minister of Justice will introduce legislation into Parliament 
soon so that terminally ill people will have another option 
available, thereby permitting physician assisted suicide for the 
terminally ill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May her courageous struggle and that of others who have made the 
same eloquent plea not be in vain.

the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas that a special committee be 
appointed to review the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing 
with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, and that the 
committee be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues in the House would no doubt agree, the subjects 
referred to in this motion raise very complex legal, moral and 
social issues that Canadians are increasingly concerned about, 
but remain clearly divided on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Montreal woman in a depressed state drowns her six-year-old 
son before attempting suicide.  A Halifax doctor is charged with 
the death of a terminally ill cancer patient under her care. 
These are just two examples to illustrate the complexity of this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who moved the motion illustrated the human toll 
which this issue has taken on Canadian families.  No one in this 
House would not be moved by these tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debate this subject we must examine questions ranging 
from the quality of medical care available to seriously ill and 
dying people to the moral questions involving a person's power to 
control his or her own life, and even the value of life itself. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological progress in recent decades has considerably 
improved our capacity to extend life and, in an aging society, the 
issues of care and treatment at the end of life take on ever 
greater importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many individuals, professionals, organizations and 
associations have clearly expressed their concerns on this over the 
16 months of hearings held by the Senate Special Committee on 
Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide.  In June 1995, the committee 
tabled its report entitled “On Life and Death”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated goals of the committee were to help the public to 
develop a better understanding of this very complex subject and 
to set the stage for a full and open national debate.  The 
committee referred to its report as an initial step in the long 
process ahead for Canadians attempting to find solutions to the 
problems that it raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues raised by this motion, that is, euthanasia and 
assisted suicide, are profoundly controversial.  It is clear that 
the special Senate committee was aware of this.  I am sure we 
would all concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate report raised a number of problems which must be 
carefully addressed.  The committee had little difficulty 
reaching consensus on issues regarding medical and health care 
practices, such as developing national guidelines to address pain 
control and sedation, and the withholding or withdrawal of 
treatment.  However, there were no such agreements among 
committee members when it came to dealing with the more difficult 
questions of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the case of the less controversial recommendations, I 
would suggest a great deal has yet to be done before we take any 
steps to consider amendments to the Criminal Code. Let me 
illustrate by way of example areas where further work is 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard and considered testimony from numerous health care 
professionals appearing individually or on behalf of numerous 
associations representing doctors, nurses and other 
professionals, the Senate committee report was unequivocal in its 
recommendations in chapters 3, 4 and 5 that urged the development 
and implementation of national guidelines and standards in a 
number of areas such as palliative care, pain control, sedation 
practices and the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining 
treatment.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines which seemingly have not yet been drafted, should 
help those who, every day, must make decisions or help others make 
decisions concerning palliative care and treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moveover, few Canadian provinces and territories have passed 
legislation on advance directives, generally known as living wills. Such 
legislation is important in order to recognize and support the 
participation of patients and their family in the decisions relating to 
medical care and treatment when they reach the end of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At such times, when critical decisions must be made, it is useful 
and less stressful for those involved to make these decisions if they 
know the patient's wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this work is completed, I think it would be premature to look 
at how the Criminal Code should deal with these issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the motion before us, while it is clear that I am 
of the opinion we should not be considering any amendments to the 
Criminal Code at this time, and I stress at this time, I would 
also suggest that attempts to do so are fraught with difficulties 
even when one purports to deal with subject matter upon which 
there is apparent agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago Bill S-13, an act to amend the Criminal Code, 
protection of health care providers, was introduced in the Senate 
and was later the subject of second reading debate in that house. 
The purpose of that bill as stated by the hon. Senator Sharon 
Carstairs who introduced it was to implement the unanimous 
recommendations in chapters 4 and 5 of the Senate report dealing 
with pain control and the withholding and withdrawal of 
life-sustaining treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Carstairs took great care to point out that her bill did 
not touch the more controversial aspects of the Senate report, 
that is, euthanasia or assisted suicide.  Yet that bill itself 
was the subject of controversy and was not fully supported by the 
senator's fellow members of the special committee who had 
initially supported the recommendations in the first report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would argue that it is premature, as moved by 
the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas, to appoint a special 
committee when there has been in fact one that has studied the 
issue to review the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with 
euthanasia and physician assisted suicide or to consider the 
possibility of bringing in a bill when, as the Senate report 
demonstrated, Canadians are much too divided on these issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, may I have the consent of the House to split my time 
with the member for Macleod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a special Senate 
committee on euthanasia and assisted suicide spent over a year, 
from February 1994 to June 1995, studying this issue.  It 
published a 250 page report in June 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate committee held 86 meetings and heard from 242 
witnesses representing 92 organizations.  It received 24 written 
submissions, listened to 12 witnesses by teleconference from 
Holland and received literally thousands of letters from 
concerned Canadians.  The special Senate committee cost taxpayers 
more than $250,000 not including the salaries of the senators and 
the staff assigned to the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate committee recommended no changes to the Criminal Code 
offences for voluntary euthanasia, non-voluntary euthanasia and 
counselling suicide. The Senate committee only made two 
recommendations regarding the Criminal Code:  that consideration 
be given for creation of a new murder offence called 
compassionate homicide; and that the Criminal Code be amended to 
explicitly recognize and to clarify the circumstances in which 
the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is 
legally acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A special Senate committee has already spent hundreds of hours, 
spent more than $250,000 and heard hundreds of witnesses, 
received thousands of letters and issued a 250 page report to the 
Senate in 1995.  There is no need for the House of Commons 
committee to repeat this same process.  Nor is there a need for 
taxpayers to shell out a few more hundred thousand dollars to do 
it all over again.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion presupposes that the special committee will agree 
that amendments to the Criminal Code are needed because the 
motion directs the committee to prepare and bring in a bill. If 
this motion is passed, it will require the special committee to 
introduce legislation even if the special committee's 
deliberations and debate and public opinion conclude otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code as it is currently worded provides crown 
prosecutors with a sufficient number of options when laying 
charges with respect to homicides.  The changes recommended by 
the Senate committee are not the highest legislative priority for 
the general public.  If a special committee is to be struck to 
draft any bill, Reformers say it should be a victims bill of 
rights. For these reasons, I cannot support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas 
proposes to introduce a bill dealing with a very complex and 
emotional issue. Some Reformers feel this is a moral issue and 
should be handled using a process employed on issues such as 
abortion and capital punishment and on issues of personal 
conscience.  We as Reform MPs follow a four step process to 
clearly state our views publicly and to ask our constituents to 
develop, to express and to debate their own views on the matter. 
Following that process, we seek the consensus of the constituency 
and support that constituency in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, here is my personal view on this issue.  I 
believe in the inherent value of life and the need to protect the 
most vulnerable individuals in our society.  While I respect 
every person's right to refuse medical treatment, I do not 
believe that any changes should be made to the Criminal Code 
offences of euthanasia, assisted suicide or counselling suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do support designating palliative care as a core 
service in the Canada Health Act and developing in co-operation 
with the provinces national guidelines to govern the provision of 
palliative care services, including research, counselling and 
education programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to participate in this debate as a clinician, as a GP, as a guy 
who dealt with people at the end of their lives, and as someone 
who did surgery.  This has had a very significant impact on my 
life.  I do this with humility, recognizing that the ending of a 
life is a significant and important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make sure that those watching understand what 
euthanasia is not.  Euthanasia is not withholding unwanted 
heroics.  Euthanasia is not advanced directives. Euthanasia is 
not unplugging resuscitation equipment that is unwanted or 
useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Euthanasia is active help to aid a person commit suicide, or 
active aid to end a person's life.  Asking a physician to 
participate in that goes against everything I was taught in 
medical school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents say, and in fairness I listen to their arguments very 
well, that if we had strict guidelines, the process of doctor 
assisted suicide would be rare.  I do not believe that it is 
adequate to just listen to those arguments.  A good debater can 
make those positions well. I believe it is much more instructive 
to look at jurisdictions where this has been tried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holland of course is probably the best jurisdiction. I am taking 
my information today from a fairly new publication. It is the 
<I>Canadian Family Physician</I> for those who would like to 
research this for themselves, the February 1997 issue in which 
the Dutch experience was looked at scientifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holland has a total population of 15 million, just about half of 
Canada's total population.  The data that I am discussing today 
is from general practitioners just like me, doctors who see a 
broad part of family existence.  The Dutch experience is as 
follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke of criteria that would be used by the proponents.  In 
Holland the criteria are as follows.  A request for euthanasia 
must be voluntary.  It must be well informed.  It must be 
persistent.  It cannot just be casual. There must be intolerable 
or hopeless suffering.  There must be consultation with a second 
doctor so that one doctor would not make the decision in 
isolation. 
Finally, there must be a report to the authorities, a report to 
the coroner.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How rare is euthanasia in Holland?  This is just GPs.  This is 
not palliative care or surgeons that I am talking about. GPs 
permit about 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year. The most 
interesting thing about this scientific data is how often were 
the criteria followed.  It is quite remarkable to find that about 
180 patients per year were euthanized without their personal 
permission. These were individuals who could have given their 
permission.  It is quite surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at all doctors in Holland, substantially more than 
just the GPs, the numbers are even worse.  This is from 1990. 
For those who would like to research this data themselves, it 
comes from the Remelink study done in 1991 by a justice in 
Holland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all doctors in Holland in 1990, 2,700 people were euthanized 
according to the coroners' records. This is following the 
criteria. But 1,040 were killed involuntarily by all doctors and 
not reported.  Even worse, 8,100 were killed by deliberately 
using pain medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have in a country half as populated as Canada, over 
10,000 people euthanized in one year when only 2,700 were 
reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Holland doctors have taken over end of life decisions. This 
has not become an empowering thing for the patient.  I would 
conclude by saying giving the power of life to physicians is bad 
public policy.

<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are dealing here with an extremely serious matter that must be analyzed 
in the greatest possible detail. This is an issue that has been 
discussed for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very clearly that during the 35th Parliament, this issue 
was raised several times by the member who tabled this motion and also 
by Michel Daviault, the Bloc Quebecois member for Ahuntsic. That member 
went over the issue in great detail, made observations and addressed 
questions to the government on several occasions on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to remind you once again that it is not the first time that we 
are dealing with this issue in this House, on June 8, 1995, in a press 
release, he stated: “It is important that members examine these issues 
that concern all Quebeckers and Canadians and make recommendations 
before the House of Commons is called upon to vote on such sensitive 
matters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time or another, the government will have to examine 
carefully this whole matter. With medical advances and given what is 
acceptable today, which may not have been acceptable yesterday and 
evolves over time, a responsible government, a government that wants to 
reflect the evolution of society, will have to get its act together and 
deal with this area of responsibility, this admittedly difficult issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the member who 
tabled this motion. I know that it is an issue that he has been closely 
involved with. 
If there is a member in this House that can speak from experience, it is 
the member from Burnaby—Douglas. I believe also, however, that this 
issue must be considered as objectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find interesting in his motion is the fact that it gives 
parliamentarians an opportunity to study this matter in a non-partisan 
manner, with the help of scientists, doctors and families who have lived 
through such situations, and also in the light of our respective 
convictions. This is an issue that has social, economic, religious and 
moral implications. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of factors come into play, but this motion gives the 
government an opportunity to examine the issue and to take a real 
look at what could be done to arrive at a situation acceptable to 
the majority of Canadians and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present context is not an easy one.  Some will say that 
respect for life is being used as an excuse to outlaw killing.  I 
think they are right; that the dignity of human beings is not 
diminished by suffering.  Others, however, will say that the 
respect for life and the right to die with dignity are personal 
values and that only the individual who is ill may decide. 
Legislating euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore poses many 
ethical problems.  I think a committee could give very serious 
consideration to these ethical and medical factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some news stories have advanced our understanding of this new 
problem.  There was the case of Nancy B., Sue Rodriguez, and the 
most recent, which is still in the headlines, the case of Robert 
Latimer, a father accused of ending his daughter's life for reasons 
everyone has heard about.  As we heard on the news, the decision is 
now under appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been different interpretations in the media. 
However, some extremely important issues have been raised.  Yes, 
the subject must be looked at, but I think it is so important that 
a very exhaustive study will be required before a bill can be 
introduced. 
The issue must be submitted to the House, studied and reported on even 
before those who will sit on the committee can draft a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complex task for a committee to study a bill.  I 
participated in the review of the Young Offenders Act; the issue was not 
a heart-wrenching one but I can tell you that after six months, we had 
not completed the study and we were still pondering many questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Euthanasia and assisted suicide are related issues.  We can easily 
predict that studying these matters will take a long time.  I would not 
want the committee to be burdened with the task of drafting a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I will table an 
amendment to motion M-123. 
I would like to see a committee struck, a committee to examine the 
matter, to report to the House, and subsequently, after the public 
pressure and the societal debate that it will have triggered in a 
still more structured way—because this will be referred to the 
justice committee of the House of Commons, with the assistance of 
the hon. member who will be able to attend—there will be a report 
that the House will examine and study.  I believe that the 
government across the way, giving it the benefit of the doubt as 
far as its responsibility is concerned, will be able to respond 
favourably to the report which would be tabled by the House 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by 
deleting the word “64(4)(<I>b</I>)” and by substituting the word 
“105”, by deleting the words “to prepare and bring in a 
bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(5)”, and by 
adding after the words “and that the Committee be 
instructed”, the words “to report to the House”. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, this amendment is very legalistic, very much in 
lawyer's jargon, if I can put it that way, but it is aimed at 
striking a committee.  The committee could examine the entire 
question in a very clear way, report back to the House, and then 
the government could follow up on it by bringing in a bill, which 
would be along the lines of the recommendations made by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member's 
amendment has been taken on reservation.  We will report back in 
due course. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in the debate tonight.  This is an example 
of the House working at its best, where there is reasoned and 
intelligent debate.  Certainly we will not all agree with the 
hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas, but who am I quoting when I say 
“We do not argue his right to stand up and debate the issue or 
argue his case.  We certainly would not deny the member that?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate reminds me of the abortion debate.  I know there are 
at least a couple of members on this side of the House who were 
here during that debate in 1989.  I was a member of Parliament at 
that time.  I often say I am very fashionable because I am a 
recycled member of Parliament.  I was here in a previous life in 
the 34th parliament and I spoke on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of that debate.  It was one of those issues that 
I do not think the government wanted to bring to the floor of the 
House of Commons.  That was understandable.  Obviously there were 
two sides to that debate as there are with this one.  I think 
that is reflected in the supreme court rulings that have come 
down on cases like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is the Sue Rodriguez case the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas quoted.  He was very much attached to that case 
and to Sue Rodriguez herself.  I do not always agree with the 
member.  Nor do you.  Nor does the House.  He took a very 
courageous stand in defence of his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Rodriguez died before that ruling came down but the fact 
that they ruled 5:4 on that case indicates that even the supreme 
court is divided on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for parliament to give them guidance.  It 
is incumbent on us to do that and to bring this issue before the 
House of Commons for intelligent debate.  I do not support the 
idea of spending money on a committee.  The Senate did that.  The 
Senate struck its committee.  A couple of the members have 
mentioned the cost of that study.  It becomes very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secret to the whole process lies right here in the House of 
Commons.  All members of Parliament are going to be here.  They 
are paid to be here.  They are paid to stand and present their 
positions.  That is what I think should happen.  An intelligent, 
reasonable, persuasive debate should take place in the House.  At 
the end of the day we will have taken our respective positions 
and will have had our say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to define euthanasia.  I am sure there are people back 
home, including myself until I took the time to study the issue, 
who are a little confused on what the term means.  I will quote 
from a fact book that was put together for me and other members a 
number of years ago by the Campaign Life Coalition. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is basically a definition that Canadians should hear.  The 
original Greek meaning of the term euthanasia is easy or good 
death.  Over time this meaning has been lost so that today an 
acceptable definition of euthanasia would be to act or fail to 
act so as to cause the death of a human being for the purpose of 
relieving suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim is usually though not exclusively a chronically or 
terminally ill patient, not necessarily imminently dying.  The 
person performing the act of euthanasia is usually but not 
exclusively a health care professional.  The participation of the 
medical profession in these acts has led to the use of the term 
medicalized killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as the understanding of the precise definition of 
euthanasia it is important to be clear on which medically based 
decisions at the end of life should never be classified as 
euthanasia.  It is important that we listen to this carefully 
because allowing a terminally ill person at the last stages of 
life to die a natural death is not euthanasia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the situation is medically hopeless, a decision not to 
provide or continue extraordinary or heroic measures where such 
no longer offer any hope for healing is ethical, legal and 
consistent with standard medical practice.  It is important to 
remember that.  More important, it is also consistent with 
thousands of years of religious belief and practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose is to examine present law to decide whether or not 
it should be changed.  That is what the member is asking.  We do 
not disagree with that.  It is just a case of bringing debate to 
the House of Commons and working through it in an intelligent 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surrounded by members from all parties.  To the right I 
have a few Liberals, to the left there are Reformers and there 
are a few Conservatives as well.  The views of the respective 
individuals are interesting when we are engaged in discussion. 
There are some areas about which we fundamentally agree.  There 
are some areas about which we fundamentally disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the place where that debate has to happen.  I urge all 
members to go home and do some research.  In time hopefully this 
issue will come to the floor of the House where it deserves to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned the abortion debate which took place in the 
House.  I remember as a member of Parliament at that time that I 
had to do some soul searching on the issue.  I remember saying in 
the House that according to my definition if life begins at 
conception life should be allowed to continue.  As a parallel to 
that, if we are talking about human life and we have accepted the 
fact that life is there, what right do we have as individuals to 
determine when that life should end?  That goes back to the 
fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the continuation of human life or the 
termination of human life.  It is no more fundamental than that. 
It is about life.  It is about the preservation of life.  It is 
about the continuation of life.

assisted suicide and euthanasia.

Speaker, Canadian troops in Somalia were administered the 
experimental drug mefloquine.  Military doctors got the 
antimalarial drug because they agreed to participate in a 
prelicensing safety monitoring study.  They ignored their 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health was asked on October 20 if any action 
under the Food and Drug Act had been taken by his department 
against either the manufacturer who was responsible for 
supervising the safety monitoring study or the surgeon general 
who acted illegally in prescribing the drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and his department are responsible for the 
administration of the Food and Drug Act.  They ignored the fact 
that military doctors used an unlicensed drug that commonly has 
neuropsychiatric side effects. 
It is a drug the World Health Organization has expressed concerns 
about, and I quote from a World Health Organization document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mefloquine is taken out of recommendations, based mainly on the 
concern about the neuropsychiatric side effects of mefloquine. 
Such side effects are relatively rare, but were considered a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Health Organization withdrew its support for the 
military use of the drug in April 1992, long before Canadian 
troops were sent to Africa.  But this is not simply about whether 
the World Health Organization withdrew its support for the use of 
mefloquine by military personnel before soldiers were ordered to 
take it.  It is about what the Department of Health did after 
learning the law had been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not explain what action his department took in 
1993 when it learned of the problems in Somalia. The minister did 
not explain why his department took part in a cover-up of the 
illegal use of mefloquine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials in the Department of Health believed in 1993 there was 
a direct connection between the use of mefloquine and the death 
of Somali teenager Shidane Arone and the attempted suicide of 
Master Corporal Clayton Matchee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's reply to my question on the response of his 
department to the illegal use of the unlicensed drug in 1992 and 
1993 was to tell the House that the decision to illegally use 
mefloquine in Somalia was based on the best evidence available at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wrong. DND ignored the law and ignored critical evidence from 
reputable source which I would be happy to make available to the 
minister.  Furthermore, the minister asked the House to await the 
outcome of continuing investigations before coming to any 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials at the Department of Health told us on October 20 and 
21 that no research is being undertaken by either the Department 
of Health or DND.  Can the minister tell this House whether his 
officials are mistaken or whether he was mistaken when he 
informed the House that there were continuing investigations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cover-up occurred at DND and in his own department in 1993 and 
1994 as to the illegal prescription of mefloquine by the surgeon 
general and its possible connection to the attempted suicide in 
Somalia of Master Corporal Clayton Matchee in 1993 and the 
suicide of Corporal Scott Smith in Rwanda in 1994. These were 
Canadian soldiers who deserved better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this minister is not trying to continue the cover-up of 
this illegal use of the unlicensed drug or to protect officials 
who had licensed mefloquine in 1993 at about the time the 
notorious events in Somalia became public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The licensing was done based on an incomplete safety monitoring 
study.  Telling this House there is an investigation under way 
into mefloquine when his own officials deny any study is now 
under way does not help us get to the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health did not acknowledge the drug was used 
illegally. Instead, the minister said there was an ongoing 
investigation.  Presumably he is talking about an investigation 
that has been ongoing since 1993.  If so, even the minister's 
infamous Airbus investigation did not take that long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask again whether the minister can tell the House 
whether his officials are mistaken or whether he was mistaken 
when he informed the House there were continuing investigations. 
Furthermore, I would ask that he document for the House what 
action his department has taken with regard to the illegal use of 
mefloquine by the surgeon general and the failure by the 
manufacturer to carry out a proper safety monitoring study.

hon. member regarding the antimalaria drug lariam mefloquine and 
its availability to the Canadian Armed Forces in Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, lariam has been and continues to be used and 
recognized worldwide as one of the most effective drugs for the 
prevention and treatment of a form of malaria resistant to most 
other antimalarial drugs.  Estimated at over 2 million deaths 
each year, malaria is one of the world's greatest killers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to its marketing approval in 1993, lariam was available to 
travelling Canadians through an open access clinical trial, 
referred to as a safety monitoring study. The study provided 
Canadians with early access to a drug where few alternatives were 
available and monitored potential side effects of the drug in the 
interests of patient safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Health Canada took immediate and affirmative action when 
media reported claims of several incidents where lariam may have 
been involved in Somalia.  The Department of Health requested the 
sponsor to provide all information and adverse drug reaction 
reports as required under the safety monitoring study. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Health Canada directives, researchers involved in 
clinical studies and attending physicians are bound to report without 
any exception any significant adverse reaction to drugs. The results of 
the monitoring study on drug safety, combined with recent information in 
scientific literature, confirm the prescribing information approved by 
Health Canada for Lariam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to use Lariam as a first choice therapy is a matter of 
responsibility for the patient. 
It is for the prescribing physician to decide in consultation with the 
patient whether a drug's potential benefits outweigh the risks.

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 21, I asked a question in this House of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs concerning the upcoming peoples 
summit, specifically the concern that many delegates from APEC 
countries who wish to attend the peoples summit to speak on 
issues of fundamental human rights, the rights of workers and the 
environment were refused any federal government funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the foreign minister why it was that this explicit bar 
on the peoples summit, using federal funds to assist people from 
civil society attending the peoples summit, was in place.  I 
pointed out the double standard and the fact that the federal 
government is spending something in excess of $50 million for the 
APEC summit itself for things like security for leaders like 
Suharto and Cheung Chi Min and others and it is not prepared to 
provide the very minimal funding which has been requested to 
assist in the travel of delegates from APEC countries to the 
peoples summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I questioned the minister with respect to cuts 
in Canada's overseas development aid, shameful cuts which have 
led to our being severely criticized by the Canadian Council for 
International Co-operation and other international aid bodies. We 
have dropped from fifth place to eleventh place in the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Minister of Finance has triumphantly proclaimed 
that the deficit has been wrestled to the ground, I urged that 
the minister responsible for foreign affairs, the Minister for 
International Co-operation, cancel the proposed 8% cut, about 
$150 million, which is planned for next April in Canada's 
overseas development aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the response to both those questions was 
completely unsatisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that as well in the context of the upcoming APEC 
peoples summit my colleague from Yukon raised very serious 
concerns about the failure of the federal government to provide 
requested financial assistance to the APEC women's conference, 
this despite the commitment that was made by the secretary of 
state for women and multiculturalism at the conference in 
Beijing. The failure to provide proper funding has also led to 
the cancellation of the indigenous peoples forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peoples summit is a tremendous opportunity for Canadians and 
for people in APEC countries to raise concerns about human 
rights, about workers rights, about the environment, and I want 
to pay tribute to the organizers of the upcoming peoples summit 
in Vancouver later this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to again appeal to the Government of Canada to honour its 
own policy, the policy of CIDA, which encourages the involvement 
of delegates from other countries in important UN conferences and 
other key intergovernmental and non-governmental fora.  They have 
much to witness; workers from Hong Kong, for example, who will 
speak about the failure of the Government of China to respect 
workers rights. It just cancelled the laws passed by the Hong 
Kong legislature to guarantee freedom of association. 
It is important that we hear from workers there.  It is important 
that we hear from workers in Indonesia and from others talking 
about the genocidal policies of Suharto in East Timor.  Why are 
we allowing him to come to Canada when he is guilty of crimes 
against humanity?

</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful review the government decided that the best way to 
support the People's Summit is to provide funding support for 
policy discussions, not travel.  And this is what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has provided $195,000 to the People's

interactive Internet-based electronic conference that will 
provide a forum for an exchange of views.

continue to so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
October 28 I had the opportunity to rise in the House and ask a 
question of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  Quite frankly 
I thought the question was fairly simple.  Obviously the answers 
were not quite as simple because they were not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House a little background.  What I was 
referring to was the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation. This 
corporation is based in Manitoba.  It is fishermen operated and 
those people who ply their trade in the Northwest Territories, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northern Ontario are the 
stakeholders of this corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept is fairly simple.  The fishermen catch the fish, the 
marketing board markets the fish and sells them throughout the 
world and domestically.  It has sales in excess of $50 million on 
world-wide distribution.  It is a typical board.  It has a 
chairman that is elected.  It has a board that is elected. It has 
no government subsidies.  It works extremely well and it is 
self-sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also has working for it a chief executive officer and 
president.  The current president and chief executive officer has 
been with the corporation for 16 years.  He worked his way up as 
controller, vice-president of finance and then became the 
president and general manager, which is what we would all like to 
do within our corporation.  Everything is fine.  This is where 
the sinister of music comes in because unfortunately the 
government has the ability to appoint the CEO under the 
Freshwater Fish Marketing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous history showed that this particular CEO had extended to 
him contracts of two and three years.  Unfortunately, in April 
1997, just before the election, an extension of that contract was 
issued for only six months, which was a bit strange.  After the 
June election the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that 
there was going to be a new president and general manager and he 
would be Mr. Ron Fewchuk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and 
it was not that tough.  My question was would the minister tell 
me what the qualifications of Mr. Fewchuk were.  Would he also 
tell me if he consulted with the board and the chairman with 
respect to that appointment? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, I did not get an answer.  What I got was some gobbledegook 
but let me tell you what the answer is.  The fact of the matter 
is that the qualifications of Mr. Fewchuk are that he did not run 
in that riding because he let another member, a fellow by the 
name of Jon Gerrard who is no longer with the Liberal benches, 
run in his stead.  He retired as a member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did they ask the board and the chairman?  Did they consult with 
them?  The answer is no, they did not consult with the board or 
the chairman.  It was simply a matter of a political appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question was quite simple as well.  Unfortunately, now 
that they need a chief executive officer to actually do the work, 
they are going to retain the services of their current CEO and 
they are now going to have Mr. Fewchuk also as a CEO.  They are 
now going to have two salaries.  My question to the minister was 
would he simply tell me that the one salary of patronage would be 
paid for out of the budget of the minister of fisheries. Do not 
allow those salaries to be paid by the poor fishermen.  All they 
really want to do is fish and make an honest living.  I never got 
an answer to that question either and I hope I can get one this 
evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have with this is not just simply for the 
Freshwater Fish Marketing Board, but we are dealing with another 
bill right now, Bill C-4.  The government is fighting to make 
sure that it has the ability to appoint the CEO.  It makes me 
very nervous because quite frankly there were a number of 
defeated Liberal members in the last election.  I am wondering 
which one of those will be appointed the CEO of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I might say on Bill 
C-4 that what we are trying to do is come up with a bill which 
producers have asked for. They continue to want us to be able to 
appoint the expertise in marketing that we did under the last 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there no depth to the disrespect for a political opponent to 
which the member for Brandon—Souris will stoop for cheap 
political gain?  The member opposite has nothing of substance to 
say.  He reverts to an attack on the character of the individual 
in an effort to belittle the individual Mr. Ron Fewchuk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am responding to this question on behalf of the 
government in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Mr. Fewchuk happened to be my 
seatmate in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fewchuk as a member of Parliament was not loud nor 
bombastic.  He did not use malicious comments to attract 
headlines like the member opposite is trying to do.  He did not 
try to manipulate the media like the member opposite is trying to 
do. He held a quiet conviction and he did his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fewchuk brings years of experience to the job of president 
and will serve the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation very 
well indeed. He is a skilled entrepreneur and former 
parliamentarian with diverse experience in business and local 
government.  He has 18 years ongoing experience as a successful 
business owner-operator and 16 years experience as a commercial 
bait fisherman and outfitter. He has a long history of local 
leadership, including 15 years of elected service as reeve, 
deputy reeve and councillor of the rural municipality of St.

purchase of courses.  Try asking Edgar Rousseau, 56, of Coleraine

totally meaningless.

27, 1997, I asked him a question in the House and he did not even 
dare to come to the defence of his government's treatment of these 
workers.  Instead, he designated the Parliamentary Secretary to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, my colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis, 
tabled a letter in the House reminding the minister that the 
workers wanted an improved POWA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has no compassion.  Jean Dupéré, I remind the 
House, is prepared to do his share, a substantial share, he says. 
Louise Harel is also ready.  Only the minister is refusing to 
budge.  He is prepared to go as far as $3 million in active 
measures.  Does he not understand that forcing workers who are 55, 
56, 58 or 59 years old, to sit in a classroom is not only 
unrealistic, but stupid coming from a minister who claims to manage 
this country's human resources? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
for International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister is 
sensitive, open and always willing to listen to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes the difficulties experienced by 
Canadians who lose their jobs, particularly those affected by the 
closing of the mine in Black Lake, in Quebec. However, these layoffs 
cannot be covered by the Program for Older Workers Adjustment, or POWA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program was terminated last March because, among other things, 
it was not fair and equitable to older workers in Quebec and across 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Human Resources Development Canada has changed 
its focus from passive income support to active measures in order 
to help workers reintegrate into the workforce.  Provinces are 
also moving in that direction.  Let me point out that the 
predecessor to the human resources development minister made a 
commitment to helping older workers adapt to the changing labour 
market and considered a variety of measures including income 
support benefits before concluding that active measures would 
best serve his client group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member this decision was not taken lightly and we 
will continue to help Canadians affected by layoffs in the best 
way possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Lab Chrysotile, this is reflected in the generous 
offer of close to $3 million made by our government to help the 
employees at the BC mine re-enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will benefit from adequate active measures including 
self-employment, targeted wage subsidies and skill development, 
which will increase the employability of these people and help 
them re-enter the workforce as quickly as possible.
