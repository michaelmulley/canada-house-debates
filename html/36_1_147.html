<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CALGARY DECLARATION 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to address 
Motion No. P-22 which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a Humble Address be presented to His Excellency praying that 
he will cause to be laid before this House copies of all 
documents, reports, minutes of meetings, notes, memos, polls and 
correspondence relating to the Calgary Declaration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion outlines, in any fundamental democracy it is key 
that anything governments do with public money or anything 
governments endeavour to do be made public through access to 
information to almost anyone who would like to see the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three key elements that I would like to address in the 
House today regarding this motion.  I will outline them before I 
begin my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the key issue of transparency.  Governments need to 
make more of an effort to become transparent.  In addressing this 
motion it is important to talk about the issue of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is federal-provincial relations.  In the House 
we have heard many different points of view on federal-provincial 
relations.  How we enhance and balance those relations is 
fundamental when heading into the new century.  I would like to 
address the issue of federal-provincial relations and what the 
government claims could be unfortunately hurt by making more 
documents public and by making people more aware of what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue is how this will impact unity.  There are many 
issues right now.  The Quebec election is taking place.  There 
are different points of view from different provinces when it 
comes to what direction Canadian unity should take and what sort 
of changes should be made in the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this motion tries to address will fundamentally impact the 
direction of unity in the country.  In the long run, if we follow 
the direction of this motion it could enhance unity by following 
the two key elements of transparency and federal-provincial 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing the issue of transparency I want to say that there 
has been widespread public disillusionment with governments. 
Generally, Canadians feel that their governments are trying to 
hide a lot of information that belongs to them.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because of different things we have seen in the 
past, especially with the APEC scandal and other scandals of this 
government, there has been more and more public disillusionment 
with the way governments operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look fundamentally at this motion, all it is trying to do 
is make federal government operations more transparent.  There is 
nothing wrong with that.  Most members of the House would agree 
that it is in the best interests of governments to become 
transparent.  They definitely should make the public aware of the 
sorts of things they endeavour to take part in and make available 
documents, reports, minutes of meetings, memos and anything else 
that should be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can especially point to the issue of the Calgary declaration. 
The public is skeptical.  They really do not know what the 
federal government's role is within the Calgary declaration. 
Obviously it was a provincial effort.  All of all the premiers of 
the country came together to suggest issues of positive change in 
the direction of unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government has a role to play and has taken 
a role in that process.  It is very important to make what its 
role is public.  The issue of transparency is fundamental in 
trying to regain public confidence in governments and in the way 
they operate.  I believe that is the crux of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the times we live in and the fundamental skepticism about 
politicians there is no reason for any member of this House to 
oppose this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I want to address is the issue of 
federal-provincial relations.  I have heard government members in 
their debate on this motion so far say that transparency would 
harm the government's ability to conduct federal-provincial 
affairs.  As a member of this House and as a participant of 
democracy that is very confusing for me.  As I mentioned earlier, 
when I look at the opportunities for governments in this whole 
direction of being more transparent and trying to enhance 
federal-provincial relations, the best way to do that is to make 
public and include the public in the endeavours the government 
chooses to take part in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the alienation that exists in this country 
between the provinces and the federal government there is no 
better time to change the direction of that public opinion by 
making government operations more transparent and by sharing 
information with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alas, we know what the government's stand is on trying to deal 
with the regions and the provinces.  We have seen so many cases 
where it does not respect democracy and does not want to enhance 
its relationship with the provinces.  We seen that most recently 
in the case of Alberta with its Senate elections.  People in that 
province who are trying to change the way democracy works have 
gone ahead with an election process, trying to make the 
federal-provincial system of Senate representation work much 
better.  They have been thwarted in that process.  There is no 
direction on the part of government to try to enhance 
relationships between the provinces and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen that on other issues concerning parliamentary 
reform.  Many people in this country want changes, but we tend to 
see over and over again the heavy-handed governing strategy of 
this government and that unfortunately creates alienation between 
the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the tabling before this House copies of 
documents reporting on meetings, notes, memos and correspondence 
relating to the Calgary declaration will harm the government's 
ability to conduct federal and provincial affairs is absolutely 
ludicrous to assume.  Because we have not made a lot of these 
things public is the reason we have harmed provincial-federal 
relationships to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, in its new Canada act, has outlined 
ways to specifically address provincial-federal tensions.  One of 
the best ways to do that is to make governments more transparent 
and to address the fact that we need to make anything the federal 
government does more transparent. 
This would allow a relationship to develop between the provinces 
and the federal government, and the government has failed 
miserably in doing so.  I encourage the government to consider 
that because there is nothing to hide and there should not be 
anything to hide.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to address is the impact on unity.  When 
it comes to the whole issue of the Calgary declaration, the 
initiative of the provincial premiers, there is definitely a will 
for change in the country.  There is definitely a will to address 
this age old unity problem with some new solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the new Canada Act.  The official opposition has made 
that public.  We encourage debate on that.  We encourage people's 
feedback on that.  We feel it is important that the public gets 
involved with important issues that will fundamentally change the 
future of the country.  Why do we not see that sort of effort and 
will on behalf of the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions raised with this motion is how on earth as 
democratic representatives we can argue against making public any 
sort of reports, documents or memos pertaining to the Calgary 
declaration which could fundamentally affect the future of the 
country.  It is a wonderful initiative on behalf of provincial 
premiers trying to evoke change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to summarize that if the government were interested 
in democracy, if it were interested in freedom and if it were 
interested in allowing positive change to take place in the 
country, it would make an effort to make its dealings more 
transparent.  The government should want to make an effort to 
make provincial-federal relations more transparent and more 
effective. It would make it easier for for them to work together 
and for the provinces to deal with federal problems and vice 
versa.  To be able to deal with the Calgary declaration in the 
way the motion says the government should allow unity and the 
future of unity to be debated openly.  That should be encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House should support the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate being able to rise in support of the motion moved by 
my esteemed colleague from Calgary West and seconded by my 
learned colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona.  It is an important 
motion that reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble address be presented to His Excellency praying that 
he will cause to be laid before this House copies of all 
documents, reports, minutes of meetings, notes, memos, polls and 
correspondence relating to the Calgary declaration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very sensible motion, as my colleague said, calling 
for transparency with respect to an important development on the 
national unity file. It is particularly important because several 
times my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona has risen in his 
place to ask members of the government cabinet at question time 
what exactly they plan to do, if anything, to consult Canadians 
on the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the maiden question put by my colleague from 
Edmonton—Strathcona in this place last year related to that 
point:  what, if anything, the federal government was doing to 
consult Canadians about the Calgary declaration given that at 
least nine of the ten provincial governments engaged in fairly 
exhaustive and in depth consultation processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have yet to receive, notwithstanding several 
efforts, a clear response to that very simple question.  It seems 
the federal government has no plan to consult Canadians about the 
future reform of the federation and potential amendments to our 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find this very worrisome.  If Canadians have learned one 
thing over the past 15 years of politics surrounding national 
unity and the Constitution, it is that a behind closed doors top 
down approach to constitutional reform is rejected out of hand by 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw this in the approach the Liberal government took to the 
repatriation of the Constitution and the adoption of the charter 
of rights in 1982 by limiting debate to a small circle of 
political elite within the government. 
That decision did not carry the support of the majority of 
Canadians in a majority of regions.  It ended up helping to 
create ongoing constitutional discord because it did not embrace 
the heartfelt concerns of Quebecers with respect to repatriation.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly in the efforts made by the federal government in 1986 
through 1990 to adopt the Meech Lake accord we saw the same kind 
of top down, secretive, behind closed doors, executive 
federalism.  It was elite brokerage politics which left ordinary 
Canadians on the outside of the information loop and left 
politicians alone on the inside.  This led to enormous public 
cynicism about the Meech Lake accord, which ultimately was its 
undoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself led to a revival of separatist sentiments in the 
province of Quebec, which then led to the sad history of the 
Charlottetown accord in 1982.  The then federal government 
finally realized that leaving Canadians on the outside of the 
process and maintaining secrecy about negotiations and 
consultations on unity and constitutional reform was no longer 
acceptable.  That question was put to Canadians in the referendum 
held in October 1992.  We know of the remarkable historic result. 
Canadians overwhelmingly rejected the jerry-built approach to 
special status in constitution making and interest group politics 
found in the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started this process once more with the Calgary declaration. 
Nine of the ten premiers gathered in good faith in Calgary in the 
summer of 1997 to examine ways to once again begin as a 
federation to talk about the need for reform of our 
constitutional framework to include all Canadians, including 
westerners and Quebecers.  The premiers came up with the five 
principles of the Calgary declaration as a framework for 
discussion.  They encouraged their various legislatures to engage 
in an exhaustive process of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those provincial governments went to their constituencies. 
Through a variety of techniques which included public opinion 
polls, focus groups, town hall meetings, information circulars, 
surveys, brochures, Internet sites and special committees, each 
provincial government reviewed the input from the public and each 
premier reported back to their fellow premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the beginning of a bottom up process for reform of the 
federation and the Constitution.  Unfortunately no similar effort 
was undertaken by the federal government.  When my colleague for 
Edmonton—Strathcona asked the government whether it intended to 
engage in such consultations in the province of Quebec, the 
answer was no.  There was no such plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the official opposition assumed the responsibility to 
consult with Quebecers.  We mailed an information circular on the 
Calgary declaration to a quarter of a million homes in the 
province of Quebec seeking input on the declaration.  We 
conducted a poll and held public meetings.  We generally did 
whatever we could within our limited resources to get public 
feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have put the motion before the House.  We feel 
the government has been cavalier and indifferent at best to the 
Calgary declaration, which by no means is perfect.  It includes 
elements of deep concern to many Canadians.  Many people are 
concerned that the unique characteristics clause may be some day 
interpreted to confer special legal privileges on a particular 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding, most Canadians support the general direction of 
consultation, the principle of equality of provinces under the 
law and the principle of rebalancing powers as the premiers 
further manifested in their social union agreement in Saskatoon 
earlier this year.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion comes before this place simply to ask the government 
to show the House and to show all Canadians what, if anything, it 
has done, said and thought about or how it has consulted 
Canadians in the way of public opinion polls and other mechanisms 
with respect to the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important.  This should not just be regarded as some 
sleepy motion.  It is critically important that we get the 
process right at the front end, that we do not once again find 
ourselves as a country in the backwaters of the constitutional 
elite brokerage deal making that occurred at Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown.  It is absolutely critical that we know exactly 
what the Government of Canada has done, said and plans to do with 
respect to the constitutional future of the country and reform of 
the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While speaking to the motion I would also point out it is 
unfortunate, in seeking access to critical information of this 
nature, that increasingly Canadians and parliamentarians find the 
legal framework for access to information far too inaccessible. 
The Access to Information Act passed in parliament in the 1970s 
has become a joke in terms of guaranteeing real access to 
government information.  It is well known that the bureaucracy 
has learned how not to comply with the spirit of the act but has 
managed to twist the letter of the law to its advantage to keep 
secret government information which should be public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a partisan opinion that I express.  Some members 
of the government opposite, including the hon. member for 
Hamilton—Wentworth, have put forward a comprehensive private 
member's bill before us to completely overhaul and reform the 
access to information law so that it will once again put Canada 
on the leading edge of governments with respect to openness, 
transparency and accountability.  This is an important principle. 
As someone who used to work at an advocacy organization seeking 
information on government spending I can say that time after 
time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but the 
member's time has expired.  I have been trying to get the 
member's eye for the last two minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
the motion has come back on the order paper.  When it was 
introduced into the House I was at home awaiting the arrival of 
my new daughter and was unable to speak to it.  I thank the 
member for Simcoe North, the former parliamentary secretary to 
the minister of intergovernmental affairs, who stood in my 
absence and responded on behalf of the government, and the member 
for Vancouver Quadra who also spoke to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to respond to the comments that have been made, and 
certainly the comments that were made when the House was 
previously seized with the matter, it is important for us to 
reflect on a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in my 11th year as an elected person.  I spent two terms in 
the provincial house and I am now in my second term here.  It has 
been my experience—and I think this experience holds in most 
walks of life—that we do our best work and create the best 
results when we work together, when we work in co-operation, when 
we attempt to put aside some of our differences and work on 
behalf of the best interests of the country and the people we 
serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is this more important than in the issue of 
constitutional reform which affects every person in the country. 
It is an issue that must be considered very carefully.  Each 
decision we make will become part of the structure of the country 
for a very long time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a process to be entered into lightly and I certainly 
do not hear members opposite suggesting that we should. The 
important aspect for me is that it is a process that needs to be 
entered into co-operatively.  It is a process that is entered 
into when people are sitting down, not to fight about their 
personal differences or their broad political differences, but to 
look at ways in which they can produce something that is truly in 
the best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I am a little surprised by this motion.  It is 
said that if the policies or actions of the government cannot be 
attacked, then attack the process.  Unfortunately, recently in 
this House when members cannot attack the process, they attack 
the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a lot of debate in this House in these last few 
weeks, certainly since we came back into this House in September, 
that has little to do with reality, little to do with actions of 
individuals and a lot to do with an attempt by members of this 
House to personally discredit and attack individuals.  I find 
that extremely distasteful. In the two speeches that were just 
made I have heard the words “secrecy”, “behind closed doors”, 
“talked down”, “ramming things through”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's response to this motion?  It will 
produce all the papers.  That was the government's response 
before it was debated in the House.  There is no secrecy here. 
There is no attempt to hide anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where are they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Ask for them.  A member opposite asks 
where are they?  The point is that we moved to this debate before 
anyone asked for the papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  I am sorry.  I do not want to be like our 
NDP friend on the plane who chooses to share all conversations, 
but there were conversations which took place that I was a party 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said from the beginning that we do not have 
any objection to sharing this information.  I would suggest on 
issues such as this one in the future that if there is a concern, 
if there is information members opposite want, and I am not 
saying all information will be shared automatically, but the 
information will be shared.  I am certain there will be policy 
issues and information that will come forward at times between 
the government and others where it will be difficult to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue, I would advise members that if they want 
information from the government, perhaps the first approach would 
be to call the minister and ask if they could have it.  If 
members get told no, then they have the option of going the 
freedom of information route and all this information would have 
been received that way, or members could come to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To start at the top simply uses a lot of time that could be 
spent elsewhere and produces no advantage, no additional result, 
particularly when members have been told they would get the 
information.  One has to wonder why members came into the House 
to do this.  Is it because they really want to get the 
information because they are concerned about transparency or is 
it because they want to create a straw man that reinforces the 
image members want to create regarding secrecy and lack of 
accountability?  Members want to run against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue frankly that it is the latter.  I would feel, if I 
were allowed to feel things around here any more, that that was 
probably an abuse of the time of this House.  More importantly it 
is an abuse of the process that we have to create if we are going 
to create the kind of constitution we all want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the official response of the government to this motion? 
This comes from the speech of the member for Simcoe North.  The 
government agrees to follow up on this initiative. The member in 
saying this has said his prediction is that the government will 
vote down this motion. Why are these polls being held back?  Why 
are we not being apprised of the situation?  The government's 
response is “Sure. If you want them, you have got them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Give them to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  The member says to give them to him.  Let 
me read the motion:  “That a humble address be presented to His 
Excellency praying that he will cause to be laid before this 
House copies of all documents, reports, minutes of meetings, 
notes, memos, polls and correspondence relating to the Calgary 
Declaration”. We have agreed to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I expect that tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  It takes a few days to pull it together. 
Under freedom of information I think the departments are given 40 
days to prepare it.  When it comes before the House all documents 
have to be put together.  Those that are not originally in both 
official languages have to be translated before they can be 
entered into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of that information will be produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the comments that were made by the member from 
Calgary about the government's supposed concerns about the 
Calgary declaration, let me read what the former parliamentary 
secretary of federal-provincial relations said when he spoke on 
this motion in the House:  “The Calgary declaration is based on 
seven principles that are completely”—completely, not 
partially, not maybe, not sort of—“in line with our 
government's national unity policy.  It highlights our country's 
diversity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How that can be twisted into some other government playing games 
with the Calgary accord or not supporting the Calgary accord is a 
little difficult to figure.  The point I would like to make is 
that if we are truly going down the road to changing, rebuilding, 
restoring confidence of Canadians in our constitutional framework 
and we are truly going to rebuild this framework, maybe we should 
begin that process by trying to work together on it rather than 
simply making it one more straw man that arguments are created 
about.  I do not know how that assists the process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in a democracy in order for people to make decisions, 
they need information.  For the member opposite to give the 
impression that the government is forthcoming and free in sharing 
that information is totally hypocritical and totally false.  One 
of the biggest problems I face as an MP is the fact that I cannot 
get information in a timely fashion. It is a very serious matter 
which needs to be addressed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point is that if the elected representatives of the 
people of Canada are to be effective and make proper decisions in 
a democracy as we pretend to have here, we need to have that 
information.  It needs to be forthcoming. I have had a lot of 
experience in the last five years where that information has not 
been forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an issue here regarding the Calgary declaration, or 
separation, or the Quebec issue, whatever the label is, where 
that information is not forthcoming.  This issue gravely affects 
the country and for the government not to be producing all of 
these things is very serious.  The government pretends it is but 
it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had information denied to me regarding positions that 
this country has taken at the United Nations and the government 
continues to stonewall.  It continues to deny us the information 
as to what it is saying and doing internationally.  I cannot 
understand why it does not share this information.  The 
government shares it all over the world.  It shares it with 
people from other countries, many of them dictators and people 
whom we may not even agree with. The government is more open with 
those people than it is with the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very serious problem here, especially in parliament. 
When we are dealing with issues here we need information and I 
hope that information will be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is my experience with questions on the Order 
Paper where we specifically ask the government for information in 
relation to a certain matter.  The government is supposed to 
answer within 45 days.  I have yet to have an instance in which 
it does answer within 45 days. We sometimes have to wait a year, 
even longer. This is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada ought to be aware of the fact that one of 
the biggest problems I face as a parliamentarian is the fact that 
I cannot get proper information in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  According to 
Standing Order 97(2), it is my responsibility to interrupt debate 
for right of reply.  The government has the first right of reply 
and seeing no one standing, the hon. member for Calgary West, the 
mover of the motion.

rise on a point of order. I am not 100% sure whether this is a 
point of order, so I look for your wisdom on this. I would like 
to suggest to the House that the motion be amended by adding 
after the word— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but on a 
motion to amend at this point, we are just about to put the 
question after the right of reply.  I cannot receive an amendment 
on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have allotted the time until 12 o'clock in which to 
debate this motion and everyone will be sitting here doing 
nothing if we do not continue the debate until 12 o'clock, I 
would like to seek unanimous consent that we allow this motion to 
be further debated for the next 20 minutes and if necessary, the 
amendment be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
amendment one of my colleagues was trying to move was to make 
sure that the papers would be tabled in the House no later than 
February 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that an election in the province of Quebec is 
happening as we speak and in less than a month there will be a 
new government chosen to represent the province of Quebec.  In 
this whole issue of federal-provincial relations it is important 
that the federal government comes clean on what it has as 
documentation with regard to the Calgary declaration.  It is only 
fair that it does so in a timely fashion so that it can be taken 
into account by the electorate of the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question really lies with what was the federal government's 
role in the Calgary declaration, what was its position and what 
type of backroom negotiations, deals, polls and whatnot did it 
conduct with regard to the declaration.  That is what this motion 
fundamentally speaks to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a will for change in this country.  One of my other 
colleagues mentioned that.  The Reform Party obviously has a will 
for Senate elections. The Bloc has a will with regard to a change 
in the nature of the relationship between the provinces and the 
federal government.  The NDP wishes to abolish the Senate.  The 
Progressive Conservatives in this House have a will for change 
with regard to their own leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really is about consultation and whether or not the federal 
government has engaged in that and what it has done with regard 
to that in the Calgary declaration. It is one of the reasons we 
wanted to see these papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time this type of thing was done with regard to 
constitutional papers was with the Charlottetown accord in 1992. 
The opposition at that time went on a fishing expedition and 
found a goodly amount of information with regard to what the 
government was up to on the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the issue of transparency, as I said before, in a month 
there will be a new government in the province of Quebec.  We 
will find out what the people of Quebec decide with regard to 
their future.  If the federal government has nothing to hide, it 
should be willing within a month to provide the information so 
that the people in Quebec know what position the federal 
government was taking in secret and in public with regard to the 
declaration.  This amendment that we were trying to put through 
was so that the reasonable portion of the time line would be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that the government should provide these types 
of documents within 90 days, or three months, call it what you 
will.  I wanted to make sure that the government was held true to 
that and if we could speed up that process we should endeavour to 
do so.  In that way everyone would know what the federal 
government was up to on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It would be a first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  That is right, it would be a first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on a couple of other things just to wrap up this 
debate.  I want to see the Liberal government operate and come 
forward with these documents in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the red book in 1997 the Liberals promised that any future 
debate that puts into question the continuing existence for the 
unity of Canada would be characterized by clarity and frankness. 
In that spirit, the Liberals wrote it themselves by their own 
hand, by their own pen. 
In the red book of 1997 they said they wanted to have clarity and 
frankness, and that is what the opposition is demanding on this.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not clarity and frankness with regard to provision of 
documents.  In 1992 with regard to the Charlottetown accord the 
government at that time said that one of the considerations that 
had to be taken into account was the potential for causing great 
damage.  The member for Wentworth—Burlington brought up that 
issue. If the federal government were forthright and had no 
difference between its public and private position there would be 
no potential for causing great damage.  I think we all want to 
see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the whole idea of co-operation.  When I 
brought this motion forward I had a flurry of calls from the the 
government asking me to pull this motion because it did not want 
to provide the papers.  It said I should do it through an access 
to information request which means that I would get fewer papers. 
The government asked me in a flurry of activity in the 48 hours 
before the motion was put to pull it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said it had the documents.  I said if it had them 
it could provide them and it refused to do so.  That is why I let 
the motion go forward and now that is why we ask for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I seek the unanimous consent of the House to consider an 
amendment to this motion which would specifically address some of 
the concerns that were voiced by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  An amendment to a 
motion cannot be raised on a point of order.  When we got into 
the right of reply the debate was ended.  After the right of 
reply it is the responsibility of the Chair to put the question 
forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the wisdom 
you have given me.  What I am seeking is simply the unanimous 
consent of the House to consider a motion.  I am not at this 
point putting forward the motion, I am just asking the House to 
consider an amendment to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will allow the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre to ask the House for unanimous 
consent. Just so we are clear, the member for Calgary Centre has 
requested the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion 
seeking to move an amendment. Is there unanimous consent?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 30 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-54, an act to support and promote electronic commerce 
by protecting personal information that is collected, used or 
disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of 
electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the motion 
that the question be now put. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to again intervene on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois on 
Bill C-54, the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right at the start, the Bloc Quebecois had to remind this House 
that, when it comes to protecting personal information, Quebec's 
law has for some time been unique in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec had a law protecting privacy in the public sector as far 
back as 1982. The federal government and the provinces later 
enacted similar legislation. In 1994, long before the federal 
government had envisaged doing so, the Quebec law extended the 
protection of personal information to the private sector.  Once 
again, Quebec was the first jurisdiction in North America to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's privacy laws were adopted to ensure respect for major 
fundamental rights provided in international instruments such as 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantee the 
right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These international instruments were reflected in the Quebec 
Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which was enacted in 1975, 
and which was in fact the first law dealing with the right to 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind this House that section 5 of the Quebec charter, 
enacted in 1975, provides that “Every person has a right to 
respect for his private life”. This implies of course that 
governments must pass laws to protect this right, including 
against any misuse of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec act respecting the protection of personal information 
in the private sector is rather similar to the directive from 
the European Union on this issue, which is also a leading-edge 
document. This means that Quebec and the European Union are the 
jurisdictions that are most respectful of the right to privacy 
when it comes to the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Bill C-54, which is now before us, it is in response to 
numerous commitments made by the government to enact a federal 
law to protect personal information in the private sector, which 
comes under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the title itself shows a will to reduce the level of 
protection that the legislation should provide, since it reads 
an act “to support and promote electronic commerce”. This means 
it is first and foremost an act to promote electronic commerce. 
Then comes “by protecting personal information that is 
collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances” only “by 
providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or 
record information or transactions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the title already tells us about the limits which the 
government wants to impose on the protection of personal 
information that may be used or collected by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this bill is not an act to protect personal information but 
rather an act to manage the use of personal information in the 
sole area of commercial activities. 
Unfortunately, Bill C-54 is another bill whose core is to be 
found in a schedule and one that restates guidelines originally 
developed at the OECD and embraced by standards organizations in 
Canada. This is a bill whose schedule, which is its heart, its 
core, is written in the conditional. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205
<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to take a close look at this bill and its schedule to 
notice that the so-called requirements are in fact written in the 
conditional, which means that for all intents and purposes 
theses requirements are really only suggestions or 
recommendations being made to those who hold personal 
information and should ensure its best use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in considering the bill, under paragraph 5(2), every 
government institution is required to specify the identified 
purposes to the individual from whom personal information is 
collected, but subparagraph 4.2.3 of the schedule states, and I 
draw members' attention to the use of the conditional here, that 
the identified purpose should be specified at or before the time 
of collection to the individual from whom the personal 
information is collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two subparagraphs further, subparagraph 4.2.5 of the schedule 
states—and again I draw members' attention to the use of the 
conditional—that persons collecting personal information 
should be able to explain to individuals the purposes for which 
the information is being collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it would seem that the purpose of Bill-54 is, through 
watered down obligations written in the conditional, to promote 
electronic commerce by making the right to privacy in the 
private sector a secondary consideration. Worse yet, the Bloc 
Quebecois believes that, in some instances, this bill will 
restrict the rights Quebeckers currently have under legislation 
passed by the Quebec national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 17 of Quebec's protection of personal information 
legislation, an Eaton employee in Montreal is entitled to see 
his personal file, even if it is kept in Toronto. However, with 
Bill C-54, he would not necessarily be able to view his file, 
because his request would be subject to legislation that ignores 
the right to privacy when the access to information request is 
made under labour relations provisions and is not of a 
commercial nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the weaknesses of this bill, and we have pointed this out 
in the last few days, is that clause 27(2)(b) gives the Governor 
in Council excessive powers that should never be given to a 
government and that should be spelled out in the bill if there 
is really to be any respect for the fundamental right to 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill relies on the voluntary CSA code.  This code is 
mentioned in the preamble to the schedule.  But those with 
primary responsibility for protection of personal information 
were not impressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave an example that is worth repeating today. 
The access to information commissioners for Quebec and for 
British Columbia were quite critical of this code and argued 
that it did not go far enough and did not provide optimal 
protection.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1997-98 annual report, the Quebec access to information 
commissioner said that going along with this proposal, the CSA 
standard, would be a step backward from the current situation in 
Quebec as far as protection of personal information is 
concerned.  The British Columbia commissioner made similar 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois feels that Bill C-54 makes this 
a long and complex procedure that will do nothing to protect the 
legislation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry but your time is 
up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak once again to Bill C-54, because it represents 
a missed opportunity by the federal government and the Minister 
of Labour to assume the leadership role announced on a number of 
occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surprising that the thrust of this bill is not the 
protection of personal information and privacy.  As we look into 
it, we realize how different it could be and in fact how much 
work went into making it different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be amiss if I did not mention that the Minister of 
Justice had announced at an international conference he would be 
tabling a bill on the protection of personal information.  We 
understand it was the upcoming OECD conference that pushed the 
government into action. 
Unfortunately, this haste caused it to circumvent the 
federal-provincial consensus reached.  The consensus was on 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that, for a long time, it was hoped in 
Canada—and it was the wish expressed by the former privacy 
commissioner, Mr. Grace—that protection of personal information 
in the private sector would be voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When privacy commissioner Bruce Phillips was appointed, and 
after he himself had tried to provide for a voluntary 
arrangement that would adequately protect the public, he said, 
in his 1997-98 annual report, that he had reached a different 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past seven years have brought one signal change: that is in 
my views on how best to face the mounting 
challenges to preserving privacy rights.  My first annual report 
expressed a scepticism about the need for stronger privacy laws 
and “some hope yet for the path of voluntary action”.  That hope 
did not long survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1995, I confessed “Reluctantly and by 
stages” to having concluded that “voluntarism is inadequate”.  I 
pressed for both federal and provincial action to bring the 
private sector under the umbrella of privacy laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evolution in thinking occurred partly (but not entirely) 
because of the inadequate response of the private sector. Other 
important influences were at work. These include growing 
government and private sector exchanges of information, 
privatization of government operations with the resulting loss 
of existing privacy information— 
</UL>
<Something the Bloc Quebecois has often pointed out. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and the developing European Union common data law which risks 
restricting information flow to countries with inadequate 
private standards—of which Canada is one. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preparatory work done by Mr. Phillips, the commissioner, and 
by the provinces and the federal government was based on harmony 
and dialogue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have no choice but to deplore as strongly as we can 
the fact that Bill C-54 and particularly clause 27 not only have 
the federal government establishing a lower national standard, 
but also give it the outrageous power to decide whether the 
Quebec legislation applies to Quebec, and when, because they 
give the federal government the power to decide to what type of 
organizations and activities the provincial legislation applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable and incomprehensible, particularly 
in the case of Quebec and in light of the comments made by the 
privacy commissioner. 
Quebec has had a law since 1994 to protect not only commercial 
information, but also the numerous exchanges between businesses, 
associations, and so on, a law to protect privacy and personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, the federal bill restricts in many ways the 
scope of the provincial act. Some of the conclusions stated in 
the Owen report were reaffirmed by the task force on the future 
of Canadian financial services. The Owen report also recognizes 
that the Quebec act currently applies to all businesses in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dubreuil, a constitutional expert, was asked what would 
happen if the constitutionality of the provincial legislation 
was challenged. Mr. Dubreuil stated twice that the Quebec law 
would survive such a challenge. 
That means that this law applies now not only broadly to all 
businesses on Quebec soil, but it protects the rights of Quebec 
citizens when information about them is used elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same report notes, and I quote Richard C. Owen: “National 
institutions across the country will have to come to terms with 
these provisions”—the ones in the Quebec law—“when personal 
information is sent outside Quebec.  In practical terms, this 
means that they may be required to not send personal information 
about residents of Quebec, unless measures meeting the 
requirements of the law throughout Canada are met”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means Quebeckers are protected beyond the borders of 
Quebec. 
Now what happens with Bill C-54?  This bill has the power to 
regulate all transactions outside Quebec. It will also have the 
power to regulate transactions of businesses in Quebec under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is at least a third matter of concern: the influence of 
the federal bill, which recognizes the CSA code in the schedule, 
on future jurisprudence as it applies to the meaning of the 
Quebec legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a clear collision of what I might call Quebec and 
Canadian cultures.  The effort in Quebec and elsewhere before 
was focussed on harmonizing the two.  It might be advantageous 
for Canada, but this was not what the federal government chose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government chose to deprive Quebeckers of the rights they 
enjoy under their law.  It chose to not give Canadians 
equivalent protection.  It chose to include the schedule in the 
bill, the CSA code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This code, which businesses have agreed to apply, is a good one. 
However, the code is unclear.  It errs seriously in the matter 
of requirements concerning the consent businesses must obtain so 
people will know what information about them is being gathered 
and how it may be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us and for all Quebeckers—since the Quebec legislation was 
recently revised by the Liberals and the PQ—Bill C-54 is 
unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
needless to say, I take great interest in joining with my 
colleague for Mercier at third reading of Bill C-54 to support 
and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected.  I will not read the title in 
full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the primary purpose of this bill is to promote 
e-commerce.  If there is time, and if the government and public 
servants are so disposed, an effort will be made to protect the 
personal information that has been gathered using the 
increasingly sophisticated electronic equipment available on the 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 contains a number of shortcomings. Primarily, this is 
an extremely fragile and confusing piece of legislation that is 
liable to interpretation and to problems in determining 
divisions between the provinces and territories and the central 
government. This bill hands discriminatory power to the 
governor-in-council, or in other words the cabinet.  What is more, 
the commissioner has no real power.  Finally, this legislation 
will interfere with the Quebec legislation which has already 
been in place since 1982 and which has been reinforced in order 
to protect personal information not only in the public sector, 
in publicly owned corporations and in government, but also in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will most 
definitely object to Bill C-54, to which we are speaking this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, there is danger that the bill will limit 
Quebeckers' right to privacy , and no certainty that it will be 
capable of meeting the expectations of Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since ensuring homogeneity across Canada in the protection of 
personal information would appear to require the harmonization 
of legislation, one might well have expected the federal 
government to at least take some of its inspiration from what 
has been going on in Quebec for the past four years, from our 
experience with the protection of personal information.  But it 
did no such thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is a fundamental right.  The experts equate the right to 
privacy with other human rights such as the right to equality 
and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United 
Nations over 50 years ago and to which Canada was a signatory, 
states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security 
of the person. It also states  that no one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or 
correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is also protected in Canada, although only partially. 
This protection is not specifically included in the Charter, but 
that is how the courts have interpreted two important sections 
of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, sections 7 and 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment or two to read these sections.  Section 7 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and 
security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 8 provides as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Everyone has the 
right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to what happened a scant year ago in Vancouver, 
when the Prime Minister was host to APEC leaders.  One of these 
leaders was Suharto, a head of state who was trampling the most 
elementary human rights within his own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some 200 students demonstrated across from where the area 
where the meeting was to take place, the Prime Minister's Office 
and the Prime Minister himself issued no-nonsense orders to the 
RCMP to clear the area by 4 p.m.  We all saw what happened.  The 
duty RCMP staff sergeant gave orders to the demonstrators, 
students aged 17, 18 or 20 years old, several of whom were 
accompanied by their father or mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine being with your daughter, who is exercizing her civic 
right here in this country to express her dissatisfaction with 
our Prime Minister for showing so much deference to a dictator 
like Suharto. This same Prime Minister then asks the police to 
give a warning, but 20 seconds later, the police go all out, 
using what our PM referred to as civilized methods, that is 
pepper spray. The next day, the Prime Minister mocked us by 
saying he only used pepper in his soup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you expect our privacy rights to be respected in a 
country where even our civic rights are not respected? 
In this respect, I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet Roch 
Gosselin from East Angus Sunday morning. This middle-aged man was 
proud to tell me he got arrested, not under this government but 
under another Liberal government that was in office in 1970, 
when the current Prime Minister was a very high-ranking member of 
the cabinet that passed the War Measures Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly 500 arrests were made among the Quebec elite, often 
without just cause. Roch Gosselin, of East Angus, was one of 
those who were detained for a dozen days without knowing why. 
His only fault was to want to give his children and 
grandchildren a country: Quebec. Like Pauline Julien, he was 
jailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government is apologizing profusely, but the same men 
and women are now sitting across the way and proposing Bill C-54 
presumably to protect our privacy, our personal information. 
They want to see this legislation passed. Why do they not tell 
us the truth this afternoon? 
Why not say that the primary purpose of this bill is to promote 
the sale of electronic products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roch Gosselin is a distinguished citizen in his town of East 
Angus, yet his civic rights were trampled. He was jailed. What 
did the current Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, do 
when in cabinet at the time? Again, he mocked us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a free vote, this government refused to fund the legal 
representation of financially challenged Vancouver students by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
continuing a very important debate on Bill C-54, the purpose of 
which is to support and promote electronic commerce by 
protecting personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be recalled that the government introduced this bill 
last week, and everyone in this House, except the Bloc 
Quebecois, seemed to expect it to move rapidly along, like a hot 
knife through butter, more or less.  Fortunately, that was not 
how things went. Fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois pointed out 
some of the shortcomings and serious problems in Bill C-54, and 
once the House was aware of these, it was able to engage in a 
more thorough debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is pleased to have been able to make a highly 
significant contribution to this examination, one which is all 
the more significant because we are well placed to judge the 
enormous shortcomings in the bill, since we in Quebec have 
legislation for the protection of personal information in the 
private sector.  That legislation has been in place for the past 
four years and has proven itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always room for improvement in any legislation, of 
course, but ours is a serious act, one with muscle, one that is 
useful in defending people against intrusion into their private 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we have before us now, however, unfortunately lacks 
muscle. It is a bill without sufficient regulations and 
provisions to really protect the public. 
All that it does contain is a number of precautions and covers, 
very often in the conditional, things that should be done, with 
no obligation to comply.  People can opt out.  Where e-commerce 
is concerned, merely having a few obligations is really very 
weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the worse thing, however.  In some ways, this bill 
is undermining what Quebec has so wisely accomplished.  We in 
Quebec find ourselves trying to move ahead up an escalator, 
while the federal government is trying to make us go back down. 
The bill is a serious step backwards.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples.  Paragraph 5(2) of the Privacy Act, 
which governs the public sector, provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.(2) A government institution shall inform any individual from 
whom the institution collects personal information about the 
individual of the purpose for which the information is being 
collected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the legislation governing the public sector, federal 
institutions.  Now, this government is going to treat the 
private sector differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.3 of the schedule to Bill C-54 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.2.3 The identified purposes should be specified at or before 
the time of collection to the individual from whom the personal 
information is collected— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.5 of the schedule provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.2.5 Persons collecting personal information should be able to 
explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is 
being collected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have two conditionals, two clauses in the schedule that 
are not obligatory and easily ignored.  The identified purposes 
should be specified to the individual. 
They should be, but if they are not, it is not a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of legislation is this?  The bill says “should”but 
failure to do so is not serious.  Who will comply?  Nobody, 
obviously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, the bill says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons collecting personal information should be able to 
explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is 
being collected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says “should be able to explain”.  This is wishful thinking. 
If the person is unable to explain, too bad.  The public will 
provide information but will not know for what purpose.  There 
is no obligation to explain.  The public is not entitled to 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person should be able to explain, but may not be able to or 
does not feel like explaining and, whoops, the law becomes null 
and void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two simple and clear examples, but they show that this 
law lacks vigour and teeth.  It renders no service to the 
public.  It is essentially a useless law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is worse.  Bill C-54, in some cases, will restrict 
the rights of Quebeckers, rights they enjoy under provincial 
legislation.  Under the Quebec law, someone working for Eaton's 
in Montreal is entitled to see his personnel records, even if 
they are kept in Toronto.  Section 17 of the Quebec legislation 
provides for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-54, this same employee in Montreal will now no 
longer have access to his records, because Bill C-54 makes no 
provision for the right to privacy in connection with a request 
for access under labour relations laws or when, in any case, the 
request for access is not of a commercial nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec spent a lot of money on parliamentary commissions, 
hearings, receiving memorandums and legislation that is solid 
and respects individuals' right to privacy.  It cost money. 
Today, and for a week now, what have we been doing?  We have 
been trying to save Quebec, because the federal minister is 
trying to undermine what it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I am being paid at the moment not to improve the 
situation, but to prevent its deterioration. 
If Quebec were a sovereign state, if it made its own laws—in 
fact it already has a law to protect personal information—I 
would not be here trying to defend its legislation. Federalism 
is not just a question of profitability and non-profitability. It 
is also a matter of respect for the decisions made by citizens, 
in a legitimate and democratic fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will undermine a Quebec initiative, an important right 
for its citizens, in this era of telecommunications and at a 
time when electronic commerce is expanding. This makes no sense, 
but I have no choice. In fact, this is not the only bill that 
puts us in such a situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I can think of the young offenders bill, which was 
introduced by the Minister of Justice and which includes 
measures that are totally opposite to Quebec's successful 
initiatives. Sometimes, we Quebeckers look at what is going on 
and it makes us feel sad. However, when we get here, we feel 
much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things that we in Quebec do very well. The 
protection of personal information is ensured in a very adequate 
manner. The same is true regarding the rehabilitation of our 
young offenders. It is in Quebec that the youth crime rate is 
lowest and that rehabilitation measures are most successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so because, for over 25 years now, we have had a youth 
protection branch that has constantly been improving and 
providing really useful services. But the federal Minister of 
Justice introduced a bill whose content contradicts Quebec's 
successful initiatives, a bill which will lead us to the abyss 
where the other provinces already are when it comes to young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am looking forward to the day when Quebec becomes a 
sovereign state so we will no longer have to try to save what is 
working well in Quebec and prevent Ottawa from imposing lower 
standards. Indeed, Quebec's sovereignty looks more and more like 
the solution for our province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak to Bill C-54. As I told this House 
previously, this bill is about a fundamental value in our 
society, namely the protection of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has an impact beyond this chamber. This morning, there was an 
article in <I>Le Devoir</I> entitled “Increasing Pressure for the 
Protection of Consumers' Privacy”. It discusses the threats to 
our privacy and the need for consumers to be informed of their 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also discusses the bill we are debating today, emphasizing 
that the federal legislation will be imposed on any province 
that has not passed its own legislation in this respect within 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a bill protecting personal information and privacy 
is not new. 
Most provinces have already passed such legislation. The federal 
government is the one dragging its feet when it comes to taking 
its responsibilities and introducing a bill governing federally 
regulated businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we expected this government to draw on existing 
provincial legislation to bring forward a bill that is coherent, 
effective, clear and in harmony with provincial jurisdictions. 
Unfortunately for all Quebeckers and Canadians, this bill is 
wide off the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of protecting privacy as it should, this bill only 
protects the right of large private businesses to make profits 
with as few restrictions as possible. This is unacceptable. The 
federal government must go back to the drawing board as soon as 
possible. 
It must introduce a bill that really deals with the protection 
of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not yet convinced of the urgency of the situation, it 
should contact the president of the Quebec Commission d'accès à 
l'information, Paul-André Comeau. It will see that the Quebec 
government receives 2,000 calls each month from people concerned 
with the protection of their privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is fuelling the cynicism against politicians 
by using this empty and confused initiative to try to convince 
our fellow citizens that it is concerned with the protection of 
privacy. But it does not say it introduced a bill that is simply 
in favour of commerce, a bill that is only based on voluntary 
compliance by businesses as far as protection of privacy is 
concerned. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is full of loopholes. It leaves many sectors without 
any protection. This bill is filled with ifs and whens and 
shoulds. This means the government says to large businesses they 
should, if possible, be concerned with the privacy of their 
clients. I insist on the word should because this is exactly 
what we have in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is unacceptable. First of all, I would like to 
stress the fundamental nature of the right to privacy. Others 
have spoken of this before me, but I am returning to it because, 
with this bill, the Liberal Party is putting the right to make a 
profit before the right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experts equate the right to privacy with other human rights 
such as the right to equality and justice. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations 50 
years ago and to which Canada was a signatory, states that 
everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 
It also states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his 
privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his 
honour and reputation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms also impacts on 
the protection of privacy, even though this is not specifically 
in the charter. In Quebec, as members are aware, this right to 
privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human 
Rights and Freedoms, which was enacted in 1975. 
There is nothing ambiguous about section 5, which says, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. Every person has a right to the respect of his or her 
privacy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right is also recognized in Quebec's Civil Code, and my 
colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry, who is very knowledgeable 
in the law, can tell us that I am right. This right is indeed 
recognized in chapter III of Quebec's Civil Code entitled 
“Respect of Reputation and Privacy”, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>35. Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation 
and privacy. No one may invade the privacy of a person without 
the consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is crystal clear: respect of privacy is a fundamental right 
that is recognized internationally, as well as in Canada and in 
Quebec. It is wrong for the federal government to introduce a 
bill that does not protect this fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned in the article published this morning in <I>Le Devoir</I>, 
the situation in Quebec in this regard is particularly 
exemplary. The Government of Quebec is the only government in 
North America that has passed legislation protecting personal 
information in the public and private sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, many experts say that Quebec's law, which applies 
to the private sector, is one of the best in the world. It is a 
lot better than the federal bill that applies to the public 
sector only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surprising in this context that the government did not 
draw on Quebec's legislation. It would have achieved two 
objectives at once. 
First of all it would have ensured consumers would have top-notch 
protection. It would also have avoided all the inevitable 
loopholes and pitfalls of unharmonized federal and provincial 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to believe that the real objective of this bill is 
not the protection of privacy, but a vague exercise in public 
relations. The government would like to use this bill to show 
that it responds to the public's concerns. This, however, is 
totally false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not meet the expectations of the people of Quebec 
who want their privacy protected. Instead, it serves commercial 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Canada's privacy commissioner notes that the working 
document proposed by Industry Canada and the Department of 
Justice focuses more on commerce than on protecting privacy.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, one simply needs to compare the titles of the two 
acts. Quebec's act is entitled “An Act respecting the protection 
of personal information in the private sector”, whereas the 
convoluted title of the federal act reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec act is clearly more strict and more comprehensive, in 
terms of its format, definitions, clarity and because of the 
power of order given to the commissioner. 
It is for these reasons that we categorically reject Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government refused to follow the example of the 
Quebec act, even though it is recognized as a model in this 
area. This does not come as a surprise, because Quebec's act is 
aimed primarily at protecting citizens, whereas the federal 
government's bill is essentially intended to please big 
corporations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today especially as I have not seen you in a 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those watching us on TV, I am the member for Québec East. My 
riding is close to Quebec City. One of the most beautiful 
ridings in Quebec, it encompasses L'Ancienne-Lorette, Duberger, 
Les Saules, Vanier, Saint-Odile, Lebourgneuf, Neufchâtel, Les 
Méandres, Loretteville and the Huron village. I invite anyone 
following this debate and recognizing me as the member for 
Quebec East to write to or even call me if they have any comment 
regarding what is being said in the House today on Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues said repeatedly, this bill is weak and does not 
meet the population's needs. I have grave concerns regarding 
this bill because times are changing. 
We are living at a time when communications are very quick. My 
old communications professor, Marshall McLuhan, coined the 
phrase “the global village” to stress the extent to which we are 
increasingly close to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only problem. Today, in the late 1990s, on the 
eve of the 21st century, there are significant changes in the 
way trade is being conducted around the world. This morning in 
the Quebec daily <I>Le Soleil</I>, I read that there was less 
competition among Canadian firms. For instance, Loblaws is in 
the process of buying Provigo, a Quebec company. There are also 
the proposed bank mergers. Several of these developments are a 
sign of things to come that might not necessarily be good as 
mergers reduce competition and choice, often resulting in more 
expensive services and products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, when companies such as banks and multinationals become 
very powerful in today's electronic era, they might use personal 
information in a way that might be harmful to individuals. This 
is a real danger and the thrust of the debate surrounding Bill 
C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish the federal government were aware of its 
responsibilities. Unfortunately, such is not the case, as the 
labour minister and members across the way readily acknowledge. 
The way Mr. Chrétien has been behaving during the “Peppergate” 
events in Vancouver, showing a total lack of respect for the 
most basic democratic principles, is a case in point.

right which has become fundamental these days, the protection of 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in fact becoming an urgent and important right given the

personal information: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<“The myriad of transactions that involve personal information 
about identifiable individuals that take place without their 
informed consent constitute the disregard and destruction of a 
treasured human right on a massive scale.  These are good 
descriptions”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is describing in rather complex terms is the right to 
the protection of personal information. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<“In the new information age we will respect each other as 
individual human beings”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the commissioner had to say. Basically, he wants 
the government to respect the individual. This is elementary, 
but we found nothing comforting in Bill C-54 as introduced by 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this is a bill Jean Charest, in Quebec, could very well 
support, because it puts corporate interests before the public 
interest. Jean Charest has recommended to Quebeckers changes 
that would give priority to corporate interests over public 
interest, that would destroy much of the work done by the 
current government at the expense of individuals. Bill C-54 is 
the kind of legislation Mr. Charest would support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's Bill C-54 even undermines Quebec's 
existing legislation.  It must be recognized that Quebec has 
been a leader in a number of areas.  For instance, our elections 
act is among the best in the world.  We have passed farming 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have even carried out an enviable reform in the health sector 
that is a tribute to the courage of the present provincial 
government.  Well I remember watching Marc-Yvan Côté, the health 
minister in 1990, as he introduced his proposed health reform on 
television.  The bill for this reform would have been $650,000. 
Ultimately, nothing was done, for the other government took 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present provincial government has passed a number of laws, 
including one on the protection of personal information.  Quebec 
passed this law in 1994.  It is just one of many examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It proves that the present government in Quebec, with its 
open-minded and progressive bills, is on top of things.  This 
particular law is one of the best, if not the only one, of its 
kind in North America, requiring that personal information be 
protected in the private sector.  The federal government's Bill 
C-54 would be a step backward from the legislation passed by 
Quebec in 1994.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Bill C-54 is, once again, a step backward.  One 
of many.  The Prime Minister and this backward-looking Liberal 
government really lack the strength to bring in any 
forward-looking bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should support those who are calling for the Prime 
Minister's head.  For instance, this week, <I>La Presse</I> wrote that 
it was time for the Prime Minister to make his exit.  The 
<I>Toronto Star</I> has also called for his resignation, as have the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> the <I>Gazette</I> and the <I>Edmonton Journal</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, there was a chorus from numerous English-language 
dailies—not known for their separatist views—all after the Prime 
Minister's head because he does not respect fundamental rights 
in this country.  One good example of this lack of respect is 
Peppergate, but there was also the Somalia scandal and the 
ensuing attempted cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not therefore surprising that Bill C-54 is so wishy-washy, 
weak and contrary to the interests of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much having the 
opportunity to say a few words regarding Bill C-54, which I 
suppose is a serious attempt by the government to modernize 
legislation in recognition of the fact that Canada is entering 
the digital age.  It is an effort by the government of the day to 
provide a regulatory environment that will enhance electronic 
commerce and ensure that electronic commerce flourishes in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge that when we look at the advances 
countries have made in electronic commerce, Canada has in fact 
played a leadership role in this respect, certainly as far as 
public policy is concerned.  I noticed with interest just in the 
last six months the number of new publications that have come 
into being regarding various areas of this phenomenon called 
e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one was to identify the specific purpose of Bill C-54 it 
would be to create a legal and regulatory framework for 
electronic commerce by introducing measures to protect personal 
information in the private sector, by creating an electronic 
alternative for doing business with the federal government and by 
clarifying how the courts assess the reliability of electronic 
records used as evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of important issues that are attached to this 
legislation.  Let us first look at the implications of electronic 
commerce itself.  I suspect that most Canadians are unaware at 
this point of the effect that e-commerce will have on their lives 
in the very near future.  The growth of electronic commerce is 
expanding arithmetically in such a fashion that it will be 
doubling, tripling and quadrupling in the weeks and months ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the larger Canadian firms.  I will not 
mention any specifically because I suspect that at this point 
this is relatively privileged information.  However, we have been 
told by a number of the larger firms in Canada that now a 
significant amount of their purchasing is done using e-commerce. 
That has done away with a whole number of what we would normally 
refer to as middlemen:  the wholesalers, the retailers, the 
shippers and all sorts of others who would normally be part of a 
commercial arrangement between, let us say, a manufacturer and 
the eventual purchaser of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the larger firms have indicated that they now purchase 
over 85% of their annual goods using this type of method which, I 
guess if we were to extrapolate this in the long term, means that 
we will see, as the result of e-commerce, hundreds of thousands 
of jobs disappear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not disappear over the next 10 to 20 years, they will 
disappear over the next 10 to 20 months as firms introduce 
electronic commerce as a way of purchasing their supplies and 
realize the financial benefits attached to using e-commerce.  I 
suspect a lot of people are going to make a lot of money by 
simply introducing this to individuals firms.  A lot of firms 
will save a lot of money directly, but the fallout will be that 
hundreds of thousands of existing jobs will no longer exist 
because they will be made redundant as a result of electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous comments to the House regarding Bill C-54 I 
detailed how this process would work.  I will not repeat that, 
but I will say that since I made those comments I have spoken 
with a number of individuals who are presently involved in 
setting up electronic commerce facilities in various businesses. 
They tell me that this is going to—and I use the term 
advisedly—revolutionize the retail sector.  That is actually a 
euphemism for wiping it out.  Modernize, revolutionize and major 
change are other ways of saying that whole sectors of the retail 
sector of our economy will be eliminated.  This will take place 
very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could consider, for example, a business such as a travel 
agency.  Travel agents should probably start looking at college 
and university courses for a new career because electronic 
commerce is pretty well going to make them redundant.  People who 
are in the brokerage business advising clients, particularly low 
and middle income clients, with respect to their stock portfolio 
should probably look at another career option because this type 
of electronic networking will simply do away with the need for 
these folks in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can lament that, but I think it is fair to say that we are 
not Luddites by definition.  We acknowledge that e-commerce is 
with us.  What is crucial is that we understand the incredible 
impact it will have on our society economically, particularly 
when it comes to jobs, in the next little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally many of us think that in another decade or two we will 
see major changes.  I wish we were talking about a decade or two, 
but we are probably talking about a year or two.  This will 
result in huge and major changes to the way business is conducted 
in our country.  I do not think that we appreciate the impact 
which electronic commerce will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is a modest effort by the government to move in the 
direction of ensuring privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day I walked into a store in the city of Ottawa. 
I made a purchase and they asked me to sign a little screen.  I 
asked why I was signing the screen.  They said that once they had 
my signature I would not have to sign anything any more when I 
made purchases.  I did not think that sounded like a good idea. I 
would just as soon be on record as having made a conscious 
decision every time I made a purchase.  I refused to sign the 
screen, but the reality is that presumably people are signing 
these screens and their signatures are on record.  Once a 
signature is on record in one place, I suppose it could be moved 
very quickly to other locales.  I use this as a practical example 
of how privacy will be affected as a result of these moves toward 
a digitalized economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that in our society there are a number of 
organizations which have attempted to protect human rights in our 
country.  The right to privacy, for example, is a human right 
just like the right to equality and justice.  The United Nations 
universal declaration of human rights, which is celebrating its 
50th year this year and to which Canada is a signatory, specifies 
that everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of 
person and that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary 
interference with his privacy—family, home or 
correspondence—nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously our concern about privacy is very serious. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on to make the point.  However, what I am 
going to say in closing is that I do not believe our privacy is 
adequately protected by this legislation.  When this bill moves 
to committee this will be a crucial part of the inquiry that 
needs to take place.  We will need to have a sufficient number of 
witnesses come forward to convince the parliamentary committee 
that privacy has, in fact, been dealt with adequately in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate that a number of individuals representing 
groups have come forward in support of the general thrust of the 
legislation in principle, but, on the other hand, they have gone 
out of their way to point out a potential flaw, and that is the 
right to protect privacy, not only in the legislation, but in the 
attached regulations as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
you will allow me, first of all, to greet the great many people 
from my riding of Repentigny who are watching us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, a very important event took place in the riding of 
Repentigny in this busy and eventful month of November we are 
having in Quebec this year. This event was the convention to 
reconfirm our current MNA for L'Assomption, Jean-Claude St-André, 
as the official PQ candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that I have the unanimous consent of the House to 
extend our congratulations to him. Even the hon. member from 
northern Ontario agrees. 
There is therefore consent to allow me to extend our 
congratulations to the current and future member for the riding 
of L'Assomption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said this, it is my pleasure to now turn to Bill C-54, 
that members of the Bloc Quebecois and others eloquently 
criticized, to show why the bill, as it stands, should be 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an introduction, I shall discuss the origin of the bill and 
why we must debate it today. I can see there are members who 
want to hear the rest of my speech and hear why Bill C-54 is 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read the title of the bill, which, as the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve pointed out, is quite convoluted. It reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all one sentence: I did not omit anything. This is how 
the title of the bill reads. The title says it all: we are 
definitely facing a very convoluted bill, as I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where does it come from? It is the government's response to 
requests from several groups across Canada. It is a commitment 
the federal government made to introduce legislation on the 
protection of personal information in the private sector. 
This commitment was first made by the Minister of Justice in 
1996; he then promised a bill to protect privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry made that commitment his own—as they 
often do things twice over—when he responded to the 
recommendations of the information highway advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following these two commitments, documents were drafted. And 
last January, both ministers released a joint working paper 
entitled “The Protection of Personal Information: Building 
Canada's Information Economy and Society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, the working group created to examine the issue 
received 90 briefs. Almost all of these agreed that legislation 
was needed to protect privacy in the private sector. 
Thus, we were expecting good new when Bill C-54 was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost everybody stressed that the protection of personal 
information voluntary code developed by the Canadian Standards 
Association was a good start, but that it was a minimum and 
should be reinforced.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of privacy is recognised as a fundamental right. 
Sections 7 and 8 of the Canadian Constitution refer to it 
indirectly. Section 7 deals with the right of everyone to life, 
liberty and security of the person. Section 8 protects Canadians 
against unreasonable search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Quebec Charter for Human Rights and Freedoms enacted 
in 1975, it is very clear. Its references are not indirect. The 
Quebec 1975 Charter reads as follows: “Every person has a right 
to respect for his private life”. So, from a legal point of 
view, there are not too many problems with its interpretation. I 
repeat: “Every person has a right to respect for his private 
life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, Quebec has been a pioneer with regards to the 
protection of private life in this sector. 
It is the only jurisdiction in North America that has passed 
legislation to protect the private life of its people. For four 
years now, this legislation has been covering all aspects of 
human activities, commercial as well as others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind you of an act protecting private life that was 
enacted in 1982, and of an act amending it that was passed in 
1994. In 1982, an act for the protection of personal information 
in the public sector was introduced. The federal government and 
all provinces all passed legislation in this regard. Then, in 
1994, an act extended the protection of personal information to 
the private sector. It already exists. In Quebec, we have been 
dealing with this protection of private life process for several 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc believes the federal government should have used 
Quebec's experience as a model not only because it is recognized 
internationally, but also because it is essential that all laws 
passed in Canada and in the other provinces be compatible with 
one another for the greatest benefit of the citizens of Quebec 
and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compatibility of federal and provincial legislation, or their 
harmonization, does not seem to be a priority for our friends 
across the way. One has only to look at the Young Offenders Act, 
at the Tobacco Act, and now at the Privacy Act. Compatibility of 
federal and provincial legislation probably comes in tenth place 
in the order of priority of our Liberal colleagues in the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why harmonize legislation when one has the big end of the stick, 
as the Prime Minister of Canada would say? 
All we have to do is wave the stick, and the others will have to 
respect our opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which was eagerly awaited by everybody, is too weak 
and too soft for us to accept as it now stands. What are theses 
weaknesses? I will mention a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the measures concerning the protection of personal 
information are not in the bill itself, but in the schedule, 
where the Minister for Industry has decided to introduce word 
for word the standard personal information protection code 
developed by the Canadian Standards Association. This code was 
judged to be utterly inadequate by the federal and provincial 
personal information protection commissioners and by all 
consumers groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry could have used the Quebec Act 
Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private 
Sector as a model. I am sure that he could have followed the 
exact wording of that legislation without fear that Mrs. Louise 
Beaudoin, Quebec's minister of culture, would ever claim 
copyrights for the use of that sensible and reasonable act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By choosing to apply without change the CSA standard, the 
government revealed that it was opting for permissiveness 
instead of the full protection of Quebeckers' and Canadians' 
privacy. Among this bill's several loopholes is the fact that 
the annex contains eight clauses using the conditional tense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.3, for example, reads: “The identified purposes 
should be specified at or before the time of collection to the 
individual from whom the personal information is collected—” 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.5 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons collecting personal information should able to 
explain— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.5.2 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations should develop— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.5.3 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal information that is no longer required to fulfil the 
identified purposes should be destroyed, erased, or made 
anonymous— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worse is the default consent. In the area of personal 
information, informed consent is a basic principle where there 
should be no ambiguity. However, the voluntary code says that 
that consent can be obtained by default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that if someone does not check the box indicating 
that he or she does not want his or her personal information to 
be transmitted, it will automatically be. That is what is called 
default consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, I will say that for these two reasons and all the 
others that my colleagues discussed so eloquently, we must 
oppose Bill C-54 as it was introduced in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to join my colleagues in addressing the bill before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection of privacy has always been a major concern of mine. I 
was involved in the labour movement for many years before going 
into politics. I remember that when I was a member of the CSN, 
the organization's offices were searched by police. I saw police 
officers open books and carelessly search everywhere. To me it 
was a breach of privacy, of the collective life of our union. 
They searched our offices, our work spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been very much concerned by this question of 
privacy and this is why I have decided to rise today to address 
this bill. In my view, there are in fact a lot of enforcement 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have already mentioned, it is very important to 
recognize that there is a difference between the situation in 
Quebec and what goes on in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous difference just in the titles of the two 
acts. The Quebec act is entitled “An Act Respecting the 
Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the federal act is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is quite apparent just in the two titles. The 
title of the provincial act emphasizes the importance of 
protecting personal information in the private sector. 
We are debating a bill whose purpose is to promote electronic 
commerce and allow for its greatest possible extension and, 
incidentally, to protect personal information and privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the federal government is not seeting exactly the 
same goal as the Government of Quebec, which was primarily to 
protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about protection of individual rights and respect for 
privacy in relation to the economy, since this is the true title 
and the true purpose of the bill, we have to wonder how the 
Liberal Party is protecting privacy in relation to economic 
liberty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if we examine the behaviour of this government on 
the international scene, we realize that human rights often come 
a distant second behind economic expansion. 
I remind the House of what happened recently with the APEC. It 
has been in the news a lot, lately. Which was given greater 
priority, respect for democratic rights truly or the 
unreasonable demands of Suharto, a dictator? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill like this one does nothing to calm our concerns. The 
government says that it will promote electronic commerce but, 
since there may be some problems,  that it will also try to 
protect privacy. It is not easy to trust this government about 
the issue of privacy in relation to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues before me pointed out, this bill is flawed. 
Furthermore, the schedule will, in my opinion, be a source of 
problems in terms of application. Too much is written in the 
conditional. 
In my opinion, lawyers will have a field day with this bill 
because of the use of the conditional.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawyers are very happy with this kind of bill, as they are most 
of the time with federal bills, because this government's issues 
and federal bills are put completely within the realm of the 
courts. Very often, lawyers are the first ones praising this 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, we should understand that this is the way 
lawyers earn a living. They prefer the adversarial approach, 
because they can go in court and defend their clients as 
effectively as they can. I do not deny this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ponder over bills such as this one and others that 
have been put before the House and who involve a greater role 
for the courts. 
It is inappropriate for the government.  It seems to be saying: 
“Listen, if you are not satisfied with this bill or the existing 
law, just challenge it before the court”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People then have to pay huge legal costs, whereas the government 
has its own army of lawyers in the justice department and 
elsewhere. The government also has the money to pay lawyers to 
refute the arguments of any Canadian citizen who is seeking 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If private confidential information is disclosed in an 
electronic business deal and the whole legislation, in 
particular the schedule, is in the conditional it will be 
difficult for someone to say: “My private life has been exposed 
by this electronic commerce with which I disagree, and I would 
like you to protect me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see on which side the government will be. It will simply 
say: “Dear sir or madam, we are sorry, but your point of view is 
not in keeping with ours, and if you're not satisfied just sue 
us”. And then we start a legal saga which, too often, requires 
the taxpayer to pay sums of money he cannot afford, which means 
the government wins by default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, the Henry VIII section which in my 
opinion is absolutely terrible. 
You will remember that Henry VIII could, by decree, order that 
anyone in England be beheaded. Fortunately Henry VIII no longer 
rules because if he did it is quite likely that 45 heads of Bloc 
Quebecois members would be rolling on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is the same system because these people will be able to 
change the rules simply by Governor in Council decision, which 
means cabinet decision, and this in my opinion is a huge 
problem. Who is lobbying the government? Associations for the 
protection of private life? Consumer associations? I think not. 
Then, who is lobbying the federal government? It is the huge 
corporations, the big banks, all the people who have money and 
make billions in profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they think that some aspects of the schedule or the 
legislation do not suit their purpose, they will tell the 
government: “We are financing your party—we know how it works—our 
big corporation is financing your party so we do not want 
any interference with our electronic commerce”. Then they will 
ask the government to change the regulations. And we know what 
will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is quite secure because we are funded by the 
people. We get $10 or $15 in rural areas, in small towns. Our 
hands are not tied unlike the government in front of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have some obligations, because any major 
corporation that contributed $25,000, $30,000 or $40,000 to 
their party and now wants to engage in electronic commerce will 
say to the minister “Look, Sir, can you talk cabinet and the 
governor in council into making changes to the regulations, 
because I have a small problem here that is costing me 
approximately $100,000 or $200,000 a year?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do?  Once again, it will bow down 
before big business, and those who defend private rights and the 
right to privacy will end up empty-handed, as they usually do 
under this government.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-48, an 
act respecting marine conservation areas, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation 
areas, and more specifically to the amendment now before the 
House, which calls on the government to go back to the drawing 
board, to put it simply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation has a laudable purpose. However, the 
means to implement it are appalling, and that is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is asking the government to go back to the drawing 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, whose purpose is to define the legal framework for 
the establishment of 28 marine conservation areas, including 
eight in Quebec, each representative of the ecosystems 
identified so far in Quebec and in Canada, follows up an 
international commitment made by the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports this research, undertaken at the 
instigation of the World Conservation Union. It supports the 
environmental approach underlying this bill. 
However, the Bloc wants to forcefully state its disagreement 
with the means used.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wonders why the federal government did not 
draw on the agreement reached on the creation of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park in Quebec, which called for the 
cooperation, on an equal footing, of two governments in their 
respective jurisdiction and which even led to Quebec passing a 
legislation similar to the federal law, showing the respectful 
cooperation on the part of both governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was totally in agreement and urged adoption 
of this bill because it is the way to proceed where shared 
jurisdictions are concerned. 
Quebec is willing to co-operate, as it has shown with phase III 
of the St. Lawrence Action Plan, but for the bill to state as a 
prerequisite for the federal government's involvement in the 
management of marine conservation areas that title to the lands 
to be included in the marine conservation areas be vested in Her 
Majesty in right of Canada is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, instead of co-operating to ensure that in 
difficult circumstances, riparian communities take part in the 
preservation of those marine areas in the river, in the gulf and 
in the estuary, the federal government is saying that this land 
must belong to it, or else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For it, the implementation of the international agreement, its 
commitments are more important than the fact that this land that 
would become federal is most definitely located in Quebec 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a change from what we hear constantly repeated here, for 
example in the flattering record the Prime Minister presents and 
the progress he supposedly made in his relations with provinces, 
including Quebec. This government action is possible only if the 
concerned aquatic territory in Quebec is declared federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an authoritarian and disrespectful way of acting that, 
ultimately, would not be efficient. How can one imagine that not 
only coastal populations but also every stakeholder in Quebec 
will co-operate if this bill becomes law? We hope very much that 
it will be withdrawn and reworked. How can anyone imagine that 
it could lead to a co-operation of various governments instead of 
creating an institutionalized conflict due to the federal 
government's arrogant attitude, saying there will be work only 
if the marine conservation areas are federally owned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains other major problems. Overlapping is one that 
can certainly not be overlooked. This time, overlapping 
jurisdictions would not be provincial and federal governments, 
but different federal departments. This could be pretty funny. I 
hope the Royal Air Farce will examine this issue. They could 
also look into other matters, there are lots to choose from.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three federal bodies. The Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans has marine protected areas and regulations. There is 
Environment Canada, which has marine wildlife reserves and 
regulations. Finally, there is Heritage Canada, which has marine 
conservation areas and its own regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that these three federal organizations would 
talk to each other, would find a way to co-operate with the 
provinces, including Quebec, particularly since this is going on 
at a difficult time for people in the maritime provinces. 
Indeed, the coastal communities who rely on marine resources, on 
fish, are very disturbed and live in fear, if not in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we expect to have the freedom of mind that is necessary 
to look at the ecosystem from these various perspectives if the 
workers who have lost their jobs do not know what their status 
will be in two or five years? More importantly, these people do 
not know if they will have resources to live on. The fact that 
they live in such insecurity is evidence that something is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three federal organizations are looking after the ecosystem and 
the fishery, but what about the men and women who need to earn a 
living, who are faced with an employment insurance reform whose 
effects are being felt more and more? As we know, things will 
get even worse in the spring, but these people are already 
experiencing the adverse effects of the employment insurance 
reform, at a time when the government has an enormous surplus, 
which makes it all the more painful for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is overlap among the federal departments, which, through 
numerous consultations with the public and departmental 
interventions, can do nothing but foment exasperation and anger. 
The context needed for these commitments by Canada is the total 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share these commitments, but we say that if the government is 
serious, if it wants to progress, it will have to create, with 
the provinces, the conditions that will enable stakeholders and 
the public to become involved in a task that will fall to them 
in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good news to hear that the St. Lawrence is not as polluted 
as we thought.  That is what a study revealed two weeks ago. 
It is good news, but we know that our problems are not over and 
that the protection of ecosystems and marine areas requires 
public involvement.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but underline how shocking it is to see that, far 
from honouring its commitment in this regard, the federal 
government persists in acting in a unilateral and authoritarian 
way toward the provinces, particularly Quebec, so it can put the 
word “Canada” on every little marine area, instead of 
collaborating with Quebec and creating the conditions required 
to work with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all its sweet talk to Quebeckers, with Bill C-54, this 
government actually decides when the Quebec legislation will 
prevail and, with Bill C-48, it says it will not become involved 
in the conservation of marine areas unless its ownership is 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the mark not of a centralizing government but of a 
government which denies the very existence of the provinces, 
which wants to take over the areas under their jurisdiction. In 
doing so, the government wastes not only money but also energy 
and hinders the co-operation needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government sang the praises of renewed federalism. 
If there is a new way to make federalism evolve, it will be 
found in these bills because we rely not on the press releases 
which supposedly explain the meaning of the bills, but on the 
text of the bill itself. It is our responsibility. Indeed, 
whatever a minister may say about his intentions, he will have 
to act according to the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility is not to say “My God, the minister has good 
intentions and would never do such a thing”. We cannot do that 
because the minister may change his mind anyway, even if he had 
the intentions which he said he had. We cannot do that because 
this government could decide otherwise. The government may 
change and, anyway, legislation is interpreted not according to 
news releases but according to what is written in the act 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the supreme court, particularly in the two 
successive decisions from Justice Laskin and Justice Dickson in 
a case whose name I hope I can remember before the end of my 
speech, is interpreting provincial jurisdictions in a way that 
is increasingly eroding them. Our responsibility is to ensure 
that, if governments have other intentions, they spell them out 
in their legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, for both Bill C-54 and Bill C-48, if ministers have 
in mind something other than what appears in the legislation, we 
ask them to withdraw and rewrite them. We know that even with 
amendments the spirit of a bill will not change. 
Our amendments were rejected often enough for us to know that, 
in the future, to change the spirit of the bill, we must ask 
that the bill be withdrawn and rewritten in such a way that the 
interpretation given will really be the one used in enforcement 
of the legislation, and not only in the news releases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues opposite to read the bills drafted by their 
government instead of just relying on the news releases. They 
will understand why we are against Bills C-54 and C-48. What 
matters is the text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember instances where the Minister of Finance introduced 
new wording for his budget implementation bill, telling us that 
the original text should have read that way. These things do 
occur. The Minister of Finance did so and, in so doing, he 
confirmed that we were right in our interpretation. However, it 
took some reporters to understood it the same way we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, all bills do not get the same attention from 
reporters in the House who are simply not enough to cover 
everything that is going on here. We sincerely regret it because 
we could certainly see changes in behaviours and different ways 
of writing if the public understood better what is happening. We 
cannot say that a text means one thing when in fact it means the 
opposite. This is true of bill C-54 and it is also true of the 
spirit of Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the minister go back to the drawing board and I 
can assure her that, as was the case with the development of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the Bloc critic concerned, the 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, will do her share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the intensity of her speech, I am sure she will. 
However, if she does not agree with the bill, it would be a lot 
more difficult to support it and to enforce it afterwards, a 
situation that I hope will never happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, we are still confident because we believe in the 
set goal, but we are forced to realize that we were often 
disappointed. This is in fact the reason why bills C-54 and C-48 
reaffirm the necessity for Quebec to achieve sovereignty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is only 
recently that I have become interested in this bill. There are 
some aspects that I understand, some that I do not. I will ask 
my colleague to shed some light on this for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the bottom of the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf 
are within Quebec's jurisdiction.  I believe that the British 
North America Act clearly states that the bottom belongs to 
Quebec and is within its jurisdiction.  Even if it wanted to, 
Quebec could not sell it to anyone, let alone the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, if I understand correctly, the purpose of the bill before 
us is to have the federal government take over these areas in 
the river and in the gulf, on the grounds that they are wildlife 
conservation areas, which contain shellfish, plants and algae it 
wants to protect. And in a way expropriate from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is unconstitutional.  I believe that the federal 
government has no right to do so.  Why then is it proposing 
legislation that clashes directly with the Constitution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to shed some light on this for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague will agree 
with me that I am not the greatest expert on this bill. What I 
understand is what I read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of expropriation is not mentioned. However, it is 
clearly stipulated that the schedule cannot include the names of 
marines areas. Clause 5(2) reads as follows “An amendment to 
Schedule 1 may be made only if the Governor in Council is 
satisfied that clear title to the lands to be included in the 
marine conservation area is vested in Her Majesty in right of 
Canada—”

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can be interpreted to mean that the federal government is 
reserving the right to force any province to transfer an area in 
the river, the gulf or the estuary. Otherwise, the area in 
question could not be included as part of the action taken to 
comply with the international agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something in that logic that does not ring true. As I 
said, it does sound arrogant and even somewhat mean, because we 
have made our support for compliance with this international 
agreement known. However, we will not be able to support it if 
we have to give up the title to some areas, which is something 
we do not have the authority to do, anyway. Quebec does not have 
the right to transfer these titles to the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this is a very strange piece of legislation, 
which is why we are asking the minister to withdraw the bill and 
allow the committee to reconsider the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> There will be six minutes left for questions and 
comments when we will resume after question period. It being 
almost 2 o'clock, we will now proceed to statements by members 
so that we can have a little more time afterwards.

spending? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the only new spending in the tabling of the estimates was $628 
million for the Pacific salmon fishermen and the post-TAGS 
program.  The others were expenditures that were already 
announced in the previous estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the hon. member is against.  Is it the 
payments to the British Columbia salmon fishermen?  Is it the

health payments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me tell the minister what we are offended about. We are offended 
about the $4 million going to the millennium arts project and the 
$3.2 million going to the Senate.  I am sure that is what 
Canadians want to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we had the finance minister saying we have to be 
concerned because we have worldwide turmoil.  We have to be 
prudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think it is prudent to give $4 million to the

once again, the total amount given for the millennium which is 
$145 million has been set in previous estimates.  The member 
could easily have picked up the amount at that point and made his 
comments on it.  I will repeat my comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The really large amounts in the estimates are transfers to 
various parts of the population that found themselves in 
difficulty, the salmon fishermen, the people affected by the ice

these the payments my hon. colleague would like to see decreased?

the member cannot have it both ways, both to criticize health

goes across the country to hold public consultations about 
renewing itself and changing the way it does business to be more 
open and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That indeed is our objective, to ensure that the health

fashion that will hold the confidence of Canadians in an open and

It is part of that process to go public, to have public

that it is going to be too expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the price of an ELT is about the same price as 
a one-way ticket from Ottawa to Halifax, will the minister make 
it a requirement that all planes in Canada be equipped with ELTs

.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 125—<B>Mr. Ted White:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 2,224 minister's permits issued by the immigration 
department in 1997 to individuals who would otherwise have been 
inadmissible to Canada for technical reasons, the 1,797 
inadmissible for criminal reasons, and the 275 inadmissible for 
medical reasons, could the government please indicate the 10 most 
common reasons for the issuance of a ministers' permit for each 
of these three categories? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> a) In 1997, the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration issued 2,244 minister's permits to persons 
inadmissible for a variety of reasons other than criminal or 
medical inadmissibility.  The department does not have a list of 
the 10 most common reasons for which these permits were issued on 
behalf of the minister because data is not collated in this 
manner.  However, the majority of permits issued for technical 
reasons were issued to members of the family class to allow early 
admission to Canada before all of the processing steps were 
concluded.  An example would be the issuance of minister's permit 
to a spouse of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who is 
unable to undergo the required immigration medical X-ray due to 
pregnancy.  A minister's permit may be issued to allow her to be 
reunited with her family despite the fact she has not met the 
medical requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases, the X-ray is normally completed after the birth 
of the child and the processing of the spouse's application for 
permanent residence is then completed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister's permits may also be issued to facilitate the entry to 
Canada of highly skilled workers or business immigrants where 
Canadian jobs are at stake.  An example would be that of an 
applicant for permanent residence destined to work with a 
Canadian high-tech company.  The worker is key to the 
implementation of a project or the ability of the company to 
honour its contractual obligations. Hundreds of Canadians will be 
laid off if the company is not able to bring in the skilled worker 
immediately.  The prospective immigrant cannot be issued an 
immigrant visa because the medical examination or criminal or 
security screening have not been completed.  A minister's permit 
may be issued to allow the prospective immigrant to enter Canada 
and to start work immediately while processing of the immigration 
application continues abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) In 1997 the department issued 1,497 permits to persons 
inadmissible for criminal reasons.  The department does not have 
a list of the 10 most common reasons for which these permits were 
issued on behalf of the minister because data is not collated in 
this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an example would be that of a prospective 
visitor who admits to a minor criminal conviction several years 
ago, such as driving under the influence, possession of 
marijuana, or shoplifting, but wishes to come to Canada to visit 
family.  After determining that the individual presents no danger 
to the public, a minister's permit may be issued to facilitate 
the visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c) In 1997 the department issued 275 permits to persons 
inadmissible for medical reasons.  The department does not have a 
list of the 10 most common reasons for which these permits were 
issued on behalf of the minister because data is not collated in 
this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example would be spouses and dependent children sponsored by 
Canadian citizens or residents that are found to be medically 
inadmissible.  Minister's permits may be issued in such cases on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds in order to facilitate 
family reunification.  Departmental officials consult with 
provincial health officials before issuing minister's permits in 
such cases. Another example would be minister's permits issued to 
medically inadmissible visitors, including children, coming to 
Canada for medical treatment where the treatment is not available 
in the home country and the treatment has been prepaid by the visitor 
or the visitor's family in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK207">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-48, an 
act respecting marine conservation areas, be read a second time 
and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to talk about Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is entitled “An Act respecting marine conservation 
areas”, and its purpose is to provide a legal framework for the 
creation of 28 marine conservation areas representative of each 
of the Canadian ecosystems. 
The Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but is not governed this legislation since it 
has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 follows a commitment made by the Prime Minister of 
Canada to the World Conservation Union Conference held in 
Montreal in 1996. At that time, as in 1994, the union passed 
resolutions asking all coastal nations to act quickly to put in 
place conservation measures for marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 1998 was designated the International Year of the Ocean 
by the United Nations. Among the most important initiatives to 
mark this event we should mention the World Exposition in 
Lisbon, Portugal and the signing of the Ocean Charter, prepared 
by UNESCO, in September 1997 in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of marine conservation areas fulfills the 
objectives of many international forums and documents like the 
World Conservation Strategy of 1980, the 1991 report entitled 
“Caring for the Earth”, prepared by the IUCN, which is the 
United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Wide Fund 
for Nature, which is financed in part by the Government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures to protect 
the environment. More particularly, the Bloc Quebecois reminds 
the government that it supported the legislation creating the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park. Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois 
knows that the Quebec government is also pursuing initiatives to 
protect the environment and sea floors in particular.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is also open to working together with the 
federal government, as evidenced by the agreement signed by the 
two governments on the third phase of the St. Lawrence action 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois has to object to the bill before us 
for a number of reasons: first, instead of relying on dialogue, 
as in the case of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the 
federal government wants to create marine conservation areas 
regardless of Quebec's jurisdiction over its territory and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Heritage Canada is proposing the establishment of a new 
structure, that is the marine conservation areas, which will 
simply duplicate Fisheries and Oceans' marine protected areas 
and Environment Canada's marine wildlife reserves. 
In a nutshell, believe it or not, the federal government has 
found a way to divide itself into three components to better 
invade Quebec's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage, I would like to elaborate on our objections to 
this bill. First, let us look at the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
Marine Park, which is a model. In 1997, the governments of 
Quebec and Canada passed legislation to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. This legislation led to the 
creation of Canada's first marine conservation area, and one of 
the main features of this legislation is the fact that the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the first marine park to be 
created jointly by the federal and Quebec governments, without 
any land changing hands. Both governments will continue to 
fulfil their respective responsibilities. The legislation also 
states that the park is made up entirely of marine areas. 
It covers 1,138 square kilometres. Its boundaries may be changed 
through an agreement between the two governments, provided there 
is joint public consultation in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in order to promote local involvement, the acts 
passed by Quebec and by Canada confirm the creation of a 
co-ordinating committee, whose membership is to be determined by 
the federal and provincial ministers. The committee's mandate is 
to recommend to the ministers responsible measures to achieve 
the master plan's objectives. The plan is to be reviewed jointly 
by both governments, at least once every seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, any exploration, utilization or development of 
resources for mining or energy related purposes, including the 
building of oil lines, gas lines or power lines, is prohibited 
within park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, by means of regulations, the governments of Quebec and 
of Canada will be able to determine measures for protecting the 
park's ecosystems and resources and for protecting the public. 
More specifically, they will be able to define how each category 
of area will be used and for how long such use shall apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sagenuay—St. Lawrence marine park should have served as a 
model to the federal government for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another model it could have followed is Phase III of the St. 
Lawrence action plan.  On June 8, 1998, the environment 
ministers of Canada and of Quebec announced phase III of the St. 
Lawrence development plan, representing a total bill of $230 
million to be shared equally by both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of this action plan is to increase the 
area of protected habitats by 100% from 12,000 hectares to 
120,000 hectares. 
Phase III follows on the first two phases, in which both 
governments invested over $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now examine Bill C-48, which unfortunately fails to 
respect the integrity of the territory of Quebec.  One of the 
conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established.  This land, let it not be 
forgotten, belongs to Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 5(2) of the bill stipulates that the minister may not 
create a marine conservation area unless “satisfied that clear 
title to the lands to be included in the marine conservation 
area is vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada”—this of course 
being the Queen of England—excluding any such lands situated 
within the exclusive economic zone of Canada”.  A highly 
complicated way of putting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be noted that section 92.5 of the Constitution Act, 1867 
recognizes that the administration and sale of lands in the 
public domain are an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.  In 
other words, the 1867 Constitution says that Quebec is the 
exclusive owner of its territory.  There is a kind of 
contradiction here. 
As I asked earlier, is what we are dealing with here 
expropriation in disguise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Quebec legislation on crown lands, passed by the 
Quebec National Assembly, applies—and I invite the public to 
listen carefully, as well as this House—to all crown lands in 
Quebec, including beds of waterways and lakes and the bed of the 
St. Lawrence River, estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by 
sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making this up.  It is there, clearly written.  Quebec 
cannot transfer its lands to the federal government.  I repeat, 
Quebec cannot transfer its lands to the federal government. The 
only thing it can do within this legislation is to authorize, by 
order, the federal government to use them only in connection 
with matters under federal jurisdiction 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the protection of habitats and fauna is a matter of 
joint federal and provincial jurisdiction, and the Government of 
Quebec plans to establish a framework for the protection of 
marine areas in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided us by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage with regard to Bill C-48, marine conservation areas are 
planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary and the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence. These are three areas in which the ocean 
floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, co-operative mechanisms already exist to protect ecosystems 
in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park, and in the St. 
Lawrence River under the agreement entitled “St. Lawrence action 
plan, phase III”, which was signed by all federal and provincial 
departments concerned and which provides for an investment of 
$250 million, over a period of five years, in various activities 
relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Department of Canadian Heritage acting with such 
arrogance this time, by claiming to own the marine floor where 
it wants to create marine conservation areas, instead of 
permitting bilateral agreements with the Quebec government and 
thus avoiding having Canada once again trample Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word about environmental matters in the 
context of shared jurisdictions.  Under the Constitution Act, 
1867, the governments of Canada and Quebec share responsibility 
for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of section 91, the federal 
government has control over the following areas:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Quebec's Act Respecting the Conservation and 
Development of Wildlife specifies the role to be played by the 
Quebec Minister of the Environment and Wildlife. Section 2 reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. The Minister of the Environment and Fauna ensures the 
conservation and development of wildlife and wildlife 
habitats. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Quebec's legislation, the minister also has authority to 
appoint conservation officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to use the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as a 
model and by making title to the territory an essential 
condition for the establishment of marine conservation areas, 
the federal government is behaving, as Robert Bourassa used to 
say, like a centralizing government that wants control over 
everything, regardless of recognized jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 creates overlap within the federal administration 
itself. Through the Department of Canadian Heritage, the federal 
government intends to create marine conservation areas. Through 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, it intends to create 
marine protected areas. Through the Department of the 
Environment, it wants to create marine wildlife reserves. This 
means that a single site could find itself protected under more 
than one category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Canadian Heritage sets out its reasons for 
creating marine conservation areas in the preamble to the bill. 
It is establishing marine conservation areas to protect natural, 
self-regulating marine ecosystems for the maintenance of 
biological diversity; establish a representative system of 
marine conservation areas; ensure that Canada contributes to 
international efforts for the establishment of a worldwide 
network of representative marine areas; provide opportunities 
for the people of Canada and of the world to appreciate Canada's 
natural and cultural marine heritage; and provide opportunities 
within marine conservation areas for the ecologically 
sustainable use of marine resources for the lasting benefit of 
coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, it is proposing the 
establishment of marine protected areas. However, in a 
discussion paper released by Fisheries and Oceans in January 
1997, the purpose of marine conservation areas is described as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These zones are established to ensure the conservation of 
commercial and non-commercial fisheries resources and their 
habitats, endangered or threatened species and their habitats, 
unique habitats, productive ecosystems and biodiversity, any 
other marine resource. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, we are told that local people will have a 
significant involvement in the establishment of marine protected 
areas. The Bloc Quebecois wonders how many information or 
organization meetings local people will be invited to, serving 
bureaucracy instead of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Environment Canada, it is proposing to establish marine 
conservation zones, that could also be called natural marine 
reserves, expanding the concept of the national wildlife 
sanctuary beyond the territorial sea to the 200 nautical mile 
limit. 
These areas are also subject to the Canadian Wildlife Act, but 
require a different set of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these various laws, the Government of Canada is proposing 
to create marine conservation areas, marine protection areas and 
natural marine reserves.  The same territory could, according to 
Fisheries and Oceans, be zoned in various ways and subject to 
various regulations. Welcome, folks, to the complex world of 
Government of Canada bureaucracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minutes prepared by the Fisheries and Oceans officials 
following the consultation meetings on marine protection areas 
held by the department in Quebec, in June 1998, state, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a great deal of confusion among stakeholders 
regarding the various federal programs on protected marine 
areas—The departments concerned should harmonize their actions 
and co-operate to create protected marine areas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois shares the views of those who participated in 
these meetings and feels that this is bureaucratic overkill that 
will not serve the public's interest, in the end. 
The existence of an interdepartmental committee of these various 
departments is no reassurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from experience that having a number of departments 
involved in the same project makes it difficult for them to work 
together and ends up costing taxpayers a lot of money. The 
government would have been better advised to have a single 
department oversee the protection of ecosystems and the 
departments concerned conclude a framework agreement delegating 
their respective responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see there is confusion but there is more. The bill 
provides that each federal department will retain jurisdiction 
over its own marine conservation areas. However, when the 
Department of Canadian Heritage deems it appropriate it may, in 
co-operation with the department concerned, adopt regulations 
regarding a marine conservation area that differ from the 
existing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the change agreed to between the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and the department concerned takes precedence 
over other regulations under the Fisheries Act, the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Arctic 
Waters Pollution Prevention Act, the Navigable Waters Protection 
Act or the Aeronautics Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, I would like to add this. Consultations were held. Of 
all the answers given by participants and obtained by the 
department, only one was in French. As we do not have access to 
the names and addresses of respondents because this information 
is confidential in accordance with the Act respecting the 
protection of personal information, we can only conclude that 
Quebec did not have the opportunity to take part in 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this, the Bloc Quebecois, on behalf of the population of 
Quebec, will stoutly defend the right to territorial integrity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
my colleague from Portneuf for such a good speech showing how 
complex this bill is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like shooting one's self in the foot. The member clearly 
showed the overlap between three departments that want to be 
sure to intrude into an area that is outside their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' federal government has been shouting from the 
rafters it has met all of Quebec's demands. In its speech from 
the throne it claimed it was putting an end to overlap and 
intrusion into areas under provincial jurisdiction. However, it 
has now found a way to divide itself into three components and 
to actually overlap itself, so as to be absolutely certain to 
meddle in our affairs and invade an area that comes under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like our colleague to demonstrate how three departments 
overlap to be sure, in a roundabout way, to interfere in our 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue is this: there is a 
river bed along the St. Lawrence and a seabed in the gulf. 
Shellfish and plant life can be found there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions will be asked: to whom do the shellfish and the plant 
life belong? Does Fisheries and Oceans have jurisdiction? Is 
this a heritage issue? Should the environment minister determine 
whether the river bed and seabed where the plant life and the 
shellfish are to be found is contaminated or in good condition? 
All this is done on Quebec's territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it is as if I were at home, on my property, and 
someone came to tell me how things must be done. Is my lawn in 
good condition? Are the ants developing well? Am I taking good 
care of the environment? 
All this, without asking my permission, without talking with me, 
without trying to reach an agreement, without trying to have a 
dialogue, without trying to agree on terms and conditions, 
without taking my own concerns into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here an invasion of territory through legislation. 
There is no physical invasion, just legislative invasion. This 
is not the first occurrence. Let us look at the millennium 
scholarships, an extraordinary example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, in Quebec, there has been a sound policy on 
scholarships for the last 35 years. This is why Quebec students 
have the smallest debt load in Canada, about $11,000 per person; 
for the rest of Canada, it is $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec made some good societal choices about thirty years before 
Canada did. 
Now, Canada takes a part of our money, about $600 to $700 
million from Quebec, and puts it in the millennium scholarship 
fund to provide us with something we already had but that the 
rest of Canada did not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often face this situation: the federal government invades our 
jurisdictions, duplicates the efforts, walks all over us without 
any concern for what it is destroying. With an attitude such as 
this, I am increasingly proud to be a sovereignist and 
increasingly anxious for our people to say yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
my colleague for the quality of his research on this subject. I 
like to hear about the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, Parks Canada and the federal government did not have 
one single document about the Saguenay fjord. When I was elected 
as a young member in 1984, one of my main priorities was to do 
everything I could to have the fjord included in the Canadian 
national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was re-elected, I was happy to be able to co-operate with 
the minister on this issue. That co-operation led to the creation 
of a new national marine park by the federal government. It took 
14 years. Millions of dollars were invested in research. It must 
be said though that environmental issues were an important part 
of the government's agenda at that time, which led to the treaty 
on acid rain, the St. Lawrence River action plan and the green 
plan. 
All that to illustrate the fact that it was an ongoing concern 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell my colleague that the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park is an extraordinary accomplishment. Not only will it 
contribute to the preservation of our marine resources, but it 
will also help bring our region to the fore nationally and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little bit surprised that my colleague would want to 
focus on frictions between the two levels of government, because 
the establishment of the park, which required the co-operation of 
several departments at the provincial and federal levels, was a 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there any documents or statements by the Quebec government 
or the federal government that show disagreements in the 
negotiations related to this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be made aware of these disagreements, because 
the establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park was a 
complete success. For the next hundred years, it will allow us 
to preserve our resources and also to be known in the rest of 
the country. Knowing that Parks Canada advertises all over the 
world, one can see why this is important for our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would really like to know the source of these frictions 
between both levels of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
hon. colleague for this excellent question. He has given an 
example of exactly the right kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is a project that is 
working out just fine. It has been designed and developed thanks 
to the co-operation of the Canadian and Quebec governments. Both 
levels of government have passed mirror legislation to create 
that park. It has been a real success. That is a good approach, 
but the Canadian government does not seem inclined to use it 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it had been a disaster, I think the government would use that 
approach again, but since it was a resounding success, it does 
not want to. 
It does not want to copy what has been done in the past. It is 
designing a new system to which the Quebec government is not a 
party, in which it is not involved as an actor or a negotiating 
party. Quite differently, the feds are just intruding, and that 
is what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When something is working just fine and we have a good approach, 
when we find the right move and the right procedure, with 
respect for the jurisdictions of both levels of government, 
co-operation and harmony, why not use the same approach? We have 
a good model. My colleague told us he is proud of that 
achievement. All of us are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a good model, but they will not follow it anymore. They 
refuse. 
They are designing a new one, in which they will be trampling on 
Quebec jurisdictions and, through three departments, impose 
legislation on the marine floor in Quebec without asking for any 
permission, without negotiating any agreement, without asking 
any question. They make themselves at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Canadian government is not at home in an area of 
exclusive Quebec jurisdiction recognized by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we are going to oppose most vigorously this federal 
encroachment in an area that, constitutionally, is under 
Quebec's jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to have the opportunity this afternoon to address the 
House with respect to Bill C-48, an act respecting marine 
conservation areas. The proposed piece of legislation is designed 
to protect and conserve the areas of Canada's marine landscape 
for the benefit, education and enjoyment of all Canadians and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency of Fundy—Royal straddles the beautiful and 
scenic Bay of Fundy.  The Bay of Fundy has the largest tides in 
the world.  Many beautiful beaches have evolved throughout the 
Bay of Fundy region following centuries of constant pounding 
delivered by these often unforgiving tides. Tourists from around 
the globe have been attracted to the Fundy region to witness the 
record tides while also revelling in the opportunity to enjoy 
down-home maritime hospitality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This region has also been the focus of many environmentalists 
who are drawn to the area to study our unique marine ecosystem 
and the Fundy escarpment.  Like many of our local residents, 
these individuals are deeply concerned with the often callous 
indifference for our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bay of Fundy has been the lifeblood for many of my 
constituents, just as it has been for my neighbours across the 
bay who are effectively represented by our party's Canadian 
heritage critic, my colleague from West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bay of Fundy is home to many different species of marine 
life.  For instance, the right whale, of which very few breeding 
pairs exist in the world, call the Bay of Fundy home every 
August.  For years Fundy fishing grounds supported the very 
prosperous inshore scallop fishery.  Groundfish used to be found 
in abundance, helping create a very lucrative fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today many of the species fishermen depend upon for their 
livelihoods are disappearing due to overfishing.  Only the 
lucrative lobster fishery remains.  This is also threatened. From 
that perspective I am very concerned for the individuals from St. 
Martins in my riding who earn their livings by fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-48.  We feel it is time politicians started to 
take a leading role in helping to preserve our environment so our 
next generation will enjoy the scenery and the beauty that exists 
throughout the country.  This is another reason why I look 
forward to the introduction of the Canadian endangered species 
protection act in February. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of individuals when they talk about protecting endangered 
species do so in order that we can protect those for future 
generations. Some people believe that piece of legislation is 
rather complex. It comes down to a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when it comes to endangered species we do not kill them. 
We do not destroy their home and we give them a habitat in which 
to live.  We also look after those concerned Canadians who are 
land owners so that we can provide them with economic instruments 
with respect to stewardship.  Obviously when that piece of 
legislation comes in I will have more to say at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only achieve the goals by taking immediate action through 
protective measures as outlined in this bill.  Education must 
play an integral role in helping raise Canadians' awareness of 
our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been born and raised along the Fundy shore I can 
certainly appreciate the importance of our natural environment 
and the importance this environment plays in our everyday lives. 
Many of my constituents depend on the ocean for their 
livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our aboriginal peoples fished these great waters long before the 
arrival of any European settlers.  Fish were an important staple 
in their everyday diets.  They recognized the importance of this 
natural resource for their survival.  Even today their leaders 
respect and appreciate the value of maintaining a viable fishing 
industry.  Aboriginal peoples recognize that conservation 
measures must be of paramount concern whenever discussions 
surround the allocation of fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deriving one's living from the oceans is a cultural way of life 
for many individuals on all the coasts of this great country.  We 
depend on the preservation of this large habitat for our survival 
and for the survival of our next generation. It is incumbent on 
all to begin taking immediate steps toward protecting our 
ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this note I am also very proud of the leadership which was 
displayed recently in my riding near the town of St. Martins in 
the development of the Fundy trail parkway.  In this park we have 
an opportunity to view the Bay of Fundy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the leadership of the hon. Gerald Merrithew, a minister 
for the province of New Brunswick at that time, I must compliment 
provincial colleague Stuart Jamieson and some other stewards such 
as Mitchell Franklin who actually had the foresight to develop 
this park to view the beautiful Bay of Fundy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently our coastal regions have been facing another menacing 
attack.  This time it comes from illegal lobster fishers who have 
been pillaging the ocean floors almost unabated by officials of 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The lucrative lobster 
fishery can be in danger if strong measures are not immediately 
taken to put an end to this illegal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has long been concerned with 
preserving our ecosystem.  In 1986 the PC government approved the 
national marine park policy.  In 1987 the country's first 
national marine conservation area known as Fathom Five in 
Georgian Bay was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the government signed a federal-provincial agreement 
with British Columbia to create a national marine conservation 
area in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 6, 1990 the Progressive Conservative government signed 
a historical and unique agreement between Canada and Quebec to 
create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay estuary in 
the St. Lawrence River. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to have had the opportunity last summer to visit this 
park in the Saguenay fjord. I must say that this is an 
incredible region and a great park. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the government and provincial governments 
collaborated to build such a wonderful park along the Saguenay 
area, Lac-Saint-Jean toward Tadoussac and into the St. Lawrence 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have outlined the ecosystem leadership the government at the 
time had.  I think that is an indication of the vision the 
Progressive Conservative government had during its era between 
1984 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out some of the initiatives that were brought forth 
which dovetail in terms of our commitment to ecosystem 
development and protection and respect for the environment. 
Under our government in 1988 the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act was brought forth by the minister of the day, the 
Hon. Tom McMillan and the Hon. Jean Charest. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time it was prime ministerial leadership under Brian 
Mulroney that developed the Clean Air Act which took on the 
Americans and brought forth a national accord that addressed acid 
rain. The same prime minister cared enough about the environment 
and showed leadership at the Rio earth summit with respect to 
biodiversity and climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment of the Progressive Conservative Party with 
respect to our national parks and our conservation areas and the 
environment is unprecedented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although the proposed legislation 
is designed to establish and manage a system of marine 
conservation areas respective of the 29 marine areas, it does not 
specifically identify a precise geographic location to be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sites will have to be chosen through much consultation 
with members of the general public, provincial governments and 
obviously those individuals who earn their livelihoods from our 
distinct waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned our aboriginal peoples' dependence on these waters 
for their food fishery.  It is important that aboriginal peoples 
be involved in the negotiations.  With many land claims still to 
be resolved, it is imperative they be consulted on creating any 
new marine reserve areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are restrictions on non-renewable resource extraction.  I 
believe careful examination of any proposed site must be explored 
as to its potential for oil and gas exploration in a very 
sustainable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia is finally going to reap the economic benefits of 
Sable gas.  This economic boom would not have been possible if 
the Sable area had been designated a marine protected area.  That 
is why we must exhaust all opportunities for constructive 
consultation sessions with all those who have a vested interest 
in our ocean floors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must immediately begin the process of identifying appropriate 
locations for inclusion within marine conservation areas.  This 
bill will help provide the framework for creating these much 
needed conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very excited about trying to identify at least 10 marine 
parks by 2000.  I applaud the government for actually setting a 
goal because I fundamentally believe what gets measured actually 
gets done.  Let us make sure we take our time to do it in a very 
prudent, consultative fashion and that we locate those ecosystems 
that should be preserved the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue on behalf of 
our critic for heritage, the member for West Nova, and to 
participate in this afternoon's debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his comments. I also want to make it clear 
that the Bloc Quebecois is absolutely in favour of protecting 
the environment and taking the necessary measures to ensure that 
we live in an increasingly cleaner environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois is totally opposed to Bill C-48, 
because it is yet another federal interference in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to create marine areas, regardless of 
which department does it and regardless of the names given to 
these areas—because we now know that three departments are 
interested in creating such areas—it must first appropriate the 
ocean floor. 
But the ocean floor comes under the sovereign right of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is once again showing its bad faith. 
There can be no better proof. The hon. member said he visited 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence park last summer. It is a beautiful 
park co-managed by Canada and Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague, the member for Portneuf, pointed out, the 
Government of Canada has once again interfered in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction in attempting to create marine 
conservation areas on our territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether my colleague is aware of this 
problem of the federal government again charging into an area of 
provincial jurisdiction, and whether he does not share our 
impression that once again the Liberal government of the Prime 
Minister, the member for Shawinigan, is doing everything it can 
to pit the provinces against the federal government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the premise of my 
colleague's question surrounds issues not as related to this 
piece of legislation as to other ones.  I agree with her concerns 
that the government on too many occasions has interfered in 
situations that have provoked provinces into some very difficult 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my critic's position I noticed it in terms of when the 
federal government chose to turn its back on the agreement 
established November 13, 1997.  At that time it made an agreement 
with respect to climate change.  The very next day the Minister 
of the Environment and the Minister of Natural Resources said 
that is not necessarily our position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a provocative move what the government chose to do with 
respect to the supreme court.  This country was actually formed 
from an act of will.  We did not go to any lawyers, judges or 
courts to determine whether we should have a country or not in 
the first place.  It was an act of will on the part of the 
political leadership of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the millennium scholarship fund it is clear interference 
with respect to provincial jurisdiction. It would be more prudent 
for them to actually inject the moneys into the CHST which would 
pay for health care, post-secondary education and social 
services.  Those are the things where we should be working in 
partnership with the provinces as opposed to taking provocative 
steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this legislation there are very valuable ways we 
can have some very positive provincial-federal relations.  We see 
that with respect to the park I had the pleasure of visiting this 
summer along the Saguenay River.  It is one of the most 
picturesque areas of the world.  There are very few fiords where 
people actually have access. We see it in Norway and we see it in 
one of God's most beautiful areas in this country along the 
Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government on occasion has interfered in areas where 
it should not have.  I do not think this is necessarily 
applicable with respect to this piece of legislation because it 
is very possible to build some very positive partnerships with 
the provinces in protecting our marine areas with respect to 
having better conservation for everybody. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I also live in a riding which has an extensive marine ecosystem. 
I probably have ten times more coastline than highways in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have five Gulf Islands among numerous other islands. Those 
islands are all frequented by daily ferry service.  I live in a 
very sensitive marine environment with all kinds of marine life 
from pods of orcas to grey whales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party also support protecting ecosystems.  We 
want to make that very clear.  We are very concerned about 
ecosystems and it is important that we protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has all kinds of problems with it.  I will 
focus and demonstrate to this House how this legislation is very 
typical of the type of legislation we see in this House.  We have 
a hollow piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600
<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing in it.  I will demonstrate that to 
the House with numerous specific examples which will make it very 
clear to see.  We have a piece of legislation brought forward by 
the government suggesting that it actually wants to protect an 
ecosystem, but in effect it is hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore it does not bring in other groups such as the 
provinces.  It does not bring in the resource base to ensure that 
there is active participation in the management of parks and to 
ensure that the resources can be removed safely so that we do not 
trample on the rights of the people who are already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite do not agree with what I am saying.  Let me 
give an example.  Schedules I and II of the legislation describe 
the lands that are to be set aside.  We have a bill that is for 
marine parks, the Marine Conservation Act.  I ask members to get 
out their legislation.  Schedules I and II describe the areas 
that we are thinking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we look up schedules I and II we cannot find them. 
They are not there.  This is just a hollow piece of legislation 
that provides broad powers to the minister.  The government will 
decide this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize the problem I have with the legislation.  I am a 
strong advocate of conserving our marine life.  I would fully 
support legislation specifying pockets that should be set aside 
for marine parks.  I would even go further to say that the small 
pockets should be class <I>a</I> marine parks that we cannot even 
touch.  That is not what we have.  We have no idea what we are 
getting ourselves into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched the example set by the government.  The current 
minister of fisheries talks over and over again about his three 
priorities:  conservation, conservation, conservation.  However 
what happens when the actual practices come down?  For example 
there is the Makaw whale hunt that is happening outside my 
riding.  The minister supports the Makaw whale hunt.  He is 
supporting the slaughter of whales in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to question whether the government is serious when it 
asserts that it wants to protect our ecosystems.  It can be done 
but this is not the legislation to do it.  It is hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experiences in the House have shown that we do not have 
openness and transparency.  The government would like to bring in 
legislation where all these decisions would be made by orders in 
council or after the fact.  We have no idea.  Will there be a 
consultation process if there is an abundance of shellfish in a 
marine park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the only way I found out about the legislation and 
what the government was intending to do was through government 
press releases.  My riding is one of the ridings that would be 
most affected by the legislation.  I have had private meetings 
with the people in the bureaucracy and have asked them about it. 
It is only after I pursue and dig into it that I find out what is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not come forward and inform all members of 
the House, as we have seen over and over and over again with the 
bills that are brought forward.  It operates in a vacuum, this 
little tight-knit group, this handful of people who surround the 
Prime Minister.  What we have is a dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  The legislation does not even identify which 
areas will be designated as marine parks.  We have no idea what 
is happening.  I know the minister has announced a couple of 
small areas, his wishes for marine parks, but the reality is that 
the legislation leaves it wide open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are broad, sweeping powers for the minister.  We have no 
idea whether the provinces will have any participation in the 
marine parks.  We have no idea whether the resource based 
industries in British Columbia, the fishing sector or the 
forestry sector, will have any input regarding how they will be 
affected.  Both the forestry and fishing sectors are in a very 
difficult situation in British Columbia.  I could safely say in 
the House, after speaking with those representatives, that they 
are also very strong supporters of maintaining our ecosystems. 
Bringing in legislation that will not consult with them to ensure 
that all these people can be brought on board to make sure it is 
done in a very economical and positive way is not the way to go.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It enlarges the minister's jurisdiction.  There are all kinds of 
examples of this in clauses 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 which enlarge the 
minister's jurisdiction.  They effectively empower the minister 
to designate whatever areas he or she feels fit, depending on the 
time.  Right now it comes under the minister of heritage.  She 
would have the power to do as she sees fit.  It has raised 
concerns among the residents of British Columbia.  Many of them 
are strong supporters of our ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They raise flags with me in discussions.  They are somewhat 
amazed when the government comes out with this kind of 
legislation in flashy press releases with no substance. Then, 
only hours later, they find out that the minister of fisheries, 
Mr. Conservation, is about to allow the slaughter of whales on 
our beaches.  Whales will be floating up on the beaches of 
Victoria in his riding.  This has caused them great distress.  He 
has taken absolutely no initiative to stop it. I have approached 
him and the Minister of Foreign Affairs with no success, asking 
them to lobby against the the unnecessary slaughter of the Makaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more disturbing is the Canadian government's giving the 
Makaw tribe permission to slaughter these whales in Canadian 
waters.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  Then the government 
tells us that it is bringing in marine parks to preserve our 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Conservative member from Nova Scotia.  I agree 
with him it is very important that we protect our ecosystems and 
our marine parks.  However the legislation is not the vehicle 
that will do that.  We have a hollow, empty piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question why it is there.  I question what the government is 
doing.  It imposes upon the provincial governments, as was 
pointed out by my hon. colleague in the Bloc, without their 
active participation.  If we are to succeed in doing something 
meaningful and in providing something that would preserve some of 
the ecosystems, the provinces should be brought on board as 
effective partners and not just have a dictatorship against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks.  This is but another example in the 
House of the Liberal government bringing in legislation which is 
absolutely hollow.  It does not give us specifics.  I repeat that 
it is not worth the paper it is written on.  It does nothing to 
give us any specifics on preserving ecosystems, a process which I 
support.  The government should look at the record of what it is 
doing and get the Canadian public to agree before it starts 
bringing in these types of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the minister of fisheries would like to designate 
some areas in Victoria, but he creates his own problems when he 
allows the slaughter of whales in Canadian waters.  He should be 
ashamed of himself for supporting that initiative and suggesting 
that he also wants to come out with legislation for marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis I will be voting against the legislation because 
it is a scam against Canadians to suggest that the government is 
in any way concerned about our marine environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to comment a 
bit and then ask the member a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the member to section 8.(4) of the act which talks about 
agreements with provincial authorities.  There is no forcing of 
anybody to do anything.  We are talking about agreements with 
provincial authorities and other agencies, as has been the case 
in the establishment of parks throughout our history.  Let us not 
get carried away by inventing motives that do not exist.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member started his speech by parrying for more consultation. 
There are ample elements built into the proposed legislation to 
guarantee consultation in designating 28 of the 29 conservation 
areas the legislation intends to establish.  He rightfully 
requests more consultation.  Then he said that he would vote 
against the legislation because it is hollow.  To determine that, 
he referred to the annexes where the conservation areas are not 
listed.  Of course not, because they have not been selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a mapping out of the 29 areas in Canada 
representing the 29 ecological zones we wish to protect with the 
marine conservation area legislation.  The locations within these 
areas have not been selected and that is the subject of 
consultation.  Which is it?  Should we decide there should be no 
consultation and make these decisions unilaterally?  Of course 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has indicated its intention once the legislation 
is approved to establish 10 such areas, hopefully by the 
millennium year, in consultation with the relevant authorities 
and not unilaterally as the member would rightfully object to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot possibly list them in the annexes.  The member cannot 
have it both ways.  Which is it?  Does he want consultation or 
does he want us to go ahead and pick unilaterally?  I do not 
think so.  That is the question the member has to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to go back to the 
government's record.  The legislation contains numerous Henry 
VIII clauses.  We all know that a Henry VIII clause will allow a 
minister to designate new areas under the act without having to 
steer the amendment through parliament.  That is an absolute 
given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only go on the performance of the government over the last 
year and on what it has done in the House.  I do not have 
confidence in the government at all.  We have seen that dwindling 
among Canadians over the past month.  The Liberals are going down 
and down and down and they know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say the legislation is hollow.  How can we 
possibly sit here and believe when the minister of fisheries is 
allowing the slaughter of whales by Americans in Canadian waters? 
Those whales could potentially wash up on the beaches of 
Victoria.  How can we expect the government to mean that it will 
consult with industry, the provinces and the different sectors? 
The government's record is dismal in this area.  We have had a 
dictatorship.  We have seen it over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give them all kinds of examples.  We could look at the EI 
fund.  Every member on this side of the House has demanded 
consultation, and all we hear is the Liberals saying no.  There 
are a hundred examples.  The record speaks for itself.  Their 
performance has been absolutely dismal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are sighing over there because they have nothing better to 
say.  They know it.  It is a fact.  The legislation is very 
clear. It gives broad sweeping powers to the minister.  We would 
like to know exactly what we are passing in the House before we 
vote on it.  We will not vote on a hollow piece of legislation 
which will give the minister the ultimate say on where the parks 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget there are all kinds of resources attached to 
these parks.  There is the fishery which the government has 
destroyed.  The Liberals can talk to their own member from 
Gander—Grand Falls in Newfoundland.  He has been very open in 
the House and is a big defender of the fishery.  He will talk 
about how the government has destroyed the resource over the last 
10 years.  It has been an absolute dismal failure.  The auditor 
general has confirmed this in numerous reports.  Now the Liberals 
are coming out and are to be the great saviours of the ecosystems 
and the environment.  It does not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to support something that would truly protect the 
environment and the ecosystems and would include these people in 
the process.  This legislation clearly does not do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my Reform Party colleague and congratulate him on seeing, as I 
do, the tragic aspect of this bill, with its sham consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Briefing sessions were held.  We were 
told that the federal government had consulted Canadians; we 
read in the Minister of Canadian Heritage's notes that 3,000 
organizations had received questionnaires and mailed back little 
scraps of paper, which were put together into a magnificent 
document that was presented to us in a folder.  A sham 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Members opposite are upset because they 
do not like having their negligence brought to the attention of 
the people of Canada. 
It is high time that the public knew that this government is 
arrogant beyond all belief; it pretends to consult and spouts 
fine rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether my Reform Party colleague also 
thinks that, in addition to conducting a sham consultation, this 
government has gone too far with its interference in provincial 
jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. 
I think it has been made quite clear by the members of this House 
that in fact the consultation process—and again I will use the 
word—is hollow.  The government can send out questionnaires, but 
there is nothing in the legislation except empty schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks whether it will trample the rights which the 
provinces have under section 92 of the Constitution.  She makes a 
valid point.  I think it is open for debate.  I believe that the 
bill gives the government broad powers over our inland waters in 
creating parks.  That, without question, I would agree is 
provincial jurisdiction.  The only area that we may question is 
the waters which are shared by two provinces.  That could be open 
to interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The waters of the Lac-Saint-Jean and Saguenay areas which I 
visited this summer are very beautiful.  I think it is up to the 
province of Quebec to impose provincial legislation to protect 
and to choose the waters in their provincial parks.  Similarly, 
with respect to the inland waters of British Columbia, it is up 
to the province of British Columbia to implement legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing we need is different levels of government and 
bureaucracies all trying to do the same thing, which we have seen 
over and over again in this country.  It is a waste of taxpayers' 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would agree with her comments, with the exception of 
waters which are shared between provinces.  That would be open to 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, regardless of the jurisdiction, this is a hollow piece 
of legislation.  Looking at the government's record, we have to 
question whether it is really sincere about actually protecting 
the ecosystem, considering its past performance and the fact that 
it is allowing Americans to slaughter whales in Canadian waters 
which are potentially going to wash up bloodied on the shores of 
Victoria in the riding of the minister of fisheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak to Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation areas, 
and the amendment moved by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into my presentation, I wish to inform you that I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. member for 
Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to provide a legal framework for the 
establishment and future development of 28 marine conservation 
areas, including eight in Quebec, representing each of the 
ecosystems identified to date in Quebec and Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but this park is not included in this bill 
because it is covered by ad hoc legislation both in Canada and 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports measures to protect the environment. 
I want to remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois did not 
hesitate to support the government when it suggested passing 
mirror legislation to create the Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine 
park and to establish a legal framework to ensure it would be 
jointly managed by the two levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec government is 
launching initiatives aimed at protecting the environment, 
particularly the marine floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is also open to working in co-operation or 
in partnership with the federal government on any project 
designed to ensure or promote the protection of the environment, 
as evidenced by the agreement signed by the two governments on 
the third phase of the St. Lawrence action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against Bill C-48 for 
a number of reasons. First, instead of relying on dialogue, as 
in the case of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park, the 
federal government wants to create marine conservation areas 
irrespective of Quebec's jurisdiction with regard to the 
protection of its territory and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Department of Canadian Heritage is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
that will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
offshore areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, which proclaims from the rooftops that 
it has met all of Quebec's demands, and states in its Speech 
from the Throne that it is putting an end to overlap and to 
interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction, has now found 
a way to divide itself into three components and to actually 
overlap itself, so as to be absolutely certain to meddle, in one 
way or another, in areas that come under the jurisdiction of 
Quebec and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established. 
Bill C-48 does not, therefore, respect the territorial integrity 
of Quebec and the other provinces. What is more, Bill C-48 
creates overlap within the federal administration itself. What a 
setup! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of Canadian Heritage, the federal 
government intends to create marine conservation areas. Through 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, it has already created 
marine protected areas. Through the Department of the 
Environment, it wants to create marine wildlife reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be carefully noted that a single site could find 
itself protected under more than one category. The Department of 
Canadian Heritage sets out its reasons for creating marine 
conservation areas in the preamble to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Canada is establishing marine conservation areas to 
protect natural, self-regulating marine ecosystems for the 
maintenance of biological diversity; to establish a 
representative system of marine conservation areas; to ensure 
that Canada contributes to international efforts for the 
establishment of a world-wide network of representative marine 
areas; to provide opportunities for the people of Canada and of 
the world to appreciate Canada's natural and cultural marine 
heritage; and to provide opportunities within marine 
conservation areas for the ecologically sustainable use of 
marine resources for the lasting benefit of coastal communities. 
As for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, it proposes the 
establishment of marine protected areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A discussion paper released by Fisheries and Oceans in  January 
1997, entitled “The Establishment and Management of Marine 
Protected Areas under the Oceans Act” indicates that the areas 
are created to protect fishery resources, commercial and others, 
including marine mammals and their habitats, endangered or 
threatened marine species and their habitats, unique habitats, 
marine areas of high biodiversity or biological productivity and 
any other marine resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the result of discussions held in Quebec in June 1998 by 
Fisheries and Oceans on marine protection areas, the report 
prepared by public officials states, and I quote: “There remains 
a lot of confusion among stakeholders about the various federal 
programs on marine protected areas,”—these are not our words, but 
the words of government officials—“marine protection zones, 
national marine conservation areas, marine fauna reserves, and 
so forth.  The departments involved should get together and 
collaborate in establishing marine protected areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Environment Canada is proposing to establish marine 
conservation zones, that could also be called natural marine 
reserves, expanding the notion of the national wildlife 
sanctuary beyond the territorial sea to the 200 mile limit 
within the exclusive economic zone under the Canada Oceans Act. 
These zones are also subject to the Canadian Wildlife Act, but 
require a different set of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, let us summarize, because the triple federal overlap 
at the federal level—setting aside its overlap with provincial 
jurisdictions—becomes almost a federal maze where people can get 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, under the various laws, the Government of Canada is 
proposing to create marine conservation areas, marine protection 
zones and natural marine reserves. 
According to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the same 
territory could find itself with several different zonings under 
different regulations that could confuse the user. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, an initiative such as the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park 
could have been a model to follow. In 1997, the governments of 
Quebec and Canada agreed to pass legislation to create the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. This resulted in the creation 
of Canada's first marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation established the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park, the first marine park to be created jointly by the federal 
and Quebec governments, without any transfer of territory. Both 
governments will continue to fulfil their respective 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should have used this first partnership 
initiative as a model for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas. 
Instead of using a policy of openness and co-operation, the 
federal government has used arrogance, aggression, invasion and 
overlap, everything we need to make us want to leave at the next 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois will have to 
vote against the amendment moved by the Reform Party, because it 
did not identify some points that we consider really important. 
Our interpretation of the bill leads us to believe that the 
reasons it gives are unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill invades the jurisdictions of Quebec and the other 
provinces involved, and Quebec cannot and will not operate 
within this system. 
We showed the Canadian government great openness when it came to 
managing the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, and we regret 
that the government has not learned its lesson.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise this afternoon to make a very specific point and 
I appreciate the opportunity to ask this question of the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the points that the government has been 
making across the way.  Hon. members are always using the word 
“consultation”.  It is a word that we hear all the time in the 
House.  “Just pass this legislation and we will consult with all 
of the provinces and the stakeholders” in whatever issue they 
are putting forward in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that this bill will do will be to enlarge the 
minister's jurisdiction.  That should be of concern to all 
Canadians.  Power is being taken away from the people of Canada, 
through their elected representatives, and it is being given it 
to a bureaucracy which will tell the minister what needs to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make my point I refer hon. members to something that I said 
previously.  I asked some lawyers in the House of Commons to do 
some research for me with regard to a number of bills that were 
coming before the House.  I asked them this simple question: 
“Which one of the current bills before the House of Commons 
takes power away from parliament and gives it to the 
bureaucracy?”  I received a very shocking answer.  They did 
research on six separate bills and every one of those bills took 
power away from parliament and gave it to the bureaucracy.  In 
other words, the people of Canada are losing control of the 
agenda.  That control is being concentrated in the hands of a 
very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at this bill we see the same thing happening.  We are 
losing control through this bill which seems to be so nice and so 
wonderful and so compassionate in expressing concern for the 
environment.  It actually does not do anything like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members go about using the word 
“consultation”, we have found by experience that they do not 
really and truly consult.  They may have a dog and pony show and 
go around the country making it appear as if they are, but they 
do not really listen.  What they call consultation is putting on 
a show, but not really putting into place what the people of 
Canada genuinely want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives the people behind the scenes more control over 
the agenda.  I am wondering if the member does not have a concern 
about this.  I realize she is not supporting Reform's amendment, 
but we are very concerned about what is going on. Giving 
bureaucracy more power and taking it away from the people of 
Canada is what is going on.  Once this bill is passed, no matter 
what the government says about its consultations and its process, 
it is gone forever.  The next thing government members say will 
be “Parliament passed this bill.  We have the power to do this. 
What are you complaining about?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on what I have just said. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
Reform member for his very relevant question which we take 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are concerned, because we fear that these consultations 
will be a sham. Under clause 9, the minister can  consult 
whoever she wants whenever she wants. She transfers these duties 
to her staff without consulting, informing or bothering to get 
input from the public in general or even its elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are democratically elected to this House to represent our 
constituents and we have to inform them. As legislators, we 
should also be able to represent them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are shown this bill and then told: “The minister will carry 
out some consultations.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned about this type of consultation, because, 
as we know, by and large these consultations always turn out in 
favour of the government or of the minister introducing the 
bill. This is why we think these consultations are a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is truly a tragic situation, because the government is 
trying to hoodwink us and would have us believe that the people 
have been consulted, when it is not so. It is also tragic 
because, once again, it is trying to impinge upon provincial 
areas of jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak on Bill C-48 at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal bill entitled an Act respecting marine conservation 
areas is aimed at establishing 28 marine conservation areas 
representative of various ecosystems in Canada. As we all know 
the Sagenuay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but this park is not included in this bill 
because it is covered by its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures aimed 
at protecting the environment. I should know since I was in 
charge of this issue for over a year. Also, as I recall the Bloc 
Quebecois supported the establishment of the Sagenuay—St. Lawrence 
marine park. 
I remember it well. I believe this must be very clear; there is 
a difference between the bill and the marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to Bill C-48 respecting the establishment of 
marine conservation areas because, instead of relying on 
dialogue, as in the case of the marine park, the federal 
government wants to impose marine conservation areas, regardless 
of the fact that Quebec has jurisdiction over the protection of 
its own territory and of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover Canadian Heritage is proposing to put in place new 
structures, marine conservation areas, that will duplicate 
the marine protected areas of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected offshore areas. 
Simply put, the federal government is using three departments to 
infringe upon areas under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec 
government is launching initiatives aimed at protecting the 
environment, particularly the marine floor. The Quebec 
government is also open to working in co-operation or in 
partnership with the federal government on this, as it has done 
for phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then is the federal government behaving once again as if 
Quebec did not exist with regard to this issue, proposing a 
national project that does not take into account Quebeckers' 
wishes concerning environmental protection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking this question while knowing this approach by the 
federal government is increasingly commonplace. Since the Prime 
Minister became convinced he met Quebec's traditional demands, 
his government has been introducing one centralizing bill after 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, in fact, several objections. In 1997, the governments 
of Quebec and Canada agreed on an act to create the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park. The two pieces of legislation  resulted in 
the creation of Canada's first marine conservation area.  Allow 
me to explain the main features of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the first marine park 
to be created jointly by the federal and Quebec governments, 
without any transfer of territory. The two governments will 
continue to fulfil their respective responsibilities.  The park 
includes only marine areas and covers 1,138 square kilometres.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to promote local involvement, the acts passed by the 
Quebec and federal governments confirm the creation of a 
co-ordinating committee, whose membership is to be determined by 
the federal and provincial ministers. The committee's mandate is 
to recommend to the ministers responsible measures to achieve 
the master plan's objectives. The plan is to be reviewed jointly 
by the two governments, at least once every seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By means of regulations under their respective legislation, the 
governments of Quebec and of Canada will be able to determine 
measures for protecting the park's ecosystems and resources and 
for protecting the public. 
More specifically, they will be able to define how each category 
of area will be used and for how long such use shall apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first partnership initiative should have served as a model 
to the federal government for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas.  There is also one other example to follow, 
Phase III of the St. Lawrence Action Plan, of which I shall now 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1998, the environment ministers of Quebec and of 
Canada announced phase III of the St. Lawrence development plan, 
representing a total bill of $230 million to be shared equally 
by both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of this action plan is to increase the 
area of protected habitats by 100% from 12,000 hectares to 
120,000 hectares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this phase III follows the two previous ones in which 
both governments invested over $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something which should concern everyone in Quebec. It 
is the fact that Bill C-48 fails to respect the integrity of the 
territory of Quebec. If I may, I would like to mention six 
factors which show that Bill C-48 fails to respect the integrity 
of the territory of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of the conditions essential to the establishment of a 
marine conservation area is federal ownership of the land where 
the conservation area will be established. 
Clause 5(2) of the bill provides that the minister can establish 
a marine conservation area: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—only if he is satisfied that clear title to the lands to be 
included in the marine conservation area is vested in Her 
Majesty in Right of Canada, excluding any such lands situated 
within the exclusive economic zone of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, recognizes that 
the management and sale of crown land are matters of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Quebec legislation on crown lands, passed by the Quebec 
National Assembly, applies to all crown lands in Quebec, 
including beds of waterways and lakes and the bed of the St. 
Lawrence river, estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by 
sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this legislation provides that Quebec cannot 
transfer its lands to the federal government. The only thing it 
can do within this legislation is to authorize, by order, the 
federal government to use them only in connection with matters 
under federal jurisdiction. However, the protection of habitats 
and fauna is a matter of joint federal and provincial 
jurisdiction, and the Government of Quebec plans to establish a 
framework for the protection of marine areas in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided to us by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage with regard to Bill C-48, marine conservation 
areas are planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary 
and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. These are three areas in which the 
ocean floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Heritage Canada now arrogantly demanding ownership of the 
ocean floor in order to create marine conservation areas, rather 
than allowing bilateral agreements between Quebec City and 
Ottawa that would let Quebec maintain its jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that this is the new approach to federal-provincial 
relations.  This is what they did with the millennium 
scholarships.  It is what they want to do with new health 
programs and the new young offenders legislation. It is what 
they are doing with the personal information protection bill. 
And they are doing it today with this marine conservation areas 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has decided to put Quebec in its place 
and that is why it is ignoring the promising experience of the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at this 
point I would rather make a comment than ask a question of my 
colleague, the member for Rosemont, whom I thank sincerely, 
especially for helping out the Reform Party colleague who is 
wondering why the Bloc Quebecois does not support his party's 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you no doubt know much better than I, Mr. Speaker, with your 
broad experience and generally recognized expertise, there are 
different procedural tactics for delaying the passage of a bill 
at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a motion may be moved that it be postponed for six 
months.  Second, a motion may be moved that it not be read the 
second time but that the objectives of the bill be referred to 
the committee under whose jurisdiction it comes. 
Third, and this is the approach of our Reform Party colleagues, 
a motion may be moved that the bill not be read the second time 
because of the absence of fundamental principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the approach the Reform Party has taken.  It has invoked 
the absence of principles from the bill and, when I spoke last 
week, I was even surprised that the amendment was deemed 
votable.  I was very surprised at this, given that our reading 
of the bill is not at all the same as that of the Reform Party. 
The principles the Reform Party is raising do not seem to us to 
be absent from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we cannot support the principles, which the Reform 
Party claims are not to be found in the bill, is the reason we 
in the Bloc Quebecois will not be able to support the Reform 
Party's amendment to the effect that second reading not take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we could not come up with one single 
amendment for the opposition.  We will still not support the 
amendment, but we will not be supporting the bill either.  As 
all of our colleagues here have pointed out, this bill blocks 
any progress on environmental matters, because before we can get 
to protecting the environment we have to battle over who has 
jurisdiction here and who has jurisdiction there, when it would 
have been so simple to follow the example of the Saguenay-St. 
Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would ask my colleague, who was involved in 
environmental matters, whether he can enlighten me a bit on the 
differences between provincial and federal jurisdiction over the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, a few months ago the federal 
and provincial governments together negotiated a harmonization 
agreement with the Government of Quebec, an agreement Quebec did 
not sign.  Why did it not sign?  Quite simply because the 
federal government refused to recognize that the environment was 
under Quebec's jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as the harmonization agreement and the bills—and I am 
thinking, for example, of Bill C-32, which is currently being 
examined and which changes the entire Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, known as the CEPA—interfere in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, Quebec will reject such bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Quebec is clear, we will not sign a harmonization agreement 
so long as the federal government will not give this recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, APEC Summit.

<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
so important I had to rise today and speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not often find myself in agreement with members of the Bloc 
Quebecois but on this particular bill they are absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What on earth is the federal government doing dictating to the 
provinces what their marine conservation strategy should be? 
These are provincial jurisdictions.  They always have been. I do 
not understand where the federal government gets off thinking it 
is going to somehow make our national unity problem easier to 
resolve when it keeps forever intruding into provincial 
jurisdictions on a more and more draconian basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from northern British Columbia.  I have lived all my life 
there.  I think I represent the point of view of most of the 
constituents I represent who live in northwest British Columbia. 
I am a skier, a boater and a recreational fisherman.  I do a lot 
of hiking in the back country.  I am a hunter.  I spend a great 
deal of my recreational time in the great outdoors.  I for one am 
very concerned and very interested in seeing that it is there for 
my children and their children, but in Canada we have gone 
completely overboard in pursuit of this radical environmentalist 
and preservationist agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party who 
spoke earlier was lauding the accomplishments of the previous 
government in the creation of South Moresby park in the Queen 
Charlotte Islands. That certainly waved a red flag in front of 
me. It is easy for that hon. member to pontificate on what the 
creation of South Moresby park meant because he lives 4,000 miles 
away. He is not the one who has to go out in the middle of the 
night when some poor family is moving out, taking everything they 
own in the back of a pickup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been forced out of work. There are no economic 
opportunities left for them any more. The logging industry was 
shut down on the strength of a bunch of lies and half truths and 
mistruths on the part of the radical environmentalist and 
preservationist agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Queen Charlotte Islands are an archipelago comprised of two 
major islands.  South Moresby is the large island on the south 
part of archipelago.  In the mid-1980s radical environmentalists, 
preservationists and others with a hidden agenda made a concerted 
effort to convince ordinary decent Canadians that something which 
should not be happening was taking place on the Queen Charlotte 
Islands. They tried with the help of the media to persuade 
Canadians that clear cutting was taking place, the Queen 
Charlotte Islands were being decimated, the environment was being 
ruined, wildlife was being driven out and there was going to be 
no future if something was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the Government of Canada under Brian Mulroney and the 
provincial government created South Moresby park.  The effect was 
that it stopped all logging in South Moresby.  People were told 
that there was going to be—

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would greatly appreciate it if you could ask those members 
across the way, who want to talk and shout, to go and do so in 
the lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what my colleague from the Reform Party has 
to say. If they want to shout, they should go there. There is a 
member there, all by himself. We will hear them less and they 
will be less disruptive; or else they should step out in the 
lobby, because our colleague deserves some respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We all need to be 
apprised from time to time of the necessity of courtesy to each 
other.  The hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis is quite correct in 
bringing this to our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, hopefully it will be a 
little quieter in here for the next few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of South Moresby were promised at the inception of 
South Moresby park that there was going to be an alternative 
economy for them.  It would not be logging any more; it would be 
tourism.  This was going to be the way of the future for South 
Moresby and the community of Sandspit.  For several decades it 
had been a logging community employing several hundred people on 
a full time basis who made very good wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>South Moresby is one of the richest, most productive forests 
anywhere in the world.  It was taken out of forest land and 
turned into a park.  Parks Canada runs that little park like a 
fiefdom.  It limits the number of Canadians who can go into that 
park every year.  For these bull hards down here who do not want 
to listen, the number of people who can go into the park is 
limited to under 2,000 every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would have to be somebody special to get into the park, if 
you can afford it.  It is only wealthy lawyers from Toronto and 
New York who can get in there.  As northerners who live there, we 
cannot afford to go into the park because it costs so much.  It 
is cost prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I mentioned earlier 
that we should be tempered in our language.  I remind and ask all 
hon. members to be temperate in their language.  As we all know, 
there are certain words that raise the temper of the debate to a 
point that it does not remain civil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I too have 
heard words that raised my level of anger.  I feel very 
passionate about this issue because it directly affects 
constituents of mine.  People I know, people I feel for and 
people I care for have been displaced as a result of this. The 
same kind of thinking that went into the creation of South 
Moresby park has gone into the creation of this nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We who live in regional parts of Canada, we who live in the 
north depend on access to resources for our livelihoods.  We have 
to have it. People do not go up to northern British Columbia to 
go shopping. They do not go to northern British Columbia to bask 
in the sun.  They go there primarily to work in a resource 
industry or in some other commercial venture that is most likely 
there to support a resource industry or the commercial industries 
that support the resource industry.  Everything feeds on each 
other; it is a domino effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have an economy in northern B.C., if we are 
going to have an economy in regional Canada, we have to have 
reasonable access to resources.  We have to have reasonable 
access to water.  We have to have reasonable access to the land 
base. This bill is specifically designed to prevent this from 
happening.  This bill is cobbled together by a bunch of misguided 
politically correct soft heads on the other side who are 
listening to the environmental agenda and the radical 
preservationists. They are not considering what the impact is 
going to be on ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of South Moresby we are not talking about hundreds 
of thousands of people.  We are not talking about a political 
voice that is going to be loud and vociferous and heard in Ottawa 
on a regular basis.  We are talking about a community of 500 or 
600 people, but that community is dying on the vine. 
That community has been blindsided by government.  How do they 
feel about mother Ottawa forcing on them something they had no 
involvement in?  They are not in agreement with it.  This has 
been forced down their throats.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I am tired of seeing the people of the north who have 
put everything they own, their life, their property, their future 
and their children's future on the line only to have the rug 
pulled out from under them by this kind of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the government was asked to basically 
rubber stamp a decision that was made by the province of British 
Columbia.  The Tatshenshini River is in the northern part of 
British Columbia.  It is on the Yukon border.  There is a 
copper-cobalt deposit in the Tatshenshini which is probably one 
of the top two or three copper-cobalt deposits ever found in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to one of the senior geologists at the Geological 
Survey of Canada who told me that they do not even know the whole 
extent of that deposit.  Conservatively it was estimated that the 
deposit contained, at a minimum, $10 billion worth of 
copper-cobalt ore.  It was estimated that, at a minimum, it could 
provide 1,600 permanent, full time, year-round jobs for 
approximately 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The geologist I talked with said that in his experience, based 
on some of the further testing that was being done and some of 
the samples they were starting to see, this deposit could 
actually be anywhere up to four times as large as they had 
actually proven.  Just consider that for a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to a manufacturing facility that closes down and 
people are put out of work, it is easy to see the sadness, the 
pain and the hurt because these people have been displaced.  We 
can put a name and a face to that.  However, we cannot go around 
and interview the 1,600 people who never got jobs up in the 
Tatshenshini region because of this ridiculous decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government rubber stamped the NDP government's ridiculous 
decision to create a park by having this nominated as a world 
heritage site at the United Nations.  I cannot fathom what was in 
their minds when they agreed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House more examples.  In British Columbia the 
Fisheries Act, which is an act of this parliament, is a very 
powerful piece of legislation.  That act states that there shall 
be no development of any kind on the coast of Canada that would 
involve any net loss of fish habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we carry that to the extreme it means we cannot walk down to 
the beach and kick a stone over because somebody could come along 
and argue that was fish habitat.  If anyone thinks I am being 
ridiculous, let me assure them I am not.  I have had meeting 
after meeting with constituents in Prince Rupert who cannot get 
access to the waterfront because every time somebody comes along 
and proposes to develop the foreshore, to build a dock, a 
berthing facility or a log dump, or proposes any kind of access 
to the waterfront, the first person on the scene is the local DFO 
biologist who shuts it down and says that it poses a danger and a 
threat to fish habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Rupert right now, because of the downturn in the fishery 
and problems in the forest industry, is looking at very serious 
unemployment and economic situations.  Prince Rupert is not 
alone.  The people in the larger communities in the riding that I 
represent are suffering and they are suffering a great deal. 
They are looking for alternatives.  They are looking for ways to 
offset some of the downturns that have taken place. They cannot 
get access to the waterfront to do anything because DFO will shut 
them down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making this up.  I am telling members that DFO will not 
allow a pile to be driven in the water, will not allow a dock to 
be constructed, will not allow somebody to build the most 
rudimentary access of any kind from the foreshore to the water 
because it might interrupt fish habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell members that British Columbia is a province which 
has literally thousands and thousands of miles of waterfront. 
Let me say as well that British Columbia is a province which, 
outside of the lower mainland, does not have much of a population 
base and has not experienced much development.  Really there is 
no threat to the integrity of the environment in British 
Columbia, but that is contrary to what most of the 
preservationists and radical environmentalists would have us 
believe.  That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is one more chink in the armour.  It is one 
more step down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The radical environmental agenda is becoming clearer as time 
goes on.  These people are profoundly anti-human.  These people 
think we are nothing better than pestilence.  Some of these 
people have even voiced that thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki, who is the founder of the Suzuki Foundation, has 
opined that what should take place is a mass die-off of human 
beings in order to preserve the environment.  Can we believe 
that?  I am not making that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that this environmental movement is a very 
well-funded movement, controlled predominately by large estates 
in the United States.  Most of their money does not come from 
Canada.  Most of their money comes from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their agenda is becoming clearer as time goes on.  Some of them 
have publicly said:  “Would it not be great if human beings were 
all living in rural communes with rudimentary housing and no 
hydro-electric power?” Some of them have said that all the dams 
that have been created in British Columbia should be dismantled. 
Can we imagine that?  There would be no power.  There would be no 
means for people to generate electrical power for industrial or 
commercial use.  But that is what these people see.  That is their 
vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that this legislation is driven by that kind of mentality. 
The goal is to further limit human activity of almost any kind 
and this is one more step in that direction.  These people want 
to limit economic activity with the eventual goal of eradicating 
it altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already said, the environmentalists and the 
preservationists have been saying a lot about the environment in 
British Columbia and across Canada.  Let me tell members that 
there is very little truth to any of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been saying, for example, that we need to stop logging 
in order to preserve habitat for wildlife.  I know a little about 
wildlife, since I have spent most of my life hunting and fishing 
in the backwoods.  Do members know what the aboriginal people did 
in this country when wildlife was becoming scarce?  They went on 
a controlled burn.  They burned the forest because they knew that 
a heavy forest canopy did not allow for the growth of small 
deciduous plants and berry bushes, the plant life that is 
important for wildlife to live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go into the so-called old growth areas of British 
Columbia, I assure members they will find very little wildlife. I 
can take a boat down the Douglas Channel, which is down from my 
home town of Kitimat, and see every place where some logger has 
a-frame logged old growth.  There is regeneration and the berry 
bushes are reappearing.  That is where we would find the 
wildlife, the bears and the deer and the moose, because something 
is available for them to eat.  If we went to where the old growth 
was, there would be nothing available for them to eat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wildlife population in British Columbia is extraordinarily 
strong at the present time.  As much as the people who run the 
bear watch campaign would have us believe otherwise, I can say 
from living in the Kitimat Valley all of my life that the bear 
population in that region is as high as I have ever seen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a kid, prior to logging in the Kitimat Valley, it 
would be a very rare occasion that a moose would be seen.  Now 
that the valley has been logged and we have a nice regeneration 
taking place, the moose population has probably quadrupled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the radical environmentalists and the preservationists talk 
about old growth logging and how it hurts wildlife, I can say 
that nothing could be further from the truth.  Their agenda with 
this bill is to further limit human activity on Canadian soil. 
Their eventual agenda, if this bill is adopted, is to make sure 
that we do not have access to the waterfront at all any more. 
There will be no chance to revise the Fisheries Act to bring some 
sense to the development of the Canadian waterfront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a British Columbian.  I am a Canadian and I love Canada.  I 
would not be in this parliament if I did not feel strongly about 
the federation, but I have to agree with my friend in the Bloc 
Quebecois.  This is provincial jurisdiction.  Why in the name of 
God is the federal government getting involved?  Does it not 
think that when it gets involved it puts up big red flags, not 
only for members in the Bloc but for members in other parts of 
Canada as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this bill should be defeated on its face for those very 
reasons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks.  I have great 
sympathy for his objection to environmental groups.  They often 
have agendas that have nothing to do with preserving the 
environment but have a lot to do with getting donations and 
publicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that he is a proud Canadian and that he is concerned with 
national values.  However, I have to say to the member, as a 
Canadian, that there are too many examples across the country 
where major problems have been created in the environment because 
provincial governments have not acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario the provincial government is retreating from 
environmental issues in every way.  In Newfoundland, for example, 
there are environmental problems occurring in the logging 
industry.  If we fly over Corner Brook we can look down to see 
that the trees are gone.  While perhaps what is growing back may 
be good for some types of wildlife, there still is the disruption 
of the natural landscape.  I could cite examples right across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem with the member's remarks is that in siding with the 
Bloc Quebecois he simply asserted that the federal government has 
no role in the environment.  I fundamentally disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he sets aside that criticism, upon which the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois are constantly together, that is, provincial 
power at the expense of federal power, can he tell us something 
about what his genuine concerns are about this legislation as it 
pertains to the marine environment, and not the logging industry, 
the mountains and the forests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my first concern is that we 
have this legislation at all.  If the member says that provincial 
governments are retreating, so be it.  That is their right.  It 
is not the right of the federal government to override that and 
say that it will step in and do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments in this country have jurisdiction 
over the environment.  The Liberal government's philosophy has been 
for 30 years, and it is what has led us to the brink of breakup 
in this is country, that we have to have a strong central 
government, mother Ottawa, dictating to the rest of the country 
how it will live.  I say, frankly, that is not on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal government have a role to play within the 
environment?  Absolutely.  When it comes to matters of 
international negotiation, the federal government has a role in 
concert with the provinces.  It also has a role in consultation 
and agreement with the provinces.  Beyond that there is not.  The 
provincial governments have jurisdiction.  If the federal 
government would just butt out and leave matters to the 
provinces, we would all be a lot better off and the tensions in 
this country would start to decrease rather than increase.

efforts to preserve marines areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the critic for his party, in his remarks at the beginning of 
second reading, stated that he could not support this bill 
because it did not go far enough, because it did not include 
conservation measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that question is easy to 
answer.  My colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands said this is a 
hollow bill.  By hollow he meant that it gives the minister a 
great deal of discretionary power without specifying what that 
power is going to be used for and without specifying where the 
marine conservation areas will be, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you want us to consult? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member across asked me 
something.  I want him to butt out.  Do not tell us in northern 
British Columbia from Ottawa what we can and cannot do with our 
marine areas.  We do not need somebody from the other side of 
Canada telling us what we can do in our own backyard.  If the

to Newfoundland, Quebec and the rest of the country, the country 
would be a lot better off.

a question for our colleague from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I heard correctly, British Columbia asked the Canadian 
government to establish a park and the government agreed, 
without holding consultations. I am not sure I heard correctly 
on account of the noise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, I would like him to tell me, because this is indicative 
of something about this government that I find extremely 
dangerous. As members know, once bitten, twice shy, and what 
goes around comes around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how the Liberal government operates, saying it is 
holding consultations but not taking them into account. We saw 
it when the issue of the changes to the boundaries of Tuktut 
Nogait Park was brought up. The government never agreed to 
recognize the rights that were being claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, could the hon. member tell me exactly what he said about the 
park in British Columbia that was authorized by the Government 
of Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question.  I will try to explain what happened.  The federal 
government decided it wanted to create a national park.  It asked 
the province for permission to do that and the province agreed to 
do so provided there was consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a small degree of consultation.  It was not widespread 
by any means.  As a result of that consultation a number of very 
serious promises were made on the part of the federal government. 
There was a $38 million fund to be established to assist in the 
transition to a different economy.  Promises were made with 
regard to assisting the community in transforming from a resource 
based economy to a tourist based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has not kept its word on any of that. It 
has not kept the bargain.  The people hanging out to dry are the 
people who live on South Moresby and Sandspit on the Queen 
Charlotte Islands—

forth and have done that for the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire the province.  I love the province.  I love the island

what he is basically saying is if you do not live in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian I care about this country from sea to sea.  It is 
of interest to me.  I know the provincial government in B.C. now 
is probably the most venal government in Canada. It is inept.  It 
would do anything in order to get votes, including raping the 
landscape and raping the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned the federal government is doing the 
right thing because if we are Canadians we should care about 
B.C., about Quebec, about Newfoundland.  We on this side do care.

sharing my time with my colleague from Témiscamingue. We will 
each speak for ten minutes. My colleague will speak last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-48, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas. As members have seen from 
our previous speeches, we have several reasons to oppose this 
bill which, once again, interferes in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was flabbergasted, a few moments ago, when I heard the Liberal 
members automatically make a connection between the Reform Party 
and the Bloc Quebecois because we were talking about respecting 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like them to be honest. From the beginning, they have 
been talking even louder than us—they are always very grouchy 
when we speak—but I would like them to tell us frankly and 
honestly that they have absolutely no respect for areas of 
provincial jurisdiction and that they think the simple solution 
to Canada's problems would be to eliminate the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canadian Constitution of 1867, there are areas of shared 
jurisdiction, including the environment. The federal government 
says it must interfere in areas such as the environment because 
there is a problem in Newfoundland or there is a problem in 
British Columbia, but let us look at what it has done on its own 
turf. Let us look at what it has done on northern native 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment committee visited these reserves. What has the 
government done? It can all  be found in the committee's 
proceedings. What has it done to protect the environment at 
airports and on Canadian forces bases? The Liberals, when and if 
they check in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, will 
see what the government's obligations are. They can read 
evidence given by federal employees and by other witnesses who 
have seen the federal government renege on its obligations on 
its own property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to blame others and say “We must have the upper hand 
because we are better, more intelligent, more clever, more who 
knows what else, we must have the upper hand over the Government 
of Quebec and every other province. There are crooked trees in 
the provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only the government looked at its own areas of jurisdiction, 
it might see it has problems too. It is a lot easier to shrug 
off its own problems and point to the problems of other 
governments, claiming it will take care of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately they have not stopped to think about how they 
could improve things. What we see today is the result of this 
approach. The government and the bureaucrats, who are trying to 
justify their positions, come up with countless new ideas

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage suggested, we are not opposed to this kind of 
environmental protection. We are in favour of measures aimed at 
protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the Bloc Quebecois would remind the 
government it supported legislation establishing Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park. Moreover the Bloc Quebecois knows the 
Quebec government is embarking on initiatives aimed at 
protecting the environment, particularly the sea floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we support the establishment of Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park when we now object to this bill? It is very simple, really. 
On one hand, there was joint action and perhaps the 
parliamentary secretary—I read it in his speeches—did not 
understand this aspect or did not want to understand it. We 
agreed to determine a procedure for the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park, and if we were had been offered the same procedure, 
the same joint action and the same harmonization, perhaps we 
would be talking differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, today, Liberals say “The federal government, even to 
establish these marine parks, will have to be the owner of the 
seabed”. The Constitution does not allow the government to take 
such a direction, to own the seabed to establish a marine park. 
If the parliamentary secretary read his bill once again, he 
would probably find this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the problem is not only one of overlap between the federal 
and the provincial governments. Let us look within the federal 
government alone. There is a small problem. 
If only the federal and the provincial governments were 
involved, the bad separatists could be there to throw a monkey's 
wrench into the works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will find ourselves with three designations, three 
categories, namely who will take precedence, where and when. I 
will name them: the Department of Canadian Heritage, which was 
once again short on visibility, has decided, by forgetting or by 
intentionally omitting, to establish marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, Fisheries and Oceans Canada had marine 
protection areas. At the same time, there were protected marine 
areas within a same department. We could ask this question. If 
there were a problem, would it be environment, heritage or 
fisheries and oceans that would deal with it? So, there will be 
discussions, task forces and probably consultations to determine 
who will deal with this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, leaving the provinces aside, they create a federal body 
to examine this problem so things can move forward once again. 
We are not alone in deploring this situation. I would like to 
quote a report from a group of officials from the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans who wrote the following: “There is still a 
great deal of confusion among stakeholders regarding the various 
federal programs on protected marine areas, marine protection 
zones, national marine conservation areas, wildlife marine 
preserves — The departments concerned should harmonize their 
actions and co-operate to create protected marine areas.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments were not made by the Bloc Quebecois or the member 
for Rimouski—Mitis, but rather by DFO officials who were asked by 
a committee to write a report commenting on the creation of 
marine conservation areas across the country, including eight in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and time again that different groups had been 
asked to share their concerns or their views on the 
establishment of marine conservation areas in Canada. Actually, 
what happened is that Heritage Canada, very proud to be able to 
show that they were consulting Canadians, had 3,000 copies made 
of the document. They decided to go ahead and consult all the 
environmental groups, all the groups who were in any way 
concerned with the establishment of marine conservation areas. 
It was quite a consultation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Their very existence or their very being is one of opposing 
anything that might in some way unite all of Canada over an issue 
as vital as the environment.  I am not at all surprised.  In fact

that they want to break the country apart.

be left in the hands of provincial governments that have 
parochial interests of their own and, as my colleague pointed 
out, may be driven by a need to gather votes.  They would hand 
over the environment of the country to provincial parochial 
politicians.  I would suggest the Bloc at least has an agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather arrogant on their part to tell us from the outset 
that in the end no one is in a better position to establish high

provincial governments may be motivated only by electoral

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> That is what they are. I have been in politics

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> I go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, five years ago, in order to get elected, these 
people promised they would abolish the GST in the best interest 
of Canadians. Five years later, I still pay GST on my 
transactions. Now, they say that they are better than us at 
representing constituents and that they can better defend the 
interests of constituents and citizens all over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not expect them to react 
that strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, let us go back to the proposal included in this bill, 
because it reflects what is found in many bills. 
We see this repeatedly in intergovernmental affair issues. The 
Liberals want to occupy every inch of space in the Constitution 
of Canada, to elbow their way in, to be more present, to 
interfere more in every area of provincial jurisdiction. We have 
seen it with the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the government has an important financial leeway. 
Now that it has done it, that it has reduced its transfers to 
the provinces, payments to the most disadvantaged, funds for EI 
benefits and welfare, it becomes more present. Liberal members 
think they are very wise and know best what is in the interest 
of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about marine areas. I remember hearing on the 
Réseau de l'information the press conference given by the 
Minister of Environment of Quebec and by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, regarding the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park. An agreement suitable for both parties was signed. 
But what is happening suddenly? Are there regrets? Is an 
agreement respecting both parties' areas of jurisdiction no 
longer possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To establish marine areas, the federal government will now 
demand ownership of the land and subsoil. They will invoke 
certain sections of the Constitution to extend their powers, 
saying that the federal government can act in the interest of 
Canadians, that it is a matter of good governance, setting aside 
the whole question of the distribution of powers as provided in 
sections 91, 92 and 93 of this same Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could not care less. We heard earlier what this government 
really thinks. When they think something may benefit them, they 
could not care less about jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there is so much overlap between the federal 
government and the provinces. But in this case, 
not only do we see overlap between the federal government and 
the provinces—and we will have another example of this—but the 
federal government itself has seen a possibility to meddle in 
the environmental area. We do not question the objective of 
creating marine areas, to respect our fauna, our heritage, which 
is important. Nobody is against this. Can anybody be against 
virtue? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important things to do in this regard. Everybody 
agrees with the objectives. However, the approach used by the 
government to achieve these objectives is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two or three departments in Ottawa have seen this. All of a 
sudden, every one of them wants to take care of this. Heritage 
Canada says: “Yes. This a good idea. We will do something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote some of the objectives the Department of Canadian 
Heritage has defined: the protection of natural self-regulating 
marine ecosystems for the maintenance of biological diversity; 
the establishment of a representative system of marine 
conservation areas; and many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisheries and Oceans Canada is another department that found 
this initiative interesting. It has its own goals, which are to 
ensure the conservation of commercial and non-commercial 
fisheries resources and their habitats, endangered or threatened 
species and their habitats, unique habitats, productive 
ecosystems and biodiversity, any other marine resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This department decided it had a role to play and had to get 
involved in this area. It also wants to take credit for the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the list goes on. Of course, that has the Department of 
Environment a bit concerned. 
It also wants to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we have three departments, with different responsabilities, 
the departments of Environment, of Fisheries and Oceans and of 
Canadian Heritage, that want a piece of the action. So we can 
talk about marine protection zones, marine reserves or marine 
conservation areas. Everyone has its own name for it and 
everyone will have its own regulations. It will be total chaos 
within the federal government who, to make matters even worse, 
will tackle the provinces head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask you this: how is it that, not after hundreds of 
years, but only after a few months of a framework agreement with 
Quebec where areas of jurisdiction were respected, we are 
suddenly no longer able to keep going in this direction? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that so? Do they already regret the agreement they 
signed? Did some of them suddenly wake up, saying: “We should 
never get trapped again. We should not respect provincial 
jurisdiction, but rather invade it to preserve our room to 
manoeuvre and defend the interests of the people we pretend to 
represent”? There is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to come back to what was said at the 
beginning on the fact that this responsibility should not be 
left to the provinces because their motivations are purely 
political. Let us examine those words. What is their meaning? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, they do not want citizens to put pressure on their 
provincial governments. 
I am convinced that Canadians approve of the environmental 
protection goals we are giving ourselves today and that those 
same voters are able to put pressure on their provincial 
governments. But in order to do so, they must know clearly whom 
they can talk to, instead of being told that the federal 
government is responsible for this area and the provincial 
government for that area. This creates dissension and confusion 
about responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If things are clearly defined and jurisdictions are respected, 
citizens might understand better and put more pressure on their 
elected representatives. Ultimately, it is those voters who will 
put pressure on either level of government to make sure that 
they act and that our wildlife habitat is better protected and 
environmental standards better implemented in various areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not to the federal government, in its wisdom, to decide 
suddenly what is good or bad for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that bother them is the fact that when they 
attend international forums in foreign countries, they have to 
say that those issues come under provincial jurisdiction. They 
feel somewhat powerless, inferior, diminished. They do not want 
decentralization. They ask themselves what they can do and once 
they are back home, they get together. One will admit having had 
a problem relating to the environment, while another had a 
problem in another area. So they all agree that they should 
centralize even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people want a centralized state. No wonder we the big, bad 
separatists are not alone in denouncing this situation. 
There are also people from other political parties, with other 
priorities and other agendas, who do not agree at all to our 
cause, but who also condemn what is happening because they are 
committed to serving the interests of Canada, perhaps even more 
than Liberals, and who would like the government to respect 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very amusing today to hear members praising the 
government's virtues. I challenge these members to try to 
understand the agreement that was signed with Quebec on the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine park. I am convinced that, in fact, 
most members do not even know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should examine it, study it and ask the minister some 
questions, if they can get a word in during their caucus 
meetings. They should ask why this agreement is not being used 
as a model. They should take a stand, and we will see what comes 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will put the bill into the proper perspective and use last 
summer's agreement as a model, so that we can do something 
lasting for the environment, something that will respect 
jurisdictions and serve the public's interests.

concerns in that area of British Columbia are and they are the 
best ones to deal with it.  I find it offensive to hear members 
on the other side suggesting they are not capable, not to be 
trusted and that this must be done from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not agree that the Liberals caved in when 
it came to cleaning up the litter, the refuse and the pollution 
from the American military installations around Canada?  Does he 
not agree they have completely failed to perform on their 
commitment to clean up the Sydney tar ponds?  Should they not at 
least clean up their own act before they start to pretend they 
can dictate to the rest of Canada what our environmental 
legislation should look like? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more. These 
people should have a look at their own backyard first and their 
own jurisdictions, and try first to see what they can do there, 
before they intrude on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that, ultimately, voters in affected areas are in 
the best position to set their own priorities. Generally, people 
are much closer to their provincial governments than to the 
federal government, and provincial politicians are much more in 
touch with their constituents than we are. The same holds true 
for municipal representatives. 
So we can say there are quite a few members opposite who are out 
of touch.

the people in B.C., and they cannot determine either what is 
best for us. I respect this type of approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should take a look at its own backyard. 
It has enough problems as it is without looking for more 
elsewhere. I do not want to digress, but we know that the feds 
have a debate on their hands about the surplus in the EI fund 
and the budget surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do these members not stand up, not speak up, not shake up 
their government so that it will take care of the most important 
priorities? No, these people are looking for jurisdictions, for 
squabbles between the federal and provincial governments and for 
senseless debates that keep us from moving forward. They really 
do love squabbles. They are always looking for more of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They even fight with their allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> They even fight with their allies. It is true, 
I had forgotten that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, they even fight with their allies, which is nothing 
new. Then they accuse us of provocation. There is no one better 
than a federal Liberal to provoke fights in Canada. They are the 
masters in that game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I want to tell the member that we share his approach, and I 
hope the government will finally understand. I always hope that, 
in a moment of lucidity, the Liberals will show some courage. 
They have the majority, but only by five or six seats. It would 
take only a few of them to make a stand. They do not realize the 
power they have. Wake up. You could wake up the government, make 
things change instead of constantly backing away and backing 
down from the Prime Minister. Think about your own future. Stand 
up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the 
hon. member who spend a good part of his speech saying that the 
Liberals are the big bad wolves, who are always looking for 
squabbles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he explain to the House, first, whether he too does not 
feel somewhat out of touch as a federal member of parliament 
and, second, why the NDP and the Progressive Conservative Party 
both support the bill?  They are not big bad wolves.  How can he 
explain that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to explain. There 
is en excellent example right now in Quebec. Like many people, 
we have a very hard time making the difference between the 
Liberals and the Conservatives and we have a very good 
illustration of that in this case. There are many similarities 
between the two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit, however, that, in general, the Liberals are the 
kings of confrontation and I do not want to strip them of their 
title. I must give them that, but I must say that it is 
sometimes very hard to distinguish between Liberals and 
Conservatives because they so very much look alike. But in some 
cases, it is easier than in others to distinguish the political 
stripes. But let us go back to the issue at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Let us get back to the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Yes, that is it. Why would it be impossible to 
do what we already did once? Why would it be impossible to 
conclude the kind of agreement we signed in the case of the 
Saguenay-Saint-Laurent marine park? 
What is the problem?  Why can we not do the same thing for the 
other marine areas?  I would like an explanation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The system does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  A member of the Reform Party says the 
system does not work.  He would simply build a bridge right 
through the heart of the Rockies and separate the province of 
British Columbia.  That is the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wants all the regulatory power to be put in the hands 
of Premier Clark.  That is what we are hearing those members say. 
They know what is best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Wentworth—Burlington pointed out that he has 
a mother, a brother and a sister living there.  I have many dear 
friends in Victoria.  Most of them are Liberals, he might 
appreciate, but dear friends nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a former long time mayor who now represents his 
community in this place.  When someone is elected on a federal 
agenda they are elected, it seems to me, regardless of their 
parochialism, regardless of their tunnel vision, regardless of 
their inability to understand that from sea to sea to sea there 
are issues of significance to all Canadians. The treatment of the 
environment in the province of British Columbia I believe in my 
heart is important to the people of Newfoundland and vice versa. 
The treatment of the Great Lakes, the treatment of our fisheries, 
the treatment of pollution, of dealing with water purification, 
is important to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof of that came when recently there was an announcement 
that water would be sold out of the Great Lakes basin to the 
United States.  The uproar, believe me, was from sea to sea to 
sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we turn that decision over to the province of Ontario? 
Should we abdicate our national responsibility?  Members in the 
Reform Party would probably suggest we should turn it over to the 
state of Michigan, given their track record and their background 
and where many of their policies come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do a survey in virtually any part of this country and simply ask 
should the federal government, the national government, the 
Parliament of Canada, have input into the protection of the 
environment in this country or should we simply wash our hands 
and abdicate that responsibility to the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard one member talk about Tweedledee and Tweedledum.  I am 
not sure who but I heard somebody, Bloc or Reform, say that 
perhaps the municipalities should be given control over this. 
Would that not be interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also served 10 years as a municipal councillor.  I understand 
the role and I appreciate the role.  My wife currently serves as 
a councillor. 
It is a incredibly important service to the community, but with 
all due respect to my dear wife, my mayor and all municipal 
politicians, I do not feel I would stand here and abdicate my 
responsibility for national programs to the municipalities.

a two out of three mud fall, fighting over the environment?  I do 
not think I want to see that.  I do not think the national

municipal level.  The member opposite is shaking her head, but it 
was one of her own members who suggested it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the official opposition wants to criticize the federal

perspective.  It wants to dismantle the country.

responsibilities with a great big bow, things Canadians hold dear 
to their hearts, and turn them over to provincial politicians? If 
that is what Reformers want to do, they should say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not surprise me terribly, considering that they only 
represent two provinces and considering they do not have a seat 
east of the Manitoba border, that their interests might lie in 
the fact that Ralph Klein is the latest champion of the Reform

It would not surprise me considering the fact that the hon. Tony 
Clement, minister of transportation for the province of Ontario, 
sings the praises of the Reform Party.  I wonder why. He might 
like to avoid a provincial Reform Party starting up in the 
province of Ontario.  Maybe that is the motive.  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a Reform Party in the province of Ontario running on

that the venerable Bill Davis recently attended a unite the right 
cocktail party.  I wonder if they were serving arsenic or 
whatever.  I understand there is a move to have the Reform Party 
leap-frog over the Bloc to join the Tories in the unite the 
right, but I am delighted to hear members say that it will not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some federal legislation.  Should we turn it over to the 
provinces?  The Fisheries Act, the Oceans Act, the Canada 
Shipping Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the 
Migratory Birds Act, all these statutes are relevant to the 
conservation of marine resources.  They are relevant to this 
place.  It is our responsibility and the responsibility of 
Reformers to stand and defend the nation.  They should stand and 
say that they will vote with the government if it means 
protecting the national environment on behalf of all Canadians, 
even though they only represent a few in a few small areas of the 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the 
Liberal member say in his eloquent speech that when a party is 
elected on a particular political platform, it must follow up on 
that platform. He could have talked about the elimination of the 
GST, pay equity, withdrawal from the free trade agreement, the 
elimination of the GST on books or the end of patronage 
appointments, all to be found in the red book, but he simply 
forgot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to his speech helped me understand why people have so 
little confidence in and so little respect for politicians. To 
summarize his speech, we could say, as we used to say in the 
schoolyard when we were kids, “my father is stronger than 
yours”. 
That was more or less the substance of his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now try to ask a different question to the Liberal 
member. I will ask him what part of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence 
marine park agreement would be unacceptable in Bill C-48. I 
remind him that this has nothing to do with the big bad 
separatists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how can the member explain the inability to come to an 
understanding on the basis of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park agreement, and second, how can he explain the difference 
between clause 5(2) of Bill C-48 and section 92,5 of the Canadian 
Constitution? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an interesting 
response, the issue of my father is stronger than your father.  I 
am paraphrasing.  Perhaps it is close to what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are saying that our Canada is 
stronger with Quebec as part of it than the hon. member's country 
separated.  That is very simple.  If that is school yard bully 
tactics then so be it, but I do not think it is.  We understand 
that my Canada, the Canada of people on this side of the House, 
is stronger with British Columbia as part of it and is stronger 
with Quebec as part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite continues to chirp.  I guess he did not have 
enough time to ask his question.  Perhaps he has a particular 
amendment that he wants to make to the bill.  Is he saying he 
does not?  He is asking why it cannot be like the agreement in 
the Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not bring it to committee?  This is second reading.  It will 
go to committee.  Why not bring it to committee and take a look 
at some amendments?  The hon. member might be surprised.  If 
there is a way of improving the bill, who knows?  We could 
discuss it.  It could be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member wants to stand in this place and use it as 
nothing more than a political soapbox for the absolute display of 
unity between the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois that are both in 
their own inimitable way determined to destroy the country.  The 
Liberal Party of Canada, the government of the country, will not 
allow that to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I get from 
the member's intervention the notion that if we do not support 
this kind of heavy handed interventionist legislation we are 
somehow not patriots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are truly looking to keep Canada united and strong, the 
federal government has to back off. If the federal government 
does not do that, we will lose Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bill establishes a 
procedure.  It is not a short term proposition.  Like national 
parks the areas we are talking about are intended to be created 
in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely a puzzle to me why Reformers would object to 
perpetuating and perpetually protection of the environment 
through the bill.  They are using it for their own political 
purpose to grandstand because they only know how to be against an 
initiative of the government instead of trying to understand it 
and support it for all Canadians.

Africa.  It is a beautiful part of the world, particularly Egypt. 
I am very fond of the desert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most stunning adventures, if one is into the 
environment and into wildlife and that sort of thing, is to 
travel to the shore of the Red Sea and snorkel in the Red Sea, 
which is what I did about six or seven years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Red Sea is famous for its underwater marine environment.  I 
arrived there and went swimming.  There is a reef just offshore. 
It is quite fantastic because when looking around with my face 
out of water it is all desert.  When I put my face in the water 
it was a riot of colour.  There is life everywhere competing. 
There were fish, coral, sea fans and everything imaginable within 
my view.  The water was beautiful and perfectly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in one little cove that the local guides took us to.  I 
asked to go a little way down the shore where again I went into 
the water and looked down with my face mask and snorkel on and 
there was desolation.  There was nothing.  Everything was totally 
dead.  As I walked along the shore the sand looked perfectly 
normal, but I stepped on something soft.  It was a sand coated 
globule of oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to passing through the Suez Canal the oil tankers trim 
their tanks by dumping oil into the Red Sea.  The devastation of 
one of the most fantastic ecosystems in the world is 
unbelievable.  It is all because of a weak national government 
which did not apply standards to the tankers moving through the 
Suez Canal.  Egypt did not apply those standards because it needs 
the money.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us return to Canada for a moment and travel with me to 
Newfoundland, to Cape St. Mary's on the Avalon peninsula.  I was 
there the summer before last.  It is an absolutely splendid 
situation.  It is a bird sanctuary.  Approaching the edge of the 
cliffs there is a huge pinnacle a couple of hundred yards 
offshore.  The drop is about 300 feet.  Tens of thousands of 
birds swarm around that pinnacle.  That is their breeding ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Puffins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  No, not puffins.  On other islands along 
the shore there are puffins and whales, just along the east coast 
of the Avalon peninsula.  There is wild life and biodivisity in 
incredible quantities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone in Newfoundland decided to shoot all those birds or 
kill the whales found along that coast, or maybe develop the 
islands where the puffins breed, would the people in B.C. care? 
Would they be affected?  I suggest that every Canadian would care 
if this type of environment in Newfoundland were destroyed.  I 
would say every Canadian would care.  The world would lose 
something but Canada would lose something most of all.  Even if 
we do not see it and even it is not in our province it is 
important to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move to Lake Ontario.  Just off Welland there are two ships 
that lie in about 500 feet of water.  They are called the 
<I>Hamilton</I> and the <I>Scourge</I>.  They are American vessels 
from the War of 1812 which were actually seized from the 
Canadians and refurbished into American men of war.  A storm came 
up and the ships capsized and sank in about 500 feet of water in 
Lake Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 12 years ago they were located and an expedition was 
mounted to go down and examine them.  These are two War of 1812 
warships that are in absolute pristine condition on the floor of 
Lake Ontario.  They are absolutely perfect.  They are a wonderful 
snapshot of a period in all our history that determined the 
future of Canada when we were under threat and at war with the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation covers the preservation of that type of 
historical situation at the bottom of Lake Ontario. 
It is under threat because all those artifacts on the lake floor 
are a tremendous attraction to scuba divers and relic hunters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a classic case where the heritage ministry has a role in 
this kind of legislation.  We have to protect that kind of thing. 
It is of interest.  It is of value.  People do care in British 
Columbia, Quebec and Newfoundland about that kind of 
archeological treasure in Lake Ontario because it is Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to Victoria.  Let us go to British Columbia and look 
at Long Beach for example.  Long Beach on Vancouver Island is one 
of the most splendid marine environments we could ever hope to 
see. For miles there is surf rolling up.  We can walk along the 
shore and find shells of every diversity. The waters off British 
Columbia are as equally famous as the Red Sea for their 
biodiversity. Scuba divers come from all over the world to 
British Columbia to dive in those waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Victoria is noted for its very long sewage pipe 
which dumps raw sewage into the ocean. I would ask members on the 
opposite side of the House, especially the B.C. members, if they 
seriously want to tell me that the federal government has no role 
because we can trust the provinces and the municipalities. We can 
see for ourselves, and Victoria is the classic example, that in 
order to save a few dollars or perhaps to save jobs, Victoria is 
dumping raw sewage into the sea.  And it does float back, I have 
to say, and all they do is make the pipe longer. That is the type 
of problem that exists when we leave environmental issues solely 
to the provinces and the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real thrust of my talk is that we have choices in this 
country.  We can believe that what pulls together a country of 
this size and this diversity is its diversity.  It is its 
difference in its cultures, its environment, its forests and its 
sheer beauty.  Perhaps the fundamental difference between members 
on this side and members on the opposite side is that I feel very 
strongly that all of it belongs to me, not just what exists in my 
municipality which is at the head of Lake Ontario, not just what 
exists in my province, but the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a riding near the city that had the Plastimet fire. 
The Plastimet company came under Ontario and municipal fire codes 
and environmental laws and what did we have?  Hamilton had one of 
the worst toxic fires in this century, at least in Canada. The 
provincial controls were there on paper but they were not there 
in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental difference between members on this side and 
members on the other side is, be they Bloc Quebecois or Reform 
members, they do not appreciate—the NDP have indicated that they 
do not want to be included with the Bloc and the Reform Party and 
I appreciate that, and I did not notice a reaction from the 
Conservatives.  The fundamental point is simply that the 
difference politically that exists in this country is exemplified 
by this legislation.  One side wants the legislation for the 
entire nation and the other side does not want the legislation 
for provincial parochial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois members although they do not like the 
nationalist component in this legislation have certainly 
indicated that they agree in principle with the general idea of 
preserving these ecosystems.  I know it is impossible for the 
Reform Party but I would suggest that the Bloc Quebecois remember 
that this is second reading, agreement in principle. Therefore 
support it in principle and vote with the government on this 
occasion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite easy to understand why the NDP is in favour of this 
bill. It is simply because the NPD is a centralizing party, just 
like the Liberal Party. It is normal for these people to support 
a centralizing bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker shared with us his tremendous knowledge. He 
analyzed what is happening in Africa, at the Suez canal, 
throughout the world, but I think it is time for him to wake up 
and realize what is going on in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the Minister of Justice is here, so the member may 
want to listen to what I say and then ask her some questions. 
The situation in Canada is very complex. Let me give the example 
of a fisherman from the riding of Berthier—Montcalm, who wants to 
go fishing in the St. Lawrence River. 
Then the member can tell me that this whole thing they are 
setting up is not complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fisherman asks the province for a fishing licence. He will 
go fishing in a boat he has bought in Quebec and for which he 
has paid the federal and the provincial taxes. To launch his 
boat, he has to register with the federal government. Then he 
brings his boat to the shore which is an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. As soon as it is launched, the boat is in federal 
waters. However, the bottom of the river is provincial. The fish 
swimming in the water belongs to the federal, but the crab at 
the bottom falls under an area of shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, as soon as the fish swimming in federal 
waters is caught and thrown in the boat, it comes under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But as if that were not good enough, we also have federal 
fishing quotas. 
If, on top of this, it is a commercial fishery, there are 
federal and provincial laws and regulations on food, the 
environment, safety, equipment, and so forth.. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is completely flawed. As if things were not 
complicated enough as it is, Canadian Heritage, Fisheries and 
Oceans and Environment Canada will now be involved in the 
implementation of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member who studied how things are done around the world 
and believes they are easy to manage in Canada not think it is 
not normal for the federal government to always try to 
complicate matters? It is creating problems where there were 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean marine park is a case in point. Why not 
duplicate it? 
No, it would be too easy. As if things were not complicated 
enough, as if there were not enough stakeholders in matters such 
as water and fisheries, now three other departments and all 
their bureaucrats are involved, and the provincial government 
has been pushed aside. We know how this works. This makes 
absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member opposite open his eyes and ears for once in his 
life and, when the time comes to pass the bill, will he rise and 
vote against the government and the bill? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I detect from the 
hon. member's remarks that he does support the bill in principle. 
I would suggest to him that it is he who should be rising in 
support of the bill rather than the opposite. The often valid 
objections that the Bloc Quebecois brings up should be debated in 
committee.  If they cannot be resolved at that stage, it makes 
sense then to vote against the bill at third reading.  When we 
agree with something in principle, we should support it in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for my colleague's general remarks, it seems to me that the 
easiest way to resolve the problem of too much mixed jurisdiction 
in issues of the environment, the fisheries and the coastal 
regions would be for the provinces to back off and allow the 
federal government to play its proper role in managing these 
resources on our coastal waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be in the House and to see 
members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak tonight on the Liberal government's 
complete mishandling of the APEC affair.  I hasten to add that 
the handling is really the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what has been stated by Liberal members, this is not 
an issue of partisan politics.  Rather, this is an issue that 
involves serious questions pertaining to the responsibilities of 
ministers of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are deeply troubled by a Prime Minister and a 
solicitor general who appear to have clear disregard for their 
respective duties and outright refuse to be accountable for their 
own actions, not unlike the infamous Airbus affair which we have 
yet to hear the last of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon assuming office ministers of the crown must swear an oath 
to Her Majesty the Queen to uphold responsibilities which are 
inherent in serving the federal cabinet.  The Prime Minister and 
the solicitor general in particular are entrusted with very heavy 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know the level of the Prime Minister's 
involvement in directing RCMP officers to suppress peaceful 
protesters so as not to offend the sensibilities of an Asian 
dictator. What offends the sensibilities of Canadians is not only 
the callous remarks of the Prime Minister and the efforts to 
dodge the issue that the government is engaged in, but how 
closely was he involved and is it appropriate that he was 
involved.  These are the fundamental questions that have remained 
unanswered throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of equal importance is why did the Prime Minister and his 
government not simply answer questions about this matter in this 
House when the matter was first introduced? Instead of engaging 
in that, they stepped up their efforts by engaging spin doctors 
to deflect these questions to avoid the hard questions that were 
posed to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly and to his personal shame, the Prime Minister has refused 
to account for his actions and the actions of his office.  His 
government has chosen the RCMP Public Complaints Commission to 
investigate these allegations.  Despite the commission's lack of 
a legal and moral mandate to undertake such an inquiry with a 
broad truth seeking authority or any real final say in the 
matter, the government has been hiding behind this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has recently been declared that the federal court will not be 
hearing the appeal that was put to it.  Instead, the commission 
itself is going to be tasked with the decision as to whether the 
commission has already prejudged this matter by the chair's 
alleged remarks in a casino.  The commission is left with the 
tantamount task of deciding its own fate.  This has gone from the 
sublime to the ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter has completely lost the faith of the Canadian 
people.  This entire affair has a stench around it now that 
Canadians will not tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general openly chastised the opposition members 
when they asked questions about this.  He then went out, got on a 
plane and spoke about this in a very forthright way saying that 
Hughie was going to take the fall and that certain officers were 
going to be the fall guys in all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter has been completely compromised by the government 
and by the actions of both the solicitor general and the Prime 
Minister.  There is a blatant contradiction in what the 
government has asked the Canadian people to swallow, which is 
that they should have faith in this commission.  However, when 
the commission asked on two separate occasions that the students 
be funded, the government refused. How can Canadians have faith 
in this commission if the government will not listen to the 
requests of the commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Palliser made very damning allegations against 
the solicitor general and these allegations were repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that we have not heard the end of this APEC matter.  I 
am very interested to see how the parliamentary secretary will 
respond to these allegations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to do this in 
French, but I will repeat an English phrase that was used 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way used the expression “from the 
sublime to the ridiculous”.  Oddly, that is just what I was 
thinking when watching the behaviour of the party over there in 
connection with this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a clear understanding of what the problem is: there 
are incidents.  A commission was created a long time ago for 
handling this type of problem.  The case is referred to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the allegation is made that the commission does not have 
the power to do what has to be done.  That is false, but such is 
the allegation, and the commission's credibility is undermined 
as a result.  It is alleged that the Prime Minister got 
involved.  It is alleged that the commission is a lame-duck 
commission.  The allegations keep coming.  Allegations about 
what happened on a plane.  I do not believe my colleague was on 
the plane and therefore he did not hear first hand what was, and 
was not, said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying principle is that someone said this or that. 
This becomes an absolute truth.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 
Enough to make a person weep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, going further with this, who is it that is behind these 
allegations?  Members of opposition parties.  Why are they 
making these allegations?  To defend purely political and 
partisan causes.  And what does this have to do with reality? 
Nothing whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not at all interested in the truth.  What they are 
interested in is the media circus in the House around a matter 
that could have been settled very readily, and will be settled 
very readily, by an organization created for that very purpose, 
a commission called the RCMP Public Complaints Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
