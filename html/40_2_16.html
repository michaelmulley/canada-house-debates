That is a primary reason behind Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3654475,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3654475&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11, An Act to promote safety and security with respect to human pathogens and toxins</A>.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302379" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to begin by explaining what a pathogen is. A human pathogen is a micro-organism capable of causing disease or death in humans. Examples include: salmonella bacteria, the agent of anthrax, listeria bacteria and the Ebola virus. The need to enhance biosafety in Canada's laboratories and prevent an inadvertent release of these agents is one of the two primary focuses of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3654475,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3654475&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302380" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to safeguard Canadians from the risk of an intentional release of these dangerous agents constitutes the second primary focus of the proposed human pathogens and toxins act. As we know, the world changed after September 11, 2001. The events of that day highlighted the need for greater vigilance on our part. This was emphasized in the month that followed when an anthrax attack in the United States resulted in 22 identified cases and five deaths.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302381" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of a bioterror attack is high, both in terms of lives lost, lives affected and economic consequences. It is the responsibility of government, of this Parliament, to put in place the necessary measures to minimize the likelihood of such an event.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302382" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 3,500 laboratories that import human pathogens into Canada. These laboratories are regulated under the existing human pathogens importation regulations which have been in force since 1994. They must also comply with our laboratory biosafety guidelines which are widely accepted as Canada's national biosafety standard.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302383" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, these regulations and associated laboratory biosafety guidelines are only mandatory for facilities that import human pathogens. They are not mandatory for the additional 4,000 laboratories that do not import, but which acquire human pathogens within Canada.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302384" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While labs working with these pathogens do so in a safe manner and widely apply these guidelines on a voluntary basis, we need legislation and regulations in place to reinforce these safe practices, and establish consistency by ensuring all labs in Canada, whether federal, provincial or private, are adhering to these guidelines.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302385" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada faces some serious risks as a result of this legislative and regulatory gap. These include risks to the safety of persons working in and around laboratories and risks to our national security. There is always the potential for accidental release of human pathogens or toxins.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302386" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, about 4,000 laboratories in Canada use domestically acquired human pathogens and toxins. The fact that these laboratories are subject only to a voluntary biosafety regime is not acceptable, especially since similar laboratories that import human pathogens operate under a mandatory biosafety regime.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302387" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to level the playing field in Canada so that all persons working with these agents, and especially all laboratories, are required to operate under the same rules and to comply with the same national biosafety guidelines.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302388" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end the new human pathogens and toxins act is designed to ensure that unless exempted, no person may carry on activities with these dangerous substances without a licence and without complying with the laboratory biosafety guidelines.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302389" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond accidental release, Canada also faces the risk of a deliberate release of a human pathogen or toxin. This is not a pleasant scenario but one which we must consider fully in order to protect Canadians.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we establish a legislative framework that extends beyond the present importation and storage regime for pathogens and toxins, especially for things such as anthrax, salmonella and influenza. The current regime is inadequate and not up to the standard of other international regulations. It only requires that all labs that import human pathogens and toxins adhere to the laboratory biosafety guidelines, the LBGs, but these existing guidelines are not mandatory for labs that acquire human pathogens and toxins from domestic sources even though they are applied widely on a voluntary basis as an industry standard. This voluntary approach is no longer good enough. We need to bring Canada into the modern world that actually deals with the biosecurity reality we now face.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would require laboratories carrying out activities with risk groups 2, 3 or 4 human pathogens or select toxins to register with the Public Health Agency of Canada's Office of Laboratory Security. It would subject the licensees with a risk of group 3 and 4 pathogens and possibly select toxins to stricter operating regulations and it would require a permit to import a human pathogen or toxin. As well, as was raised by the hon. member from Winnipeg, the bill would require transfer permits to send and receive any human pathogen or toxin between laboratories within Canada that are not part of the same facility. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a need for the minister to have the ability to improve the safety and security of Canada's laboratories, the powers given to the minister in the bill are very serious. We believe that putting in place the kind of scientific advice that would be important to the minister should be as transparent as possible. I am in favour of there being an advisory committee to give transparent advice to the minister, so it is clear that scientists make scientific judgments and politicians make political judgments.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioterrorism also remains a very real threat. As mentioned, in October 2000, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to American news media offices and two senators. The letters killed five people and infected over twenty others. Broad public health measures were implemented to treat the thousands who were potentially exposed and decontamination of government buildings and postal offices took years.

Infamously, in 1978 a smallpox laboratory accident caused one death and led to the suicide of the laboratory director.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues said, it is important to keep Canadians safe. It is every Parliament's duty to ensure the safety of Canadians within the scope of its constitutional powers. As we have seen, the proposed legislation would require all persons conducting these activities to comply with a number of guidelines. It would ensure consistency by obliging all labs to adhere to laboratory biosafety guidelines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Licences must be obtained for controlled activities, such as possessing, handling, using, producing, storing, permitting authorized access to, transferring, importing, exporting, releasing or otherwise abandoning, or disposing of a human pathogen or toxin.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government claims that it is entitled to introduce this bill because of its jurisdiction over criminal law. However, at this point, I have to wonder whether the government should really have made this bill a priority. As we know, since the guidelines were introduced over 15 years ago, there have been no incidents in Canada, regardless of whether labs have been following those guidelines. </div>

The government has known at least since November 2006 that there are problems in this area. The Auditor General said so. Since the summer of 2007, there have been several major recalls, including a recall of toys containing lead. It would have been better if this bill were before the House now, seeing as how there have been no pathogen problems to date under the existing acts and regulations.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the highest risk groups are groups 3 and 4. I would remind this House that the human pathogens in these groups pose a high risk to the health of individuals and a low or high risk to public health. Twenty-four labs in Quebec and 150 in Canada fully meet the guidelines for groups 3 and 4. In addition, the backgrounder on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3441362,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3441362&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-54</A>, which is the number this bill had in the last Parliament, states that “The risk to Canadians posed by the presence of human pathogens and toxins in labs is low.”</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still a very important issue. However, this bill, in its current form, must not be allowed to stop or impede lab work, which is crucial to determining the causes of diseases and advancing science through research. In committee, it will be very important to look at this aspect of the bill in depth and to meet with a wide range of specialists working in this field to make sure that they will be able to do this work once this bill has been passed, especially with regard to risk group 2, which poses a lower risk to the health of individuals and public health. Of course, these labs include hospital and university labs where very important research is under way.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise another point before I go on to the topic of university research. I am just wondering whether the Criminal Code already covers intentional threats to public safety, such as terrorist acts, and unintentional threats, such as criminal negligence. To my way of thinking, these threats to public health or public safety are already covered by legislation passed here.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302468" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start with the issue that, in the current version of the bill could, in our opinion, pose a number of problems. That issue is research conducted in our universities. The parliamentary secretary told us earlier that the government had held a number of consultations. And at a meeting with officials from the Public Health Agency of Canada, we were told that a number of consultations had been held. However, despite these consultations, researchers still have a number of important questions, especially regarding who will pay the costs of complying with the new requirements. This concern is mentioned in the Public Health Agency of Canada notes, but was not addressed by the parliamentary secretary in his earlier remarks. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that university research is already underfunded, yet today, as we prepare to refer this bill to committee, we do not know if assistance will be made available to institutions to help them comply with the new guidelines or if labs will be left to cover all the costs themselves.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302470" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the government actually conducted studies to determine the impact this new legislation would have on university courses, on how our hospitals operate and on the research industry in Quebec and Canada?</div>
</p><a name="Para1302471" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is extremely relevant because, as I said earlier, I have not yet received an answer. I understand the government's desire to impose a new guideline so that no products are released that could pose a risk to public health, but as for the operations of laboratories, I have yet to receive an answer.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply have one question. Does the government want us as parliamentarians to pass legislation that I think is incomplete, in the sense that it does not address all the concerns raised by the community? It is asking us for carte blanche, in a way, and asking us to trust it and wait until later. It seems to be saying that it will communicate with the various stakeholders and labs again, that it will ensure that the regulatory framework will meet their expectations and not pose a problem for their operations. If that is in fact what the government and the department intend to do, why then, from the first draft, from the time this bill was introduced for first reading, has this bill not included provisions to address the concerns justifiably raised by the community? </div>
</p><a name="Para1302473" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the government decided to introduce a bill in this House without assessing the direct impact it will have on the community. If it had done so in a responsible manner, this version of the bill would already include provisions to address the concerns raised by the academic community. We would have already heard the government's response regarding its assessment of the impact of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3654475,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3654475&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> on university education. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also proposes a number of fines. I understand that when a bill is introduced that will affect the Criminal Code, for example, fines must be imposed. However, what the government wants to do is impose fines on universities and hospitals, when everyone knows very well—and I said so a little earlier in my speech—that there is an abysmal lack of funding for those two kinds of institutions where research is done.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also establishes penalties and fines for anyone who shows wanton or reckless disregard concerning pathogens and toxins. The bill also establishes financial penalties and imprisonment for anyone who intentionally releases pathogens.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering, as are my Bloc Québécois colleagues, about the need for these new prison sentences given that they are already contained in existing legislation. Are measures put in place by this bill with respect to breach of duty, wanton or reckless breach of duty and intentional release not already in the Criminal Code and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act? And are measures prohibiting intentional misuse of pathogens not included in the Anti-Terrorism Act? These are the questions to ask when the bill is before the Standing Committee on Health. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding my remarks, I would like to go back to two or three other aspects that are more directly related to the bill. Clause 39, for example, states: </div>
</p><a name="Para1302479" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">

</div>
</p><a name="Para1302480" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all intents and purposes, although those receiving this confidential information are required to maintain confidentiality—as stated later in the clause—I find it rather strange that consent is not required. It should be understood that the person may not be consulted or, at the very least, notified that information will be disclosed. This could be discussed with the minister and his officials in order to clarify this aspect of the bill, which could be problematic if, in fact, confidential information is disclosed without notifying the individuals or institutions concerned. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about another issue that relates a bit more directly to the bill. Clause 67 states that the minister may make an interim order involving a product in the case of problems with enforcement of the legislation. The minister would then make an interim order effective immediately. The clause also states that the two houses of Parliament need not be informed for up to 15 days.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302482" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an emergency occur that requires immediate action on the part of the minister, this House should be informed much sooner than that. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary or even the minister would like to touch on that. When it comes to incidents involving public health and safety, all members of the public, as well as all parliamentarians, should be informed and given the opportunity to debate the issues without delay. To me, that means within hours or, at most, a few days. Fifteen days is far too long. Indeed, it would be odd for Parliament not to be informed of a situation endangering public health within 15 days. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of the Conservatives, and the Liberals before them, is atrocious. Neither party has understood the role of government in this area.

Did we see a well coordinated, thoughtful, profound response when it came to something as devastating as listeriosis, which resulted in 20 deaths in our country? No. We saw once more the kind of scattergun approach that the Liberals brought to this chamber. We saw a passive government response that said it would let the industry regulate itself.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start with some basic principles. This legislation says it will broaden the mandatory application of the laboratory biosafety guidelines from just imported pathogens to include domestic sources as well. It will supposedly ensure that the government has a complete inventory of where potentially dangerous pathogens exist and that sites are licensed appropriately. It says it will parallel the treatment of pathogens in many other industrialized countries, because we are far behind the rest of the world on these issues, and that it will bring the malevolent use of these organisms under the criminal code regime and provide for the inspection of work sites and penalties for misuse.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that this bill will make Canadians safer, or will at least make them feel safer. That comes after dealing with Walkerton, SARS, listeriosis, and what have become regular announcements of food contamination and recalls. Just remember that E. coli, salmonella, and listeriosis have all now become household names across this country. There are no exceptions across communities in this country.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Winnipeg, as my colleague from Winnipeg Centre mentioned earlier, we have a level 4 lab. We are very proud of that fact. We are proud of the record of achievement of that laboratory, but we know that it takes a certain ideological perspective to ensure that the public safety is guaranteed whenever such a facility is established in a community. It takes a perspective that says that government's job is to protect people from any dangerous spills or seepage or accident pertaining to pathogens and toxins. It says that the workers in that lab must be safe, that the people in the community must be safe, and that whenever such dangerous pathogens are transported, people everywhere must be safe.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302514" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was a bit of a problem back in 1999 with that lab. The Liberals were in power. There was a leak, and 2,000 litres of lab effluent were dumped into the public sewage system. That was on June 23, 1999.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302515" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a community to stand up and demand its rights for government to take action. The Liberals were then in power, and the Government of Canada decided to keep things relatively quiet, to keep it a secret, to not be fully transparent. Health Canada did not publicize the spill. News of it came through media reports.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302516" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally the community was very upset. I and my colleague, the member for Winnipeg Centre, decided to work with the community to make sure that their voices were heard and that lessons were learned from this incident. In fact, shortly after that spill we launched a community lab safety task force, hosted a round table of experts and activists, and met with many people in the community on this issue.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302517" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It paid off. Eventually the government announced a community liaison committee to improve communications, and other measures were taken as a result of this incident. </div>
</p><a name="Para1302518" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it took the community to speak up about it. There was no full disclosure, and that should never happen.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302519" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I started this debate by saying there must some basic principles in place in order for this legislation to mean anything and to work.</div>
</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1302520" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the list is the principle that there must be full transparency and accountability to the public. There can be no secrets. There has to be full disclosure when accidents happen or mistakes are made. The public has to be kept informed every step of the way.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302521" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Conservatives are not naturally inclined to do that, despite all their protestations when they were in opposition and their promises during the last election to be accountable and transparent. We have seen almost no evidence of that. They break their word, they change their minds, and they refuse to disclose when the public needs to be told of an important public policy development. I do not need to go into the long list of issues on that front. We could talk about appointments to the Senate or about breaking their own law on fixed election dates. The list goes on and on. There are all kinds of issues related to the Conservatives' promises of transparency and accountability.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302522" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that kind of action on the part of the Conservatives cannot be allowed to continue, especially when it comes to something as important as human pathogens and toxins. We are talking about life-and-death situations. There is no room for that kind of culture of secrecy and arrogance to be continued for one second in this country today, especially on this critical issue.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302523" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, then, is public accountability and full transparency. </div>
</p><a name="Para1302524" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there has to be coordination. The right hand of government has to know what the left hand is doing. There has to be some semblance of a coordinated system within government to deal with the issues pertaining to human pathogens and toxins, partly because of the public health issue at stake here, but also because of the threat of bioterrorism.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302525" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have questions today pertaining to the legislation. Is the government any more prepared today than it was last fall with respect to the listeriosis crisis? Is it any more prepared today than when we had the SARS crisis? Is it any more prepared today than when we learned the tragic news of September 11? Do we have a coordinated, centralized shop within government that oversees this area? </div>
</p><a name="Para1302526" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think so. I am having a hard time finding it. I know the public safety department is sometimes responsible. Health Canada is sometimes responsible. There are pots of money here and pots of money there. There is a little bit of shifting here and there between government departments, but who is in charge? Where does the buck stop? Which minister is absolutely responsible?</div>
</p><a name="Para1302527" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very legitimate concern in the light of a couple of recent developments. In September 2008 the Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Defence found our response capabilities lacking. The Senate committee found that the federal government will not even tell local front-line responders where it stashes its emergency medical supplies. It will not tell them where they are located.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that when those who are responsible for delivering emergency services at the local level in Medicine Hat stumbled on a federal supply, the federal government, rather than using the opportunity to build coordination and efficiency, took the supplies and hid them somewhere else. Does that make sense? Is that responsible, accountable, fully transparent government action in the midst of a very serious situation? It certainly does not bode well for future crises that are likely to occur in this country.</div>

Is it not the job of government to put in place regulations and standards and laws and programs that the private sector must adhere to? Is it not the fundamental role of government to set the stage and to put in place the framework by which those who operate in the private sector are guided? How was it possible that through consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments we just let this system deteriorate to the point that nobody was in charge, the private sector was regulating itself, inspection capacity was greatly reduced, and standards based on a series of recommendations on paper were not on site?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Rather, there was simply a risk management model that said there might be a problem, that we were going to let business live up to these standards, that we were not going to inspect them regularly to make sure that they were, and that when it happened, we were going to duck and run. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the lesson. That is why this legislation is so important today and why we need more than simply the words of this bill before us.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a member of Parliament in Ontario, I will never forget the Walkerton scandal and the scenario that unfolded in front of us in the days of the Mike Harris government. I think the member might have been around in those days. That was as a result of, yes, some human failure but also the fact that over a number of months into the Mike Harris government there was a moving of oversight on the environmental front of laboratories to the private sector. There was also a reduction in the number of people working for the ministry of the environment which all came together to present to us a very tragic circumstance in which people lost their lives.</div>

Does she believe the government may continue to cut staff to the point where even the best of legislation and oversight will not actually be effective?</div>

I have said that the bill looks progressive and positive at face value and that I want to see it studied at committee. However, I also said that it is pretty hard to judge a government action on a very important issue by legislation alone. If the resources, staff and policies are not in place to protect Canadians, we have a serious problem and we need to continue to address it through the course of this legislative process. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a couple of examples of why I have such doubts. One of the Conservative government's first acts on taking power in 2006 was to eliminate the Public Health Agency minister and public health seat at the cabinet table. It took away the whole role at the cabinet table. It also left the Chief Medical Officer of Health responsible to the Minister of Health. According to the CMA journal, this left our country without a national independent voice to speak out on public health issues, including providing viable leadership during a crisis.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to watch for cutbacks and wonder if the government is taking some shortcuts in this area. I mentioned earlier that the government decided to convert to a system of increased food industry self-inspection, which has been widely speculated to have caused some of the problems we have seen with respect to salmonella, outbreaks of E. coli and listeriosis. We also should not forget that the Conservatives cut back the avian influenza preparedness program.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302553" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to mention that this area requires in-depth research and a constant injection of funds into research if we are ever going to understand the relationship between these pathogens and toxins in terms of human health. What did the government do in its last budget? It cut back on investments in health and research in the scientific communities, which is an ominous, worrisome response on the part of the government at a time when we need more investment, scientific understanding and coordination between the research communities and laboratories that work in these areas.</div>

We have all studied the Walkerton issue. My colleague from Sault Ste.

It was not just the result of two individuals not doing their job.

The government can be darn sure that we will not support the legislation if it continues to find bogeymen instead of looking in its own backyard to find the problems that exist. Why in the world is the government cutting back $42.7 million in this fiscal year, $52.9 million next year and $72.2 million more in 2011-12 from the Public Health Agency and Health Canada? </div>

The issue concerns the granting by this House of powers to the administration, not just to the government but to persons in the government. In this particular case, they are referred to in the bill as inspectors. It has to do with this whole concept of the House giving power in a statute to the government to make regulations and enforce provisions of the act that are regulatory, in addition to the statutory provisions.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern government, we all accept that we need to do that.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is okay for Parliament to pass a law that says a citizen shall not do X. That is not a delegation. That is a creation of an offence and authorities enforce those offences. However, when Parliament passes a law that gives the authority to a minister or the governor in council to make a regulation, to create some kind of a regulatory offence, that is a delegation. When we do that in Parliament we should take steps to ensure that the enforcement and execution of those powers happen within the law. Parliament has created a method for doing that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just for the purpose of preventing a breech of the act but for the purpose of ensuring compliance, the inspector may enter any place, any reasonable time.

There had better be a real good reason for this, to give all this power to a particular individual. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with some difficult chemicals here, some pathogens and toxins, but here are some of the things that inspectors could do. They can examine the place. They can require the person in the place to do things. They can seize and detain, open and examine, direct the owner or the person having possession, care or control, to do certain things, to move certain things. They can examine and make copies, require any person in the place to do the same, and the list goes on. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are significant powers. We should keep in mind the basis on which the inspector enters the premises. It is for the purpose, low threshold only, of verifying compliance. That would mean on a bad day, “I think I will go check these guys because I feel like it”. It could be that. I am not saying that it would be, but what if that is the case? “I will go into this place to check it because I want to verify compliance. I do not like the way they park their cars in the parking lot”, or maybe, “I do not like the owner”. This is the power that the act now gives, not by regulation, but by statute, right up front, to an inspector.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents, a family, father, wife, two teenage boys, 14 and 16, came back to Canada at Windsor. They had made some purchases in the U.S.A. and low-balled the amount of money, they underestimated the amount they spent, so they were invited to go to secondary for inspection. It was all pretty reasonable stuff. I have been sent to secondary for inspection. People there are a little bit officious, but they are just doing their job: “Stand up. Move over there. Do this.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a problem with subclause 42(3) which deals with the warrant and going into a dwelling house. It says that the inspector may not use force unless it is specifically authorized. The problem is that the use of force issue is too vague in the statute. It is not clear what extent of force is being referred to. If I have a warrant to enter a dwelling house, do I have the ability to turn the doorknob if that requires the use of force? Do I have the ability to break a window? Do I have the ability to lift the latch?</div>

It is reviewed for compliance with the law, the originating statute, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the criteria adopted by the House.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the great advances for humanity in recent years is that we do not simply talk about old age anymore, we now talk about very old age. As a human society, if we are prudent, if we do not drink too much, if we do not smoke, if we do a bit of physical activity, if we go to the gym regularly and if we pay attention to what we call health determinants, chances are good that we will live to be 100 or more. That is what we mean by very old age. We have met centenarians in our ridings. I could ask my colleagues how many of them have, in their activities as a member, met people older than 95 or 100. There are more and more of them. In Canada, it is said that there are more than 100,000 centenarians. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, when I look at you and see how healthy you are, that you will be a centenarian yourself, and I wish that for you.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a society in which there are more and more centenarians, in which people are living much longer and in better health, and this is thanks to research. It means we are able to control certain diseases that used to be crippling, and not all that long ago. Remember, just a few years or a few decades ago, mononucleosis was a fatal disease. Today, there are some differences, depending on the strain in question, but people do not die from mononucleosis. It has been called the kissing disease. Of course, I do not wish to get too autobiographical about it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Bouchard appointed his shadow cabinet, he gave me a very important responsibility: research and development. I told Mr. Bouchard that I was flattered. During the 1993 campaign, we were very concerned, as a political party, about the fact that there had been a lot of public investment in the national capital region, where several public laboratories were—and still are—located, and very little investment on the Outaouais side. There was a lot of investment in the national capital region, but even though research was being done, compared to the numbers for the Outaouais, there was a huge disparity. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois wants to make sure that this bill's worthy objectives result in all laboratories complying with human pathogen handling standards. We have been told that several thousand labs in Canada do not follow Health Canada's biosafety guidelines. The government wants to make the guidelines more coercive by introducing a licensing system. It wants to ensure that organizations conducting research will not be penalized. The bill's schedule differentiates between pathogens that can be very harmful to public safety and those that are less dangerous. We see that different classes of licences will be issued.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois would like to know what this means for research. I was a member of the Standing Committee on Health when we studied the bill to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. In the 1990s, John Manley was the minister responsible for that file: as minister of industry, he was responsible for research and development. The OECD had released a report that lambasted Canada for investing so little in research and development. The bill was introduced.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois had a number of concerns. We wanted to ensure that various funding organizations, such as the Medical Research Council of Canada, would continue to support us. In good years, Quebec received nearly 30% of the funding. We wanted to be sure that, under the new Canadian Institutes of Health Research, we would hold on to our share of research contracts.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Institutes of Health Research is a network of virtual institutes across Canada. Some of these institutes are concerned with population health, while others focus on cancer, aboriginal people, mental health and so on. The institutes are connected to each other in a structure that can produce interesting outcomes. Certainly, within these publicly funded research labs, research involving pathogens is being conducted. If the bill is passed, what will that mean? That is one question the Bloc Québécois has.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have questions about fines. As I said, we are told that biosafety guidelines already exist. In Canada—and I feel it is my duty to share these figures in the interest of full disclosure—there are 7,500 labs, nearly 4,000 of which allegedly do not comply with the guidelines. In addition, 5,500 labs, including 1,100 in Quebec, reportedly import pathogens. This comes as no surprise, considering how vibrant the research sector is in Quebec. There are apparently 24 labs in Quebec and 150 in Canada that are working with group 3 and 4 pathogens and are subject to these guidelines.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to sit on the Standing Committee on Health. That was a great time in my life. I was the health critic for at least five years.

But I learned about it, I took an interest in it, and I understood its importance. I then became the immigration critic. Immigration is an extremely important issue, and as I am a member from Montreal, it was an issue in my own community. After that, I was the health critic for five years.

I was very disappointed to learn something about the regulations for new reproductive technologies. We know that one in five couples in Canada is infertile. Therefore, it is important that the issues of surrogate mothers, gamete conservation and donations be covered by regulations. I am very surprised to see that the regulations we have been expecting for at least two years have not yet been submitted to the Standing Committee on Health.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many Canadians do not consider the flu to be a national threat, we need only remind ourselves of the 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, that spread to nearly every part of the world, including the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The Spanish flu did not claim simply those normally at risk, such as the elderly, infants and the infirm; in fact, it claimed the lives of normal, healthy adults, mostly because it tricked strong immune systems into a catastrophic overreaction. It is estimated that anywhere from 20 million to 100 million people were killed worldwide, roughly double the number of people killed during World War I. Indeed, many of those who survived the horror of trench warfare ironically succumbed to this deadly strain of influenza A, a form of bird flu. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the staff on Parliament Hill recall the extraordinary measures that were taken in 2001 following the anthrax attacks, when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several media outlets and the offices of two U.S. senators. This attack killed five people and infected 17 others. Anthrax is one of the oldest recorded diseases of grazing animals and is even believed to be the sixth plague mentioned in the book of Exodus. One can see I read religious books. It occurs in nature, but it also has been harnessed as a weapon of war. Sheep and cattle are especially vulnerable to anthrax spores because they are soil-borne and are inhaled or ingested while the animals graze.

It was stored as a weapon of mass destruction in the arsenals of the former Soviet Union, Great Britain and the United States until 1971. However, the 2001 anthrax attacks were classified as weaponized or weapons-grade strains of the spores. While that should have made it easier to identify the attacker, it was not until August 2008, seven years later, that the FBI identified the culprit as a scientist who worked at a government biodefence lab.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to be a member of the scrutiny of regulations committee, the standing joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate, for a number of years, and was its chair for a couple of years. What struck me was the regulatory guidelines and requirements, as laid out in certain pieces of legislation, tended to push the envelope with regard to a concern about what is called backdoor legislation. Backdoor legislation refers to providing undertakings or responsibilities in the regulations where that authority is not enabled by the legislation itself. It means putting something into the legislation that is not even part of the bill itself, simply covered under, “The minister may make regulations from time to time”.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302688" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the regulations are required by a bill, the bill in the end will not show that it comes into force on receiving royal assent, but will be at a date specified by order-in-council, which is by cabinet. The reason for that is so the regulations necessary and called for under the legislation can be properly drafted, reviewed and gazetted et cetera prior to their enforcement.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some concern when we get to matters like this. We have seen far too many examples of where regulations have not been prepared on a timely basis. It represents a reluctance by the government to have legislation come into force. It may just simply be, here is a bill that will do all these wonderful things and it will be the law in Canada when the regulations are done.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was the reproductive technologies act that I was involved with through the health committee. This dealt with the whole question of embryonic stem cell research and the establishment of a committee that would review the application of researchers to do research involving embryonic stem cells. </div>
</p><a name="Para1302692" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the officials told us in committee that the regulations required to make this happen would take something like two years, yet the government said that we needed it, that it was pursuant to a royal commission report on the reproductive technologies. It was urgent and had some very significant recommendations, but much of the legislation from years gone by is still not in place. One of the reasons for that was we put into the legislation that the minister was required to submit the proposed regulations to the committee for its comments. The minister of the day refused to give the committee the authority to amend or to reject regulations. They were simply there for review and comment.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302693" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to that legislation, and it is years now after the royal commission report, which was about 15 years ago, we now have a situation where regulations pursuant to that legislation, which was passed at all stages in this place and in the other place, still are not the law in Canada. In fact, the committee to establish it has not been established and all the regulations related to the research permissions or authorizations are not in place.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that Parliament as a whole, along with the Senate, passed urgent legislation, the law has not been totally put into force because regulations have not been promulgated, which totally frustrates the responsibilities of Parliament to do its job.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is a good example of a situation where legislation has gone through all stages, with two or three months of comprehensive committee hearings, and it is still not fully in force primarily due to regulations and the fact that the government has not even come forward with them.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of whether the regulations were a problem. As the members well know, when we deal with legislation in this place we do not get to see the regulations. We do not get to see those fine-tuning items that give us an idea of the scope or the intent of the legislation. There is a fine line at which a regulation will go beyond what was enabled in the legislation.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise that because it leads to the whole question of whether we have backdoor legislation where regulations are trying to do things that were not enabled in the legislation and whether the proviso that there be regulations made, which the government chooses not to make, could delay or even stop legislation that goes through the entire parliamentary process from ever becoming law in Canada.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Canadians keep ahead of the curve when they do not know whether legislation that is passed in Parliament will become law. We have far too many examples. It goes to the true question of accountability and transparency.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things the current government did was bring in the Federal Accountability Act. It puffed its chest and said that it would be accountable. When I first looked at it I thought that people should understand what the expectation was from accountability. I was looking at some of this material on the weekend and I came up with a definition that I challenge the government to follow. The definition of accountability is to explain and justify one's actions or decisions in a clear, concise and truthful manner. To synthesize this down, it means to be honest and give the straight story. I want to understand and I want to understand why the government took that decision.</div>
</p><a name="Para1302701" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a government promises to do something and it does not do it, accountability demands that it explains and justifies that decision. Sometimes we make decisions to do things but circumstances change and it is important to back off and rethink the decisions. There is no point in going forward with something that changes because there is new information. However, when I think of some of the examples, such as promising not to tax income trusts but imposing a 31.5% tax one year later, really did not do much for the government, which boasted that it was helping seniors by introducing things like pension income splitting when it knew that over 85% of seniors would not benefit from it simply because they were in the lowest tax bracket, did not have eligible pensions or were seniors who had no one to split with.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we take it to that extent, when the government claims that it represents 100% of a group and then does something for a group that only 14% or 15% actually can benefit from, that is not being accountable. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Motors and Chrysler presented plans to the government on Friday, requesting substantial funding and plans for reorganization that will touch the constituencies of many members in the House. The industry tells us that sales are down 23% over one year, 15% in December alone, and production is down 50%. In fact, 250 to 300 dealerships may be closing their doors. General Motors has indicated that it will be forced to reduce its Canadian workforce to 7,000 employees by 2010, a dramatic change from its 20,000 employees in 2005. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Statistics Canada released figures indicating that the decline in the auto sector led to the significant decline in retail sales in December. Retail sales were down 5.4% in December to $33 billion, the largest monthly decline in over 15 years. Clearly, this is an issue that requires the urgent consideration of the House. I think it is imperative that we have an opportunity to have that debate today. Thousands of jobs have already been lost. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we are making additional investments in our Coast Guard with respect to capital and supports to ensure that we are in a position to do that. With respect to environmental enforcement, the government has included substantial increases in the number of environmental enforcement officers in the last two budgets, so we have more boots on the ground. Some 110 new environmental enforcement officers are being trained over two or three years. Coincidentally, they are trained at Algonquin College in the great riding of Ottawa West—Nepean and then they fan out right across the country. They do a great job. That started a good number of years ago before I arrived in this place. There is also a significant desire to work with northerners to ensure that we promote that sovereignty.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would I say that? I do not think there is a Canadian in the country who would not agree that we should extend our sovereignty over waters that we have traditionally considered to be our own. As the minister says, these are part of waters that we have thought to be our internal waters. They are part of the Arctic Archipelago and therefore they are Canadian territory.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the part that goes beyond that, and think about this for a moment, we are, with a stroke of the pen, reasserting what we have already agreed with all our partners in the United Nations, and that is this is our territory, it is our right to extend our jurisdiction to the full 200 kilometres. That is great. We want to do that. It is good for us. We expect that as part of Canadian sovereignty we would give notice to the entire world that these waters are now our waters.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so you know, Mr. Speaker, because I know you come from that province, this is equal to the entire land mass of Saskatchewan that we are, with this bill, advertising to the world is now territory water, aquatic territory, over which the Canadian government, the state of Canada, will now exercise its jurisdiction.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303048" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know members have read the bill in great detail. It is about 10 lines long, yet it generated from the minister a speech of about 15 minutes. My compliments to him. I listened through it all, hoping to hear something more than “looking at”. I think the minister, perhaps to his credit but certainly to the advantage of his party, indicated that the government was looking at a whole stream of things that would be made possible with the passage of the legislation.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303049" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be delighted to help him along. In the process, however, we would want to ask a few questions. He talked about four pillars upon which the legislation would be based. I was looking, for example, at the mechanisms, the processes, the moneys, the resources that he and the government would be putting in place in order to, first, effectively exercise the jurisdiction which we are claiming as is our right under the Conventions of the UN over this entire territory.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303050" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, how many more ships are we prepared to buy, to lease, to engage in protecting the territory that, as I said a moment ago, is the size of the province of Saskatchewan, which is bigger than almost every other country in the world, save maybe the top 10?</div>
</p><a name="Para1303051" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not to have more ships in aquatic territory, how does the minister expect Canadians to feel assured that they will exercise greater sovereignty over this great expanse of further territory? It is not that Canadians do not want to, because we do. We have already established that we feel it is our right, it is part of our territory, and we do want to protect it. We want to exercise sovereignty over it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to, as well, as the minister suggested, ensure that there is greater security. For that, aside from the satellite beams that we will be engaging to help us track where ships might be, because I think we are talking about ships in aquatic territory, we are not really talking about tanks, we are not talking about land rovers, we are not talking about boots on the ground, as he mentioned, we are also talking about ocean-going vessels, whether they are below surface or above surface. However, there is no indication that resources will be put at the disposal of the Canadian government and its enforcement agencies to ensure they can do the job that the bill would have them do. Otherwise it is meaningless.</div>

In fact, we have always said they have been our own. However, they extend to countries like Norway, Russia, Denmark, Greenland and the United States. They all have competing claims, competing interests and overlapping concerns about the environment and about pollution.

He would show us the vessels that we would engage, the satellites in which we would invest and the additional marines, RCMP or soldiers that we would engage in the area.

At the same time, the federal government under the Chrétien Liberals cut back on many of the weather services that were essential to keeping these airports safe and reliable for the transport of goods and people.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, our party is going to support this legislation, but it feels like a bad movie. We are talking about the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which means that if there is a risk of polluting arctic waters it is because there are marine transportation activities going on. And if there are such activities going on, it is because the ice has disappeared. And if the ice has disappeared, it is of course because the temperature is rising.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303100" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the record to show this, because I would not want our children and grandchildren, some day, to blame me for having addressed this legislation. We must adopt these measures, at last, because the current Conservative government and the previous Liberal and Conservative governments did not do what they had to do. That is why we are now facing global warming and a totally new situation in the Arctic. We must bring in regulations and we must protect that territory, because an increasing number of ships will navigate these waters and there will be development potential.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303101" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me shudder to hear this, because they want to develop, they want to get that gas and that oil, but we are talking about the world's last reserves. Given the way the Conservatives are managing, some day our planet will disappear, and the reason for that will be obvious. </div>
</p><a name="Para1303102" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, given that the retreating polar ice is creating new waterways, we must consider that Canada has a legitimate right to establish its sovereignty over arctic waters. Considering that this will be a new development channel and that a number of countries share the territory around the North Pole, discussions are indeed to be expected. </div>
</p><a name="Para1303103" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By extending the limit of its internal waters from 100 to 200 nautical miles, Canada will have better control over marine traffic in its waters and over the management of the natural resources in those waters. So, the fact that the ice is melting creates a whole new potential for development. Consequently, it is only normal that neighbouring countries want to look after their geographic protection and, of course, their nationality and their sovereignty. A sovereignist party cannot be opposed to the idea that Canada would protect its sovereignty. On the contrary, we are hoping to achieve our own sovereignty in Quebec and, therefore, we cannot object to Canada wanting to do the same. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, in terms of Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic, we are saying that any future action in this region must reflect certain basic principles, which I will outline. </div>
</p><a name="Para1303105" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, any exploitation of northern resources must be closely monitored and regulated so that the region will not be exposed to uncontrolled exploitation of its resources. Obviously, it would be ineffective to only deal with the prevention of pollution in Arctic waters.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303106" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois members are proud to rise every day in this House to defend the interests of Quebeckers. Given that a part of Quebec is in the north, we feel it is important that any exploitation respect ecological development because, once again, if we trigger one disaster after another, we will not fix anything. We must make sure that development is done in such a way that the environment is respected.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303107" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second basic principle is that any border disputes must be resolved peacefully, diplomatically and by respecting international law. Expanding Canada's rights from 100 to 200 nautical miles is obviously consistent with international law. We hope that these issues will be peacefully and diplomatically respected so that we can negotiate with other countries, since this is not a given in this geopolitical situation. The question of the north pole and the entire Arctic territory is not a given either.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303108" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third basic principle is that we must fight climate change, which is a huge source of the Arctic's problems. We must also adequately protect our extremely fragile ecosystems. Yet, that is not what the Conservatives have been saying. Obviously, I have been told that it is a bill to prevent pollution. It is true, we cannot fix everything that has already happened. </div>

</p><a name="Para1303110" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate should be restored, and there should be more ice in the Arctic. Quite simply, we need to work very hard to restore the ice that used to be there. If we want to extract oil, then we need to find ways to transport it other than by ship. There are other ways. We need to do everything we can to make sure the north pole and the Arctic get colder again and the ice returns, especially so that the animal populations can survive. The people who live in the Arctic and have always lived in a cold climate are not happy about what is happening. I have seen a lot of reports, but I have not seen anyone who is glad the ice is melting. When a people has always lived with ice, it does not take any pleasure in seeing that ice disappear.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303111" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the minister is saying today that there is going to be development and people are going to have work, I do not think that the goal of these communities is to work for oil companies, even though that is where things are headed. I think they would rather live as they used to live.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303112" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth basic principle is as follows: any action in the Arctic must take into account the people who live there. That is what we say. It is all well and good to try to turn people into oil people, but if that is not what they are interested in or what they want, then we need to do everything we can to put them at ease. They are the people who have lived in this area. If Canada is entitled to claim international rights today, it is because communities have lived in this part of the world, which comes under our jurisdiction. It comes under Canada's jurisdiction now. We have to be able to live in harmony and choose to defend these people and consider what they want.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois denounces and will always denounce any militarization of the north and any military operation that could take place there, whether naval or otherwise. We would like to move away from that and instead chose another way to ensure sovereignty. It must serve as an example for the entire world. One cannot go all over the world trying to resolve conflicts and then turn around and start one in the north because of an interest in oil. There are enough wars in the world caused by oil, and I hope we do not create one here ourselves because we are trying to protect a certain area.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ice melts, Canada's sovereignty in that region will come into question. That is one of main reasons why legislation is passed. As I said earlier, the ice is melting. The problem is that, instead of doubling its efforts to fight climate change, the government is doubling its efforts to encourage economic development in the Arctic. As I said at the beginning, everyone here in the House of Commons has a part in this bad movie. No one should be in this movie at all, but once again, the Conservatives are leading and this is how they lead.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must therefore work with other Arctic states within the framework of the Arctic Council. There is a council of all the sovereign states that border on this area. The purpose of the council is to protect the environment and ensure sustainable development. Clearly, it needs to be more proactive when it comes to sustainable development and protecting the environment.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the objective is to increase the outer limit from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles from the nearest Canadian land. Increasing this limit will ensure that the waters within that limit are recognized as internal waters, and not as international waters or as an exclusive economic zone. These 200 nautical miles are very much a reality, as is Canada's authority over that area. International waters used to be outside the 100 nautical mile limit. Now, international waters will be outside the 200 nautical mile limit.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Arctic waters were considered to be an impenetrable ice barrier for human beings. That is why I said earlier that this is like being in a bad movie. It was a frozen desert where nothing happened. Of course, climate change has changed all that now. The Arctic is particularly affected by global warming.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that a rise of 1<sup>o</sup>C or 2<sup>o</sup>C along the Equator, could result in a rise of more than 6<sup>o</sup>C in the Arctic.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact remains that climate change will have a serious environmental impact on the Arctic. The climate in that region is warming up more rapidly, which triggers even more drastic changes, such as a change of vegetation zone and a change in the diversity, range and distribution of animal species. For example, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of polar bears drowning, because the distance between ice floes is constantly increasing.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are scientific facts but those listening to us have an opportunity to see it all regularly on television reports. A multitude of filmmakers have focused on this issue and filmed the havoc caused by global warming. Climate change will also cause the disruption and destabilization of transportation, buildings and infrastructure in the North. For the Inuit and other people living there, everything is changing. They used to travel by snowmobile but now they may have to add wheels. That may be the reality. We can laugh about it but it is enough to make you cry. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change has a major impact on the lifestyle of aboriginal peoples.

Since 1960, the surface area of the permanent ice pack has decreased by 14%, with a 6% reduction since 1978. The ice pack has thinned by 42% since 1958.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute over Arctic sovereignty centres on the Northwest Passage and the navigable waters in the Arctic archipelago. The dispute between Canada and the United States is one of international law, namely, how to define the waters surrounding the Arctic archipelago. Canadian sovereignty over the islands is recognized and not contested. For Canada, the islands constitute an extension of its continental shelf. Thus, Canada considers the various straits between islands as “internal waters”. Therefore, the 200 nautical mile limit applies to the contour of the islands.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle over jurisdiction is understandable. The United States has never recognized these waters as Canada's “internal waters” and deems that they constitute only an “exclusive economic zone”. In January 2009, former U.S. President George W.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have to focus on negotiation and diplomacy. There is no point sending navy ships to assert sovereignty over Arctic waters.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines “internal waters” as follows: “—waters on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the State”. According to the convention, a coastal state has the right to take the necessary steps “—to prevent any breach of the conditions to which admission of those ships to internal waters [...] is subject”. In other words, coastal states have sole jurisdiction over their internal waters. They have every right to prevent foreign vessels from entering their waters.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303131" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal was to increase the boundary from 100 miles to 200, particularly around the Arctic islands, to give Canada complete control over all vessels navigating those waters. However, in article 55, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines the “exclusive economic zone” as “—an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea—”, and that is how the United States interprets it. Article 58 reads as follows: “In the exclusive economic zone, all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy [...] the freedoms [...] of navigation and overflight and of the laying of submarine cables and pipelines—”. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea included provisions for pipelines and that kind of thing. So it should come as no surprise that the United States prefers article 58 and thinks of these areas as economic zones rather than interior waters. States are entitled to restrict marine traffic in, to charge fees for access to, or to prevent entry into their interior waters. In respect of fossil fuel exploitation, I do not want to repeat what I have already said, but as we all know, transportation of fossil fuels is at the root of wars going on in many parts of the world.

Again, we should all be discussing a lowering of the temperature in the Arctic, so as to ensure a larger ice pack in that region, but instead we are talking about economic development and marine traffic.

Of course preventing pollution in the far north makes the government look good. On the other hand, the result will be an increase in economic activity with its polluting effect.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not from the north, but I try to follow these fisheries issues as closely as I can. There was an announcement that a deep water port was going to be built somewhere on Baffin Island and there were going to be some repairs and improvements. I will correct myself. It was not repairs and improvements but the actual construction of a port. A lot of the places like Pond Inlet do not have ports at all. The announcement was about a deep water port. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is a strong fisheries industry in the Arctic. Right now it is mainly being prosecuted by foreigners and other Canadian interests from the southern provinces, Newfoundland in particular. The catches I believe are landed in Greenland for packaging and processing for shipment to the southern markets. That all should be done on Canadian soil. I believe there is a strong argument for a deep water port. There was an announcement the officials were looking at Pangnirtung, but again that is another announcement I hope does come about. The area has tremendous potential and some of the methodologies used by the local ice fishermen are certainly very environmentally sensitive. I am hoping, as part of this northern strategy or development, that this will be looked at. Again, it is time to stop talking and let us get on and do something. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area which is most effected by the climate change problem is the northern territory of Canada. With the visit last week of President Obama I become very cynical.

Excuse me, why was that not told to the House over the last three years? Why were we not informed of that fact? Here we are three or four years later and we are going to start a dialogue. We cannot fault President Obama because he has only been elected for a couple of weeks, but again the Canadian public is becoming cynical.

Again, it is pretty meaningless if it is not accompanied by real concrete action, a plan as to how these environmental issues are going to be enforced.

What does this mean? It means that access to natural resources in that region will be made increasingly easier. I am thinking for instance of the oil and gas resources located under the ice. According to a study by the U.S. Ecological Survey, it is estimated that the fifth largest undiscovered oil and gas reserve in the world is under the Arctic ice. No less than 90 billion barrels of oil may be hidden under the ice pack in the north. It could meet the world demand for oil over the next three years, at a rate of 86 million barrels per day. What we have under this melting ice pack is a natural resource, an important oil resource that is the equivalent of the total reserves of Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Mexico put together. Natural resources, and more specifically oil and gas resources, are synonymous with development and exploration. We are talking about 90 billion barrels of oil and 47,260 billion cubic metres of natural gas. One third of all known world reserves of gas are under the Arctic ice. What does this mean? It means that in the coming years we will see promoters interested in developing this natural resource. It is no surprise that the presence of natural resources always triggers development, exploration and economic development activities. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in recent months and particularly in 2007, this route between Europe and Asia has allowed companies like Exxon to successfully bid $50 million to begin exploration in the Beaufort Sea and, in 2008, allowed BP to bid for an operating interest in the Beaufort Sea. For what purpose? To be able to explore for oil in that area and develop this resource.</div>

I am not against Canada claiming greater sovereignty over the north. But let us not be blind to the reality that Canada seeks to retain ownership of these natural resources to maintain this oil dependency and continue exploiting resources and fossil fuels that pollute, instead of turning to renewable energy. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government ought to be embarrassed to put forward this bill on the pretext of preventing Arctic waters from being polluted. It should be embarrassed because Canada's record with respect to environmental protection in the north is rather disappointing. As I said earlier, the north has always been a territory much used by military organizations in particular. We will recall that, during World War II, more than 60 radar installations were built at 27 sites north of the 69th parallel to assess the Soviet threat. These radar stations later changed hands. Those under U.S. authority were transferred to Canada in the mid-1950s, in exchange for $100 million worth of military equipment and a commitment to decontaminate these northern sites.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation today? In 1995, the Liberal government of the day introduced a decontamination program that was supposed to ensure that the soil in these areas would be decontaminated. However, a few years later—and this is where we see that the Liberal's environment record is no better than the Conservative's record—the internal auditor at Canada's Department of National Defence released an evaluation of these sites. And what did the internal auditor say? He said that the overall cost of the decontamination program had increased significantly, from $322 million to $583 million. To quote the internal auditor: “Delayed application of government contracting policy...increased cost and raised questions regarding the openness and fairness of some contracting decisions—” That is an obvious lack of environmental responsibility on behalf of the Canadian government regarding territories north of the 69th parallel.</div>

According to the Director of the UQAM research group on military industry, Yves Bélanger, the Department of National Defence should test the land as soon as possible to see if the work was as badly botched as the project management was.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, therefore, an environmental issue here. There is an energy issue, as I said, because there are a lot of natural resources, one-third of the world’s proven gas reserves. There is also an economic issue, related among other things to the sea passage. There is an opportunity here for the big shipowners of the world to save time and kilometres. Ultimately, that means a cost reduction for them. China increasingly wants to use marine transport and big containers to ship its goods. The distance between Tokyo and London by what is called the Arctic route that is expected to develop is 14,000 kilometres, while the southern route, that is the current route between Tokyo and London, is 21,000 kilometres.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was given the opportunity to talk about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3628791,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3628791&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>, I was pleased to take part in the debate. Let me tell you why. I have been my party's defence critic since 2000. Before that, I was Indian affairs and northern development critic. Naturally, I went to the far north a number of times. I would like to tell you a funny story. Before leaving for the far north, I was still in Saint-Jean, and I asked my assistants what I should wear up there. They told me to dress as I would in Montreal. So I headed off with a suit and a little raincoat.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got off the plane, the thermometer said it was -30<sup>o</sup>C. I had to find a store where I could buy some more appropriate clothing in a hurry. I did not look at all like a northerner. I looked like a southerner in the far north for the first time—which is what I was. So I went around the town of Iqaluit, where I met people and asked them what their lives were like, if things were still as tough as they used to be. I saw that there was a huge problem with the price of food. People there pay twice as much for their food and they earn half as much as people here. It is no wonder they have trouble making ends meet.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303269" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very important for me to discover the far north. I discovered it the hard way. We noted that there was a certain degree of solidarity in the Inuit villages. I also noticed that there was a municipal form of government. It was not like Indian Affairs or aboriginal nations that operate based on a tribal council. Inuit villages were governed like municipalities. I was invited by the mayor of Iqaluit to speak with the mayor and councillors. I learned a great deal about the dangers facing the far north.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303270" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dangers threaten the far north. People are just now becoming interested in it because, as usual, the financial aspect takes priority and people realize there are riches to be had there. No one cared about it before. There was, however, one circumpolar meeting held every year or two, at which “nordicity”, that was the term used at the time, was explored. Now, we go even further than “nordicity”. How is it that the passage continues to open up and that we will soon be able to go through it all year round? This has not only economic, but also environmental repercussions. My hon. colleagues have talked about this. As Canadians and Quebeckers, we absolutely must try to regulate that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the House that there are now new territories in the far north. I had the opportunity to attend the creation of Nunavut in 2000. As part of the ceremony, there was a toast with a small glass of northern water. This gave me a new perspective on things because, normally, when we toast, it is not with water, but with something that looks similar but tastes much stronger. That ritual was intended to express the purity of the far north. Thus, I attended the creation of Nunavut.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303272" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also became very involved in Nunavik, in Quebec. One must not think that today's debate is uniquely Canadian. It is also a Quebec debate. I would even say it is an international debate. In 2000, I began attending Canada-NATO meetings.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just come back from a meeting in Brussels where the far north was a hot topic. We are not the only ones who are realizing that commercial vessel traffic will be revolutionized by the opening of the Northwest Passage. The whole world knows it. In a minute I will talk about the different distances and tell you how many kilometres shipowners will save by sending their ships through the Northwest Passage. They can save tens of thousands of kilometres, which is huge.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303274" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the national defence critic, I have visited the far north, mainly because many things in the far north have to do with the military. The Bloc has some concerns on that front. We do not want to see the Arctic militarized. We would like this to be negotiated, and we would like international legislation to be applied.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303275" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is certainly not to build warships to stake our claim in the far north. I have a great deal of respect for the Canadian navy, but if we ever tangled with the American or Russian navy, it would not be long before Canada's navy was at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. This is really not the answer. We have to find another way. We even think that the coast guard is likely better placed to patrol and assert Canada's sovereignty.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303276" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the military in the far north is still important. Now, for this government, it is clear that this is coming. The government is making no effort to try to address this fundamental issue. It is all well and good for the far north to open to vessel traffic for economic reasons, but this affects not only the people, but the Arctic flora and fauna. For example, there is now a higher rate of drowning among polar bears. They were used to swimming from one island to another, but the islands are farther apart now because the water level has risen. That also has an impact on the whole Inuit food chain, which is something we must never forget. </div>
</p><a name="Para1303277" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government doing to address this issue? It is facing facts, realizing that the passage is opening and wondering how to go about defending our national interests. Consequently, there is a problem, and in my opinion, this problem should be solved in another way. We need to think about what greenhouse gas restrictions we should be adopting so as to keep the Arctic intact and not despoil it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot let economic concerns override environmental concerns. More and more people admit this and understand that if we push the economic side of things and ignore the environmental aspect, future generations will inherit a tainted and squandered planet. Even if they were billionaires, they would not be happy living on this planet if we let things go.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303279" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves these questions. Why is the government not trying to fix the greenhouse gas issue? Why is it not trying to fix it with absolute measures instead of intensity measures? The government is saying that it will ensure that for every barrel of oil produced, there will be a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases. However, if oil companies are allowed to produce 10 times the barrels, we will not make any progress and things will be worse.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303280" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is defending the issue of greenhouse gases and absolute measures. That is how the issue will be resolved and greenhouse gases will be reduced instead of increasing. Nothing will be fixed by simply saying that greenhouse gases will be reduced by 20% for each barrel of oil produced, when 10 times as many barrels will be produced. The problem will still be there. That is the environmental aspect.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to the military aspect, which must also be considered. I have been to the DEW line. It is a line of radar stations that stretches from Labrador to Alaska, passing through the Yukon and the rest. There are perhaps 70 radar stations, established to study the far north and watch for a Russian bomber attack.</div>
</p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1303282" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, this line was extremely important. In the 1950s the Americans and the Canadians agreed to build that network. At the time only bomber planes could carry atomic weapons into the U.S. territory, or anywhere in America, Canada or Mexico. A network was needed to watch for these aircraft. Now, this line is somewhat obsolete, because there is no defence against intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Americans claim to have one, but that remains to be seen. There is no question that if they were the target of a massive attack, they could not stop them all. But at the time, it was important. I went to Hall Beach in the Arctic, on the DEW line. I chartered a plane and I visited about ten radar stations. I saw the environmental catastrophe that was created there in the 1950s and that has still not been dealt with. I think my colleague referred to it earlier, when he said that the federal government had increased its contribution for the cleanup from $300 million to $500 million, but it will have to increase it again, because at Hall Beach it is truly a catastrophe. I am not talking about a catastrophe merely because it is ugly, but because it is polluting and it is even contaminating the whole Inuit food chain. Whales are suffering and have many diseases. Birds, seals, all the Arctic flora and fauna are being contaminated, because there was a lack of control at the time.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303283" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back then, they would use a barrel of contaminants and if that barrel was half empty, they would empty it on the spot and leave it there. We now realize it was a terrible mistake. There are health problems, not only affecting the flora and fauna, but also the Inuit themselves who traditionally feed on these animals, on this wildlife. So, there is a major problem with the DEW line and I think it is far from over. We will have to invest a lot more money to correct the situation. Sometimes I wonder if it is not too late.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303284" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also travelled to Alert, which is the Canadian Forces' northernmost base. We can understand that there is a reasonable military presence. However, if the Conservative government's strategy is to arm ourselves even more heavily, I think we will have a problem, as I explained earlier.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303285" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a military perspective, if one wants to take possession of a territory or establish sovereignty over that territory, human presence is always important. I think the far north is the subject of many studies. People want to know how to behave and affirm their presence. Many tactics are being considered right now.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303286" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Russian friends left a titanium case containing a Russian flag on the bottom of the ocean. That was kind of an old-fashioned approach. Long ago, nations planted flags to assert sovereignty over a territory. The Russians deposited a titanium case on the bottom of the ocean to lay their claim. </div>
</p><a name="Para1303287" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate is ongoing. Where do Canada's boundary waters lie? I think that when a country claims a given territory, as Canada has the Arctic, it has to implement a series of legislative measures or laws to secure that claim. That is what Bill C-3 does. It enlarges the protected area from 100 kilometres to 200. I think that is a good idea.</div>
</p><a name="Para1303288" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, there is no doubt the Americans consider Arctic waters to be international waters. Along with the Americans and the Russians, the Danes also want in on the act. A lot of northern countries are looking closely at what they can claim. That is why I am saying that we should rely on governance and diplomacy to resolve the fundamental issue. We need scientific studies, and we need international courts, such as the court in the Hague, to rule in case of dispute. As I said before, we cannot let this turn into a power struggle between nations or war in the far north. That would certainly be senseless.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have the Rangers, the Canadian Forces' arm in the far north. They patrol the region. I am planning to go on patrol with them. I might not cover as much ground as them because they are in great shape, and they are used to walking long distances and camping. I do not mind camping. I am sure they know how to make igloos, but I do not think they camp in them. I am looking forward to going with them because patrolling territory is a form of sovereignty assertion. That is why planes fly over the area. The Coast Guard has a presence in the far north. All of these elements support the government's claim to the Arctic. Our military presence is important, but it must not go too far. As I said, our military would not be able to hold off an American aircraft carrier or destroyer for long. Their military is much bigger than ours.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not look at other surveillance options as well? In terms of defence, satellites are being developed as an option. Thus, we could ensure accurate surveillance of vast areas in the far north. NORAD is using its satellites for that purpose. They now monitor shipping traffic and can guide their ships on their routes to some extent. They can communicate with them to say, “You are not on your planned route. You must stay on your planned sea route.” Thus, satellites are gaining in importance.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drones are another possibility. We do not need to use ships and we do not have to pay exorbitant amounts for fuel to patrol the far north. Some types of drones can patrol the area and provide appropriate surveillance. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had promised earlier that I would talk about distances. I have seen some very impressive distances. The route that will be used will save thousands and thousands of kilometres. For example, travelling from London to Yokohama, via Panama, is a trip of 23,300 kilometres. Using the Northwest Passage, the distance is 15,930 kilometres. If the trip is 10,000 kilometres shorter, shipowners and all marine traffic will save a lot of money. I believe that is the main focus. There is not enough concern about the environment. We ask ourselves how to save money. That is humanity's downfall. Greed often wins over concern for the environment. This has to be regulated.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, as other members have said, the Bloc Québécois will support the bill that is before us. As I mentioned earlier, it is a claim over a territory. If we can extend the protection zone to fight pollution, this legislation will show that we care about that region. Quebeckers also care about the north. Incidentally, the Inuits and the Quebec government have signed excellent agreements for the Nunavik. I think that, as Quebeckers, we too must monitor that part of the far north that is located on our territory. New intentions and interests are surfacing among the parties involved. There are people looking at the impact that this will have on their daily lives. Will all that is going on in the far north and all that has happened in the past have an impact on the food chain? How do we try to settle the issue once and for all?</div>

It is unfortunate that the government will not take the bull by the horns and say: “As for greenhouse gases, we will deal with this issue to save the far north.” However, should this become inevitable, we will have provided the solutions that we can see. We must not militarize the region. We must reach agreements at international forums to ensure that the far north is accessible to all and that Canada gets its fair share in that region and in the circumpolar regions. </div>

Occupying the territory is important. However, those of us who live in urban areas often find it difficult to understand people who live in outlying areas. You have to have gone there. You have to go to Gaspé to know that you will travel 50 to 70 km to have a coffee at a restaurant. In Montreal, when I am lost and I ask someone where a certain place is because I cannot find it, they tell me it is very far and that I should take a taxi because it is three blocks away.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic concept of occupying an area varies. In regions such as the far north, you have to work with the people who live there. People from the south do not fly there. They do not go there. Sometimes the Canadian army goes there for training exercises. It is trying to have a presence in the air, the water and the land. However, the exercise lasts two weeks and then the army returns to its base. We have to convince the inhabitants of the far north that occupying the area is important.</div>

We also have a northern area in Quebec. Just on the other side, a few hundred kilometres away, another territory begins, the Canadian territory, and we will always be neighbours, whether we like it or not.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed in the budget that the government has defined “clean energy” to include coal-fired and nuclear facilities. I think that is why the government is investing so much money into carbon capture and storage, the so-called carbon sequestration programs. It is because it still believes we can use dirty oil and coal and can continue to burn these fossil fuels, if only we can find a way to take the carbon dioxide that is emitted and somehow control it. I think this is misguided. </div>

It is with regard to EI premiums and Canadians who are finding themselves in a very difficult situation, having lost a job and having to look for some type of revenue to help support their family. In many cases, these people are the most vulnerable. These people are least apt to go a week or two without a paycheque, not that anybody can really go too long without a paycheque. When there is an interruption in household income over a period of time, it creates an incredible amount of stress on the family unit and we should do all we can to try to help these people who are in need.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a chance that this problem will even worsen as more and more Canadians find themselves, through no fault of their own, out of work. The January job statistics showed that 129,000 jobs were lost in this economy. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to this chamber eight years ago. At one time, it took four to five weeks to turn around an EI claim. It then drifted up to six weeks. Now it is even seven and eight weeks before somebody can receive benefits. That is very much of great concern.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day I posed the question in the House 10 weeks had passed from the time my constituent lost her job, filed for EI and was notified that she would receive benefits.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Canada says that it can turn the processes around in 28 days. However, the reality is if there is any kind of glitch or if there is anything out of the norm at all, a case has to go to a level 2 agent for review. That is where the delay is because there are not enough agents, or the workload is too great, or there are not enough resources within the department to deal with these claims. However, no Canadian worker should have to wait eight, nine, ten weeks for some type of assistance from the government.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an economic downturn, EI is the first line of defence. We recognize that it is a challenging time for many Canadian families.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Service Canada we have a high standard for service delivery.
