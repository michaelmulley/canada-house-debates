<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CUSTOMS TARIFF 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK19">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-11, an act 
respecting the imposition of duties of customs and other charges, 
to give effect to the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System, to provide relief 
against the imposition of certain duties of customs or other 
charges, to provide for other related matters and to amend or 
repeal certain acts in consequence thereof, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee. 
<A NAME="LINK20">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that

<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak 
to Bill C-11, an act to simplify and update Canada's tariff 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that during the second reading debate, 
widespread support was voiced for this legislation from both 
sides of the House.  I am pleased to report that support was also 
evident at committee.  Indeed, I believe that most members were 
of the view that while Bill C-11 is and might be low profile and 
somewhat technical, it nevertheless represents an important 
contribution to making Canada a more competitive player in world 
trade and will in fact help to maintain jobs in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, we heard during debate and in committee that 
trade is the economic lifeblood of Canada.  Clearly then, it is 
in our national interest to advance measures, such as Bill C-11, 
that simplify importing and enhance Canadian producers' ability 
to compete both at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that the customs tariff is a key component of 
Canada's import regime.  In my view it represents the nuts and 
bolts of import transactions undertaken by thousands of Canadian 
importers on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It not only classifies all goods that may be imported into 
Canada but also provides for applicable tariffs and import duty 
relieving measures to assist Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, despite going largely unnoticed by the general 
public, the customs tariff touches on the daily economic 
activities of millions of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thus important that we take every effort as we are doing 
with Bill C-11 to ensure that the tariff is as efficient and as 
up to date as possible.  Anything less would in fact entail an 
unnecessary burden to Canadian industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Canadian industry has played an 
integral role in developing this legislation. Since 1994 when 
this initiative was launched, extensive and detailed 
consultations have been undertaken with interested parties 
regarding the proposals contained in Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, to facilitate input and to help secure consensus, the 
government has disseminated the proposals as broadly as possible. 
In fact, each of the proposals to change the existing customs 
tariff has been published in the Canada <I>Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, letters were sent to all known interested parties 
and in March 1996, when a draft of the proposed new simplified 
customs tariff was made public, it was placed on the Internet and 
on Revenue Canada's electronic bulletin board. To go further, 
advertisements were placed in some of Canada's leading newspapers 
inviting comments from both industry and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the importing and manufacturing communities 
strongly support the changes embodied in this bill.  They 
particularly support the measures for greater simplicity, for 
transparency and predictability, all of which should help to 
improve the competitiveness of Canadian industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, industry unanimously endorses the implementation of 
the new simplified customs tariff on January 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up the virtues of this bill, let me use the words of the 
hon. member for Calgary South rather than my own. As he 
eloquently put it during the second reading debate, the 
cumulative effect is a more predictable, simplified tariff 
legislation with less regulatory burden and increased competitive 
strength.  Very eloquently put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, this view was confirmed during the hearings of 
Bill C-11 in the House standing committee on industry.  Clearly 
the witnesses from the manufacturing and importing associations 
welcomed the benefits of this bill, especially with respect to 
the positive effects the legislation will have on their 
competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particular mention was made of the duty reductions on a wide 
range of inputs used in the manufacturing processes.  They also 
welcome the streamlining of the existing tariff system to 
facilitate the importation of goods into Canada and to reduce 
compliance and administrative costs for business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did hear some concerns.  I first wish to address a concern 
that was raised on a policy issue relating to the tariff on auto 
parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, some witnesses objected to the inclusion in the 
tariff schedule to Bill C-11 of the provision that continues duty 
free status for auto parts used by non-auto pact producers as 
inputs in assembling motor vehicles in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose behind this measure being continued in Bill C-11 is 
to maintain a uniform manufacturing environment for all auto 
assemblers in Canada. 
The continuation of a zero tariff on auto parts is consistent 
with this objective.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 ensures that Canada will continue to be an attractive 
place for automotive investment by maintaining a level playing 
field for auto manufacturing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that this bill contains a number of 
measures that all participants in the auto industry will benefit 
from. They include the unconditional duty free provisions 
covering all production machinery, precision instruments and 
apparatus, as well as all materials for manufacturing vehicles, 
parts and accessories.  That is the one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a few minutes to address concerns that have 
been expressed by some in the importing community that there may 
not be enough time to prepare themselves fully for the scheduled 
January 1, 1998 implementation date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada and Statistics Canada appreciate that there is a 
large change over in data that must be installed in importing 
systems in order to be ready for the new tariff.  That is why 
since April of this year there has been an ongoing outreach 
campaign by the department of revenue to assist in these 
necessary preparations by providing the data required to update 
these systems.  The efforts are continuing with the issuance two 
weeks ago of the printed departmental version of the 1998 tariff. 
Updated customs notices are also being issued which taken 
together with other initiatives are aimed at ensuring that 
importers will have all the necessary information in their hands 
prior to the January 1 implementation date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second concern has been expressed in that in view of the 
timelines for introducing the new tariff, Revenue Canada should 
exercise administrative tolerance for the first six months of 
1998 and in fact waive any penalties for submitting incorrect 
statistical information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that Revenue Canada has discussed these issues with 
the importing community and is prepared to show flexibility 
provided that importers make their best efforts to apply the new 
tariff correctly.  Furthermore, Revenue Canada is prepared to 
assist those who need help to identify the proper statistical 
information to do so before goods are imported into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has every confidence that the new simplified 
customs tariff represents a positive change for the importing 
community. For its part, the importing community looks forward to 
the benefits the bill will confer, benefits including some $90 
million in duty reductions in 1998.  Importers are also looking 
forward to having less red tape associated with their import 
transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all issues that not only the importing community has 
made reference to, but the business community at large. This is 
an area where the government has taken a step forward in reducing 
the regulatory burden and easing the administrative burden that 
small businesses and businesses in general face.  That goes 
forward on the competitive issue in allowing our Canadian 
companies to compete both domestically and internationally on a 
more level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while there is an effort required to adapt to the 
new tariff, it is certainly well worth it. We have seen support 
from both sides of the House during second reading debate as well 
as in committee.  Certainly it is a widely held view in the House 
and in industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to pass Bill C-11 quickly.  The faster 
Parliament passes this legislation, the more confident the 
business community will be that its efforts to adapt to the new 
tariff will not be in vain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-11 today.  I want to 
indicate that the Reform Party is supportive of the bill. Largely 
this is a bill which simplifies and harmonizes Canadian customs 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill landed on my desk for me to critique it on behalf 
of my party I thought we were getting a case of bills, but in 
fact it was only one.  It was a foot and a half thick.  Canada is 
simplifying and clarifying our customs codes.  We are taking it 
down from 11,000 to 8,000 codes.  We still have 8,000 tariff 
lines for import duties into Canada.  We can do even better than 
that and I hope we can in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative came from industry.  It wanted government to 
clean up some of these areas of customs tariffs.  The free trade 
agreement negotiated some 10 years ago with the United States was 
one of the prime motivators to phase out tariffs.  The tariffs 
between Canada and the United States had been phased out except 
in a couple of areas like supply management and textiles, that 
type of area.  In response to that we were able to clean up a lot 
of customs lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports this bill because we are supportive of 
free trade in general.  We would even go further.  We want to 
have further trade liberalization and we believe that the only 
protection Canadian industry really deserves and needs is 
protection from exporters from other countries that are selling 
product in this country that is subsidized or protected by tariff 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel we can compete head on on the basis of production with 
the best in the world. Industry in general is starting to 
recognize this.  Companies such as Teleglobe have been 
privatized.  They are saying we should open up investment because 
they want to be able to compete with the best in the world. There 
is a big market outside of Canada and if we want to do that, if 
we want to have trade liberalization in other countries we have 
to provide that at home as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means we should move to a freer trade environment 
worldwide.  We have good networks in place.  We have good trade 
agreements.  We must move further to keep this bicycle rolling 
down the road.  We must move further to try to reduce tariffs and 
subsidies in countries such as those in Europe.  By doing so I 
believe we will be able to reduce our tariff activity in Canada, 
our import tariff regime, even further than the 8,000 tariff 
lines we have for the protection of industry. That will mean 
industries that compete on the basis of production will compete 
head on worldwide in that new world out there.  They have to be 
competitive as well.  If they cannot be competitive, they 
probably do not deserve the support of Canada's government in 
providing tariff protection for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis I would have to say that although Revenue Canada 
raises about $3 billion a year on tariffs, there is a very large 
bureaucracy that has to administer that tariff structure.  We 
hear of Canadian government officials who travel to places like 
Georgia to check on their carpet manufacturing industry to see if 
they are not dumping into Canada.  We see they have to be 
assessed duties.  It is a very expensive regime to keep in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of areas within the Canadian economy that 
already have quite a harmonized basis of business.  The steel 
industry is one example.  When we think of trade in Canada we 
sometimes think of product moving outside of Canada or into 
Canada by the shipload.  In fact, most of our trade does not 
occur that way.  Eighty-three per cent of our exports go to the 
United States and most of our exports move across the 49th 
parallel day in and day out by truck.  It is a small commercial 
quantity that is moving to service some need.  It might even be 
that a parent company is either in Canada or the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving more and more toward a harmonized trade 
relationship with the United States in particular.  This is 
reflected by the fact that we are going to be phasing out our 
customs duties in those areas.  However, we have 8,000 customs 
duty lines left.  The sooner we can move to trade liberalization 
so Canadian companies can compete head on with companies outside 
of Canada that are neither subsidized nor protected by tariff, 
the better off we will be and the sooner we will be able to clean 
up the rest of our customs lines.

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today to speak, as my colleagues have before me, on the 
third reading of Bill C-11, an act respecting the imposition of 
duties of customs and other charges.  This bill will replace the 
Customs Tariff currently in effect and simplify its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is extremely significant for Canada. First of all, 
because it will make life easier for our businesses, but mainly 
because this is a preliminary effort on the part of the government 
to get rid of numerous rules relating to customs duties that are 
both obsolete and useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, along with the people of Canada, have long been calling 
for less bureaucracy and more efficiency in our government system. 
The resulting savings will be of benefit to Canadian businesses and 
Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and myself support Bill C-11, 
for it is high time there was some tidying up of Canada's 
Customs Tariff.  Moreover, the World Trade Organization shared that 
opinion.  In its July 2, 1990 report on Canada's trade policy, the 
WTO described the Canadian tariff system as “complex and lacking 
transparency”.  Seven years ago, that was the WTO's comment on our 
customs system.  The time was therefore ripe for a thorough reform 
of Canada's Customs Tariff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the February 1994 budget was tabled, the Minister of 
Finance made a commitment to undertake an in-depth examination of 
the Canadian customs duty system, and he set himself a three-year 
deadline. 
To this end, a task force was set up in his department.  Improved 
tariffs were proposed in 1996 and subsequently supposedly submitted 
to public consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we support Bill C-11.  However, we must once 
again express our indignation at the government's approach to 
getting the bill passed.  The government started this tariff 
reform in 1994.  It has known since then that the new tariff was 
to take effect in January 1998—in less than two months.  So why 
did the Minister of Finance involve parliamentarians only just 
recently? Bill C-11 was relegated to the Standing Committee on 
Industry—not even the finance committee, which is too busy with 
prebudget consultations—two weeks ago. Despite the fact that 
they have known since 1994 and that the bill was ready in 1996, 
they dumped it on the industry committee less than two weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is an important bill that requires a long, hard 
look.   Unfortunately, the industry committee which has to study it 
because the finance committee was too busy met only twice to 
consider this technical bill.  As you know, customs tariffs can be 
very complex, particularly when the bill contains 3,000 pages of 
schedules alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the committee would have welcomed help and 
information with open arms to get this express examination done. 
The government often uses this pressure and delaying tactic to 
force the opposition to pass a technical and complex bill requiring 
long hours of examination. 
We have a right to question the time allocated to the committee as well 
as the need to have the legislation come into effect by January 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had it with this approach. It is not the first time that 
the government has acted this way. The most recent example was the 
multilateral agreement on investment. The subcommittee on international 
trade, trade disputes and investment was mandated by the Minister of 
International Trade to hear witnesses and produce a report by mid-December, 
that is to say before the Christmas break. The hearings 
started on November 4. Because of its tight deadline, the committee must 
sit three or four times a week to hear witnesses. As a result, not all 
those who wish to testify before the committee will have the opportunity 
to do so and those who do will have only a few minutes to express their 
views.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Liberal government know what the expression “public 
consultations” really means or does it just use the words blindly? This 
government is showing contempt for what the people of Canada think and 
for the opposition. It is extremely difficult to do our job in the 
opposition under such circumstances. We often get the feeling that the 
government would rather we did not do our job, so it can get anything 
through and hide tons of technical papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Liberals, to consult means posting a document on the 
Internet, discussing with two or three people and expecting 
parliamentarians to trust them blindly. 
This government has never managed to win our trust and this is not about 
to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should point out that, as usual with the Liberal government, 
public consultations were botched. There are groups that were not 
consulted, and those that were have not been heard properly. That was 
the case of the Canadian automotive industry. The Canadian vehicle 
manufacturers association, which represents Chrysler Canada, Ford 
Canada, Freightliner Canada, General Motors Canada, Navistar 
International Canada and Volvo Canada, repeatedly tried to voice its 
concerns to the finance minister and his officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association testified before the Standing Committee on 
Industry, which studied Bill C-11. 
Witnesses informed committee members that they disagreed with the 
government's unilateral decision to eliminate customs duties on auto 
parts on January 1, 1996. At that time, the association was strongly 
opposed to such a move. It asked the committee to wait before confirming 
definitely the elimination of customs duties for auto parts in the new 
Customs Tariff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association told the committee that a study was being conducted 
on the automobile industry and that this study would deal with such 
matters as customs tariffs on parts and complete vehicles. The study is 
being conducted by Industry Canada, the Department of Finance and the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. According to the 
information we have, a report should be released at the beginning of 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another matter I would like to speak to. The Canadian 
Automobile Manufacturers Association is also strongly opposed to the 
elimination of customs duties on assembled vehicles. The Bloc Quebecois 
shares this concern. I asked a question on this matter last March, and 
the Minister of Finance answered by saying that he was studying the 
issue. In April 1997, following a question from the Liberal member from 
Windsor, the Minister of International Trade at that time made a 
commitment not to eliminate customs duties on assembled vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the Liberal government will finally be able to keep a 
promise. The consequences of eliminating customs duties could be serious 
for the Canadian automobile industry. The Canadian government should be 
able to protect an industry when it needs it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the automobile industry were told that the 
Canadian government cannot wait for Industry Canada's report because 
Bill C-11 must come into effect on January 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We question the urgency of implementing the Customs Tariff, but it 
seems that the government will make every effort to pass this bill 
quickly. We are concerned about the automobile industry in Canada. That 
is why we are following closely Industry Canada's study to ensure that 
it is properly conducted and that its conclusions reflect the needs of 
Canada's automobile industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the January 1998 deadline is also a concern 
for the companies themselves, which will have to be ready to apply the 
new changes in a few weeks. 
When the committee reviewed this issue, Revenue officials announced that 
businesses would benefit from a six-month grace period before being 
penalized for non-compliance. We hope that the government will indeed be 
lenient toward these companies, because it prepared this new tariff to 
help them and not to hinder them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Quebec businesses we will support Bill C-11, 
because the proposed standardization and streamlining of the Custom 
Tariff are necessary for both Quebec and Canada. For once, the 
government is making life simpler for Canadian businesses by helping 
them become more competitive at the international level. It must also be 
realized that, with the signing of international trade agreements, our 
tariff structure has become more complex, thus making Bill C-11 all the 
more appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes in the bill include a consolidation of 
Canadian tariff obligations under the Canada—U.S. Free Trade Agreement, 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization, 
the Canada—Israel Free Trade Agreement and the Canada—Chile Free Trade 
Agreement. It is imperative that Canada fulfil its international 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of 
globalization, unlike the Liberals who just recently realized the 
importance of free trade agreements. They are now converts. 
Unlike the Liberal government, however, we are not prepared to 
engage in trade at any cost. We believe in respect for human 
rights, labour standards and environmental standards. It is high 
time the Liberals learned to promote trade while also emphasizing 
respect for social and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the foreign affairs minister had a good opportunity to do 
so, but he did not. On September 5, 1997, a group of Canadian private 
businesses, including Alcan, announced the creation of an international 
code of ethics for Canadian companies. This voluntary code of ethics 
outlines the responsibilities incumbent on Canadian companies doing 
business abroad. It also recognizes the importance of human rights and 
prohibits child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a study by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade on small and medium size export businesses, we 
proposed that the government set up a code of ethics for Canadian 
companies doing business abroad. Far from acting like a leader, the 
Liberal government does not even require crown corporations to comply 
with the private sector's code of ethics. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade are not even encouraging agencies that report to them to 
adopt the code of conduct.  This is a disgrace, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Export Development Corporation, better 
known as EDC, told the committee that EDC had not yet taken a 
decision at the time we were speaking as to whether or not it was 
going to respect the much discussed international code of conduct. 
With EDC lending large amounts to Canadian enterprises and not 
ensuring that they respect social and human rights in the countries 
in which they are investing, this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, with the help of EDC, is strongly encouraging 
Canadian enterprises to invest in Colombia.  Colombia is currently 
in the grip of what for us is an unthinkable crisis. 
The people of Colombia are being terrorized by paramilitary 
soldiers and guerillas.  Colombian teachers have the world's 
highest mortality rate.  Four out of every ten labour leaders in 
the world have been assassinated in Colombia.  Torture and repeated 
violations of human rights are common occurrences.  And yet the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade are encouraging Canadian businesses to invest in Colombia. 
We hope that the Liberal government will finally understand the 
importance of respecting the social standards set out in 
international agreements.  One step in the right direction would be 
to have Canadian enterprises respect the international code of 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I remind members that the Bloc Quebecois will 
be voting in favour of Bill C-11, for the new tariff code benefits 
Canadian businesses and is consistent with respect for our 
international obligations.

Speaker, I am happy to debate Bill C-11 and to be the 
representative of the only party which is taking a pro-Canadian 
view on these international trade matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned Bill C-11 is an enormously lengthy 
document.  It sets out to do a number of things, not all of which 
are terrible.  Nonetheless it is a continuation of the process of 
implementing what has been disastrous free trade deals signed by 
Canada, particularly disastrous because they signed away things 
that never needed to be signed away.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things Bill C-11 attempts to simplify customs tariff 
and rationalize various provisions in the customs tariff as well 
as delete provisions that are no longer relevant.  There are also 
rate reductions on a wide range of goods, mostly on manufacturing 
inputs, an elimination of a large number of tariff codes and 
regulations, a rounding down of decimal rates, and the 
elimination of most rates that fall below 2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is supported by most members of Canada's business 
community because it will reduce their costs.  It will in part 
implement the free trade agreements, in particular NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party remain alone in being opposed to 
the terms of free trade agreements.  That is not to say that we 
are opposed to trade or opposed to fair trade.  I come from the 
province of Saskatchewan which trades more than any other 
province in the country.  Canada trades more than any other 
country by various different measurements in terms of percentage 
of exports, GDP and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada lives on trade; Saskatchewan lives on trade.  The 
constituents of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar live on trade.  I am 
not opposed to trade, but I am opposed to unfair trade which 
encourages the continual control of our economy by the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what has taken place since the signing of the free trade 
agreement with the United States and then NAFTA with Mexico, we 
know that our trade focus has concentrated more and more on trade 
with the United States.  We have not diversified our trade. 
Indeed we have become ever more dependent on one market, the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No sensible business person, no sensible country, no sensible 
person would ever suggest that it is desirable to focus and be 
dependent on one market as a result of the many things that 
flowed from these trade deals.  It is simply foolish.  To be so 
dependent means that in the event of a downturn in the American 
economy we will follow suit.  It also means we have lost much 
more control of our economy.  We did not have much before, but we 
gave away much of it in these deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we been more international, had we been more open, had we 
been more external in our focus, we would have been able to 
diversify our trade more effectively to other markets around the 
world which are growing and in good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That focus is not helping Canadians.  We have an unemployment 
rate of around 9.9%, significantly higher than that of the United 
States.  These deals have not brought us what first Conservative 
governments and then Liberal governments promised they would 
bring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the New Democratic Party remains the only party 
opposed to these deals.  The Liberal Party was strongly opposed 
to the free trade agreement when in opposition but when it became 
government—and you will remember this, Mr. Speaker, because you 
were part of that transition—the Liberal Party became the main 
flag bearer for free trade agreements.  The Prime Minister takes 
some pride in being described as being the main flag bearer for 
the free trade arrangements in North America and further afield 
in South America also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an amazing transformation as the Liberal Party moved from 
opposition benches to government benches and began to listen more 
and more to those in the business community and less and less to 
ordinary Canadians struggling to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, my party, my province and I think all Canadians support a 
focus on trade in an effort to ensure we create a vibrant and 
dynamic economy, one which provides decent jobs for those who 
need them. 
These deals have not done that.  This simplified customs tariff, 
which is merely a part of the whole process, will not do that 
either.

economy, most of whom are not Canadians but from elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I reiterate my and my party's opposition to Bill 
C-11 and to the whole context within which the bill is presented, 
the context of free trade agreements in which Canada gave up so 
much of its sovereignty for so little.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of 
comments and to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the representative from the Bloc who stated that 
his party would have liked to have been better informed about 
Bill C-11.  I wish to note that background information on the 
bill was supplied to all opposition parties before the 
examination in committee.  Oral briefings were also offered to 
explain the bill.  Some took advantage; some did not.  Those who 
did were no doubt better informed about the bill and dealt with 
it in a more effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc continued to say the process was flawed 
and that no one knew about it.  The bill and the customs tariff 
were published in the Canada <I>Gazette</I>.  Letters were sent to 
interested parties.  It was placed on the Internet and on Revenue 
Canada's electronic bulletin board.  Advertisements were placed 
in some leading national newspapers.  I wanted to clarify that 
for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comments made by my colleague from the NDP, 
he focused on the free trade issue, on different aspects of Bill 
C-11, and voiced his opposition to the bill.  The policy of the 
government is to expand trade globally.  We are dependent on the 
United States as our largest trading partner just south of the 
border, but we are continuing to expand trade globally through 
the team Canada approach which brought back billions of dollars 
to Canadian companies that are continuing to excel in exporting 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members of companies from the west, the east and 
central Canada participated in team Canada.  I wonder if he could 
share some of that information.  Perhaps he could demonstrate to 
the House that exports are good for Canadian companies, that 
exports provide Canadian jobs and that the core of our economic 
success has been the export market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member give some indication that 
team Canada has worked and perhaps share the experience with some 
western companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those western companies 
are not here but I am happy to make a brief comment.  Our premier 
was part of the team Canada visits.  We have yet to see great 
fruit bearing from the visits, but I support the Prime Minister 
and the premiers in their efforts to expand trade around the 
world.  There are few who would argue that we should not expand 
trade and our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country like Canada will only survive, will only thrive, if we 
have healthy exporting markets and an environment within Canada 
which encourages businesses to respond to those markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member picked up on the point I was raising.  With the 
agreements made first with the United States and then with 
Mexico, Canada's trade is focused on one market.  Surely nobody 
would regard that as good.  Nobody would regard our increased 
focus on trade with the United States as good.  One of the 
reasons that focus has taken place is precisely because of the 
free trade agreements that have been negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were efforts by earlier Liberal prime ministers to open up 
trade much more with Europe, a much bigger market than that of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those efforts did not take us very far.  We did not diversify 
back in the eighties to other markets, but we were beginning to 
export more to other countries than the United States slowly but 
surely through the eighties and prior to the free trade 
agreements being signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since those agreements have been signed the focus has become 
evermore dependent on one market.  I merely wanted to reiterate 
that.  In the process I can certainly refer to the many meetings 
I have had with exporting companies in my province and in other 
provinces that are doing very well at the present time, certainly 
those in my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the <I>Globe and Mail</I> wrote about the western 
economies having reached full employment.  They must be doing 
something right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Government of Saskatchewan has an effective 
approach to business and job creation.  It has consistently had 
the lowest unemployment rate in the country over the last two 
years.  It leads the country in economic indicators. It must be 
doing something right.  That approach is one of partnership with 
business, labour, government, aboriginal peoples and the 
communities as a whole to represent and develop an economy which 
supports all people of Saskatchewan. It is a diversified economy 
and is becoming ever more diversified unlike the Canadian 
economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my first 
comments are for the parliamentary secretary. He states that the 
government informed the population by means of the Canada 
<I>Gazette</I> and 
the Internet. I doubt that people will get up in the morning and start 
surfing the Net to check out the Revenue Canada or Finance Canada site 
and look in a Department of Finance subfile to see if it contains a bill 
that might eventually be of interest to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that parliamentarians—because we 
are here among parliamentarians—only had two weeks to review and assess 
Bill C-11, whose schedules alone total 3,000 pages. In fact, we had but 
two sessions at the industry committee, which should have been held at 
the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of consultations, perhaps we should use the same 
definition, and when we speak about bogus consultations, we could 
perhaps ask the Liberals to give us a definition, because they are very 
good at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now have a comment and a question for the NDP spokesperson who 
spoke earlier. I noticed that the New Democratic Party does not support 
Bill C-11. 
They were against previous free trade agreements, but the purpose of 
Bill C-11 is to simplify trade and exports for companies in Quebec and 
Canada, including those in his riding. So I have difficulty seeing how 
they can explain to their constituents that they are opposed to 
streamlining trade. We are not talking about the free trade agreement 
that was concluded three, four or five years ago. That was my first 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question. My hon. colleague may also have attended the 
industry committee sittings. I would like to know what he thinks 
personally of the role of parliamentarians in the review of this 
particular bill, when we had two weeks and two weeks only to study a 
bill whose schedules alone total 3,000 pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I would like to make a brief comment and to ask the hon. 
member a short question on Canada's obligation to respect its 
international conventions. Whether we like it or not, Canada signed a 
free trade agreement with the United States and Mexico. Following the 
Liberals' conversion, Canada also signed a free trade agreement with 
Israel and another with Chile, and Canada is an active member of the 
WTO. Does he not believe it is essential that Canada respect the 
international conventions it has signed?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
the Bloc for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly, we have international obligations and we must 
respond to those international treaties and implement them once 
we have signed them. That does not mean that we in the New 
Democratic Party have to be happy about it or should support that 
requirement.  Not being supportive of the arrangements which 
formed the basis of Bill C-11 certainly provides adequate reasons 
to be opposed to Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 provides some benefits to business and that is 
indisputable and business as a whole supports the provisions. 
That does not mean that the whole trend that Canada has embarked 
upon since 1988 with the signing of bilateral, trilateral and 
other deals which give up Canadian sovereignty even more than has 
been taken away by the globalization of world economies, is a 
good or desirable thing and it will never be something that the 
New Democratic Party supports. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure that hon. members just cannot wait for this wonderful 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a pretty decent consensus in the House for 
this bill, with the exception of the New Democratic Party which 
opposes free trade even when it is point blank in front of their 
faces that it has done wonderful things for Canada, created 
hundreds of thousands of jobs.  At least they are consistent in 
their opposition to free trade. We cannot say that for the 
adaptable Liberal government which very quickly when they see a 
good idea, no matter where it comes from, will happily take 
advantage of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last occasion when we had an opportunity to speak in the 
House on Bill C-11, we stressed the importance of making 
legislation that simplifies our lives and simplifies the business 
practices of business owners.  Today, I reiterate these words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that Bill C-11 will help improve the competitive 
position of Canadian industry within a freer trading environment 
as well as in the long run make the tariff system simpler. 
However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we heard dissatisfaction from business owners as 
they faced pressures to adopt new methods according to 
legislative changes. The time period allotted to them is 
unacceptable, given the nature of the changes they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, some automotive manufacturers may face additional 
changes early in 1998 once a clear automotive policy is 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address these two main points today.  First, amendments 
to this bill must be considerate of the business owner, the 
individual or groups of individuals who must implement our 
decisions in the real world.  They must be given the necessary 
time to implement changes and carry out the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is inappropriate that the government take decisive 
actions when a clear automotive strategy is not in place as of 
yet.  While we know that industry generally supports the bill, we 
also know that they have qualms about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of greatest concern to the committee is the sense of 
urgency that is being placed on the bill. Those with the Canadian 
Importers Association are very concerned with the speedy passage 
of this bill.  They point out that importers do not have 
sufficient time for what is a very time consuming and costly 
exercise.  They ask for a period of administrative tolerance. 
This timeframe would allow them to adapt to the changes and 
alleviate their uneasiness with the timing of the proposed 
legislative changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recurring message that we are hearing from the business 
community with respect to the uneasiness they face are their 
concerns related to the delivery and implementation of the tariff 
simplification initiative.  While they support the elimination of 
regulation and business procedures, they are deeply affected by 
the timing of this bill.  They feel it is quite rushed and they 
have not been granted enough time to prepare for the upcoming 
changes and the enormous challenges they will face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance of Manufacturers is but one example of this 
concern.  They stated, and I quote; “It is a scary exercise. 
There is very little time to do the programming we need.”  These 
are the most affected parties.  We demand that the government 
listen to their concerns and continue with the theme of 
simplification.  If it is going to simplify the process, then it 
needs to continue with the agreement and simplify the law to all 
business owners.  We will hold the government accountable to this 
and urge it to listen to the suggestions it has received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard concerns from vehicle manufacturers groups. 
It is no secret that Canada is in need of a strategic automotive 
policy, one based on free and fair trade.  We understand that 
work is to be completed in this area in early 1998.  Why then, we 
ask, make changes to automotive tariffs when the strategy is not 
in place?  Why make changes now when a clear automotive policy is 
yet to be decided and risk having to amend the tariff to fit the 
policy later on?

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is not logical.  It is not fair to the automotive 
industry.  The government ought to stop and think about the 
possible repercussions of amending clauses now and then setting 
its automotive policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By trying to rush through legislation, the government is missing 
the point.  A comprehensive automobile policy needs to be 
introduced in conjunction with clauses in Bill C-11 which pertain 
to automotive tariffs.  Why take the chance of negatively 
impacting jobs and investment in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement that was so profusely objected to 
almost 10 years ago is today the largest bill on our shelves in 
the House of Commons.  It is a huge factor in contributing to tax 
revenues and job creation in this country.  The government 
continues to carry out our Conservative initiatives and our 
tariff agreements.  However, as I have highlighted, there are 
several important factors to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most complex tariff system in the world.  We know it 
and our trading partners know it.  I strongly urge the government 
to consider the huge task that lies in front of importers in 
Canada and demand that they be given time to adapt to these 
enormous changes.  As well, strategic consideration must be given 
to a comprehensive automotive policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message today is that this is a beginning, not an end.  We 
cannot stop now with all the progress we have made for the simple 
reason that the bill has been simplified.  Work still needs to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to commit to continuing with the work 
in progress, to continue developing trade agreements with our 
partners and to look ahead at the global marketplace to achieve a 
standard of excellence with our trading partners.  This means 
that the government must continue to promote trade, thus 
encouraging business development and job creation in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention, but I want to clarify that Bill C-11 does not make 
any changes to the current automotive tariff policy; rather it 
continues to ensure that all auto manufacturers in Canada, auto 
pact and non-auto pact companies, import parts duty free.  No 
changes are made to vehicle tariffs.  Auto pact companies 
continue to import vehicles free of duty while non-auto pact 
companies pay duty on all vehicles which they import. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member is now indicating that he wants 
to change that policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was not our 
intention.  When our caucus discussed this we decided to support 
it because it is under free trade and in line with the policies 
in which we very strongly believe.  Our intention is that we 
should not be changing things today which will affect another 
policy which will come before the House next spring.  Those are 
the things that drive businesses crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that there is probably going to be a comprehensive 
automotive policy presented before the House in the next 
legislative sitting.  We thought that in order to make business a 
little easier we should not be making any changes today which may 
affect their jobs.  That is really where we are to with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr.

free trade deal and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it has 
created.  I wonder how many people in Newfoundland are listening 
to his comments today.  That province probably has one of the 
highest unemployment rates in North America if we break it down 
to a per capita ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the NDP is against free trade deals.  What we are 
against are deals that hurt Canadian workers.  He, coming from 
the province of Newfoundland, should know that better than 
anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is it has driven labour standards, health 
standards and safety standards down to match third world country 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind him of what happened in Mexico.  We were told when 
the Tories introduced free trade that Mexican workers' standards 
would rise.  We were told that their standard of living would 
rise.  It is 1997 now and if we visit Mexico, as I have recently, 
we will notice that the standards for workers are lower than they 
have ever been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of deals which we are against.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just a brief reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we in Newfoundland, as part of Canada, are very 
strongly supportive of the free trade agreement, but today in 
Newfoundland nobody is really talking about the free trade 
arrangements.  We are talking about the massive Hibernia oil 
project which was developed between the Government of Canada, the 
Government of Newfoundland and a large group of private sector 
partners which yesterday flowed oil for the first time.  It is a 
huge industry.  It is going to create thousands of jobs in 
Newfoundland and in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are an estimated 6 billion barrels of oil that can be 
processed or recovered from the offshore Hibernia field.  It is a 
great day for Newfoundland.  Today we are very happy that the 
Government of Canada, the Government of Newfoundland and the 
private companies have developed those significant amounts of 
jobs in Eastern Canada.

moved that Bill C-18, an act to amend the Customs Act and the 
Criminal Code, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk today 
about Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you well know, this bill was presented in the last Parliament 
and has been reintroduced in this Parliament.  We have waited in 
Canada for this bill because it will help with the safety of our 
community.  It will help our customs officers at the border 
points.  As Canadians know, at the border points Revenue Canada, 
through its customs department which is integral to the 
department, the men and women who are peace officers at the 
border are there to be the first line of defence not only with 
having commercial goods come into the country and consumer goods 
come into the country, but millions of people visiting this land, 
both our returning residents and our tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we do the primary immigration and the customs work and now, 
with Bill C-18, we have the opportunity to fill a gap in the 
legislation that has been there for some time.  This matter has 
had intensive study over the last decade or so.  There have been 
reports.  We have very much our own customs unions on side with 
us.  We very much have the police forces in this country on side 
with us.  We very much have on side the interest groups that have 
come to us, for example, Priscilla de Villiers and her very good 
organization, CAVEAT, as well as Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these interest groups have pointed out to us something 
that we do that had to be corrected.  This gap had to be filled 
and it was a gap where our police officers, our customs 
officers—I really should not call them police officers.  They 
are our customs officers at the border points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with this legislation, they will have the ability to put 
charges down where we suspect some criminal activity that was 
outside the parameters of the Customs Act and the other 
legislation that we cover at the border points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell you about suspected drunk drivers who in the past 
we could detain but we had to call the local police forces, 
whoever they were, at the border points, and they are different 
across this land.  They would then come and we could hold them, 
but we did not have the legal right to hold them there forever. 
Now this gap has been closed because we can do those charges.  We 
can also pick up the outstanding arrest warrants that come up 
with our intelligence systems at the border points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gap will help with the drunk drivers' situation.  It will 
help with the possession of stolen goods' situation. 
It will be very material and will touch the lives of Canadians 
who fear children being abducted at the border points.  We have 
very good lookouts and intelligence.  A child find operation is 
dealt with by our customs officers at the border point.  This 
will give them the added legal authority to make the necessary 
charges on those involved in suspected criminal activities.  They 
will also have the legal authority to detain those individuals 
with outstanding arrest warrants.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very necessary piece of legislation.  My colleagues 
across the hall in this Chamber understand the need for this 
legislation and welcome it, as we do.  It is very important to the 
men and women who daily serve us in our department and who serve 
Canadians in doing their very important jobs.  They have been 
doing their jobs without this legislation but this clarifies in 
law and better allows them to complete the task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will have the adequate necessary training.  We will start 
at selected points but it will be across this land.  We will have 
to make some structural changes in some of our facilities to 
accommodate this situation but they are minor in the scope of 
things. We do not believe our customs officers need to be armed 
at our border points and we will not be arming them, although I 
know this was part of the discussion.  This decision was taken 
after much investigation.  We will ensure the safety of our 
customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing professionally with this situation for a 
long time.  Now we are giving our customs officers the tool that 
was needed to close that legal gap, to give them the power to 
charge individuals and detain them.  We will be the first 
response only.  We are not going to handle the regular processing 
after the fact.  The local police will be called in and they will 
take over as quickly as possible but we will legally be in a 
position to fulfill the need for community safety at the point of 
entry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a time when individuals such as Jonathon Yeo were 
seen at our border points and there was limited ability to hold 
them.  This will correct our situation.  I can think of tales 
from across Canada of people not being able to detain those they 
suspected of drinking and then later those people getting into 
accidents.  The safety of not only our peace officers but of 
Canadians is the number one area we are concerned with in this 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a report of many years ago have come discussions with our 
unions, the public and within the department.  Now we have this 
legislation.  We hope that with the assistance of all members in 
this House it can be moved rapidly through all legislative stages 
with the appropriate amount of discussion in this Chamber.  It 
will be sent to the justice committee, then at third reading we 
will have another level of discussion in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Revenue Canada are very proud of the men and women who 
serve us at the border.  The percentage of complaints we get 
about these individuals is very low compared to the number of 
people and goods they process.  It is a very low annual figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a student customs officer at the border in 1974 I feel there 
are jobs that both full time and part time employees did which 
they will continue to do.  My point about the students is that 
they will not get training in this area.  We feel it is an area 
in which the full time and the full part time people should be 
trained in.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everybody will have to be trained at every border point. 
There will have to be sufficient numbers trained in 
this area of the law and procedure.  They will be properly 
staffed at every border point so that we can continue to do the 
excellent job that we are doing now for Canadians.  I wanted to 
make that point because even though we value every employee, 
full, part time, student, whatever, we recognize that these are 
skills positions, positions of authority.  We want them to be 
carried out in the most professional manner.  We will provide the 
facilities and the training so that our customs officers can do 
this across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight the fact that we have not gone so far as 
arming and we will not be doing this.  We have given the legal 
tool that was missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of legislation.  It is one that 
has been long awaited.  It is one that is welcomed not only by 
the men and women in our department who have to work hard every 
day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week at all of our many border 
points, but also those people in our communities, especially the 
policing community at these border points and in general the 
whole Canadian public, the men, women and children who cross our 
border points every day.  This will make Canada better and more 
secure. I am very pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a long piece of legislation.  It is not a difficult 
piece of legislation.  The operative parts are actually in three 
clauses of the legislation.  The bottom line is that it will make 
a big difference for the people who work every day at our border 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am open to questions from my colleagues on my side or across 
the floor and I will do my best to answer their questions or 
concerns.  I am grateful that we are now in a position to put 
this piece of legislation before them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the official opposition to do something I 
thought I would never do in this House and have not done to this 
time, support a government bill.  It is not easy to do but for a 
good cause we will sometimes support government bills. This is a 
well constructed and designed bill and a thoughtful approach to a 
problem we have in controlling criminal activity coming across 
our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-18 does, as the hon. parliamentary secretary 
outlined, is extend the ordinary powers of peace officers to 
detain and to arrest people who are either under criminal 
warrants or suspected of engaging in certain forms of criminal 
activity, principally impaired driving.  This is something which 
is most sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that several thousand impaired drivers cross our 
borders each year but cannot be detained by our custom officers 
is a troubling one.  There are many customs and entry ports in 
this country where we do not have full time regular peace 
officers, RCMP officers, staffing those ports.  The customs 
agents are the only official representatives of our government 
and are the only eyes that are watching what kind of people cross 
those borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these customs agents not to have the capacity to stop, 
detain and arrest people suspected of driving on to our highways 
impaired and endangering law abiding Canadian drivers I think is 
troubling.  We are encouraged by Bill C-18's empowerment of those 
custom agents so that they can essentially act as a first 
response capability at our borders, a first response capability 
for criminals and for those suspected of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that over the past year, according to estimates 
made by our customs officers, over 8,500 suspected impaired 
drivers have entered Canada. None of these people could be 
detained or stopped legally by customs agents for impaired 
driving.  There are other reasons why they could be stopped, but 
not necessarily for that offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been an estimated 200 incidents of suspected child 
abduction where customs agents have not been empowered to stop 
the alleged abductors of children.  There have been over 2,000 
individuals subject to arrest warrants and more than 500 
individuals in possession of suspected stolen property, mostly 
vehicles, again in instances where our customs agents have not 
been able to detain these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sensible approach and one which we understand is 
supported by, among other groups, the customs union, Canadians 
Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, CAVEAT, 
and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, as well as various 
police forces.  It seems to have a broad range of support both by 
those concerned about the potential for the overzealous use of 
peace officer force as well as the police officers themselves. 
They all seem to be in support of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do have several questions which are not addressed in 
the information the government has provided with respect to Bill 
C-18 and which were not really explained adequately by the 
parliamentary secretary.  Among other questions, the government 
clearly will incur costs to implement this bill, costs which will 
derive from the training of customs agents so that they will know 
how and under what circumstances they may exercise these new 
criminal law powers.  What exactly are those costs for training 
those public servants in this respect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be costs associated with establishing new 
facilities, detention facilities at many ports of entrance. 
Again, we have seen no estimate of what costs are associated with 
that.  I would therefore ask the hon. members opposite, perhaps 
the parliamentary secretary if she has an opportunity, to provide 
this House with information on what costs will be associated with 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question we have is the question of how these officers 
will be empowered to enforce the law.  We understand, as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary just admitted, that they will not be 
issued firearms.  While we are giving them in this bill partial 
police officer powers, the power to arrest and detain, among 
other people, suspected gun smugglers and drug smugglers, we will 
be issuing them pepper spray and, I gather, batons to protect 
themselves and Canadians and to enforce the law against 
potentially violent law breakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me this raises a question about the safety of our 
customs officers and the seriousness that the government has in 
terms of empowering these officers to apply and enforce the law. 
My second question to the government would be why will it not 
issue these quasi-peace officers the tools that peace officers 
need to execute the law, to arrest and detain potentially violent 
and dangerous criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the former minister of revenue, the 
current minister of Indian affairs, introduced substantially the 
same bill in the last Parliament.  In justifying not issuing 
firearms to these officers she simply said that she did not feel 
it was appropriate.  She did not really explain why.  She just 
said “Under my watch they will not be armed.  As far as guns, 
the message there changes the whole perspective of our border and 
the risk of increased violence is not acceptable to me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these agents were properly empowered and issued firearms, the 
risk of violence would not, I think, come from them.  The risk of 
violence comes from violent criminals who cross our borders.  To 
suggest that peace officers who are issued the necessary tools to 
do their jobs somehow poses a threat of violence at our borders 
is, I think, a rather backward way of looking at it.  It is those 
peace officers who use those tools who prevent violent criminals 
coming into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would again ask for a more compelling justification for these 
peace officers' not being issued with the appropriate tools to do 
the job that most peace officers have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wonder about the common practice at Customs Canada of 
employing student customs officers.  When the question is asked 
“O Canada, who stands on guard for thee”, in too many cases the 
answer is poorly trained students at ports of entry in this 
country, not fully trained customs agents.  These student 
officers are in some places such as Pearson airport.  Some 80% of 
customs agents, the first line of defence Canada has in the 
protection and enforcements of its laws, are undertrained student 
agents and are not full-fledged customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that in other jurisdictions such as the United 
States and the United Kingdom this simply is not the case.  One 
hundred per cent of the customs agents representing those 
governments are fully trained, fully empowered, fully certified 
customs agents, and not quasi-customs agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for the government.  Why does it 
continue to staff our borders with people who are not fully 
trained officers of the law?  That is a reasonable question. 
These student agents will not have the powers given to full 
customs agents under Bill C-18.  Quite understandably they will 
not have the certification or the training to exercise peace 
officers powers.  Even though this is a good step forward, many 
thousands of our customs agents at many of our customs ports and 
ports of entry will not have the power to arrest or detain people 
under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If student agents are on duty at a particular port of entry and 
find somebody who may be suspected of criminal activity, a 
suspected child abductor, kidnapper, smuggler of contraband or an 
impaired driver, they can do nothing to arrest or detain those 
people.  They had better hope that there is a full-fledged 
customs agent immediately available to them or a full-fledged 
peace officer.  If there is not then there is no protection for 
Canadians and there is no discharging of Canadian law at those 
ports of entry.  That is an important point to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question.  The revenue minister has not indicated 
whether or not there will be additional training or the extent to 
which there will be additional training for newly empowered 
customs officers.  What kind of training will they receive?  Will 
it be in a police college atmosphere?  Will it be within the 
current customs college, or will they receive a kind of briefing? 
How do we know they will be properly trained to exercise the 
ultimate power of government, that is its police power?  That 
question is not outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand in a very sensible bill like this one why 
the government would not anticipate some of these questions and 
answer them.  Perhaps it will in the course of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a worthwhile objective.  It is a good and honest effort 
by the government to plug a loophole that too many criminals have 
taken advantage of to seek entry into the country.  I would only 
ask why this kind of legislation was not passed years if not 
decades ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it take so long for us to plug loopholes in terms of 
enforcing the criminal law in Canada?  Why have we allowed 8,500 
suspected impaired drivers to cross our borders in the past 
without having the power to stop them?  How many innocent 
Canadians have died on Canadian roads because customs officers 
were not able to stop, detain or arrest suspected impaired 
drivers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are good questions.  They are not only directed to this 
government but to predecessor governments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the position of the Reform Party with respect to 
impaired driving and the application of the criminal law is well 
known.  We stand for a criminal law regime which can be enforced. 
We want our peace officers and officers of the government to be 
able to enforce laws and protect Canadians.

<A NAME="LINK44">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, 
an Act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code, be read a 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some days are busier than others. 
Today, I was in a building on Wellington Street to attend a sitting 
of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, but I 
insisted on rushing back here to speak on Bill C-18, an Act to 
amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are extremely important amendments.  This bill, which 
was tabled by the Minister of National Revenue, affects several 
facets of law.  There is one entire section that deals with the 
changes and enhanced powers the government wishes to give customs 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new bill, however.  It is numbered C-18, but it 
was tabled in exactly the same form during the 35th Parliament as 
C-89.  It will be remembered that it was tabled by the government 
of the day on the eve of the calling of the federal election, on 
March 13, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first mandate, a number of groups came to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights as well as to the 
government calling specifically for the government to change 
certain provisions of the Customs Act in order to enhance some 
powers.  A number of groups have long pointed out the need for 
customs officers to be able to enforce criminal law at Canadian 
entry points. 
In a country like Canada, especially,  which has such a long border 
with a lot of entry points, offences have occurred over the years, 
and customs officers lacked the tools necessary to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What provision does the Customs Act make at the moment?  We 
are told that customs officers have powers, but they are 
enforcement powers as established under part VI of the Customs Act. 
These powers apply to surveillance duties and to the control of 
merchandise imported into or exported from Canada.  They include 
the power to search a person in order to find proof of an offence 
and to inspect, detain or seize merchandise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently customs officers' powers apply primarily to 
merchandise entering or leaving Canada.  They do not involve the 
application of provisions of the Criminal Code. 
The expression “peace officer” in the Criminal Code includes 
customs officers, but only in the context of offences set out in 
the Customs Act.  For example, section 163(1) of the Criminal Code 
stipulates that it may apply with respect to offences set out under 
sections 153 or 159 of the act, which are false statements and 
smuggling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances, customs officers are invested with 
the powers granted peace officers under sections 462.3 and 462.32 
to 462.5 of the Criminal Code.  In short, at the moment, customs 
officers are considered peace officers under the Criminal Code only 
in the case of offences set out in the Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is proposing to amend the Customs Act to set out new 
offences that come under the powers of customs officers.  They 
really want to use the bill to give the customs officers greater 
opportunity to intervene when they witness certain offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about the changes. At present, customs officers are 
only allowed to act when an offence under the Customs Act has been 
committed. Since they do not have jurisdiction over Criminal Code 
offences or impaired driving offences—we will come back to that 
later, because there are specific provisions on this—they cannot act 
in those instances. There has been in the past striking examples of 
cases where blatant irregularities took place at Canadian ports of entry 
and departure because customs officers did not have the power to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 proper contains four clauses. These are small 
technicalities, but I think they are worth mentioning anyway. Clause 1, 
which makes substantive changes to the Customs Act, is the bill's main 
provision, while clauses 2 and 3 amend two sections of the Criminal 
Code; these amendments, although minor, are nevertheless far-reaching in 
terms of the customs officers' jurisdiction. 
Finally, clause 4 is the usual provision dealing with the coming into 
force of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the extra time at my disposal to look at a number of 
very important provisions. Clause 1 of the bill would add part VI.1 to 
the Customs Act. This new part is entitled “Enforcement of Criminal 
Offences Other than Offences under this Act”. As indicated in the title, 
legislation other than the Customs Act is involved, hence the importance 
of the powers conferred upon customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 163.4 would be added, stipulating that the minister may 
issue a certificate of designation to customs officers for the purposes 
of new part VI.1. In this respect, according to documents from Revenue 
Canada, these new powers would only be granted to customs officers at 
ports of entry to Canada who are not students. 
This is reassuring, since it is an important power. It will only be 
given to customs officers on duty at Canadian ports of entry. The 
certificates of designation will be issued by the minister. As will be 
seen later, we have some concerns. While we support the bill as a whole, 
as we did during the 35th Parliament, we do have concerns regarding the 
certificates of designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next important provision is paragraph 163.5(1), which gives a 
designated officer the powers and obligations of a peace officer under 
sections 495 to 497 of the Criminal Code. These are very important 
sections. As you know, section 495 gives a peace officer the right to 
arrest without a warrant a person who has committed an indictable 
offence or is about to commit such an offence. 
Section 495 also provides that this power can only be exercised under 
exceptional circumstances, that is when the officer has reasonable 
grounds to believe that public interest requires such an intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 497, a peace officer who makes an arrest without a 
warrant must release the person arrested as soon as practicable, unless 
he has reasonable grounds to believe—this is another well-known legal 
concept—that it is necessary in the public interest to detain that 
person. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be noted that these new powers can only be exercised in a 
customs office. So, while additional powers are given to customs 
officers, the bill restricts their use and relies on well-known legal 
concepts. These concepts are also recognized in case law and, over the 
years, they have been interpreted under a number of acts, including the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec charter. The 
expression “reasonable grounds to believe” has indeed been interpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional powers given to customs officers come with certain 
obligations. 
In the final part of my speech, I will comment on the obligations 
that will apply to customs officers as a result of these 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18, an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal 
Code, contains an extremely important provision. I must say that I 
am very happy to see that the lawmakers have included a provision 
to amend the Criminal Code accordingly through the Customs Act. 
This provision can be found in proposed paragraph 163.5(2).  It 
would give designated customs officers—the same officers just 
designated by the minister—the powers and obligations of a peace 
officer under sections 254 and 256 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are sections 254 and 256 of the Criminal Code?  As 
everyone knows, I am sure, these are the sections having to do with 
impaired driving. 
Customs officers will have powers similar to those of peace 
officers, at border points for entering or leaving Canada—it all 
depends on the direction of travel.  They will have the same powers 
as peace officers to apply sections 254 and 256. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions are for the taking of breath or blood samples 
in cases of impaired driving.  Thus, where a peace officer believes 
on reasonable and probable grounds—again, the same principle of 
law recognized by lawyers—that a person is committing or has 
committed the offence of driving while impaired as described in 
section 253, that officer may, under the provisions of another 
section, section 254(3), require that person to provide him with a 
sample of the person's breath or, in certain circumstances, blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, when a person who was driving into or out of 
Canada had alcohol on his breath, the customs officer to whom that 
person made his declaration could do absolutely nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as an Ontario MP, you are well aware that the 
biggest port of entry between the USA and Canada is Windsor.  This 
was an extremely big problem in that region of Ontario, because 
many people who worked across the border, or who crossed to the 
States or to Canada for a night out, were at the wheel of a vehicle 
and had had one too many.  When they went through customs,  the 
customs officer could do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this amendment, in the form of subsection 163.5(2), 
customs officers will have additional powers and will be able to 
require individuals to provide a breath sample. 
Their actions will have legal consequences, eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed subsection 163.5 (3) provides that a designated 
officer who arrests a person in the exercise of the powers 
conferred under subsection (1) may detain the person until the 
person can be placed in the custody of a police officer or peace 
officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this reassuring, that customs officers' powers are 
being enhanced within very definite limits.  These are very clearly 
delineated powers.  The customs officers' powers do not replace 
those of the police officers of a province, nor those of the RCMP 
in provinces served by the RCMP. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 163.5(4) would limit the new powers of the designated 
officers by stipulating that they could not use any power conferred 
on them for the enforcement of the act for the sole purpose of 
looking for evidence of a criminal offence under the Criminal Code 
or any other act of Parliament. The purpose of this is to prevent 
customs officers from searching for evidence of other criminal 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this clause too, the lawmaker has imposed certain limits 
on customs officers, that is, a customs officer witnessing an 
offence will be empowered when this bill is passed to investigate 
and gather evidence of what he has seen.  If he has reasonable 
grounds to believe that an individual is, for example, moving 
stolen goods from Canada to the United States, he has, under the 
legislation and if there are reasonable grounds to believe the 
goods are in the trunk of a car, the power to examine the items in 
order to gather evidence to hand over to the police with 
jurisdiction where the customs officer made the seizure or 
conducted his investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as we can see, there are limits, which are extremely 
important. 
Substantial additional powers, essentially the powers of peace 
officers, cannot be given to customs officers without limits being 
set, without very precise limits to ensure that everything occurs 
according to the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said on a number of topics, we will support the 
bill.  However, we have some questions.  As I said earlier, we have 
already examined the bill in the previous Parliament under another 
number and another title.  This one is exactly the same as the one 
that was introduced in March 1997.  I will raise certain points, 
which, at the time, gave me cause for considerable thought and also 
convinced me of the merits of such amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, a study revealed that, in 17 months, there were over 
4,000 instances where criminal law could have been applied in one 
way or another at 160 ports of entry either on the highways or at 
airports. 
According to Revenue Canada officials, the majority of these are 
suspected instances of impaired driving. In these 4,000 cases, no action 
was taken because customs officers did not have the jurisdiction to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same study shows that an amendment to the Customs Act similar 
to the one contained in Bill C-89—at the time, we were considering 
Bill C-89, tabled on March 13, 1997—would fill the gap between the 
time when customs officers observe a Criminal Code offence and the time 
when the police can respond. It was clear from the statistics and from 
past experience that there was indeed a loophole allowing law-breakers 
to get off scot-free. 
This bill bridges the gap to correct this shortcoming and ensure that 
offenders are prosecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the foregoing, we must recognize that the Criminal Code could 
be much more effectively enforced at our borders if our customs officers 
were given the appropriate tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while public safety may demand that we support the bill 
before us, some aspects will definitely have to be looked into at the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. There are concerns 
regarding this bill. 
Some answers were found in departmental documents, others through 
informal discussions I have had with government members, but there are 
still questions that remain unanswered. These questions will be raised 
at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on which I sit as 
a representative of the Bloc Quebecois.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention four points. The first one is the need to properly 
train the designated officers. As I explained at the beginning of my 
speech, in some situations and under specific circumstances, customs 
officers will have basically the same powers as peace officers do, and 
these powers are very important ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that in fact the bill proposes a significant 
broadening of the customs officers' responsibilities. Sections 495 to 
497 of the Criminal Code are not easy to apply. They require a high 
level of judgment on the part of the peace officer, since the 
consequences are very significant. Take, for example, the expression 
“reasonable grounds to believe”, which I pointed out earlier. 
This concept is not difficult to understand. It is a legal concept 
lawyers are used to work with, judges are used to interpret and officers 
are trained on. However, I am not sure that customs officers do get that 
kind of training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression “reasonable grounds to believe” used in these 
sections is extremely important, as we saw in Storrey v Regina, in 1990, 
where the supreme court stated that, in order to arrest a person without 
a warrant, a police officer must have reasonable and probable grounds to 
believe that the person has committed an indictable offence. This 
subjective belief on the part of the police officer must also be 
justifiable from an objective point of view. In order to properly 
interpret the clues that will influence his subjective belief, a peace 
officer must have received adequate training. We also have to determine 
whether or not customs officers should be armed to implement these new 
provisions. 
Here again, if it is felt that the implementation of Bill C-18 
would require customs officers to be armed, then public safety will 
also require that customs officers have the necessary certificates 
authorizing them to handle firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, yes, there are additional powers, and, yes, we are in 
agreement.  However, if the job is to be well done, if we want to 
prevent myriad interpretations and court challenges, designated 
customs officers will need appropriate training.  They will perhaps 
need a basic knowledge of the legal concept of reasonable and 
probable grounds in order to be able to apply the legal principle. 
And if these officers—because this question has not yet been 
resolved—are armed, as are officers of the peace, then they will 
also have to have the necessary certificates authorizing them to 
handle these firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question concerns the need to cooperate with 
provincial authorities.  The bill would bridge the gap that existed 
between a customs officer's observation of an offence and police 
intervention.  For this gap to be satisfactorily bridged, it must 
be possible to count on the cooperation of provincial public 
security services.  It must be remembered—and it is good to 
remember this from time to time—that the administration of justice 
comes under provincial jurisdiction and that enforcement of the 
Criminal Code is thus a provincial responsibility.  Although the 
new provisions would be implemented strictly in the context of 
federal customs responsibilities, consultations with the provinces 
would be appropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want the amendments to Bill C-18 to be useful, if we want to 
avoid, once again, at this stage, the problems caused by overlap and 
unfairness at the enforcement level or to avoid jurisdictional 
squabbles, it is really essential at this time that the federal 
government, perhaps through the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights—we will surely be hearing witnesses from the police forces—sit 
down at the same table and find an approach to ensure mutual co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I am concerned with is costs. There must surely be 
costs related to these changes, for example merely in terms of equipping 
all customs facilities with cells. 
People cannot simply be arrested and placed at a table somewhere in the 
corner of some ordinary office. If customs officers have the same powers 
as peace officers and police officers, and if they are going to arrest 
individuals who could be dangerous, their safety requires that there be 
proper facilities, cells like those in any police station. We are told 
that there are about 80 border points. What are the costs for these 80 
stations? This is another question that remains unanswered at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fourth point concerns infringements of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. As we know, when additional powers are granted to 
customs officers to allow arrests without a warrant, it is possible that 
there will be violations to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
We must never forget that individuals have rights, including protection 
against arbitrary detention. 
So we have to ensure that customs officers, when there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that an offence or other act has been committed, are 
adequately informed about the rights they might violate if they are not 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, we will have to be especially careful in terms of the 
education and training provided to the customs officers chosen by the 
minister. In the charter alone, we find sections 8, 9, 10 and 11, which 
are extremely important, and customs officers will have to enforce this 
legislation properly to avoid any legal challenge under the charter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to say a few words on this bill before the House today and 
indicate, first of all, the support of the New Democratic Party 
for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a bill first introduced last March by the then government 
and died when the prime minister called the election for June 2. 
Now the bill is back before the House today.  I hope it goes 
through the House, giving the customs officers the power to 
implement certain parts of the Criminal Code, mainly to detain or 
arrest until a police officer is able to come to the scene.  This 
is something which is needed in this country. In other words, the 
customs officer becomes the first line of defence, when the 
customs officer obviously sees a drunken driver or someone else 
who is suspected of committing a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the customs officers do not have that power.  In this 
country we have many border crossings and about 2,500 customs 
officers.  There is really a gap in the law which has allowed 
over the last number of years a number of people who are 
suspected to be committing a criminal act to get into the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give some information which is relevant to the debate 
this morning.  According to Revenue Canada, in the last two and a 
half years or the last thirty months there have been about 8,500 
suspected impaired drivers who have crossed Canadian borders. 
They have been allowed to cross because customs officers do not 
have the power to detain or to arrest the person suspected of 
being impaired.  What a customs officer can do, under the law 
today, is call the local detachment of the RCMP or local police, 
which ever may be the nearest, and tell the police that there is 
a driver going through who is suspected of being impaired.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the driver is long gone before the police arrive. 
Revenue Canada believes that in the last 30 months about 8,500 
impaired drivers have just simply driven away before police 
arrived or in some cases the police were not called because there 
was not point in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been about 200 incidents of suspected child 
abductions allowed to cross the border because the border 
officials have no power whatsoever to arrest or detain these 
suspected kidnappers.  Again I think that states very clearly why 
customs officers need additional powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been over 2,000 individuals who were subject to 
arrest warrants who have crossed the border, again long gone 
before the police arrived.  There have been more than 500 
individuals suspected to be in possession of stolen property, 
mainly vehicles, who have also crossed the border before police 
arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is an obvious gap in the law that must be 
rectified by Parliament.  It is because of those facts that I am 
pleased to offer support on behalf of our party to the very quick 
passage of Bill C-18.  This is something which is long overdue. 
It should have been done a number of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to add that I believe there is general support in 
the community for these kinds of powers.  I know that police 
associations, customs officers, the customs excise union or the 
union des douanes et accises are all very supportive of passage 
of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to give an example of what happens because customs 
officers do not have this power.  I have in my hand a letter 
which was written by a customs officer.  I do not want to put any 
names on the record but just read into the record an 
incident that occurred very recently on the night of October 3, 
1997.  I believe this sums up the need for the legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The night of October 3, 1997 at the customs port of Windygates, 
Manitoba was a prime example of the need for customs inspectors 
to have the authority to detain impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At approximately 2156 hours two Canadian males on motorcycles 
arrived at the port, returning from a nearby U.S. bar.  One in 
particular displayed signs of impairment.  I know from experience 
that this man cannot be dissuaded from driving, as driving while 
impaired has been a regular occurrence for him.  Due to the 
distances involved, I also know that the suspect can be home 
before the RCMP are able to get on the road and apprehend him. 
Consequently, these motorcyclists were allowed to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two minutes later, one kilometre north of the customs office, 
[one individual] age 30, is dead in a pool of blood in the middle 
of the road. A combination of high speed and alcohol caused him 
to lose control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minutes later, while administering CPR to a man that is clearly 
beyond help, I wonder what I could have done to prevent this 
tragedy. Shortly thereafter, family members of the deceased 
arrived on the scene and I also had the dubious honour of 
informing them of their loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based upon previous encounters with [this gentleman], I am 
convinced that there is nothing I could have said, and nothing I 
could legally do to stop him from proceeding down the road that 
night. However, I am equally convinced that if customs inspectors 
had the authority to enforce the impaired driving laws, that this 
man would be alive today. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he goes on to say that in light of this incident and other 
incidents that have happened across this country, he hopes that 
Parliament will expedite the passage of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that letter sums up the need for this bill better than 
any speech we can make in this House.  People have been killed 
because customs officers do not have the powers of arrest and 
detainment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who have actually killed others in traffic 
accidents because of the fact that they are driving impaired.  We 
have in this country very strict drunk driving laws.  They are 
enforced and here is a gap in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that, I hope this Parliament can pass as quickly as 
possible Bill C-18.  With that, I offer our support and hope the 
House will do this expeditiously.  I am sure that he will make 
sure that occurs this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great pleasure that I speak in this House today to 
express my support for Bill C-18, legislation that will enhance 
safety and security for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will strengthen our customs officers role in law 
enforcement by extending the scope of their powers so that they 
can arrest and detain individuals suspected of committing 
offences under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of National Revenue has pointed out, the 
legislation will close a longstanding gap in our ability to 
better control criminal activities such as impaired driving, 
child abduction and possession of stolen goods at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also allow us to deal with individuals who are the 
subject of outstanding arrest warrants.  There is a clear need 
for customs officers to be able to stop criminals and suspected 
criminals at the border before they have a chance to enter this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has many major borders which process travellers 
and commercial traffic coming to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the criminal activity observed by our customs officers 
is reported at the borders.  On the national level, possession of 
stolen goods is up by over 250%.  The number of outstanding 
warrants is also up by close to 95% and the incidence of missing 
children increased by 16%.  Impaired driving continues to be a 
cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those numbers are startling.  Canadians expect us to do what we 
can to keep this community safe.  Bill C-18 is one way that we 
can meet those expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A modern customs organization is what we expect to have.  Over 
the last few years Revenue Canada has begun a process of 
transforming the customs program.  That transformation has 
produced one of the most modern, efficient customs organizations 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has adopted new technology and new techniques 
such as risk management to respond to the reality of facilitating 
trade and tourism. The fundamental changes now under way in our 
customs program recognize that most clients obey the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada takes its responsibility to protect Canadians 
seriously and it is my belief that Bill C-18 serves as one more 
tool for modern customs organizations to fulfil their enforcement 
mandate.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers already have the power to detain and arrest 
individuals suspected of offences under the Customs Act.  Our 
officers already deal with offences as serious as the smuggling 
of drugs and weapons.  Bill C-18 will extend those powers to 
include Criminal Code violations.  It will allow customs officers 
to deal with crimes that are repugnant to most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the House recently received a letter from the 
union representing customs officers which indicates its support 
and the support of its members for Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attached to that letter is a letter from a customs officer who 
works at the port of Windygates, Manitoba.  In it the officer 
recounts a recent experience he had with an obviously impaired 
motorcyclist.  Unable to detain this individual, the officer had 
no choice but to let him proceed on his way.  One kilometre 
beyond the port the motorcyclist lost control and was killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter this concerned customs officer pointed out that 
the ending of the story may have been different if he would have 
had the power to legally contain this motorcyclist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will allow customs officers to use their unique 
position at the border to act as a first response against crime. 
This means that customs officers will be able to legally hold 
suspects until law enforcement agencies can intervene. 
Therefore, that will increase their chances of catching those 
people at the right time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about partners in law enforcement?  Let us be clear.  The 
legislation is not intended to make customs officers a 
replacement for police.  As we mentioned earlier, it will close a 
longstanding gap and will give customs officers a stronger role 
in law enforcement as they work in co-operation with police 
agencies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers, police chiefs, attorneys general all know that 
this will enhance our ability to catch criminals at the border. 
Giving customs officers more power will help the police to do 
their job more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation has a broad base of support among the law 
enforcement community of this country.  We have consulted broadly 
with law enforcement agencies and officials and we have their 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers will not have the power to investigate Criminal 
Code offences, nor will customs officers have the power to 
prosecute Criminal Code offences.  That will remain the 
responsibility of provincial law enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not our intent to provide firearms to our officers as 
a result of this legislation.  We have studied this issue 
carefully and have concluded that it is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entrusting these powers to a group of men and women who 
prove their value to this country every day as skilled, dedicated 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 our customs officers processed over 106 million 
people at the border.  The department received only 448 
complaints about the conduct of officers.  This represents a 
one-to-nearly 240,000 ratio.  I think those statistics speak very 
highly of the professionalism with which customs officers do 
their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Bill C-18 is passed it will take six to nine months to 
implement this initiative.  We will use that time to renovate 
facilities, designate officers and train them on the 
identification of Criminal Code offences and related court 
jurisprudence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers will have the training and tools they need to 
carry out their new duties in a professional and responsible 
manner.  Canadians can be assured that men and women who are paid 
to protect our border will continue to do so with the same skill 
and dedication that they have come to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge my colleagues in the House to support Bill 
C-18.  I am sharing my time with a colleague, the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to rise in support of Bill C-18 which, as we 
know, will provide customs officers with the power to enforce the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that my riding is on the Ontario-Michigan border. 
In fact, it records the third highest volume of border traffic on 
the Canada-U.S. border on the one side, Port Huron, Michigan and 
on the Canadian side at the village of Point Edward.  We have two 
bridges with six lanes of traffic coming and going through the 
country and some 6,000 trucks alone every day crossing both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the southern end of my riding is the Sombra crossing where 
there are tens of thousands of trucks and cars crossing each 
year.  We are open to the United States.  That is patently clear 
with the 17% annual increase in truck traffic alone each year 
which has been going on for a number of years.  We find that more 
and more Americans and others enter Canada through our entry 
ports, especially at southern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, as we know, represents trade and tourism for Canada. 
However, as is always the case, with more traffic and people 
comes more problems.  Occasionally individuals who are attempting 
to enter Canada have committed or are committing a criminal 
offence, individuals who are wanted for all kinds of criminal 
offences. The other problem is impaired drivers who attempt to 
enter. As more and more of these people enter they pose a risk to 
all Canadians.  We do not want these people entering our country. 
We want to stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the reality is that when very impaired drivers try to 
enter, the only thing customs officers can do is attempt to 
detain them until the local police arrive to lay charges and take 
them into custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the taxpayers in the village of Point Edward where I 
live have been subsidizing all Canadian taxpayers because it has 
been the police force in the village that has been called when 
there was a problem.  I have to ask why the taxpayers of one 
municipality should suffer financially by paying for local police 
because a border crossing happens to be located in that 
municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill certainly goes a great distance in balancing that 
inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics from all ports of entry indicate that there were 
8,500 suspected impaired drivers who tried to enter Canada in a 
two and a half year period which is about 3,400 impaired drivers 
rolling into Canada from the U.S. each year.  In the past we had 
little or no opportunity to stop them or apprehend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that each year there have been some 80 suspected 
child abductors, sad cases of people using children as pawns in 
illegal activities, rolling up to customs where little or nothing 
happens to detain or arrest them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians certainly welcome visitors to this country whether for 
pleasure or business, but no one wants impaired drivers to roll 
in or any individual who is being sought on a warrant by the 
police to just simply sail through our customs and enter the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long we have talked about customs officers as being our 
first line of defence at our borders and ports of entry, but for 
too long we have not given them the tools.  In brief, we have 
said one thing but never given our first line of defence the 
tools to do the job.  It is, I can see, the strange dichotomy 
which at long last is being corrected by this bill. 
This bill responds to three factors.   The first and the obvious 
is that those who are the first to have contact with individuals 
entering the country must have the right to detain and arrest 
those who may be committing a criminal offence or a person for 
whom there is an outstanding warrant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we tend to forget that customs officers live in and are 
an important part of our communities.  They have been frustrated 
when they have been incapable of preventing persons alleged to 
have committed serious criminal offences entering our country. 
This bill gives them the right and the authority to do what we 
want them to do and in fact what they want to do and that is 
detain suspected criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and finally, this bill takes pressure off local police to 
respond to border problems because local taxpayers have been 
subsidizing directly the policing function that ought to have 
been carried out by the federal government.  If anything, I 
suppose I can suggest that this legislation could go a step 
further and that is that the legislation as drafted would require 
that the prosecution of the offence be carried out by so-called 
provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some jurisdictions where the RCMP are the provincial 
authorities the policing cost is divided 70% by provincial 
payment and 30% by federal payment.  This is clearly not the case 
in Ontario where the RCMP are not provincial authorities.  In 
British Columbia for example where the RCMP by agreement are 
provincial authorities referred to in the bill, the prosecution 
of border crossing offences are paid for out of the 30% federal 
contribution, yet in Ontario it is a different situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could ask, why should the taxpayers of Windsor who pay for 
local police pay for prosecutions of offences at, for example, 
the Ambassador Bridge or the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel.  I could say 
the same thing about the people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope and trust that the standing committee will examine this 
issue in the bill and perhaps look at it more fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it I would suggest that allowing customs officers 
to prosecute as peace officers would recognize them totally and 
absolutely as such and would free up local police to deal with 
local problems and not problems associated with international 
trade and travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, on balance I know that the people in my riding 
are pleased that the pressure is going to be taken off the local 
police.  I think Canadians should be pleased that customs 
officers are now going to be able to deal with those people who 
for various reasons are coming into our country and we do not 
want them to come in because they are impaired or because they 
have committed offences for which there are outstanding warrants. 
As such I think this is a good piece of legislation.  It is an 
important piece legislation.  I believe it deserves the support 
of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House of Commons 
to speak on this particular piece of legislation, Bill C-18, an 
act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact a very timely piece of legislation.  I would go so 
far as to say that it is a good initiative.  I am encouraged to 
see the government bringing this legislation forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deals specifically, as previous members have mentioned, with 
the power to enforce Criminal Code sections as they pertain to 
powers of arrest at the border crossings or the first point of 
entry for persons coming into the country.  As previously stated 
this piece of legislation is aimed at increasing the powers of 
customs officers themselves in their ability to arrest without a 
warrant and to release from custody in cases where an arrest has 
been effected without the warrant from a peace officer being 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peace officers themselves I would suggest would be greatly 
aided by the ability of the border crossing guards or the customs 
officers being able to effect this duty independent of the 
involvement of the police here.  Much like police themselves, 
customs guards are routinely encountering a great deal of what I 
would suggest ongoing difficulty at the border involving persons 
coming into the country under the influence of alcohol to 
whatever degree and this is certainly something that we want to 
deter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke in the House previously, as have other members, with 
respect to the difficulties Canadians face daily on the roads and 
the carnage that results from impaired driving.  It is a very 
legitimate purpose that customs officers would have the ability 
to make that intervention and to effect an arrest.  This is not 
to say that the age old common law powers of arrest and a 
person's ability to make a citizen's arrest could not have been 
utilized, but this certainly legislates it and empowers customs 
officers specifically in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Designated officers at customs stations and border crossings 
also encounter a fair degree of danger as it pertains to the 
illegal importation of weapons into the country and often cases 
involving the importation of drugs and banned or illegal 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is trite to say that persons who are prepared to take these 
risks are often individuals who could be described as desperate 
in some circumstances.  Customs officers are basically in the 
line of fire when they discover a person may be in possession of 
illegal substances, illegal handguns or other items.  They are in 
a position of confronting the individual at the border, which can 
lead to a dangerous situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one concern about the bill.  The increased power of 
customs officers to effect arrest and to exercise their 
discretion is not backed up with specific protections for those 
persons wielding this new power.  I am sure this will be 
discussed at the committee level.  I speak specifically of such 
things as the right to carry firearms and the right to wear 
protective body armour like a flak jacket or a bulletproof vest. 
This has to be given more thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simply empower customs officers to make these arrests and to 
intervene more at Canadian borders is a good idea in principle 
which I and my Conservative Party colleagues endorse and 
encourage, but we have to be very careful when we empower people 
to give them adequate protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some irony in the timing of the bill.  Less than two 
weeks ago there was a reading of private member's Bill C-211 
sponsored by my Reform colleague from Langley—Abbotsford.  That 
bill also dealt with peace officers being granted authority with 
respect to arrest warrants.  Apparently the government did not 
feel this was a proper initiative and failed to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard other members refer to increased traffic at our 
borders.  This has been taken into account.  It is an important 
factor when one considers the amount of traffic that flows daily 
back and forth across our various border crossing points.  We 
enjoy the largest unguarded border in the world between Canada 
and the United States, which is by far our biggest trading 
partner.  That is certainly beneficial to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of the new powers of arrest for customs 
officers is very much a good thing.  It will allow customs 
officers to carry out their daily tasks more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most positive elements of Bill C-18 would be to add a 
section to the act that would allow customs officers to handle 
impaired drivers in the same manner as peace officers.  This will 
perhaps lessen the workload of some local constabularies whether 
the RCMP or the municipal police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted with great interest the possibility of including in the 
ability of a provincial prosecution office the additional duty of 
handling the types of cases that would be brought forward by 
customs officers. 
That is something that could be explored.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the House based on my experience that 
provincial prosecution offices, much like the offices of the 
municipal and RCMP forces, are very much weighted down already. 
The downloading of this on to provincial crown offices is not 
something that should be entered into lightly as an initiative by 
the federal government.  It is certainly something that could be 
looked at in the sense that it would be done on a per diem basis 
or contracted to various provincial offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about a matter that falls solely into 
federal jurisdiction, that is international trade across our 
borders, although we are into the area of criminal activity per 
se involving impaired driving as an example or possession of 
firearms, there is room for some interaction and perhaps 
interplay between provincial prosecution services and those put 
forward by the federal Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to impaired driving I can only reiterate comments I 
have made in the House.  My party and I support tougher drunk 
driving measures.  Bill C-18 is important because it gives 
customs officers an effective interventionist role in combating 
impaired driving within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers and obligations placed on customs officers under Bill 
C-18 are very much in line with those currently found in the 
Criminal Code under sections 495 to 497 and specifically under 
subsections 495(3) and 497(3) which put customs officers very 
much in line with their ability to act as peace officers, as 
designated by the Minister of National Revenue, as if they were 
in fact peace officers.  An official designation would be placed 
upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking the feedback I have received on this 
initiative is positive.  Customs officers are embracing the 
initiative and are prepared to act in this new found role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another section of Bill C-18, however, clearly states that 
designated officers may not use their new found responsibilities 
to engage in the sole purpose of searching for evidence.  This 
might be a reasonable limitation.  I would like to hear from the 
officials in the customs office, union, law enforcement officers 
and other civil libertarian organizations and associations 
throughout the country at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area we have to tread lightly on.  When bestowing the 
powers of arrest and intervention on customs officers, we have to 
be very careful when it involves an infringement for the sole 
purpose of gathering evidence.  There has been much contention in 
the past on this area of the Criminal Code.  I suggest there will 
be continued contention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final portion of the bill deals with proposed amendments to 
the Criminal Code to ensure it corresponds with new sections of 
the Customs Act.  I have a few concerns about the impact of Bill 
C-18.  Perhaps the minister or parliamentary secretary could 
provide further details on how the government plans to address 
potential problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will customs officers be able to respond adequately to the 
emergency type situations I referred to earlier?  There are 
sensitive areas when a customs officer encounters a person 
engaged in an illegal activity or engaged in an offence under the 
Criminal Code for impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will have to be an allocation of funding and a commitment 
to increase resources as they relate to the training of customs 
officers and how to deal with the new powers bestowed upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen by example in the House involving previous 
legislation, the Liberal government is often quite quick to grant 
new powers or to expand powers as they pertain to arrest or 
search warrants.  We do not necessarily see adequate back-up in 
terms of resources to allow individuals to effectively carry out 
the particular powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very much interested to see what commitment we will 
have from the federal government to adequately arm and protect 
customs officers in their desire to combat crime at Canadian 
borders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern with respect to granting customs officers the 
ability of peace officers to avoid providing additional resources 
to municipal and federal police forces.  I do not think that is 
the intent of the legislation.  I do not think that there is an 
attempt to take powers away from police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to see the reason given that no increased 
funding would be put into the area of expanding the availability 
of justices of the peace to assist police officers.  I would not 
want to hear that money could not be allotted for that because 
money was being put into the area of increased training, et 
cetera, of customs officers at our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When customs officers are put in a position where they have to 
act like police officers and carry out the duties, it is 
extremely important they have the feeling and the assurance the 
federal government will give them the training and back-up they 
will need to perform that role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the legislation which will make the job of 
customs officers easier by granting them new authority, I do so 
on the premise the government will not give carte blanche to new 
obligations without proper support in terms of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, as I have said 
throughout my remarks, we support the legislation in principle. I 
look forward to the opportunity of discussing further details and 
fine tuning the act at committee level.  It is a very important 
and timely piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many customs officers throughout the land have felt a need for 
the legislation for some time.  I commend the minister for 
bringing it forward.  I look forward to discussing it further at 
committee level. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member's speech and to other members who spoke 
this morning.  In my comments I want to address some of the very 
worthwhile questions posed by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By expanding the scope of powers for customs officers to include 
Criminal Code offences, I stress that we are not creating an 
extra police force.  It is a means of assisting police forces 
across the country.  It does not replace them in any way, shape 
or form.  The new powers designated to customs officers will be 
limited and specific, and there will be adequate training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now many custom facilities have secure rooms so a lot of 
infrastructure is in place.  Earlier today there was a direct 
question from a member of the Reform Party on this cost. Quite 
frankly Revenue Canada has in place in its customs facilities 
sufficient infrastructure.  There will have to be some upgrading 
and some training at a cost of probably about $5.5 million across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as large as one would expect because we already have 
most of the facilities in place now.  We are just upgrading and 
putting in facilities where needed.  It will probably be 
somewhere between six and nine months after the legislation is 
brought into law that training will be complete.  For the 
security and safety of our own officers and the public, obviously 
we will not move before everyone is properly trained and the 
facilities are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure members opposite, the Canadian public and, most 
important, the men and women who work in our customs facilities 
that this will be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What new powers?  Customs officials will have the power to 
detain and arrest individuals for Criminal Code offences which 
they encounter in the course of their regular duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the hon. member would wish to respond.  I have more 
details if he wishes them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her assurances and her remarks with respect to these new 
duties and the funding.  I think that is reassuring.  I do find 
it interesting that, at a time when we are increasing the powers 
and essentially expanding on the duties currently carried out by 
customs officers, I cannot help but draw an analogy with what is 
happening to our ports police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much like customs officers, ports police perform a very specific 
duty that is very much akin to or in keeping with those duties 
carried out by peace officers.  I would say that there is a 
direct analogy that can be made with those duties carried out by 
customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does appear to be a bit of a contradiction in the 
government's approach in bestowing new powers on a body of 
individuals, customs officers, while at the same time we know 
there is legislation being brought through.  It is actually 
through the House now and it is going to wipe out the ports 
police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is a concern that I have.  I do not know that this 
is the proper forum to address that but I point that out to the 
hon. member.  Again, I look forward to discussing it further with 
her and other members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having heard those comments 
I do wish to assure the member opposite that in this situation it 
is our people working at the border points who are also very 
anxious to have this legislation.  We are enhancing their role 
with their consent and also in support of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing something that is beneficial to the people most 
directly involved as well as society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe as an example that people would be able to understand, I 
will just show where the limitation would come in.  I will take 
the example of someone, a customs officer, encountering someone 
who looks impaired at a border point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our officers under this legislation would be authorized to 
administer a roadside screening test but for individuals who 
registered high on that test, they would be then turned over to 
the police who would then do the administration of the 
breathalyzer test and obviously all the other things that would 
go after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being very limited.  We are having our customs officers 
perform their functions at the border points only.  Obviously 
between border points the RCMP, as it has always done, will be 
responsible for the security of our borders and will continue 
with its functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have here is a beneficial piece of legislation. 
It is absolutely essential to us that we properly train and 
provide all the necessary tools and safety and security not only 
to the public but to people who are within our employ and who the 
department is responsible for.  We take that responsibility 
extremely seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged to hear 
again the reiteration that the training is going to be there 
specifically because again, calling on my own experience, 
impaired driving cases essentially thrown out of court or where 
problems arise are often at the early detention stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore for these customs officers who are encountering 
impaired drivers at the border, I am very encouraged to hear that 
they are going to be given a great deal of training in this area. 
The indicia required to be identified by the customs officer in 
this case who is detaining the person for impaired driving is a 
very subjective test that has changed over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Case law has been voluminous in this regard.  I am sure that all 
peace officers who receive this training are going to have to 
study this in a very comprehensive way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

parliamentary secretary who has done a tremendous job in starting 
off the debate this morning on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair would beg 
the indulgence of the hon. minister.  The hon. minister is deemed 
to have spoken on the bill, having introduced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May we have unanimous consent for the Minister of National

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. 
members for giving me this opportunity to speak.  I know they 
believe that we should give all members an opportunity to speak 
in the House, particularly the Minister of National Revenue with 
such good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me thank my parliamentary secretary who did an excellent job 
this morning in starting off the debate and speaking on my behalf 
as I was not able to be here.  She has a lot of experience in 
this area, being a former customs officer during the summers. 
Certainly she is very able to speak on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to seek the approval in principle of the House for 
Bill C-18, which will give Revenue Canada's customs officers the 
additional power they need to enforce the Criminal Code at the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 is important for the protection of Canadians and 
Canada.  It closes an enforcement gap which restricts our 
officers from acting to control criminal activities such as 
impaired driving, child abduction and the possession of stolen 
goods at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also gives officers the authority to detain individuals 
who are the subject of outstanding arrest warrants.  In this 
regard Bill C-18 is vital to our government's efforts to increase 
the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs has always been vital to Canada's safety and prosperity. 
Today we have a customs administration which is allowing 
Canadians to seize the opportunities created by liberalized trade 
and travel while protecting us against threats to our social and 
economic well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before Confederation our customs officers were our first 
line of defence at the border.  In 1997 this is still a key part 
of their mandate.  However, like any modern organization, customs 
must change to reflect the realities of a more transient world, a 
world where crime has no borders.  That is why customs officers 
have always worked with the RCMP and other domestic and 
international law enforcement agencies to keep our communities 
and our streets safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our position at the border gives us a unique 
advantage to identify and intercept criminals.  We want to take 
advantage of this unique position.  Make no mistake, our customs 
officers do come face to face with crime at the border.  We have 
the numbers to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 16 months our officers have seized over $850 million 
worth of drugs, almost $2 million worth of contraband alcohol and 
tobacco products, and more than 2,600 illegal imports of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day in and day out our customs officers do a magnificent job.  I 
am proud of the fact that Canada has one of the finest customs 
administrations in the world.  However, we want to give them the 
tools to do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am here today, to talk about this important piece 
of legislation which will help make our streets and our 
communities even safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a compelling argument why this legislation is needed. We 
know that customs officers encounter criminal behaviour at the 
border which is outside the parameters of the Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that they cannot take appropriate action places all 
Canadians at risk.  I refer to a case involving Jonathon Yeo. Mr. 
Yeo was refused entry to the United States because he was out on 
bail for a criminal offence.  As a Canadian citizen he was 
allowed to return to Canada because the officers did not have the 
authority to detain him.  Mr. Yeo went on to abduct and murder 
two young women before taking his own life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will provide our customs officers with the authority 
to detain and arrest individuals who are suspected of committing 
Criminal Code offences or other offences until local authorities 
arrive.  Officers hands will no longer be tied when dealing with 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem and the need for this bill is borne out by recent 
statistics, during the last two and a half years, at Canadian 
ports of entry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers have encountered over 8,500 suspected impaired 
drivers, almost 200 incidents of suspected child abduction, in 
excess of 2,000 individuals subject to arrest warrants, and more 
than 500 individuals in possession of suspected stolen property, 
mostly vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police have a very strong working relationship with customs 
officers but they all agree that customs officers must be able to 
intervene effectively when they encounter Criminal Code offences. 
This will make a tremendous difference to the enforcement of our 
Criminal Code at the border and as a result make for safer 
communities in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 marks an important change in the role of customs 
officers.  This bill is a product of consensus.  Everyone sees 
merit in it.  Members across have spoken of the merits of 
this bill and are fully supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lobbying to strengthen the ability of our customs officers to 
deal with Criminal Code offences, we have the support of all the 
groups we consulted including the customs officers union, police 
at both the provincial and federal level, Canadians Against 
Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, CAVEAT, Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving and the tourism industry association of 
Canada.  All agree this change is badly needed and we are 
prepared to take action but only after moving carefully and with 
thorough deliberation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the government settled on this course a number of 
alternatives were considered but were found to be either 
impractical or too costly.  Again and again we kept coming back 
to one solution, to extend the scope of customs officers arrest 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will change the scope but not the nature of the duties 
of our customs officers.  They currently have the powers to 
arrest for offences contained in the customs act.  This solution 
will expand the scope of these powers to include Criminal Code 
and other federal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using this legislation we propose to provide customs officers 
with a first response capability at the border, allowing them to 
detain and arrest individuals who are suspected of having 
committed offences or who are in the process of committing 
offences under the Criminal Code.  This first response capability 
will bridge the gap between the time customs officers detect a 
Criminal Code offence and the time when the police can intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first response capability means Canadians can expect more 
effective and efficient enforcement of our criminal laws and 
customs officers can fulfill their protection role at the border. 
A first response capability will strengthen an already strong 
partnership with the law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is good news for all those who care about the safety 
of our communities.  These powers will enhance our contribution 
in the fight against crime.  For example, if a driver appears 
impaired the customs officer could administer the initial breath 
test.  If the roadside alert indicates a problem they would 
immediately turn the suspect over to the police for the 
administration of a formal breathalyser test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers can and will make a difference, a view also 
shared by the police community.  For example, Windsor police 
Deputy Chief Michael Dagley said of this bill: “It is a real 
plus because it means we are not out looking for the individual 
and they are in custody quicker”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for sweeping powers.  Customs officers will 
not be expected to participate in Criminal Code investigations or 
to transport prisoners.  Customs officers will only be allowed to 
use these new powers while on duty at points of entry.  Not all 
customs officers will be given this expanded power of arrest. 
This broader role will only be carried out by designated customs 
officers who will be drawn from those who are in regular contact 
with the travelling public.  In practice, this will involve about 
2,000 to 2,500 members of the current customs officers workforce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be assured that these designated customs officers 
will be trained to ensure that they act fairly, responsibly and 
within the confines of the law in carrying out their new duties. 
This training will be coupled with a clear accountability 
structure which will outline situations calling for a first 
response action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress again that our officers and their unions 
support this course of action.  Their president, Ronny Moran, 
said last spring: “This is tremendous news for Canadians. 
Finally the longstanding gap in entry port enforcement will be 
bridged and Canadians should welcome the announcement as an 
effort to improve their safety”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with Mr. Moran and he has informed me that he has 
written to all members of Parliament asking them to support this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot deal with the issue of customs officers powers without 
addressing the very difficult issue of arming customs officers. I 
am aware that some employees and indeed some members of the 
public, as has been expressed today, believe that customs 
officers should carry weapons for their personal protection.  We 
have considered these views very carefully.  However, it is the 
government's position that the introduction of firearms at the 
border is unnecessary and could lead to the escalation of 
violence instead of the resolution of differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers carry out their jobs effectively without 
firearms and we have every reason to believe that this will 
continue.  Therefore we will not arm Canadian customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to summarize the changes this bill will 
bring about.  It will give customs officers the tools they need 
to enforce the Criminal Code at the borders.  It will correct an 
enforcement gap that is not acceptable to the public, local 
police agencies, victims rights groups or customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Priscilla de Villiers, founder of Canadians Against 
Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, CAVEAT, said in 
March: “Obviously we are very pleased that this gap has been 
closed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual Canadians will be provided with the type of 
protection that results in safe homes and communities.  It will 
reinforce Revenue Canada's commitment to protect the health and 
safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Canada's customs officers can take up this new mandate 
and enforce the law wisely.  Change is nothing new for the men 
and women of Revenue Canada.  I am confident that they will take 
these changes in stride and continue to embrace the role to 
protect our nation.  Customs officers are eager and in fact 
impatient to get on with the job, to get the training that will 
equip them for the task ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the solution contained in Bill C-18 will 
work and I am pleased to present it for the approval of my hon. 
colleagues in this Chamber.  I am also confident, regardless of 
one's party affiliation, that this is a bill that will be 
supported because it is good for Canada and good for Canadians. I 
think it will receive support from all members of the House on 
both sides.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciated the minister's speech and his exhortation that we 
would support the bill because he believes it is good for Canada. 
However, before we decide on that I have a couple of questions 
regarding the men and women who are protecting our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that there are two categories, the ones who are 
trained and the ones who, shall we say, are less well trained.  I 
understand that the customs officers have to take a 14 week 
course, pass with at least a 70% mark and then be subject to a 
one year probation before becoming a customs officer.  However, 
at the same time, we have others who have to take a two and a 
half week course without an exam and begin work immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to confirm whether my facts are 
correct on that basis.  He said that the people who were going to 
be issued this certificate would be drawn from the people on the 
front lines.  I understand that these are younger people with 
less experience and less training who are the ones who are quite 
often on the front lines.  Is it the people with the two and a 
half weeks of training and no exam who are going to be issued 
with the certificates or are the certificates designating these 
people with the enhanced powers going to be given only to those 
who have had the full training, passed the exam and the 
probation? 
Are we going to let young people with two weeks training on 
the job run around arresting people?  I would like to hear from 
the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the hon. member that all those people who will 
be designated will have the full training.  As the hon. member 
knows, we have a number of people at customs who are students and 
work on a part time basis and on a summer basis.  I am very proud 
of the work we do to create this opportunity for students and 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who will get the designation will not be the students 
who are there on a part time or summer basis.  These will be 
people who are permanent and they will be designated. As I said 
earlier, there will be 2,000 to 2,500 members across the country 
who will receive this training.  Once they have fulfilled their 
training program and they are approved and passed, then they will 
be designated. With that designation they will have the ability 
to respond and carry out the additional powers which we will give 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member that they will be well trained and 
they will be required to fulfil their training and be examined 
before they are designated.  That is the whole purpose of 
designation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. minister on his 
speech, much of which we can agree on but some of which we have 
some difficulty with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Minister of National Revenue aware of the drug 
trafficking, the trafficking of people, arms, alcohol and 
cigarettes that is occurring in Quebec and Ontario across our 
borders with the United States?  Is he aware that serious 
allegations have been made that our police officers have been 
told to turn a blind eye to this situation that has been going on 
for far too long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to also know what the hon. minister would like to 
do about that and whether or not he would like to entertain a 
discussion with the Minister of Justice on this particular and 
very serious issue.  We can give our customs officers all the 
powers that they can have but if they are not going to be allowed 
to enforce those powers and if they are being told by people 
higher up that they should not enforce those powers, that is a 
serious breach of justice within our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member from Esquimalt.  I want to congratulate him on the 
good work that he did in the last Parliament on a variety of 
issues, including the land mine issue which he put a lot of work 
into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the view of the member.  It is very important to protect 
our borders.  A number of initiatives were brought forward in the 
last Parliament.  One was the anti-smuggling initiative that we 
put forward to ensure that we protect our borders. We are looking 
at smart borders by utilizing technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years we have invested a lot of money to ensure 
that we have increased the technology, to share the information 
with law enforcement officers domestically as well as 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly that is a very important concern.  It is something 
that we as a government dealt with in the last Parliament as 
well, as the hon. member knows, in terms of trying to ensure that 
we have adjustment to our taxes to make sure that we have less 
contraband flowing across the border.  I think we are renowned 
around the world as having one of the best customs offices and 
some of the best people dealing with our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows of course that we have the largest border 
of any two countries.  It is not easy to manage.  However, I think 
we are doing an excellent job in terms of the resources we have. 
It is a priority for me to ensure that we protect our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of our agenda to protect our communities 
and make our communities safer.  I think the hon. member will 
support this bill because it is very much of some of the things 
that he has talked about, to protect the safety of our 
communities and to protect our borders.  He can be assured that 
we will do everything possible to make sure that we reduce any 
contraband across the border. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have two questions for the minister with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I asked during my remarks on the bill if the government 
had made an estimate as to the incremental cost to be incurred by 
the department in training these newly empowered customs agents 
to act as quasi-peace officers and furthermore what the cost of 
upgrading any facilities might be.  I inferred from the 
parliamentary secretary's comments that there was not clear 
estimate of the costs and that there were some facilities in 
place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reasonable of the opposition and of all Canadians to expect 
the government to have some sense of what the incremental cost of 
a legislative change is going to be.  That question has not yet 
been answered either from the information provided by the 
minister's department or by him or the government speakers in 
debate on this bill.  That is my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question concerns the basis on which the minister 
decided these newly empowered customs agents will not be issued 
firearms to properly discharge their new responsibilities. Does 
he think that a customs agent can stop, detain and arrest a gun 
smuggler or a drug smuggler or a child abductor or a kidnapper 
with pepper spray and a baton?  Why is he not prepared to give 
those customs agents what they need to protect themselves, to 
protect Canadians and to enforce our laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the 
member was not in the debate when some of those answers were 
brought forward.  My parliamentary secretary just responded to a 
Conservative member 15 minutes ago.  She said that the cost was 
$5.5 million and if the member read <I>Hansard</I> he would find 
that out.   Clearly there is a cost to upgrade some facilities. 
We already have a number of facilities to detain individuals but 
there are areas we need to upgrade.  Both the upgrade in some 
infrastucture and the training will be $5.5 million. I have 
stated this figure in a number of previous speeches.  If the 
member were reading his press clippings he would clearly 
understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member does not know this.  He referred to our 
customs officers stopping gun smugglers.  He should know that 
under the customs act we are already doing that.  We are doing 
that under the present legislation and it has not changed.  This 
is an increase in expanding powers under the Criminal Code.  We 
are doing what we can of the things he has talked about.  It is 
under the customs act.  If he reads the act it will be very clear 
to him that those already exist and we are taking those 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my speech, I have not seen a need to arm our 
officers. Maybe that was the point the hon. member was making. We 
do not feel it is necessary.  We have examined the issue closely 
and we have no intention of arming our officers, but we are 
looking at providing protective vests for those officers who feel 
they need them.  We will provide that option to them.  We are 
looking for the best product available to provide to our 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be good for the officers.  It is supported by the 
union.  The union leaders have written to all members of 
Parliament asking them to support this bill.   I have read of a 
number of groups that are supportive.  This is a good bill that 
should be supported by all members of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge our thanks and our indebtedness to our customs people 
who defend our borders.  They work very hard and diligently to 
ensure they do the best they can to uphold the laws of Canada, to 
defend our borders and to ensure our country is safe from as many 
drugs and illicit contraband as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue said 
this is a very small bill but provides a great deal of benefit. 
My first reaction to that comment is that after four years why is 
it so late if it is such a small bill that provides such a great 
benefit to this country. We will leave that for the parliamentary 
secretary and the minister to explain at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These small changes are a step in the right direction but I have 
some serious concerns about the training of many of the people 
who we ask to defend our borders.  I understand that many people 
involved have very little training. 
Sometimes it is as little as two and a half weeks, they do not 
even have to pass an examine and then they are on the front lines 
protecting our borders, trying to apply 70 pieces of legislation. 
After two and a half weeks I am surprised that they even know the 
names of the pieces of legislation, let alone the contents.  But 
there we have it.  The minister assures us that he is doing his 
job well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister quite specifically if it would be customs 
officers who are fully trained who would be designated according 
to section 1 of the act to be licensed to be peace officers under 
Bill C-18.  He assured us that it would be only those who are 
fully trained.  In fact, if I understood him correctly, he said 
that those who are fully trained will be given additional 
training as well to make them fully conversant with the 
additional powers that are going to be conferred upon them and 
that we would be able to differentiate between those who have 
been given the additional powers versus those who have not by 
means of some identification and a certificate that is indicated 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the minister really understands these powers 
and has a full complement of people who are fully trained to do 
this.  I quote from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> article of Monday, 
October 14, 1996.  It states that “College students average 80% 
of the front line customs and immigration officers at Pearson 
airport on a year round basis.” If they represent 80% that means 
we are pretty thin on the ground with full time, well trained 
people.  I wonder whether there is actually enough staff to be 
able to ensure that the job is being done properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is talking about drawing 2,000 people and licensing them 
according to this act, bearing in mind the number of ports that 
we have to man, I think it would be incumbent upon the minister 
to assure the House that there is no problem about the adequacy 
of staffing to ensure that it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the adequacy of the premises that we 
have at these ports and crossings because if we are going to give 
the powers to the customs officers to arrest and hold until such 
time as a peace officer appears on the scene, then I would hope 
that there are adequate detention facilities on site in order for 
them to detain these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about arresting those who are impaired or 
appear to be impaired and those who may be involved in abductions 
and so on, I can very, very easily see that they could become 
violent.  With the small number of fully trained customs 
officers, I wonder if we are placing some of these people in some 
danger in the event that an issue does become quite violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt one day it will happen and we will look back and say 
“Why did we not provide the adequate detention facilities and 
adequate staff for the proper arrest to be made”.  I would like 
the minister to think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Southeast asked the minister about the 
news item regarding drug smuggling across the St. Lawrence River 
with seeming impugnity.  I think we need to address that.  I have 
seen on television where at night in the winter there are skidoos 
and other vehicles crossing the St. Lawrence River and not in any 
way being apprehended by anybody, police officers, peace officers 
or customs officers or anyone else.  According to the television 
clip that I saw, there was a significant amount of gunfire at the 
same time.  It sounded like a pretty lawless place. That happens 
to be in your neck of the woods, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that something would be done about it, taking it up 
with the minister to ensure that we can fully protect our 
borders.

secretary, it is a small bill, it is a big benefit.  The Reform 
Party is pleased to support it and we certainly hope that it will 
go a long way toward improving the safety of Canadians, improving 
the integrity of our borders and ensuring that Canada is a safe 
place and not a safe haven.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to rise this afternoon to speak on this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important at the outset to look at some of the 
figures involving the background of this legislation.  In the 
last two and a half years Revenue Canada customs officers have 
encountered the following criminal situations at ports of entry 
into Canada:  over 8,500 suspected impaired drivers, almost 200 
incidents of child abduction, approximately 68 Criminal Code 
offences in my riding of Fort Erie at the Peace Bridge in 1996, 
over 2,000 individuals subject to arrest warrants and more than 
500 individuals in possession of suspected stolen property. 
These are usually vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics are very disturbing.  Although customs officers 
reported these incidents to local authorities, the police were 
only able to apprehend a few suspects.  This fact is most 
disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These incidents occur at most land, air and marine ports of 
entry, with about 80% located on highways, 10% at airports that 
handle international traffic and 10% at seaports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise this afternoon to speak on Bill C-18, 
an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code, a bill 
that will make these statistics a thing of the past.  This is a 
piece of legislation that is truly very near and dear to my heart 
and to the many customs officials that work the front line at the 
Peace Bridge border crossing in Fort Erie in my riding of 
Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After my election in 1993, I was approached by the local customs 
union representatives about the difficulty in apprehending 
impaired drivers at the Fort Erie-Buffalo crossing.  In fact, I 
attended at the border and observed their observations and even 
stood out at the primary inspection line and observed the cars 
coming across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been several incidents in my riding and the customs 
officers were rightfully frustrated that they did not have the 
power to detain suspected drunk drivers until the local police 
could intervene.  The standard operating procedure at that time 
was to let the driver through and notify the local police, hoping 
and sometimes praying that they would catch up with any impaired 
individuals.  This was unsatisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it was shocking.  Most people in my riding just could 
not comprehend this.  Some said “Well, an individual has powers 
of arrest, citizen's arrest”, but the customs officers were very 
reluctant to take these powers because of concerns if they were 
injured in doing so, the question of false arrest, liability 
implications, et cetera.  It was not recommended by either 
management or the union.  This was unsatisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The course of action that was followed was far too dangerous for 
our border communities and too many times resulted in an accident 
before the driver could be apprehended.  My customs officers told 
me that this had to change and I agreed with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, an in-depth study of officers' powers confirmed this 
and concluded that the existing situation was unacceptable.  The 
study proposed an extension of customs officers' powers to 
include Criminal Code offences.  Support for this idea came from 
groups such as Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating 
its Termination, which we have come to know as CAVEAT, police 
forces, Revenue Canada, employees, the customs excise union and 
the general public in my riding of Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, I began to prepare a private members' bill on this 
issue.  I met with some of the stakeholders, including the 
customs excise union president at that time, discussed how this 
issue should be addressed and what the best course of action 
would be.  Around this time I was informed by my colleague, the 
former minister of revenue, that the department was also looking 
to resolve this problem by amending the Customs Act and the 
Criminal Code.  This government listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was Bill C-89 that was tabled this past March.  This 
legislation, as many of you know, unfortunately died in the Order 
Paper in April.  Over the course of the summer I was pleased to 
learn from our new minister of revenue that reintroducing this 
legislation was a priority. 
On October 30 he fulfilled that commitment.  I congratulate him 
for the expeditious manner in which this important bill was 
reintroduced.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation, customs officers will be 
provided a first response capability at the border with the power 
to detain or arrest individuals suspected of having committed 
offences which fall under the Criminal Code, such as impaired 
driving or child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the legislation is to bridge the gap between the 
time customs officers detect a Criminal Code offence and the time 
when the police can arrive to intervene.  Provincial authorities 
will continue to be responsible for prosecuting individuals for 
Criminal Code offences at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers encounter criminal behaviour at the border that 
is outside the parameters of the Customs Act and the fact that 
they cannot take appropriate action places all Canadians at risk. 
This legislation will correct an enforcement gap which is not 
acceptable to the public, local police agencies, victims' rights 
groups or customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these changes will result in safer communities, 
but above all they will help to contribute to long term public 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that once the bill receives royal assent it could 
take six to nine months to implement this initiative and that 
customs officers will be trained to ensure that they act fairly, 
responsibly and within the confines of the law in carrying out 
their new duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current training programs will require changes and no customs 
officer will be permitted to carry out the first response 
function until he or she has received and passed the appropriate 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an entirely new function because customs officers 
are already designated as peace officers for the purposes of the 
Customs Act.  They already undergo extensive training on search, 
seizure and arrest.  Customs officer training also includes 
instruction on the charter and its implications in exercising the 
powers of search and arrest.  I understand that plans are under 
way to introduce training on the use of force for personal 
protection and to compel compliance with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No customs officer should be put in the position of having to 
carry out this or any other function without appropriate 
training.  I urge the government to carefully plan this training 
as it is crucial for the customs officers to have adequate 
education and training.  They want nothing less and our border 
communities demand nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that the additional responsibilities will only be 
given to officers who deal directly with individuals seeking 
entry into Canada.  This will involve about 2,500 members of the 
current customs officer workforce of 3,200.  I am pleased to note 
that it will not include any student customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young people in my riding have part time or summer jobs at 
customs and, realistically, do not have the experience or the 
time to be properly trained for this function.  We certainly do 
not want to put them at risk.  I was very happy to see that this 
concern was taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to discuss the functions that extend beyond the drinking 
and driving issue that were brought to my attention two years 
ago. Customs officers currently have the power to detain and 
arrest individuals for Customs Act offences such as smuggling. 
They also have the authority to search for and seize goods, such 
as illegal drugs, firearms, contraband tobacco and liquor, and 
prohibited materials such as child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of the customs officers' existing powers of arrest and 
detention will be broadened to bridge the gap between the time 
customers officers detect a Criminal Code offence and the time it 
takes for the police to arrive and intervene.  The changes will 
also authorize customers officers to arrest individuals who are 
subject to arrest warrants issued under the Criminal Code.  In 
the case of impaired driving, designated customs officers will 
administer the preliminary roadside screening test.  Individuals 
who do not pass the screening test will be turned over to the 
police for a breathalyser test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial authorities will be responsible for any further 
investigations and prosecutions of individuals for Criminal Code 
offences at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who received a package from the customs excise union 
last month will have undoubtedly read the letter written by Mr. 
Stan Johnson, a customs inspector at the Windygates, Manitoba 
border crossing.  As recently as October 3, 1997, Mr. Johnson was 
unable to detain an impaired motorcycle driver returning to 
Canada from an evening of drinking in the United States.  Minutes 
after crossing the border one of the two motorcycle drivers lay 
dead from a deadly combination of speed and alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident from Mr. Johnson's letter that he is struggling 
with the frustration that his role as a customs officer did not 
allow him to stop this tragedy.  It is wrong to subject our 
customs officials to this frustration when these tragedies are 
clearly preventable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this House to deal expeditiously with this legislation. 
It has been demanded by customs officers, border communities, 
elected representatives and the families and friends of those who 
became victims of impaired drivers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The customs and excise union has been calling for this type of 
corrective measure for more than a decade.  The customs and 
excise union and those on the front line at the Peace Bridge in 
Fort Erie support this measure.  In a recent letter the union 
said there was a tremendous need to bridge a very obvious gap in 
legislation that had existed far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on a couple of questions asked in the House 
today.  Why has it taken so long to get to this position?  The 
situation is not a simple one.  We have to do it right.  It was 
necessary to assess thoroughly the nature and severity of the 
situation across Canada.  It was also necessary to properly 
evaluate the various options and to discuss them with both 
federal and provincial officials.  I am confident the proposed 
legislation is both reasonable and workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of arming customs officers has often been raised. 
Again it was raised in debate today.  The health and safety of 
customs officers have been and will continue to be priorities. 
Customs officers do not carry firearms.  The proposal to extend the 
scope of their arrest powers would not change that.  Some customs 
officers believe they should carry a weapon for their personal 
protection.  However it is the government's position that 
introducing firearms at the border is unnecessary and could be a 
serious mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bear in mind that this is not entirely new ground for 
customs officers.  As I said, they are already designated as 
peace officers for purposes of the Customs Act.  To date they 
have not needed a firearm to fulfil their responsibilities safely 
and efficiently.  Arming them could invite more violent behaviour 
on the part of travellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If not handled properly, an officer's firearm could provide an 
otherwise unarmed traveller with a weapon that could actually be 
used to injure or kill the officer or other people in the 
vicinity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to bear in mind that the role of customs officers 
will be very limited.  They will provide a first response only. 
They will not be expected to participate in Criminal Code 
investigations or to transport prisoners, as the police will 
intervene at a very early stage.  For these reasons the 
government has chosen not to arm our officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some concern was expressed about the impact on police and the 
judicial case load.  It would probably be very minimal. 
Furthermore we expect that implementing this initiative will have 
a deterrent effect.  We expect the number of incidents will drop 
significantly when the travelling public realizes and becomes 
aware that the customs officers are empowered to deal with 
criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, this is good legislation.  It should 
hopefully be passed unanimously by the House.  The concerns being 
expressed today are very minimal.  The country would be well 
suited to defend its borders and citizens from criminal 
activities, from individuals crossing its borders with criminal 
intent and undertaking criminal activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my constituency has about three border crossings.  It is 
basically in the middle of the Rocky Mountains or the range 
immediately to the west of the Rocky Mountains.  Some of these 
border crossings have Canada customs persons present and only one 
person overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visualize a situation where customs officers, because of the 
lack of manpower, will have the opportunity under the legislation 
to take certain remedial action in situations. The question in my 
mind is, that being the case, whether they will actually have the 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are situations right now from about 11 o'clock in the 
evening to 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning. The one border guard 
could be tied up in a potential smuggling situation involving a 
car coming across the border.  Over the ensuing half hour 
period—and this is a very common occurrence—five or six or 
seven cars could be lined up, waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could end up giving these border guards extra resources 
legally.  Will the government be prepared to give extra financial 
resources and people to actually get the job done?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the same lines I am also concerned about the fact that 
many people involved in Canada Customs at the border in all 
likelihood would be easily overpowered in the event of a physical 
altercation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government given thought to changing the profile of the 
people it will be hiring for Canada Customs?  If more physical 
action is expected by Canada Customs inspectors, will courses be 
available?  Will training be available for them so that they come 
up to speed and handle themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for this legislature to enact law that will 
empower the officials, but is the government actually prepared to 
devote the fiscal resources to Canada Customs to ensure it will 
be able to carry out that law without there being the potential 
of danger to itself and its fellow workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  It is a very good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give these powers there have to be resources available to 
allow them to utilize them.  The hon. member lives in an area 
where border crossings are very light.  I live in an area where 
there are four border crossings, all of which are very high 
volume border crossings.  The situation of one person being on 
the border would never happen.  There are many people on all 
shifts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to address those concerns too.  Obviously it is a light 
border crossing and criminal incidents would probably not be as 
significant as what I have elaborated in my speech about my area. 
They definitely need the resources to do the job.  I have some 
concerns with one person being on a border in the evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked if they would have the proper training or 
the proper education.  I have indicated that is a necessity.  As 
far as anticipation of more physical altercations at the border 
is concerned, I do not anticipate it will happen any more than it 
happens right now.  They should be properly trained for that. 
Notwithstanding, certainly more training is required and more 
training will be given.  Resources will be committed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his excellent speech.  It is my knowledge that he has been 
consistent and has persevered in bringing the attention to these 
matters that they deserve not only in this Parliament but in the 
last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have worked and lived in constituencies across the 
land with border points.  The member has written to the 
department.  He has been involved in continuing dialogue and 
supporting the legislation as it came forward.  Many members with 
border points in their constituencies have been there, which we 
as a department appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my firm belief that concern for Canadians is not a 
partisan issue.  Members on the benches opposite have the same 
concerns the hon. member and I have about the safety of 
Canadians.  We have different size border points and different 
needs.  I hope we will start on this exercise shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To train staff appropriately, we will probably start with the 
very large centres.  We will do the appropriate training.  We 
will manage this change as well as other changes we have made 
over the past number of years to make our border a smart border, 
a border that customs officers and Canadians can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to hassle people as they cross the border.  We 
want proper risk management.  We want to target goods and people 
who present a security or a criminal risk to the country.

with me, with their national executive and with departmental

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as presented by 
the revenue minister, Bill C-18 meets an urgent need to exercise greater 
control at Canadian customs offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the provinces, including Quebec, that share a border with 
the United States experience situations where individuals from that 
country cross our border while intoxicated, or after committing serious 
offences across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes will affect nearly two thirds of the total 
strength of 3,200 customs officers, a number we believe to be 
insufficient to strengthen border crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statistics published by Revenue Canada show that, over the 
past two and a half years, Canada customs officers have been faced with 
the following situations, provided for by the Criminal Code, at ports of 
entry across the country: more than 8,500 cases where drivers were 
suspected of driving while impaired; 200 alleged cases of child 
abduction; nearly 2,000 cases of persons against whom an arrest warrant 
had been issued; and finally, more than 500 cases of individuals who 
were in possession of allegedly stolen goods, mainly vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While customs officers reported these incidents to local 
authorities, the police was only able to apprehend a few suspects. Such 
incidents happen at most ports of entry by land, air or sea, 80% of 
which are located on our highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that, based on these troubling statistics, 
there is no need for the revenue minister to justify Bill C-18 any 
further. 
The minister also indicated that this bill would confer broader powers 
on Canada Customs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this proposal, customs officers would help police officers by 
taking immediate action at the border. The customs officers' current 
powers to arrest and detain would be broadened in an effort to fill the 
gap between the time when they observe a Criminal Code offence and the 
time when the police arrives on the scene and can take over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes would also give customs officers the power to 
arrest any person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued under 
the Criminal Code. Designated officers could demand samples of breath 
from suspected impaired drivers. 
People who show high levels following this screening test would be 
turned over to the police for a breathalyser test. So it is the 
responsibility of provincial authorities to continue the investigation 
and to prosecute those who are alleged to have committed an offence 
under the Criminal Code at the border.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now talk a bit about Quebec. These stricter measures at the 
Quebec-U.S. border would help Quebec's campaigns against drunk driving. 
Impaired driving is still the primary cause of highway deaths in Quebec. 
Alcohol is involved in about 45% of deaths and 25% of serious injuries 
on the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last decade, in Quebec, the number night-time cases of 
drivers with a blood alcohol content above the limit has decreased by 
40%. Greater control at border crossings would therefore help support 
the efforts of Quebec's provincial police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back now to the bill. The preamble states that a number 
of customs officers will be designated by the Minister of Revenue to 
carry out the new duties. I think the Minister of Revenue should specify 
in his bill the provinces, cities and towns that will be affected by the 
changes proposed in Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the minister should have discretion to designate the 
customs officers mentioned in the bill, but we would like more 
information on this subject. Also, I would like to ask another important 
question to the Minister of Revenue concerning the mechanism for 
selecting customs officers. Will this procedure be carried out in 
co-operation with union representatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes as outlined in this bill will most certainly 
be creating a new class of customs officers. Will their pay be higher? 
How will these changes be reflected in the existing collective 
agreement? Will the seniority clauses be respected? All these questions 
need clarification before our party can take a final position on Bill 
C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will be the limits of the powers given to customs officers in 
their new duties? I hope we are not creating a new police force that 
could end up with the same powers as the RCMP. I need hardly point out 
that our party and the Liberal government have locked horns several 
times since 1993 on the sharing of jurisdiction between Quebec and 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Revenue must therefore make a commitment to respect 
the responsibilities and jurisdictions of Quebec. 
The mandate of the Sûreté du Québec, our provincial police, and of the 
courts imposing the fines and penalties for these criminal acts must be 
respected. Too often, under the pretext of national security, of 
national health, the federal government has used such political 
opportunities to try to convince us that national standards are 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in these difficult years, we do not often see a 
government invest without providing for additional revenues. The 
Minister of Revenue tells us that provincial authorities will retain 
their responsibility to prosecute under the Criminal Code, but he gives 
no information on a very important detail. Who will be collecting the 
fines, Revenue Canada or Revenue Quebec?

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in Ottawa to protect Quebec's interests, 
including the areas that come under provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, 
our party will make sure the federal government fully respects Quebec's 
jurisdiction in the context of Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles underlying Bill C-18 are acceptable, but the way 
these changes in the customs officers' duties will be implemented still 
raises numerous concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, given the budget cuts imposed by the finance minister, 
where will the revenue minister find the money to renovate customs 
offices? Where will he get the money to train customs officers? 
Did the minister estimate the total cost involved in delegating these 
new responsibilities to customs officers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in my speech, I said that these changes will have to be 
made in co-operation with the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenue minister claims he decided to table this bill after 
conducting the following consultations. In 1995, an in-depth study of 
the powers conferred on customs officers revealed that the existing 
situation was unacceptable. There is no need to go back over this, since 
the figures I mentioned just a few moments ago confirm it beyond a 
shadow of a doubt. 
It was therefore proposed that the powers given these officers be 
increased to include offences under the Criminal Code.  Groups such 
as CAVEAT, Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating Its 
Termination, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, police 
forces, Revenue Canada employees, and CEUDA have offered their 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, here again, did the federal government consult the right 
people before tabling this bill?  Did it take the time to go and 
see the people in the provinces who will have to live with the 
amendments resulting from this bill?  Did the Solicitor General, 
who is taking part in the implementation of this bill, consult 
provincial authorities in this connection?  Or is the federal 
government once again getting ready to meddle in provincial areas 
of jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the minister is indicating that implementation of 
this bill could take from six to nine months after royal assent is 
given.  First of all, he intends to train designated customs 
officers, and then to renovate certain Customs Canada facilities in 
order to create secure areas in which suspects can be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, a grey area remains, making it difficult for us to 
see where the minister is really headed with this bill.  Does he 
intend to take a global approach, or has he already identified 
regions where there is a more pressing need for these customs 
posts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions, but we believe in the rationale 
behind Bill C-18 and this is why we are supporting it in principle.

questions posed by the hon. member in his speech, many of the 
answers were delivered earlier today in this debate.  For the 
edification of the hon. member I have no problem restating some 
of the answers. I hope it will assist him because this is a very 
good bill for tous les Canadiens et toutes les Canadiennes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan bill, no matter what the questions or how 
they are posed.  The RCMP will continue to do all of its work 
between the border points across this country.  That will not 
change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of our customs officers throughout this country, 
including Quebec, will also not change.  They are still dealing 
with all these issues under the customs and excise acts and 
the numerous other acts that our customs officers administer for 
us at our border points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a first response not only after discussion with the 
people and the unions involved but is also being supported by 
these same employees inside. They are very supportive.  This 
honourable member may very well find that the head of the union 
of customs will have sent a letter to all members asking for 
support for this bill, and I draw that to his attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not replacing or creating some new police force.  This 
is a situation where we are filling a gap, a narrow gap that 
existed, that will help the safety at first response, the point 
where we can first intercept at our border point, and security 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are situations where children are being abducted.  This is 
the place where we can detain until the appropriate and 
responsible police force comes to the assistance and follows out 
with the rest of the process.  This is the place where a drunk 
driver, driving up to our borders, can be intercepted.  Before, 
we could not detain an individual for a lengthy period of time in 
case the appropriate local police force was not, through other 
responsibilities, able to assist in a timely manner.  This is a 
better situation.  We will have the legal authority to charge and 
to detain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, very clearly this gives us that authority to make an 
arrest where there is an outstanding warrant and then turn over 
to the appropriate authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very positive measures. We are giving the human 
resources, as we have given many other tools over a time period 
in all of our experiences as professionals.  We have to work with 
upcoming technology, new technology.  Unfortunately, I do not 
think all of us get pay raises every time a new machine comes in. 
I wish that were true, but it does not necessarily happen that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, though, a tool, a legislative tool that will assist our 
people, the people who protect Canadians, to do their jobs 
better.  To give the assurance to this honourable member which 
he deserves, yes there has been ongoing consultation and there 
will continue to be ongoing consultation not only with the 
provincial and other policing authorities but with our unions, 
the people who work for us. This is very much a welcome piece of 
legislation and I respect that this honourable member did, in his 
concluding remarks, actually indicate that the Bloc is being 
supportive overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can help with any of his further questions, as a 
parliamentary secretary I am at his disposal to give him further 
briefings whenever he requests that.  As the parliamentary 
secretary, I wrote to the representative of their caucus as well 
as the other caucuses, offering briefings in this matter.

with the election of its first secretary general, Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali.

the summer of 1997 was named the Irish Summer by Heritage Canada 
in honour of the victims of the great Irish famine from 1845 to 
1850.  During these five terrible years in Ireland, one million 
people died of starvation and famine fever. Another one million 
fled across the Atlantic, some 300,000 to British North America, 
including my own ancestors.

potato crops, but also brutal and indifferent economic theories 
which held sway at the so-called centre of civilization.

died on the coffin ships or in the quarantine stations of Grosse 
Isle, Quebec and Partridge Island, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred and fifty years later this government affirmed its 
commitment to preserve and protect the sacred burial grounds and

that Canada always be a nation which welcomes the refugee peoples

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

this House. Bloc members did not dare raise the issue and have a debate

yesterday the tax department released its 1994-95 report which

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the House 
the Liberals are fond of standing up, beating their chests 
talking about how great they are with the UN, about how good they 
are at attacking Saddam Hussein, but they are letting a billion 
dollar trade deal sneak through and hopefully nobody will see it, 
leaving it to the UN to decide what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government stand up and let Saddam Hussein know 
exactly where it stands on that issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we already have.  We have made it very clear that 
they must live up to all their obligations under the United 
Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the hon. member that the proposal to

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
we heard the Deputy Prime Minister say that they let the UN 
decide whether this was a good deal or not, whether trucks were 
all right and whether trucks could be used for humanitarian 
purposes or used by the military.  That is the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to send a message to Iraq on where we stand and that we

fits our export and import laws.

<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Public Works angrily condemned the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers for refusing to allow Canada 
Post to eliminate 4,000 jobs.  His comments indicated a clear 
bias in favour of the corporation and an open hostility toward 
the working Canadians who are fighting for their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister withdraw his damaging statements of yesterday 
and let the parties conclude a new agreement free of interference 
and free of the kind of threats that we heard yesterday? 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

in French I will say now in English.  The two parties have been 
in negotiations since yesterday.  They negotiated and according 
to reports I have, they are doing very well.  I hope that very 
soon we will have a negotiated settlement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
biggest single obstacle in this round of bargaining stems from 
the Liberal government demanding that Canada Post pay dividends 
of over $200 million over the next five years.  Canada Post wants 
to meet those demands by eliminating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since when is Canada Post supposed to generate hundreds of 
millions of dollars in profits when its mandate is to put 
revenues into better service for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister and his government withdraw this unreasonable 
demand for profits, take away the need to eliminate jobs and 
thereby move us toward a speedy settlement in this round of 
bargaining? 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what this government 
and this minister want is a very viable postal service for all 
Canadians so that Canadians can continue to receive the mail and 
Canadian workers can continue to have jobs and create new jobs. 
That is what we are doing.  That is what is on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the hon. gentleman with his connection to the union

continuation of the passenger rail service.  I think VIA's 
management has done an outstanding job at reducing costs over the 
last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the level of subsidy that VIA has at its disposal, it does 
not have the money to refinance for new equipment.  We have to 
find other ways.  What I said in a speech yesterday is that we 
should look at bringing in the private sector, perhaps with some 
kind of franchising arrangement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to the notice I gave yesterday I rise on this question 
of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning the legislative counsel office advised me that 
in response to a request for a status report on a private 
member's bill being drafted for me that the work of drafting this 
legislation is in the hands of a classroom of students at Ottawa 
University. This advice came by phone and subsequently by letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the recent annual report of the House of Commons 
alluded to a partnership between this House and the University of 
Ottawa with respect to training students. That being noted and as 
a consequence I would submit the following to you as a prima 
facie case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, giving this drafting assignment to a classroom of 
students is placing in the public domain certain ideas which I 
assume would be first tabled in this House at first reading of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as a member I have the right to assume and I have the 
right to expect that work carried out on my behalf will remain 
confidential; that is, out of the public domain until such time 
that it is in fact tabled in this House or released by me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hardly think that a classroom of students at a public 
university in any way meets the test of confidentiality of bills 
being drafted.  It is in fact releasing work in progress from a 
member's office into the public domain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, sending this matter to a university class for drafting 
goes outside the parameters of the authority of the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you pointed out in a ruling on October 23 of 
this year, section 52(3) of the Parliament of Canada Act vests in 
the board the administrative rights with respect to members and 
staff.  Clearly by farming out this work to a university class, 
the board has no control or authority over these drafters.  These 
students are clearly not staff of the House of Commons.  In fact, 
by falling outside the purview of section 52(3) they are clearly 
and plainly in the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, if work in my office is to be released into the public 
domain either by me or my staff or House staff, my consent is 
necessary.  This work was sent to the legislative counsel's 
office on the assumption that it would remain confidential. 
Without my consent it has been released to a classroom of 
students, which is by any definition not a confidential setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in the letter I received from the House this morning I 
was advised that my file was being directed by Professor Keyes at 
the University of Ottawa.  Interestingly, this person is one and 
the same John Mark Keyes who works as a lawyer for the Department 
of Justice.  This was confirmed by placing a phone call to him 
this morning at his office at the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fundamentals of privilege is that members be able to 
do their work free from the interference of the crown.  In other 
words, a member of this House does not resort to employees of the 
crown for advice, yet that is what occurred when my file and 
presumably others were sent to him and to his class at the 
University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting that a Department of Justice lawyer has 
advance notice of private members' bills being drafted and has 
input into their creation?  That, I understood, was the reason 
for the creation of the legislative counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this is a serious matter of privilege.  As the defender 
of the rights and privileges of members, I submit to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that this releasing or delegation, or whatever you want 
to call it, of confidential work in progress to a classroom of 
students is in fact releasing into the public domain, without my 
consent, work or matters which are confidential.  It is a prima 
facie case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission I would move that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, giving this file to a Department of Justice official, 
a crown official, is also a matter of privilege, and with your 
permission I would move a second motion on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I would suggest to you that there is a residuary 
discretion vested in your office to correct decisions of the 
Board of Internal Economy when that board inadvertently intrudes 
into matters of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I acknowledge the general principle, as 
enunciated by you, that the board can regulate generally the 
office of the legislative counsel.  However, at some point the 
board made a decision that passed through the threshold of 
reasonableness and in fact became a question of privilege, as 
evidenced by sending members' drafting requests, requests that 
are expected to be confidential, to a class of students at a 
public university and to a Department of Justice lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I request that you exercise this discretion and 
acknowledge that the decision made by the Board of Internal 
Economy to allow students to do our drafting work is evidence 
that there is inadequate legislative counsel support for members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you make the comparison, and I acknowledge that this is only 
a comparison, that there are two legislative counsel in the other 
place and there are still only two for members of this House, 
then I have to say that the members of the other place have on a 
pro rated basis three times the level of service that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the cuts by the board, I would suggest, have passed 
the point of determining the general operations of the 
legislative counsel's office and have triggered the threshold of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, with your permission, I would move a third motion on 
this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has made 
his case. I would like to look into some of the allegations he 
has put forth.  I will reserve judgement on this until I get more 
information.  I want to satisfy myself.  When it is necessary I 
will come back to the House on this particular question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a second question of privilege, the hon. member for York 
South—Weston. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank you for recognizing me today 
during question period to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Speaker has the right to recognize members of 
Parliament during question period to ask questions, I would 
submit to you, Sir, that every member of Parliament except 
cabinet ministers and perhaps parliamentary secretaries has the 
right to ask questions in the House of Commons.  To deny a member 
the opportunity to ask questions during question period, whether 
the member of Parliament is a government backbencher or a member 
of the opposition, is a breach of that member's rights and 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A practice has developed, and it started developing before you 
became Speaker, where opposition members of Parliament who did 
not belong to a political party were treated in a different 
fashion from opposition members of Parliament who belong to 
political parties and indeed treated differently than government 
backbenchers.  That practice is to recognize those members of 
Parliament who do not belong to political parties in the last 
five minutes of questions period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the practice has developed where those members 
of Parliament who do not belong to a political party are denied 
the opportunity to ask supplementary questions.  There is no 
valid basis for that form of double standard, not only with 
respect to members of Parliament on the oppositions side who do 
not belong to a political party but also to government 
backbenchers because they too are treated differently in that 
they are not permitted to ask a supplementary question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that you review this practice, which has developed 
over the years, with the view to treating every member of 
Parliament the same, treating every member of Parliament in a 
fair fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected, just as all other members were elected, by 
constituencies.  We were given a mandate to represent our 
constituents to the best of our abilities.  By allowing this 
practice to continue, Mr. Speaker, you are discriminating against 
the voters of my riding and the voters of the other members who 
find themselves in a situation where they do not belong to a 
political party. That is discriminatory.  I would ask that you 
review the practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I would of course not want to 
be discriminatory either in question period or in the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have tried to do over the years but surely during the 
last two weeks in this Parliament is ensure that more members of 
Parliament can take part in question period.  I think that by and 
large, because it was the will of the House, the questions seem 
on the whole to be much shorter and the answers seem to be much 
shorter.  We have been able to get in more members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the hon. member is suggesting is that every member who 
stands has a question and a supplementary, that would be 
something I could consider.  This would have some other 
ramifications in the rotation and in the number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some parties that have chosen, instead of having a 
question and a supplementary, to have a question by one member 
and a second question by another member.  I find no problem with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the hon. member is suggesting is that there always be a 
supplementary, I will consider it.  If it is feasible to do such 
a thing in question period I will consider it in the hopes that 
this will make for a better question period.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my view, and I share it with you openly, that the 
more members who can get on for questions the more questions we 
can get answered.  It would make in my view, but it is only my 
view, of course, for a better question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in compliment to the House that whereas in last term we 
were getting in maybe 22 to 24 questions in a question period it 
is not uncommon for us now to get in between 38 and 42.  In that 
way I believe it has improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always open to suggestions from members of Parliament.  I 
will take your suggestion under advisement, if that is what it 
is.  It is not a point of privilege if you want me to rule on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you did not give me the 
opportunity to finish my submissions.  I am afraid you have 
misinterpreted my submissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is your wish to get more members of Parliament asking 
questions, that is fine.  What I am saying is that a practice has 
developed and you know that a practice has developed because all 
the questions I have asked in the House since Parliament has 
reconvened have been between 2.55 and 3 p.m.  On no occasion have 
I been entitled to a supplementary question.  In fact today you 
did not even give the government an opportunity to answer the 
question that I was about to put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to enter into a debate with 
the hon. member.  I believe he has made his point and, as I said, 
I will take it under advisement.  I have been trying to get the 
questions in, in a reasonable amount of time.  I would encourage 
all members.  As a matter of fact most questions today came in, 
in quite a reasonable amount of time, but there were some 
discussions on before we came in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is an independent member and of course he would 
fall directly under my purview.  I am very, very much aware of 
that.  By way of improving the question period I will take the 
suggestions under advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise.  I just want 
to put on record that we in the Conservative Party support the 
contention of the government member who spoke previously on his 
point of order.  Similarly I just want to speak very briefly with 
respect to the hon. member for York South—Weston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reading of his question of privilege is that in fact as an 
independent member he is more vulnerable perhaps to the process 
that we have undertaken.  I fully appreciate your position in the 
chair, Mr. Speaker, as having to try to equitably distribute the 
questions both between government and opposition members.  An 
extensive negotiation process went into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to support the hon. member in his contention that he must 
be given an equitable portion of that and that having his 
question earlier in the question period may involve some 
significant rotation point, so I do rise in support of that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his opinion with 
regard to that.  Was that his point of order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you as Speaker are aware that at the 
close of question period there seems to be a rush to the exits. I 
would just put to the Chair that it is my feeling points of order 
and questions of privilege do affect and have a significant 
impact on the governing of the House which you have to oversee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just wondering if there is some way to effect a more prompt 
interjection on your part, Mr. Speaker, in having these points of 
order heard before the entire body of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I can appreciate your request to have as 
many members here as possible to hear points of order. However, 
in the House of Commons members are free to come and go as they 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage hon. members, if they are interested in the 
points of order and the questions of privilege being raised, to 
indeed stay to hear them.  If it proves to be beneficial for them 
then so much the better.

by the member for York South—Weston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps you can consider the impact on the rest of us of 
agreeing to the suggestions made by the member. 
If he were to receive a supplementary question on the odd 
occasions he is here and asks a question, I do not think it would 
detract much from the rights and privileges of the rest of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West—Mississauga, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add some comments to the question of 
privilege raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton.  It is 
very important for you to understand what this means to 
backbenchers and for private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely impossible for me to understand how this could 
happen.  It is not only a matter of privilege but it denigrates 
Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Of course I appreciate the hon. member's 
remarks.  I have not yet decided if it is a question of privilege 
or not.  I am going to look into the matter and when I have 
satisfied myself one way or another I will return to the House if 
it is necessary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to comment on the matter of 
confidentiality.  It is absolutely disturbing to think, with no 
disrespect to the university or to the students, that bills are 
being proposed and prepared for Private Members' Business through 
a student body at the university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again with no disrespect intended toward the students, my 
concerns are to ensure privacy and the legal framework under 
which our business is being conducted.  I always believed that 
drafting for private members' hour was carried out by individuals 
under the direct control of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to know if the Board of Internal Economy was 
aware of this and, more important, I would like to add my 
observation that in my opinion this is a case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for her opinion that 
it is a case of privilege, but I am sure she will give me the 
latitude to decide whether or not it is a case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information has been well documented by the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton.  I will look into the matter and try to get to 
the bottom of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already ruled on this issue in the sense that it was not 
privilege but was an administrative matter.  A few more points 
have been brought into the debate, which is why I want to take my 
time and look at all aspects to see if we can come up with 
something else. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add my support to the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the same concern a month ago in the context of the 
process.  We as members are not being allowed to decide this in 
the House of Commons.  It is being decided by the Board of 
Internal Economy.  We are not being given direct input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a question of privilege on that and I have not had a 
reply as yet.  Things are getting worse and worse as we continue 
down this road.  This needs to be addressed and I would like to 
see the whole House discuss it at some point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to put on record for the whole House and all parties 
involved that the Speaker who chairs the Board of Internal 
Economy and presides over our meetings does not act arbitrarily. 
We seek his guidance quite often but ultimately in the end we as 
representatives of our parties deal with subject matters such as 
the one before the House now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand I am pleased that hopefully by next week the other 
place will have given us royal assent on the Parliament of Canada 
Act which will bring other representatives from the New 
Democratic Party and the Conservative Party to the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should be reminded that this issue has had a fair 
amount of debate at the Board of Internal Economy. I know the 
hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton and other colleagues from my side 
speak to me almost daily about the issue. 
I encourage members from the other parties to do likewise with 
their House leader and representatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
add my voice to those of my colleagues because, earlier, the hon. member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve wanted to address this issue, but you did not 
recognize him. So, with your permission, I would like, on his behalf, to 
tell the House that the Bloc Quebecois very enthusiastically supports 
the point raised by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This having been said, and as pointed out by the chief government 
whip, the issue has already led to intense discussions within the House 
of Commons' Board of Internal Economy, and while I am prevented by my 
oath of office as a member of that board to elaborate, I am surprised to 
see that the unanimity reached in the House does not exist within the 
Board of Internal Economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

into any secrets here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
since everybody else was weighing in on this weighty matter I 
just thought I would put on record that the NDP caucus shares the 
concern raised by the member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope in the days to come that this can be dealt with 
successfully in the places where it should be dealt with.  In my 
judgment it is not a question of it not being dealt with by 
Parliament just because it is being dealt with by the Board of 
Internal Economy.  The Board of Internal Economy consists of 
representatives of the various parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member has a problem he should take it to his member on 
the board and not suggest that somehow Parliament is not dealing 
with it, because that is how Parliament does deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank you very much for your 
interventions.  I will take all that under consideration.  I am

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Lotbinière is quite correct.  He has the floor to respond to a

comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, my colleague 
opposite was a bit surprised at the many questions I had about Bill 
C-18, an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that we in the Bloc Quebecois are here to 
genuinely defend Quebec's interests, and when we see the way our 
friends opposite have been behaving since the beginning of this 
36th Parliament, it goes without saying that we are even more on 
our guard, since the government, using all sorts of excuses, all 
sorts of national guidelines, is trying to interfere in matters 
that concern the Government of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see, for example, what they did with Dorval airport, 
where an agreement had almost been concluded with the Sûreté du 
Québec to assume responsibility for airport security and the 
federal government stepped in and imposed the RCMP, you will 
understand that, because of the powers that will be given to our 
customs officers with Bill C-18, members of the Bloc Quebecois want 
to make sure that provincial jurisdictions are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone is apprehended at the border point, a process 
will be set in motion and things must be clear, that is to say that 
it will be the Sûreté du Québec and the courts of provincial 
jurisdiction, as the provincial authorities, that will have control 
regarding possible charges laid by the legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked a few questions that were not answered.  For 
instance, I asked the hon. member what assurances she had given 
union representatives.  She replied that she had received a letter. 
I did not, however, hear anything specific about whether seniority 
clauses will be respected and whether the collective agreement of 
people represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada will 
also be respected.  So, with this in mind, the Bloc Quebecois would 
like things to be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech delivered not all that long ago made the 
federal government's intentions clear; it intends to use every 
opportunity to get involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction, 
so we are going to remain very much on our guard in reading bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you, however, that we are very much in favour 
of Bill C-18 as such, since the statistics I have given offer a 
very good explanation of why we would like to see customs officers' 
powers enhanced.  However, we want to see all of this happen with 
the utmost transparency and we want to see provincial jurisdictions 
respected throughout the process of passing the legislation, of 
training the customs officers, of renovating Canada Customs posts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everyone, if treated fairly, both in Quebec City 
and in Ottawa, will be very pleased with the passage of Bill C-18, 
for which I reiterate my support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
split my time with the hon. member for Niagara Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to take my turn at expressing support for 
Bill C-18, which will give Revenue Canada customs officers the 
additional powers they require to enforce the Criminal Code at the 
border.  It will be recalled that Bill C-89 ought to have been 
passed last March, but the elections intervened and it was put off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will have a positive impact for all Canadians, 
particularly those in Beauce, where we have the Armstrong border 
crossing.  It will allow us to fill in a gap in enforcement which 
currently prevents our officers from intervening at border 
crossings to control criminal behaviour, such as impaired driving, 
child abduction, the possession of stolen goods.  It also gives 
officers the power to arrest and detain any individual for whom 
there is an outstanding arrest warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will reinforce Revenue Canada's commitment to 
protect Canadians.  Thanks to our position at the border, we have 
a unique advantage in identifying and intercepting criminals.  We 
want to take advantage of our advantageous position.  The bill will 
transform enforcement of the Criminal Code at the border 
considerably.  It will in fact allow us to intercept criminals at 
the border and consequently to provide the communities in our 
country with better protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can assure Canadians that we will provide customs officers 
with training that will equip them to perform their new duties in 
a fair and responsible manner while remaining within the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is that there is no need to have 
personnel at the border carry firearms, as this could, moreover, 
escalate violence instead of helping resolve conflicts.  Customs 
officers perform their jobs effectively without firearms, and 
everything leads us to believe that this is the way it will always 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means is that they will be able to intervene without 
waiting for the police when they believe someone has committed, or 
is in the act of committing, an offence under the Criminal Code. 
They will, for instance, be in a position to take the following 
steps: detain impaired drivers; take a breath sample, hand over to 
the police those whose alcohol level is high enough to justify 
their taking a breathalyser test; detain or arrest suspected child 
abductors; arrest or detain persons against whom a warrant for 
arrest has been issued under the Criminal Code.  Customs officers 
will hold suspects in detention until the police can intervene. 
This makes a huge difference in the enforcement of the Criminal 
Code at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to bear in mind that customs officers will use 
these powers only within the framework of their duties at entry 
points.  They will not take part in investigations under the 
Criminal Code.  With the exception of testifying in court, they 
will not take part in investigations once the police have 
intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, customs officers have the power to arrest and detain 
persons for offences under the Customs Act and the Excise Act. But when 
they observe Criminal Code offences, the only line of action open to 
them is to notify local authorities. The purpose of the bill put forward 
today is to confer on designated officers the power to arrest and 
detain persons who contravene the Criminal Code. This means that customs 
officers will have the power to perform arrests for such offences as 
impaired driving, child abduction or, as I said, possession of stolen 
goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that this bill be passed as quickly as possible so 
that selection and training can start. We hope to implement this program 
within six to nine months after the bill is passed. 
We intend to apply the program at all ports of entry, starting with 
those with the heaviest traffic and the largest number of Criminal Code 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every manned border crossing will have designated officers 
responsible for enforcing the Criminal Code. We are glad that the 
various police forces at the municipal and provincial levels, as well as 
the RCMP, welcomed this change. With this legislation, the police will 
be able to rely on customs officers to arrest and detain at the border 
any person suspected of a Criminal Code offence, which will make a big 
difference in the workload of the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We plan to continue discussions with the provinces and with our 
federal colleagues to finalize the implementation plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Designated officers will be vested with the powers required to 
arrest or detain persons suspected of violating the Criminal Code. These 
officers will work at ports of entry across Canada and will have direct 
contact with travellers wishing to enter Canada. Immediate response 
powers will only be granted to those full time customs officers who have 
received appropriate training. That is why I am pleased to support Bill 
C-18 today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers are our first line of defence in keeping drugs, 
contraband and illegal firearms out of the country.  I am proud 
to lend my support to Bill C-18.  I believe this legislation will 
make our communities safer and will be beneficial for border 
communities such as the one that I have the privilege of 
representing federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this new legislation, customs officers—many of my 
constituents happen to work as customs officers as there are four 
point crossings in my constituency—would provide first response 
capability at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will make the enforcement of our criminal laws more 
efficient and effective and will help to render every community 
in Canada a safer place in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation, customs officers will be given 
the capability of detaining or arresting at the border those 
individuals suspected of having committed criminal offences, for 
example, impaired driving or child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, customs officers have the power of detaining and 
arresting individuals who commit customs act offences such as 
smuggling.  Customs officers also have the authority to search 
and seize goods such as illegal drugs, firearms, contraband 
tobacco and liquor and prohibited materials such as child 
pornography from entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study conducted in 1995 concluded that the existing situation 
was unacceptable and it proposed an extension of customs 
officers' powers to include Criminal Code offences.  The 
recommendations made by this study received support by many 
important organizations and groups such as police forces, Revenue 
Canada employees and the customs excise unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History showed us that if customs officers had had in the past 
the powers, lives could have been saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years ago, sexual predator Jonathon Yeo was prevented from 
entering the United States at the Niagara Falls border crossing. 
He was armed.  American officials alerted Canada Customs that an 
armed man was heading back into Canada.  Sadly, Canadian 
officials did not have the legal right to detain him.  As we 
know, he went on to murder three people before killing himself. 
One of the victims was the daughter of Priscilla de Villiers, 
founder of CAVEAT, a group that has been pushing for expanded 
powers for customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Mr. Yeo, the jury believed that customs officers 
should have been able to do more to assist the police.  I believe 
that the proposed legislation is consistent with the jury's 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our customs officers encounter many criminal situations while on 
duty.  I know, as many of my colleagues here know today, that 
Canadian customs officers perform their duties in an exemplary 
way.  For example, in the last two and a half years, customs 
officers were faced with 8,500 different suspected impaired 
drivers, almost 200 incidents of suspected child abductions, 
cases of individuals who were subject to arrest warrants and more 
than 500 individuals who had in their possession suspected stolen 
goods, most being motor vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of crimes are not acceptable in our community as 
they are hurting all of us.  At this point we may ask:  By 
delegating additional powers to customs officers are we putting 
them at risk?  Bill C-18 will ensure that customs officers will 
receive additional training.  Customs officers will be trained to 
ensure that they act fairly, responsibly and within the confines 
of the law in carrying out their duties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers in my riding have raised the issue of bullet 
proof vests. The Department of Revenue will make bullet proof 
vests available to those designated officers who believe that 
their personal safety will be enhanced by choosing to wear a 
protective vest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the youths in my riding get jobs during the summer as 
customs officers. Some may ask if those student customs officers 
will receive first response powers.  The answer is no.  First 
response powers will be restricted to a fully trained, permanent 
customs officers, full time and part time, who have direct 
contact with people seeking to enter Canada at points of entry. 
Designated officers will respond to the Criminal Code situation 
identified by the students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time this bill receives royal assent it could take six 
to nine months before it would be fully implemented.  Customs 
officers will receive full training during that time and holding 
facilities will be constructed at border points across the 
country.  This initiative will strengthen the already excellent 
working relationship between Revenue Canada customs and the RCMP, 
which will represent a more efficient way in which to help my own 
community of Niagara Falls and Niagara on the Lake and indeed 
every community in Canada a safer place in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that some customs officers believe that they should 
carry a weapon for their personal protection.  However, I believe 
and it is my government's position that introducing firearms at 
the border is unnecessary.  In fact, it could be a serious 
mistake. We have to bear in mind that this is not entirely new 
ground for customs officers. They are already designated as peace 
officers for the purposes of the customs act and to date they 
have demonstrated that they have no need for firearms to fulfil 
their responsibilities very safely and efficiently. Arming them 
in fact could invite more violent behaviour on the part of 
criminals. If not handled properly, an officer's firearm could 
provide a would-be criminal with a weapon that could actually be 
used to injure or kill the officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role the government has in mind for our customs officers 
will be to provide a first response service. They will not be 
expected to participate in a Criminal Code investigation or 
transport prisoners. Police will intervene at the earliest 
possible stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, a great many of my constituents work as 
customs officers.  I am well aware that they are carrying out a 
tremendous job with Child Find Canada and Operation Go Home in 
trying to alleviate the suffering for all those who experience 
the pain of missing or abducted children.  Customs officers have 
every reason to be proud of their contribution to Canada's 
efforts to return abducted children to their homes. They have 
always acted professionally and completely within the scope of 
their authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative changes called for in the legislation we are 
debating today will enhance their ability to assist with the 
retrieval of missing children because it will enable them to 
detain suspected abductors and turn them over to the appropriate 
police authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour and I lend by support to Bill C-18. To those who 
are saying that the government has the intention of creating 
another police force, I say these measures are a means of 
assisting police in their work, not replacing them.  Under this 
legislation customs officers will be authorized to only make a 
preliminary action to hold suspects until police arrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of and I am pleased to support Bill C-18. While I 
fully endorse this initiative, I am asking the House for the 
speedy passage of these changes that will benefit my community 
and other communities across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-18.  As 
previous speakers have mentioned before, you will find a great 
deal of consent in the House for this bill.  It is a bill that is 
long overdue to give our customs officers the powers they should 
have had a long time ago, powers in effect of a peace officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we mentioned before, they are repeatedly confronted by 
situations that at times are dangerous but historically they have 
not had the power to enforce the law at our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, at times we have seen some tragic results of 
individuals who have been murdered.  The hon. member across the 
way mentioned Ms. de Villiers who was murdered by Mr. Yeo who 
came into this country when he was turned away by an American 
immigration officer, after which the American immigration officer 
told our forces on the other side what was occurring.  There was 
a failure to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say at this moment that our officers who work at the 
borders do an incredible job under extraordinarily difficult 
circumstances and we can all be very proud of the work that they 
attempt to do under those difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us just talk a little more about this bill.  As we 
said before, it does give the power of peace officers to our 
customs officers, but we have some concerns over this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one is the concern of the repeated use of students in 
roles that at times could be dangerous.  It has been noted in 
this House that at times up to 90% of customs officers working in 
areas that are high traffic, high density and potentially 
dangerous are covered by students who have only two and a half 
weeks of training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to denigrate the students but we must believe that 
these students must have the adequate training and the protection 
for themselves to carry out the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time passes, as criminals become more desperate, as our 
borders become more porous, the need for these officers to be 
trained appropriately and have adequate protection is going to 
become even more urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only impress on the government that these students who 
were working in this position for their sake must have the 
appropriate training and protection that they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a failure of this bill that it does not address that. 
This bill also does not address the cost factor.  We recognize 
the need for it but the government must also be prepared to let 
us know where the costs are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the way to recoup these costs without dipping into the 
public purse would be to use the moneys from drug traffickers and 
people who are trying to bring contraband across our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long the penalties that have been placed on individuals 
trafficking and bringing illegal contraband into this country 
have been ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals know that if they come into this country and they are 
caught, the chances are the penalties they receive will be 
minuscule compared with the profits from criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example right now and I will get to more later. 
If one were to smuggle five handguns into this country in a box 
one could charge over $50,000 for those handguns.  The margin of 
profit is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from our correctional services that many times the 
penalties for trafficking, the penalties for using weapons, are 
often plea bargained away to get an expeditious conviction. That 
sends a message of absolutely zero penalty to the criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through some of the flaws of the system that we have 
had for too long.  I will go through them piece by piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a large porous border and the problem we have with 
respect to weapons is not Bill C-68.  It is not criminals going 
and getting a firearms acquisition certificate and going in and 
getting a course, applying for a permit and then committing a 
crime. Those criminals who are using illegal weapons in the 
commission of a crime are doing so generally with weapons that 
are smuggled across our border.  They are smuggled across our 
border because there has been a failure to block off this serious 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are paying the price for this and we have done an 
appalling job of trying to prevent this among us.  The 
government's response to this is to invoke Bill C-68 which, at 
least the part that has to do with registration, will do almost 
nothing to make our streets safer and I would argue would make 
our streets less safe because of the costs incurred in trying to 
bring the system forward.  The hon. Minister of Justice knows 
this right now.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than investing its efforts into Bill C-68, I would ask 
that the government invest in supporting our peace officers on 
the line and in the line of duty to do their job and to also 
support and enforce the existing penalties in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will talk about drugs, another very important 
substance that is coming across our borders in contraband.  We 
have again failed to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear, in speaking to law enforcement 
officers recently, that if someone is charged with a crime, 
unless it is murder or an extremely serious offence, they are 
released on bail.  Because of overcrowding due to a failure in 
investing in judges and crown counsel, we have such a backlog in 
our system that individuals who are guilty of serious crimes, 
crimes that affect innocent civilians across this country, are 
being let go or are being given paltry penalties. Criminals are 
walking away laughing because they know that our system is so 
backlogged.  It is such a bureaucratic morass right now that the 
criminals are getting away, which does nothing to bring 
confidence into the justice system for the people of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the amount of crimes reported in this country, 
over 70% of violent crimes are never reported.  Over 80% of rapes 
are never reported.  Over 70% of break and enters and assaults 
are never reported.  It is not because of the police officers who 
are doing their hardest to do their jobs.  It is because the 
public has little confidence that these individuals are going to 
be prosecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 can go a lot further in trying to enable our customs 
officers to enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trafficking of illegal immigrants and criminals into this 
country is a serious problem, mentioned before by members of the 
government and from our side.  This cannot be overlooked. 
Although we have a large border, it is not impossible to deal 
with this issue.  It is in fact essential for us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an illegal immigrant comes to this country with a criminal 
record and is posing a threat to innocent civilians in Canada, be 
they immigrants or citizens, is it not our responsibility to do 
what we can to protect them?  It is a lot more expensive to try 
to get somebody out of the country once they are here than to 
prevent them from coming across our borders.  I think we need to 
keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alcohol is another substance that is brought into our country 
across the borders and is a very serious matter.  Cigarette 
trafficking has also been a serious problem.  The government 
invoked a bill to decrease the price of cigarettes. That did 
nothing to decrease the conduit of smuggling.  It decreased the 
trafficking of cigarettes north-south but did nothing to decrease 
the trafficking east-west.  Furthermore, it increased trafficking 
east-west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia we have a serious problem 
with cigarettes coming from the east and people making a profit 
as a result of that.  A much more serious issue is the health 
consequences of that bill, which has committed over a quarter of a 
million young Canadians to pick up cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an answer that would have decreased smoking among 
youth and would have also decreased the trafficking.  It was to 
bring forth the export tax.  The government did that but it also 
dropped the price.  The export tax alone on cigarettes would have 
cut the legs out from the trafficking of cigarettes north-south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Mulroney did this, I think in 1992, within seven weeks 
the smuggling of cigarettes decreased by 70%.  The Conservative 
government of the day backed down because the cigarette companies 
said they would get out of this country if the government did not 
pull the export tax.  What did the Conservative government do at 
that time?  It stuck its tail between its legs and removed the 
export tax.  The smuggling continued. 
It does nothing to diminish one aspect of cigarette trafficking. 
We have to address all the components of trafficking which are 
the conduits.  Bill C-18 does go some way to do that and I 
congratulate the government for pursuing that course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will talk about endangered species.  The smuggling 
and trafficking of endangered species in Canada is a serious 
problem. Canadians may be interested to know that we are one of 
the top countries in the world for the smuggling of endangered 
species products, everything from powdered rhino horn, tiger 
bones, penguin bones, rare orchids, rare butterflies and birds. 
All of these are brought into Canada and shipped to other parts 
of the world and we are culpable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to act in this area has resulted in the decimation 
of some very important species, species that could have benefits 
for all of us, but more important are the heritage of everyone in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The black rhino population has been decimated by 98% over the 
last 20 years and the elephant population by over 80%, but is now 
starting to replenish.  The Bengal tigers of India were for a 
time increasing after some measures were invoked by India. 
Because of rampant trafficking and slaughter and the lax system 
for trying to apprehend people who are doing this, the tiger 
population is plummeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other species such as the Sumatran tiger and the 
spotted cat of China which are being decimated in large part 
because of the trafficking in these animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that we as a country that prides itself in 
standing for justice, fairness, one which is sensitive to the 
environment, would not enforce the laws dealing with endangered 
species.  Canadians would be interested to know that there are 
only a handful of hard working, overworked, and underfinanced 
fish, game and wildlife officers who are trying to prevent the 
decimation of these beautiful creatures.  They cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem in their job has been the failure of the justice 
department to invoke penalties that fit the crime.  Individuals 
who are trafficking in gall bladders laugh at the penalties.  The 
penalties meted out to them are nothing compared to the profits 
of the trafficking in endangered species.  But there are some 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government would entertain the idea that instead of 
using students in front line customs positions as Bill C-18 
alludes to, which could be potentially dangerous, perhaps they 
could be used with fish, game and wildlife officers to search for 
contraband.  Then we could get a better handle on apprehending 
individuals who are trafficking in drugs and contraband 
materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could also invoke the Pelly amendment such as the 
legislation that exists in the United States which would give a 
lot of teeth to try to prevent the trafficking in endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would again like to lend our support to Bill C-18 
and commend the government in its pursuit of this important 
legislation which will finally give our customs officers the 
power they require to do their jobs safely and effectively.  I 
would also ask the government to for heaven's sake make sure that 
the students who are working in those positions are trained 
properly and protected from harm. Let us also ensure that the 
courts will be empowered to enforce the law in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be for the justice minister to take a very close and 
brutally honest look at the justice system as it is presently and 
to finally delve into the serious problems we have in trying to 
ensure that justice is met, that the Canadian public will be 
protected and that criminals will be arrested and will pay the 
penalty for breaking the laws in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for his thoughtful presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address one of the areas of misunderstanding which he 
has about the bill.  He believes quite honestly that students 
will have the first response powers.  That is definitely not the 
case.  I have stated that a number of times in this House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure him that the decision has been made to give 
these extra powers to full time and permanent part time employees 
but they will not be given to the student officers who we utilize 
in customs, and utilize quite well I might add, having been one 
in 1974 at one of the busiest border points in Canada, the 
Niagara border point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can be assured that the decision has been made and that his 
concerns are unfounded in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have a smart border in Canada.  I do not say 
that just because it sounds nice.  We have designed our customs 
administration to protect Canadian society, and not only against 
contraband.  We have set up a system which facilitates legitimate 
travel and legitimate trade.  We use our intelligence networks to 
target high risk situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to understand the volume we are dealing with.  It 
is a very large border.  We are processing approximately 109 
million travellers a year at our border points.  We expedite our 
trade.  We all know that one out of three jobs in this nation is 
dependent on trade.  It is a growing area.  It has grown from the 
time we took power in 1993.  At that time it was one in five jobs 
and now it is one in three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with 158,000 large importers and exporters. 
There is a huge responsibility at our border crossing points to 
expedite and professionally deal with trade.  However, we must 
always be on the lookout for the other element of society which 
tries to get through our screens.  It is a big responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that the first line people are 
going to be assisted by this legislation.  That is really 
important to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers are phenomenal and they are growing.  In 1996-97 
Revenue Canada processed $248 billion in trade, representing more 
than 28 million transactions, resulting from 10 million 
commercial entries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important for the hon. member to understand.  He 
raises many different areas in his speech in which he has an 
interest but which are not truly the subject matter of this bill. 
However, I am glad to hear that the hon. member is in agreement 
with the subject matter of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let him comment on my comments, but I did want to correct 
the misunderstanding involving the students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.  I know how hard she has worked on this 
and so many other issues and I appreciate her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure, as I am sure all members do, that our 
students are protected and that they are carrying out their 
duties in a manner which is safe, primarily to them as the youth 
of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. 
member two things which I hope she takes back to the minister. 
The first is the potential visa requirement which Canadians will 
have when they cross the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member mentioned, trade is very important to our 
country.  Living in Victoria, it is exceedingly important to my 
neck of the woods, which has over 600,000 Americans coming in 
every year to spend their money in Victoria and the surrounding 
areas.  It is a serious issue for the people of Victoria.  It is 
a serious issue, as she knows, for Canadians across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot impress upon her enough that she speak to the minister 
and ask that he use all of his power to convince the Americans 
that we require an exemption from this visa requirement.  It is 
ludicrous for us.  It will hurt the Americans even more so if the 
visa requirement is imposed.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in my speech I gave a number of I hope constructive 
suggestions that she may take back to the minister, not the least 
of which was the issue of detailing the different contraband 
materials that come into this country, the failure of the justice 
department to deal with this issue once people are brought to 
trial, the need for effective penalties as a dissuasive measure 
for criminals and lastly on the endangered species aspect to 
ensure that our fish and wildlife officers have the manpower to 
carry out their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested that perhaps students could be used in part in less 
dangerous aspects of their job in doing searches, not only for 
endangered species but also for other aspects such as drugs and 
weapons that students could be utilized for.  That might be a 
cost effective way to try to damn up our border which is very 
porous and needs to be plugged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair was aware 
that the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca was very clever in 
bringing some added relevance to the debate.  On questions and 
comments, the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of 
relevancy.  Some of those issues which were raised by my hon. 
colleague across the floor are not particularly relevant to this 
bill as it stands and is going forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions of justice are relevant at any time to our whole 
Canadian society.  We are constantly looking at ways of doing our 
work better.  I think it is always useful to hear different views 
and suggestions presented in a constructive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is not relevant to this bill today, on the issue of 
the visa I would like to say that certainly it is very serious. 
Not only our minister but more importantly the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs is dealing with this issue with the Americans at 
this point in time on their piece of legislation that could 
affect us.  That, as the hon. member knows, is being dealt with 
not only on the political level but on the diplomatic level with 
our ambassador and on other things that have been out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of the seriousness of this issue.  I just did not 
want to leave this debate without addressing that problem because 
I thought it was too large an issue not to say some words on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member and all hon. members on all sides of the 
House who have contributed to the debate today.  I think we have 
an unusual consensus in the House.  I hope now that this bill can 
move toward closer examination at the committee stage with a 
consensus in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  I would like to thank the hon. member 
again for her statement.  I want to again impress upon her the 
fact that we need to ensure that Canada has an exemption for 
this.  As she is well aware, from an economic perspective it 
would be economic suicide for the Americans to invoke these 
requirements on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that there is a model from which we can work more 
co-operatively with them, although we do work very well with our 
American friends now on the issue. Perhaps there is more we can 
do to ensure that we have a greater co-operation between our 
respective law enforcement officers and that we do not see the 
tragedy that was mentioned before by a member from her side on 
the situation of Mr. Yeo who murdered Ms. de Villiers.  We never 
ever want to see a tragedy like that repeated in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you will find co-operation on our side, 
from members on our team who are willing to help the government 
ensure that we have the toughest and most constructive bill 
possible for the benefit of Canadians.

destined for human consumption, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is informed that when this

the member for Hamilton Mountain had completed her discourse at 
any rate.  That would be why she is not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is designed to make sure that Canadian drinking water 
is safe.  I am strongly in support of it but there are some 
difficulties.  I am always concerned when I am on the save 
wavelength as members of the Bloc.  On this issue members of the 
Bloc and I are in concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water control has traditionally been a provincial matter.  The 
bill is purported to look at materials, piping, filtration, 
chlorination systems and matters that are not supposed to be 
under provincial control.  I have tried to look at it from an 
unbiased perspective and to say initially what need exists for 
Bill C-14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone to the organizations in Canada currently involved in 
this area.  For the benefit of all Canadians, let me list those 
organizations.  They are the Canadian Bottled Water Association, 
the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating, the Safe Drinking 
Water Systems Coalition and the Canadian Soft Drink Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contacted these groups for their expertise, advice and 
guidance.  I was fascinated to find these expert organizations to 
a group are all opposed to Bill C-14.  Whenever I find opposition 
of that nature I ask what need exists for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to each one of the organizations.  I have quite a series 
of documents from them.  I want to highlight some of their 
concerns.  Let me start with the Canadian Safe Drinking Water 
Systems Coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group says that it tried very hard to have its opinion 
heard by Health Canada and has been singularly ineffective in 
that approach.  It is bizarre to me that a group that has an 
interest in the issue would not be well heard.  I read that the 
minister says consultation was broad and thorough.  It says 
neither are in fact accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group has a number of concerns.  It says there is no 
documented scientific case for the regulations, no problems that 
warrant this degree of intervention.  It says that nationwide 
infrastructure codes and standards are already in place, safe, 
excellent drinking water standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to talk about problems with things that are not 
correct, warranties that are wrong, and that there are hazardous 
products acts and mechanisms to deal with them.  It talks about 
Revenue Canada customs already having the ability to look after 
enforcement at the border.  It goes through a host of things the 
bill purports to address. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating also expressed 
very vigorously that its attempts to contact, meet with and 
influence Health Canada were rebuffed.  It wanted to co-operate 
but there was poor notification of the introduction of the 
legislation.  Its attempts to meet with Health Canada were 
difficult.  It is also having difficulty finding the scientific 
need for the legislation.  There are problems with our water 
supply but it says not in the areas the bill approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group gets quite specific.  It supplies roughly 90% of the 
domestic distribution of components such as pumps, pipes, valves, 
fittings and faucets, and 90% of the home use water filtration. It 
simply says the bill is unnecessarily intrusive and expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but I probably should not do so because time is 
relatively short here.  Let me say that the groups most affected 
are the industry individuals, the bottled water association and 
plumbers.  They are not small groups.   One group I mentioned 
comprises 600 Canadian manufacturers and installers.  When it 
says the bill does not seem to have a great need, is intrusive 
and could be very expensive, my ears perk up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this an effective use of our resources when it relates the 
needs of Canadians for safety and friendliness?  Costs are 
uncertain.  I have seen significant estimates of costs, but I 
cannot dig up any cost estimates from the government.  They were 
unavailable.  Many other areas are far more desperate for funds 
than this area.  There are waiting lines for health care, poor 
technology for health care and massive loss of nurses and lab 
technicians, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the speech by the member opposite as it related to 
the bill, hoping that she would enlighten me and give me the 
pearls of reason for going down this road.  I picked up a pearl 
from the member for Hamilton Mountain.  She said one problem with 
the bill was the issue of cryptosporidium infection.  The doctor 
that I am, I went to my Cecil textbook of medicine.  For those 
listening who want to do this, it is the 20th edition, page 1910, 
where it mentioned cryptosporidium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at whether the bill would help patients infected with 
cryptosporidium.  Let us cut this monster word down to something 
understandable.  Maybe I could call it crypto.  This organism 
causes diarrhoea.  It is worse in AIDS and immune compromised 
patients, those whose immune system is messed up.  It is not 
treatable so it would be a good idea to prevent it.  Most 
Canadians would recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are eye infections in the young in communities where there 
is warm wet weather and in communities where there is 
overcrowding.  This is not something common to Canada. It is 
spread from animals to humans.  It can be spread from humans to 
humans, usually by contaminated source water.  It does not show 
up in the pipes.  It does not show up in treatment facilities. 
Unsanitary conditions are the main problem.  When found in 
treated or untreated water it is resistant to common 
disinfectants.  In other words it is a tough bug to kill, a tough 
bug to have any impact on.  The bill will be singularly 
ineffective in combating cryptosporidium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pearl of reason for going down this road in my judgment was 
not sufficient.  I searched more and I found some scientific 
information from a group that felt the bill was not sufficient to 
suggest where we could go in a constructive way. 
Reformers try not to only oppose.  We try to say that there are 
some problems with fresh drinking water and that maybe we should 
go in another direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are my suggestions for the minister and for those who might 
be interested.  There are problems with our drinking water. They 
are generally problems at source.  In other words, our well water 
is not so good and our commonest problem with well water is 
leaking sewer pipes.  That is eminently fixable but it is not 
eminently fixable by regulations.  It is eminently fixable by 
going into the ground to fix the infrastructure, to fix the sewer 
pipes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific study found estimates that leakages from sewer 
pipes were from 10% to 35%.  Some municipalities do not have a 
clue how much is leaking.  The recommendation, because these 
sewer pipe discharges may penetrate groundwater supplies and 
contaminate well water, is to fix the leaking and rusted sewer 
pipes.  Funds should be spent to start fixing the infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were more scientific studies to look at our drinking water 
in a broader context.  I found them to be quite satisfying.  We 
have been paying attention to our drinking water.  The Great 
Lakes are a fascinating source.  It is a mini capsule look at how 
we are doing with the environment.  It is interesting that the 
industrial discharge of phosphorous into the Great Lakes has 
dropped from 20,000 tonnes to 7,500 tonnes over the past 20 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study measured PCB levels in herring gull eggs.  They have 
dropped over some 20-plus years from 160 parts per million down 
to below 20 parts per million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doom and gloom is always wonderful, but Canadians do enjoy a 
pretty good standard of drinking water.  Maybe some individuals 
who say that environmental legislation is totally ineffective 
should reflect upon the success we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two reasons for my rejecting the bill would be if it were 
intrusive into an area where there was no need and if it were 
potentially very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Broad categories seem to come from our legislators today.  I 
also have concerns about the regulatory and inspection components 
of the bill.  They are very broad powers of inspection.  They are 
unspecified fees.  The governor in council, which is fairly 
typical, may make regulations that are necessary for anything 
they want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have objected to every single bill when I have come across 
broad regulations.  I have tried to find other constructive 
mechanisms to see what could we do with the regulations.  My 
constructive suggestion is that they should be brought to the 
committee that passed the legislation.  Quite frankly I hope the 
bill does not pass but I presume the majority will get it 
through.  The regulations should come back to the health 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a mini victory on the tobacco bill that passed in the 
last parliament.  It was an accident but the regulations on the 
tobacco bill must come back to the health committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say how strongly I feel it is necessary to have 
scrutiny by the individuals elected to look at regulations so 
that we do not have a framework of a bill in parliament and then 
intrusive regulations doing things that were never intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I will be making this comment throughout my life as a 
parliamentarian.  I simply say that broad regulations that are 
not specified are not a good idea.  Bureaucrats are not the best 
individuals in this area.  We need to have public scrutiny of 
regulations and of other things such as fees and bills. 
It is amazing to look at some of these fees, $300,000 for 
breaking some of these acts.  Three hundred thousand dollars may 
not be much to a bureaucrat who is used to dealing in billions 
but it is sure a lot to the company representatives I spoke with.

why I am opposed to it and suggest strongly that Parliament 
reject it.  This bill further allows the federal government to 
pickpocket us under the guise of what it deems is best for us. 
This bill is unnecessary.  This bill is intrusive. This bill is 
potentially expensive.  For those reasons I will oppose it 
vigorously. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-14 deals 
with the safety and effectiveness of materials that come into contact 
with or are used to treat water destined for human consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is patterned on Bill C-76, which was introduced by 
the former health minister. Clause 3 states that its purpose is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to protect the health of Canadians by providing for the 
certification and regulation of drinking water materials; the 
making of national drinking water quality guidelines— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, we learned that we must be very vigilant whenever 
this government introduces a bill because, as the Reform Party member 
pointed out, certain provisions often go well beyond the stated 
intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon reading Bill C-14, one quickly realizes that, while claiming 
to promote good will and public health, the government is taking direct 
aim at areas under provincial jurisdiction, and this is an affront the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot let go unchallenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me elaborate. Quebeckers feel, rightly so, that drinking water 
is a collective wealth, just like wheat in the prairies or oil in 
Alberta. It is a resource found in abundance in Quebec and, given the 
population growth and the increasing number of droughts, water will 
undoubtedly become a highly coveted resource in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past several months, a large number of experts, company and 
government agencies officials and elected officials have expressed their 
views regarding the privatization of water management, the development 
of groundwater and the export of water. This is not a coincidence, given 
the increasing importance of this natural resource because the world 
population is expected to reach 10 billion people during the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Quebec has a duty to do its best to preserve this 
resource for itself and also for other nations that might need it some 
day. 
It is therefore important to give the matter some thought so as to 
be able to make the right choices based on our values of fairness 
and solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will therefore be easily understood that the people of 
Quebec want to see a serious, comprehensive policy for the 
management of this resource.  Once again, however, with Bill C-14, 
the federal government is trying to get a foot in the door and 
increase its control, let us be frank, to cover everything to do 
with water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is this bill coming from and why is the government 
suddenly getting involved in the management of drinking water?  For 
though the minister firmly denies it, this is indeed what is 
happening. 
Despite vigorous protests to the contrary, the government actually 
wants to regulate everything to do with water—water collection, 
distribution, supply, and treatment systems—in order to take in, 
as stated in clause 2 of the bill: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) any thing or class of things prescribed by the 
regulations to be a drinking water material; 
</UL></UL>
<So it is giving itself the power to regulate everything it finds 
useful to regulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a brief background, until the late 1980s, it was common for 
the provinces and territories to take advantage of the program 
allowing them to consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
This program helped in determining what treatment additives or 
system components should be used in drinking water supply systems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the EPA announced in June 1988 that it was closing down 
its consultation program, some provinces sought assistance from 
Health Canada.  They suggested to Health Canada that it fill the 
void by regulating treatment additives and drinking water system 
components.  It need hardly be pointed out that this call for 
federal intervention did not come from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the federal government has been looking for a way 
to regulate several aspects of drinking water management.  The 
strange thing is that it did not ask itself why the Americans had 
abandoned national regulations. 
Was general neglect the option chosen? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, many states now take it upon themselves to oversee the 
safety of water materials, according to their own standards. This is an 
example of decentralization that this government should consider more 
closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But on the federal side, they are constantly looking for ways to 
fill this regulatory gap which may threaten the quality of drinking 
water. But what about this gap? How wide is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Quebec side, we have our own provincial regulations. There 
are five departments with a key role in the management of drinking 
water. The Quebec department of the environment and wildlife has 
considerable powers in deciding the fate of water related projects. 
That department must approve any project dealing with the construction 
of water systems, water intakes, feeding systems for water treatment, 
sewage systems and facilities for treating waste water, and it has had 
these responsibilities since at least 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under the Environment Quality Act, that department has 
the authority to deliver operating licences for water delivery and 
sewage systems, to monitor water quality and waste water management, and 
to oversee the disposal of riverbeds and sea floors and their 
shorelines. That department is also responsible for the construction and 
maintenance of storage reservoirs for water from lakes, ponds, rivers 
and waterways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Natural Resources has responsibilities throughout 
Quebec that have a profound and lasting impact on water management. It 
is responsible for water resources and for Hydro-Quebec, for the 
management and use of public lands and for the mining industry. It also 
assumes provincial responsibilities related to mapping, surveying, land 
registers, geology and remote sensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Municipal Affairs also has a key role in 
municipal decisions on the construction and management of water 
facilities. Under the municipal code, municipalities can amend or repeal 
regulations to allow any company or individual to build or manage water 
facilities. Furthermore, the municipal code provides that all 
regulations must be subject to the approval of those entitled to vote 
and of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities have tangible and critical responsibilities in the 
area of water management. 
They must ensure that individuals and businesses can drink this water. 
Cities own and manage most water systems. They are responsible for the 
production and distribution of drinking water, and for the collection 
and treatment of waste water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Sorry to interrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, another department, 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has always had considerable 
influence on soil and water management in rural Quebec, for example 
through programs for land drainage, water course excavation, grain 
crop development and dairy and swine production.  In the early 
1990s, this department turned to sustainable development by 
focusing more on resource conservation, soil degradation and 
erosion, and reducing underground water and ground water pollution 
by pesticides, fertilizers, manure and effluent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be clearly seen that, even in the absence of federal 
standards, Quebec and several Canadian provinces are not leaving 
this field uncontrolled, nor are the various independent bodies 
studying the various facets of the issue and advising governments, 
departments and municipalities on management techniques and 
improvements to be made to the regulations in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Government of Canada has certain powers available 
to it for intervention in the environmental field, in agriculture, 
fisheries and the protection of navigable waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not fools, however.  Since the government cannot 
intervene directly in water management, it is going through the 
Department of Health to get a foot in the door.  It does this, of 
course, in the name of public health.  This is the only way it can 
interfere once again in a field that does not belong to it. 
It would have been presumptuous to intervene directly given that 
the provinces would have reacted and criticized this additional 
meddling by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1982, formerly 
section 108 of the British North America Act of 1867, ownership of 
lands and natural resources belongs to the provincial crown.  The 
power of Quebec and all other Canadian provinces to establish 
legislation on water and other environmental matters derives from 
this right of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the federal government's intervention in the area 
of drinking water through Bill C-14 comes to us from the Department 
of Health and not from Environment Canada. 
Even though health too is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, the 
federal government has always felt free to intervene, program after 
program and national standard after national standard, in this area 
of jurisdiction clearly attributed in the Constitution to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Tuesday, the Minister of Health accused us of being 
opposed to safe water and common health standards for all 
Canadians.  That is totally wrong.  We all want to be on the side 
of the angels.  Who would not want our drinking water to be safe? 
No one, either in Canada or in Quebec, wants to eliminate basic 
public health criteria.  The minister, the Prime Minister and 
everyone in the federal government are all fully aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is sad is this impression, this feeling of superiority or 
lack of trust in the provinces, this notion that, if the federal 
government does not look after the problem, nobody will, this idea 
that there are some things that are too important or too 
complicated for mere provinces to deal with without screwing up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This typical federal government attitude is what lies behind 
many of the rules, politely referred to as “national 
guidelines”, 
imposed on the provinces.  The impression is given that, especially 
in Quebec, people are just waiting for certain guidelines to be 
dropped to dismantle the health system, when it is very well known 
that Quebec has always been a leader in the public health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent examples of home care and drug plans, which were 
introduced by Quebec and which the federal government is now trying 
to imitate, are a clear indication that the provinces have nothing 
to learn from the federal government when it comes to the 
administration of health care, any more than they do in other areas 
coming under their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we are to believe the government, everything would be 
in a mess if there were no national guidelines.  So it is taking no 
chances and Bill C-14 contains a reference to national guidelines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5, under the <I>National Drinking Water Directives</I>, reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.(1) In order to encourage the provision of quality drinking water 
throughout Canada, the Minister may, after having consulted the 
provinces, establish national guidelines respecting 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the concentrations of organisms, organic and inorganic 
substances and radionuclides, naturally occurring or 
otherwise, in drinking water; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the physical and chemical properties of drinking water; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) the aesthetic characteristics of drinking water; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) the methods for analysing drinking water; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>e</I>) the collection, treatment, storage and distribution of 
water destined to be used by humans for drinking or for 
washing the body. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merely reading this clause is enough to clearly see that the stated 
goal of simply regulating “materials that come into contact with or are 
used to treat water destined for human consumption” is largely exceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concentrations of organisms, the physical and chemical 
properties of water, its aesthetic characteristics, the methods for 
analyzing drinking water: all this is far from the definition of 
“drinking water material” found in clause 2 and which reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) any device or article manufactured, sold or represented for 
use in modifying the composition, characteristics or 
properties of water destined to be used by humans for 
drinking— 
</UL></UL>
<Part (<I>b</I>) reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) any chemical or biological substance, or any organism, 
manufactured, sold or represented as a means—for modifying 
the composition, characteristics or properties of water 
destined to be used by humans for drinking or for washing the 
body— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go into more detail but, in short, the provisions deal with 
devices, chemical substances manufactured and sold to be added to water, 
replacement parts, etc. 
Nowhere does it say that Bill C-14 is intended to regulate the colour, 
odour or any other physical or chemical property of drinking water as 
stipulated in clause 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Minister of Health was categorical in his response 
to questions from the Bloc Quebecois about the purpose and scope of Bill 
C-14. He said, and I quote: “What the bill does is regulate a matter 
entirely within federal jurisdiction; that is to say, standards for the 
manufacture, sale and use of mechanisms and equipment used in connection 
with the transporting of drinking water.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manufacture, sale and use of products used in connection with the 
transporting of water, but nothing about national guidelines respecting 
the colour, chemical composition and physical properties of water as 
stated in clause 5 of the bill. If that is not doublespeak, I wonder 
what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the inspectors, and I agree with my colleague from the Reform 
Party on this, Bill C-14 also contains a clause on the enforcement of 
the bill's provisions. It provides for the appointment of inspectors, 
once again duplicating what already exists in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this duplication, the powers conferred on inspectors 
are very broad. At clause 17.(1), the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the conditions for obtaining a warrant under section 487 of 
the Criminal Code exist in respect of the commission of an offence 
under this act but by reason of exigent circumstances it would not 
be feasible to obtain the warrant, an inspector who is accompanied 
by a peace officer may exercise the powers of search and seizure 
provided in that section without a warrant. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that, as the inspector would be accompanied by 
a peace officer, one can wonder why the inspector, and not the peace 
officer, should be the one authorized to exercise these powers without 
a warrant. 
Who will decide where and when to act? Who will determine that it is 
appropriate or necessary to obtain a warrant? Peace officers are trained 
to make this type of decision, and they do so under very strict and 
clear rules. As for Bill C-14, it is definitely not clear in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about consultations, they seem to imply that an 
agreement has been reached. This is not an agreement, this is a 
consultation. In addition to the interference, the double talk and the 
lack of clarity surrounding Bill C-14, there is the government's casual 
attitude in saying: “We have consulted everyone, we have responded to 
the provinces' requests and we have the agreement of all the provinces 
to go forward with this bill.” As with jurisdictions and national 
standards, the facts are not as simple as the minister would have us 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there has been no political agreement between the federal 
government and the Government of Quebec on the management of drinking 
water. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, the Minister of Health, for whom I have tremendous 
respect, went quite far in this House by quoting during question period 
a letter from Quebec's deputy minister of health dated May 1996 which, 
according to him, confirmed Quebec's approval of the bill at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, he read only one sentence, taking it completely out of 
context and going against the spirit of the letter. 
He quoted Quebec's deputy minister of health as saying: “As far as 
protecting public health is concerned, we therefore have no objections 
to this bill going forward—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, in that same letter, it was clearly stated that agreement for 
such a project, which involves provincial jurisdiction over natural 
resources, had to come not from the Department of Health but from the 
Department of the Environment and Wildlife, which is in fact responsible 
for the management of drinking water. But the Minister of Health was 
very careful not to read that part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Why make such a statement that support has been granted, by 
misquoting a letter he knew we would receive? In short, why trumpet that 
everyone, including Quebec, supported the bill when this is not the case 
at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But one thing that is certain is that Quebec did not give its 
agreement on this issue. 
There has never been any, nor will there be because, as has already 
been said, Quebec has become far more aware of the need to take 
control over everything concerning water, its transport, its 
processing, its use, in short every facet of that resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, drinking water falls under the jurisdiction of 
the Government of Quebec and we are looking after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to inform you that Bill C-14 is 
inappropriate and must not be passed.  There is already too much 
duplication, too much encroachment, too much interference in areas 
where, most of the time, provinces already have their own 
legislation.  Is there any need for another piece of legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell you that the bottom of the river is 
federal, but the water flowing in it is provincial.  Fish are 
federal until they are out of the water, then they become 
provincial. 
Launches are federally registered, but constructed according to 
provincial standards, of course in keeping with federal safety 
regulations.  The shores are provincial, but the ports are federal 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, drinking water would be a provincial 
jurisdiction, whereas its physical and chemical properties, as well 
as the materials to carry it, would become a federal jurisdiction. 
There is something absurd in all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, in a Throne Speech, the government made a commitment 
to no longer interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction without 
provincial agreement.  No one really believed this.  Fortunately 
not, because once again the federal government is showing us what 
it means by good management and respect for jurisdictions as far as 
the environment is concerned. 
They want to harmonize the laws and regulations, but the words were 
barely out of their mouths before they intervened with legislation 
on environmental protection, the oceans, endangered species, and 
now Bill C-14 with all its implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It encroaches on three areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
namely health, natural resources and the environment.  It dictates 
national standards on the quality of drinking water.  It creates 
new duplication in drinking water quality control.  It is not 
subject to provincial approval and was never approved by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, each sufficient in itself, the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot support this bill in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to table an amendment. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK232">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be 
amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and 
substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-14, An 
Act respecting the safety and effectiveness of materials 
that come into contact with or are used to treat water 
destined for human consumption, because it does not because 
it does not take into account provincial jurisdiction over 
natural resources and health.”

<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to begin the debate on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party on Bill C-14, known as the drinking water 
materials safety act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first blush and at face value, one would perhaps immediately 
jump to the opportunity of giving this bill our enthusiastic 
support.  If one looks at and reads through the background 
material that the Minister of Health has provided on Bill C-14 we 
read the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some drinking water materials may contaminate drinking water, 
for example by leaching lead or by failing to destroy or remove 
micro-organisms.  This could put the health of Canadians at risk. 
Currently, only 30% of product models of components and devices 
sold in Canada are certified to accepted North American health 
based standards on a voluntary basis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a person in this House I am sure who is not 
interested in this government's assuring all Canadians that the 
water we drink is safe and free from any toxins, contaminants or 
poisonings.  There is not a person in this House I am sure who 
would not be interested in this government's guaranteeing every 
Canadian that the water we drink, the food we eat, the air we 
breathe and the drugs we must take for medical reasons are safe 
at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be so much easier to address this bill and give it 
wholehearted support and endorsement if we knew that was the kind 
of framework from which this government was operating and if we 
knew that there was a philosophical commitment to providing 
measures that would guarantee that the products we intake are 
safe at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question about the need in this country for a very 
tough regulatory, proactive position on the part of the 
government on such fundamental issues that pertain to the health 
and well-being of every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, we have a great deal of difficulty trying to 
place this bill in the broader context and trying to understand 
its motives, its purpose and what it is attempting to accomplish. 
On every other front we are seeing the opposite.  We are faced 
with a government that is rapidly moving out of regulatory 
approaches.  It is rapidly seeking ways to privatize areas once 
assumed to be areas for government intervention.  We are seeing a 
government increasingly tied to the demands of transnational 
corporations on a global scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have to go back as far as question period today when we 
raised a very important issue pertaining to lead poisoning.  Lead 
poisoning is found in a great number of children's toys and vinyl 
products on the market today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members in this House of the kind of actions we have 
seen, or lack thereof, from this government on such an important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it in context.  We had findings previously unveiled 
by Greenpeace about high lead content and high cadmium content in 
a number of children's toys and products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, the Minister of Health and Health Canada all 
agreed that this was an issue worth exploring and proceeded to do 
their own studies of high lead content in products that end up 
causing serious neurological disorders when that poisoning enters 
the body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government released its findings a short while ago and 
verified that there is a very high lead content in a number of 
those products.  In fact, it demonstrated that the lead content 
and the cadmium content in a good number of those products was 
even higher than the findings of Greenpeace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was acknowledged but the key point to it all and why this 
is so relevant to a debate on water and the safety of water 
materials present in our society today is that this government 
then said “Yes, the levels are high.  Yes, they exceed Health 
Canada's standards but there is no risk to children in our 
society today”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the reason?  Something to do with the fact that unlike 
the miniblind issue, these products were not necessarily subject 
to high heat intensity or to sunlight and therefore were not 
going to release that lead poisoning.  Never mind the fact that 
there was a level of poisoning that far exceeded Health Canada's 
standards to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question today is where does this legislation come from? What 
is it intending to achieve?  What regulatory framework does it 
fit into?  How firm is this government in meeting its current 
obligations never mind pursuing any other standards or any other 
regulatory approaches? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we not have a critical situation now in Health Canada in all 
those areas I have mentioned:  drugs, food, water and air? We 
have a government that is in the middle of very quietly moving 
toward a privatized deregulated approach seeking to reduce its 
liability.  Those are the words right out of the departmental 
document outlining the full intentions of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the result of that approach?  We have lost a valuable 
research bureau on drugs.  We no longer have an independent body 
in this country for assessing the impact of certain drugs allowed 
into this country and their interaction with other drugs, their 
interaction with foods, their interaction with environmental 
toxins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Come on, a regulatory body of utmost importance has vanished. 
Costing what?  $2 million to $3 million.  That is what this 
government is saving by ridding this country of one of the most 
important regulatory bodies that we have in the whole drug field. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  This is a very important 
debate.  We are talking about the federal intrusion of provincial 
jurisdiction and I do not see a quorum here.  In fact, I even 
have trouble seeing the government sitting in this House to hear 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not see a quorum.  Perhaps I 
should ring the bells.  Call in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre may resume her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>   Mr. Speaker, the drug bureau is 
gone.  This is a very important part of health protection in the 
country under which the regulation of water standards fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know how close we came to losing the food research 
bureau.  Under the government's agenda cuts were made and because 
of pressure from activists in the community, pressures from the 
House and disclosure in the media the government was forced to 
back off that issue for now.  However, we know the agenda is 
still alive and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the water and air research lab of the Health 
Protection Branch.  Where is it and when will it fall?  Where is 
it on the agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we talk about standards and about protecting the health 
and well-being of Canadians and ensuring safe water supplies when 
the government is busy behind our backs eliminating every 
regulatory measure and every research capacity we have to ensure 
the health and safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises a very serious point with respect to this bill as 
well.  So much of what has happened has been done without the 
benefit of parliamentary debate.  It has been done in the most 
secretive manner possible.  It was attempted in the dead of 
summer, without the benefit of public knowledge and input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today with a bill which according to the minister is 
the result of consultations held with various groups throughout 
the development of the legislation.  He goes on to say “These 
stakeholders include representatives from industry, public 
health, consumer groups and standards organizations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we now starting to get correspondence and calls from 
stakeholders in all of those areas questioning where the bill 
came from, why it is on our agenda and why they were not 
consulted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health critic for the Reform Party has touched on this 
issue.  Let me elaborate.  The Safe Drinking Water Coalition 
attempted to have dialogue with the minister and indicated to him 
by letter on July 31, 1997 that the coalition was prepared to 
work with the minister to ensure that standards pertaining to 
drinking water materials were adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That coalition includes the Canadian Association of Pump 
Manufacturers, the Canadian Copper and Brass Development 
Association, the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating, the 
Canadian Water Quality Association and the the Nickel Development 
Institute.  That is a significant number of organizations in the 
country that tried to dialogue with the minister, were prepared 
to work with him on the so-called standards that the minister 
says are necessary.  Now they are wondering where this 
legislation came from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than five minutes ago we requested that there be some 
people on the government side listening to the debate, especially 
the ministers who have introduced this.  We feel it is very 
important.  I think that if they cannot even sit here for five 
minutes and listen to the debate, we have a problem in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid I do not hear a point of 
order in what the hon. member has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  I am calling for a quorum count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Oh, the hon. member is calling for a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was commenting on the minister's claim that Bill C-14 
is brought to this Chamber as a result of a very serious and 
thoughtful consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the evidence points to the contrary.  In fact, we do not 
have any evidence before us to show that this minister consulted 
and that there are groups coming forward to say “This bill is 
important and we want to see you support it”.  We have had 
nothing but individuals and organizations contacting us to say 
“This is a complete surprise We've been talking to the minister. 
We've been offering to help to ensure that the standards are up 
to whatever level the minister wants.  We're prepared to do 
anything”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Water Quality Association had promised to do a 
serious scientific assessment of the risks associated with 
drinking water consumption with respect to drinking water 
material.  That study is in its final stages and is about to be 
released, probably as early as next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the minister was not prepared to consult fully, 
to wait for that kind of helpful advice and then make a decision 
pertaining to legislation that might be in order?  Why are we now 
left with the situation with every group coming to us saying 
“Bill C-14 is very controversial.  Bill C-14 should not be 
before this Chamber.  Bill C-14 is not necessary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have any evidence to the contrary. We do not have a 
shred of evidence from the minister or from any other group to 
say exactly what this bill is supposed to do, what standards are 
not now being met and what the problems are. 
Yet we know that this bill, if applied according to the way it is 
laid out, will place very hefty fines on those who deviate from 
these standards or guidelines, very significant costs to the 
consumers of this country, and yet we do not know the reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us, at least on this side of the House, are prepared to 
say that we need strong regulations.  Sometimes they cost money, 
but we have to pay if they are important in terms of the health 
and well-being of Canadians.  However, we are faced with this 
legislation today and we do not know where all of this money is 
going to go.  What will it accomplish?  How will it protect us? 
What does it mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the Standing Committee on Health said to wait until 
the standing committee gets the bill, but we are here debating on 
principle.  We are here to try to make a judgment call about 
whether to support this bill in principle or not.  We cannot 
because all of the evidence suggests that there is not a basis 
for this legislation and that in fact these high standards that 
the minister talks about could be achieved in other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I refer to the fact that the Water Quality 
Association has pointed out that it is prepared, with the 
minister, to look at the NSF International standards and to apply 
those standards here in  Canada.  As I understand it, one of the 
intentions of this bill is actually to use those international 
standards, probably provided by NSF International, which is a 
private, not for profit U.S. standards agency, which has 
representation from industry, Health Canada and provincial 
representation here in Canada as well as representation from the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill which will supposedly look at those standards and 
apply them here in Canada.  We have a council for water quality. 
We have a coalition of people concerned about safe drinking 
water.  We have a whole lot of other consumer groups which are 
prepared to say they will look at those standards, consider those 
standards and work with us if that is what we think is the best 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begs the question why this legislation?  What is it for? 
What is the rush? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of what we have read to date and on the basis of 
the input that various community organizations are providing it 
is not supportable at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the priorities of this government?  Why are we dealing 
with this legislation at this point when the government is busy 
dismantling all those agencies which ensure the health and safety 
of Canadians is protected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of water, it begs the question of what this 
government is actually doing to ensure safe drinking water in all 
our communities.  Just this morning at the Standing Committee on 
Health we dealt with issues pertaining to health care for our 
first nations and Inuit peoples.  It was acknowledged that there 
are many problems which cause ill health, one of them being poor 
quality of water.  Where is that on the priority list?  Why are 
we not dealing with that in this House?  Why are we dealing with 
legislation when we do not know what the risks are? Why do we 
need to change the standards?  What is wrong with working with 
the groups concerned about safe drinking water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of the kind of inadequate consultation process that 
we believe to be the case, on the basis of the evidence that 
suggests there may be no risks at present, on the basis of the 
fact that this government has been so hasty once more in pushing 
through this legislation without proper dialogue and 
consultation, we will at this point in time oppose this 
legislation.  We urge the government to go back to the drawing 
board and come back with a meaningful plan based on proper 
consultation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member 
speak against this proposed legislation.  I believe the hon. 
member's heart is in the right place.  She brought up some very 
thoughtful questions.  She made some very thoughtful 
interventions.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on a couple of the questions that the 
honourable member asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question was why the haste in bringing in this bill. 
This bill was first tabled in December 1996.  This is not haste. 
This is just bringing something back that because of various 
reasons, breaks, et cetera, has not had due course in the House. 
Having first reading of the bill in December 1996 and talking 
about it almost a year later is considered to be haste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the honourable member spoke about lots of other very 
important health issues that she felt that the government should 
be dealing with at this point in time.  Are we suggesting an 
either/or set of initiatives so that if we do safe drinking water 
we will not be paying attention to other issues?  It is obvious 
that you cannot do all things at once, but this is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why now. Why do we need this bill now?  Why do 
not we wait until we have a lot of evidence, until there are 
innumerable small children who have died from gastroenteritis 
because of drinking unsafe water, until we have had lots of 
people become ill, and then when we have all that data, let's do 
something about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of good public health policy is to be 
proactive.  It is to protect people, to prevent.  It is called 
preventive health care at its very best.  This is what I see this 
bill about.  I think that the question again is why not work with 
stakeholders. It is obvious that it is in the second component of 
this bill when it goes to committee that we will be hearing from 
stakeholders, where we will factor in all of the whys and 
wherefores and concerns and new ideas that will come in to 
strengthen the bill.  That is what the legislation is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to answer by 
asking a question in return to the member, because this goes to 
the heart of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it proactive in terms of the health and well-being of 
Canadians to eliminate the drug research bureau as part of the 
health protection branch?  Is it proactive to eliminate a body 
which costs roughly $2 million to $3 million and lose any 
independent capacity in this country for ensuring that the drugs 
people take are safe? Is it proactive to try to dismantle the 
food research bureau in the health protection branch?  Is it 
proactive to study the lead content of children's toys, identify 
an acceptable content and then say there is no risk for children? 
Is it proactive to pursue an approach of privatization, 
deregulation and reducing the department and the government's 
liability when it comes to people's health and well-being? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the key issues.  How do we put this bill in that 
context if we have a government not committed to being proactive, 
to a regulatory approach in terms of the food we eat, the drugs 
we have to take for medical reasons, the air we breathe, the 
water we drink?  How can we start understanding the need for this 
legislation at this time when we have organizations saying the 
standards the minister is talking about they are prepared to 
co-operate on, they are prepared to implement, they are prepared to 
enforce without the costs that will result from this bill if it 
goes forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proactive approach is to demand a strong health protection 
branch, a strong role by Health Canada and to ensure that this 
government backs off its right wing agenda of privatization, 
deregulation and offloading.  That is what I would like to hear 
from this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I heard with great interest my colleague from across the 
way talking about privatization, deregulation, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member is sitting in the provincial 
legislature in Queen's Park in Ontario or if she is sitting right 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about privatization, I do not think this is happening 
here. But with great interest I heard that the member said that 
we do not have any dialogue with organizations, we have 
inadequate consultations, no proper dialogue.  We have been at 
this almost a year.  How much more do we have to wait, according 
to the member's sense of evaluation, until we have to see the 
light and get a proper bill on the table, which in my estimation 
this is, to get Canada moving?  How much longer do you want to 
wait?  Another two years until you have, in essence, dialogue 
with everybody or are you ready to move right now?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member will want to 
address the Chair in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises 
the important issue of privatization that is happening at this 
level of government.  He may not be aware of the number of steps 
that his own Minister of Health and other government officials 
have taken in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to review the whole situation with respect to 
the elimination of the drug research bureau which costs taxpayers 
$2 million to $3 million and which means the loss of any 
independent research capacity when it comes to drugs and for 
which the minister answered by saying that the private drug 
companies can monitor themselves and do their own research.  If 
that is not privatization what is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his second point, there are a number of organizations that 
felt they were in the process of dialogue with the Minister of 
Health and were prepared to work on the improvement of standards. 
They feel Bill C-14 came out of the blue in the middle of that 
consultation and dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were prepared to do that and were prepared to come 
forward with an important study about the scientific assessment 
of risks associated with drinking water and drinking water 
materials then why could we have not waited to see the results of 
the study?  Why could we not have found ways to achieve these 
objectives other than a very costly mechanism which by the 
minister's own admission could cost consumers and taxpayers in 
the order of $2 million? 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, could the 
member comment on the circular I received from the health 
department which stated that consultations were held with various 
groups throughout the development of this legislation.  These 
stakeholders include representatives from industry, public 
health, consumer groups and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet I presented to the House information that consumer groups 
and industry had tried very hard to be in touch with the 
department on this issue and had been denied.  I have quite a 
correspondence from them.  Does the minister agree with the fact 
that this consultation has been cursory and quite restrictive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite 
right in pointing to the number of organizations in terms of 
the industry, the health activist community and the interest 
groups that there was inadequate consultation if any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I want to clarify with the member across the way what 
minister she is talking about. When the question is put to the 
New Democratic Party, what minister is the member actually— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member for Macleod 
was referring to the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  He 
meant to say member and he said minister.  I believe that was the 
mistake that was made.  Perhaps the hon. member for Macleod 
wishes to clarify the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I made a mistake and 
called the member minister—maybe in another life. I did mean 
member.  I was speaking of the Minister of Health having received 
this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I trust that clears the matter up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the amendment moved earlier by the 
hon. member, just before the speech by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
North Centre.  It is the Chair's opinion that the amendment is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the next time the bill is considered by the House, 
the debate will be on the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-204, an act to require that in the advertising and at the 
opening of a cultural project supported by public money a public 
acknowledgement of the grant be made, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House to 
speak on second reading of my private member's Bill C-204 which 
was introduced in the House on September 25, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this enactment requires recipients of grants of 
public funds for cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant 
has been made and to specify the amount of the grant at the time 
the program is announced or advertised or open to the public. 
Non-compliance may result in the recipient having to repay the 
grant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is significant in that it deals with the very 
emotional issue of spending in the area of arts and culture with 
public money.  The cultural industry in Canada is run by 
bureaucrats, financed by subsidies, yet is virtually 
unaccountable to the government or the taxpayer from which it 
gets the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a well drafted bill which would require little amendment 
to the present legislation.  It simply calls for the 
acknowledgement at the opening of an event and then the 
literature associated with that event of the contribution by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about direct parliamentary appropriations 
like the CBC.  However, it would apply to grants provided through 
agencies such as, for example, Telefilm, the National Film Board, 
the Canada Council, the Canada Information Office and the like. 
It is intended that specific dollar amounts be advertised.  For 
example, Telefilm's contribution of dollars for the film <I>Sweet 
Hereafter</I> or of the dollars for Telefilm and Canada Council 
contribution to the film <I>Kissed</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People reading <I>Hansard</I> or watching this on television 
should be aware, for example, that the film <I>Sweet Hereafter</I> 
basically had a subtitle or a subtext which really was the entire 
plot of the film which was around the incestuous relationship 
between a father and his daughter.  The film <I>Kissed</I> is a 
film specifically about necrophilia.  Necrophilia is making love 
to a dead body. Canadian taxpayers have paid money into this 
film. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those of you who say art must be subsidized in order 
to survive.  The Government of Canada has recently increased the 
budget of the Canada Council by $25 million a year. The 
government spends millions of dollars more on cultural projects 
through various programs operated through the bureaucracy. 
Taxpayers are subsidizing these projects and they have the right 
to know where their dollars are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many projects are funded through a number of government 
programs.  A project may have received Telefilm Canada subsidies, 
Canada Council subsidies, National Film Board subsidies and then 
be broadcast on the subsidized CBC.  Let us tally up the dollars 
and report them to the viewing taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is by no means focused on one region of the 
country.  It is clearly a national concern because these funds 
are provided across Canada for all kinds of events, monuments, 
films and festivals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada recently released the amount of dollars spent 
on culture over the last three years. The federal government 
allocated $2.92 billion to culture in 1995-96.  Let me repeat 
that.  The federal government allocated $2.92 billion to culture 
in the year 1995-96. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal spending on other cultural industries, which include 
film and video production, book and periodical publishing and the 
sound recording industry, amounted to $383 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say these figures very slowly because it is hard to imagine 
the wanton abandon with which the heritage minister seems to 
throw Canadians' dollars around on these issues.  Federal 
spending on heritage activities including museums, historic sites 
and nature parks totalled $624 million. Spending on performing 
arts was up more than 3% to $109 million in 1995-96. We are 
talking about very substantial money here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that few Canadians are aware of the sponsorship 
provided by their federal tax dollars for events even within 
their own communities.  Clearly this bill would not discriminate 
in any way against any particular area of the country. As we all 
know, these dollars are spent on grants for events from coast to 
coast to coast.  Again, this is reinforced by the statistics 
mentioned previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently no government legislative agenda which would 
meet the requirements of my private member's bill.  There is no 
partisanship involved in this legislation, as it comes under the 
realm of all political parties concerned with the spending and 
the accountability for the spending of taxpayer dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that today's debate on this legislation should 
generate meaningful, lively non-partisan debate because it 
covers a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, acknowledgement of the contributions that Canadians 
are making through their tax dollars is the same as acknowledging 
a commercial sponsor. We have to ask do Canadians take ownership 
of these cultural projects that the Canada Council, Telefilm 
Canada, the National Film Board, the CBC and other granting 
agencies give to these projects?  Are they proud of these 
programs or events that are put on?  Indeed, do Canadians show 
any commitment to the fact that their dollars are going out for 
these projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many individuals and groups have complained about the amount of 
dollars spent on culture. Some say too little, some say too much. 
Perhaps some of these complaints are attributable to the fact 
that it is not clearly indicated when the federal government has 
or for that matter has not funded an event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very prone to talking about the $42 billion 
deficit which it inherited from the Conservatives when it took 
over in 1993. We are looking at the fact that there have been 
cuts, but the cuts have occurred in areas that directly impact 
people's lives, ranging from post-secondary education to health 
issues, all the issues that are so important to Canadians in 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is could we during this period of time continue to 
sponsor many of these events?  Much to my chagrin and that of 
many people who have contacted my office, indeed we have 
continued to sponsor these at the expense of very vital issues in 
Canada.  Now that we are reaching the point of having a balanced 
budget and are starting to focus on the very high taxes it has 
taken in order for us to get to this balanced budget point, can 
we continue to afford to spend these dollars on some of these 
cultural projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite by way of example an unrelated issue except in terms of 
comparison. There is a $400,000 expenditure happening, and let me 
qualify that it does not involve government money, within my own 
constituency that would see the expansion of recreational trails. 
And on the other side of the coin there are communities within 
my constituencies that are just begging for $200,000, $300,000 or 
$400,000 to put in natural gas because we are dependent on either 
electricity or wood in the Canadian Rockies for heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are always these points of comparison and in this instance 
what we are saying is that when the heritage minister says it is 
only a cup of coffee a day when it comes to the flag program and 
it is only another cup of coffee a day when it comes to the 
Canada unity office and only five cups of coffee a day when it 
comes to the Canada culture grants, I think our stomachs would 
burn out from a bit too much coffee when it is only one cup of 
coffee a day for these various programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe what is important is the potential for this to assist 
in the unity issue by raising the level of awareness of residents 
of the province of Quebec. For example, the contribution that the 
federal government makes to their culture is very much. For 
example, the Just for Laughs festival is a highly successful 
annual event in Montreal funded by the Canadian taxpayer.  Why 
not advertise that fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, many short feature films funded by Telefilm would 
not have been made without taxpayer dollars. As a matter of fact, 
of the total number of films funded by Telefilm, over half the 
total number of films have been sponsored in the French language 
specifically with Quebec content.  So why not advertise not only 
the government funding but the amount that the taxpayer has 
provided?  Give credit where credit is due, to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this could well raise the awareness in the province 
of Quebec to the dollar contribution provided by all Canadian 
taxpayers to Quebec's language and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is also about accountability.  Because of the extended 
visibility of the grant as a result of this advertising it will 
make the adjudicators, whether it be the Canada Council or 
Telefilm or any of the others, more conscious of the reaction of 
Canadians to the choices they are making. 
If the choices are good, they will receive positive applause and 
if not, Canadians will come down on them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sent to this Chamber to be accountable to the people in my 
constituency, indeed to all the people in Canada, for the 
intelligent use and the intelligent spending of taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I took this issue to the artists at the finance standing 
committee in its prebudget hearing, I said that if I did not want 
to be a critic, how could we possibly have accountability for 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The artists' answer was that fundamentally they would be the 
judge, that they would judge whether this was money well spent or 
not, that they would judge whether this has artistic credibility 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then took it to the minister because that answer was obviously 
unacceptable.  I would like to read in part some of the dialogue, 
some of the testimony that occurred between the minister and me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read from the proceedings of the committee.  I said: “We have 
on a weekly basis, without any solicitation whatsoever, at least 
a dozen letters from people who express a tremendous concern 
about some of the projects that are sponsored by the Canada 
Council. In a letter by Andrew McDermott, one of your senior 
policy advisers to my colleague, when he drew to your attention 
the particular publication that was called <I>Neurotic Erotica</I> 
the letter said—”.  The minister ended up making very light of 
this letter.  Obviously this is a rather unusual title.  In fact, 
the content in my humble judgment of this particular book is 
clearly obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went on to say, however: “I am not the censor.  I do not want 
to become the censor as a politician or to be a censor for 
Canada, but I do ask the question how in the world can Canadians 
who are writing to me and who are writing to many of our 
colleagues to express extreme distaste toward some of this 
material, how can they hold you, the minister, accountable for 
the expenditure of these dollars on the production of some of 
this vile material?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answered: “I think you have to separate the two 
issues.  First of all, you say you do not want to be a censor. 
Surely you do not want me to read every book that is funded by 
the Canada Council”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say that if someone goes to the O Canada exhibit, 
it does a whole analysis of how the Group of Seven was treated in 
1920.  They were treated as artistic pariahs. Then she went on to 
compare today's pornographers to the Group of Seven.  This is the 
minister of heritage.  I could not believe my ears when I heard 
her actually say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of this is that we have today a minister who correctly 
boasts that the government is taking action against abominable 
activities such as female genital mutilation.  Yet by the same 
token and under the Canada Council grants it is sponsoring 
programs about tearing off women's nipples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolutely unspeakable and uncalled for.  It gets worse, 
but for the benefit of the members of this House and people 
reading this transcript or watching on television, I will simply 
say the problem is that some of the material is so vile, some of 
the material is so bad that there is no way that I would demean 
myself to repeat what it is all about.  Yet the Canadian taxpayer 
is paying for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill would do is hold the people who make these 
decisions accountable to the will and the position of the 
Canadian public at large.  That is what this bill is about 
because at the end of the day, the Canadian taxpayer must know 
that this House is going to be holding the people in this House 
accountable for the expenditures of those dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind and because of the importance of this, Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if you would see if there is unanimous consent 
to make this bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

unanimous consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and join my colleague from Kootenay—Columbia in 
debating his private member's bill, C-204, an act to require that 
in the advertising and at the opening of a cultural project 
supported by public money a public acknowledgement of the grant 
be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Kootenay—Columbia mentioned, this act 
requires recipients of grants of public funds for cultural 
projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made and to specify 
the amount of the grant at the time the program is announced or 
advertised and opened to the public.  Non-compliance of this 
requirement may result in the recipient having to repay the 
grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support this bill.  In fact, I have introduced a 
similar bill, namely Bill C-222, which requires the recipients of 
grants to specify what percentage of the project was funded with 
taxpayer dollars.  In this day and age, taxpayers are far more 
observant of how their tax dollars are spent.  As 
parliamentarians, we must act responsibly to ensure that the tax 
dollars are effectively being spent.  I believe that this bill is 
a step in ensuring that tax dollars on cultural projects are 
being spent wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few months I have had the opportunity to speak 
with people from all across this great land of ours and they are 
often quite surprised about how our tax dollars are used for 
certain projects, most notably in instances where cultural grants 
are being pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some instances, some people are appalled at the fact that 
their tax dollars are being spent on what some consider to be 
objectionable material.  I have been asked who is accountable for 
this spending and I cannot provide them with an answer as no one 
is willing to take responsibility.  Typically, everyone washes 
their hands of taking responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tax dollars are being spent on these projects someone must be 
held accountable.  The responsibility falls on the government to 
ensure that the money is spent wisely and for all 
parliamentarians to ensure that the government is acting 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-204 is a step in the right direction.  It targets any 
grants that are provided through agencies such as the Canada 
Council and the Canada Information Office.  As my colleague 
mentioned, this does not apply to direct parliamentary 
appropriation such as those for the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has stated that she is not 
responsible for agencies such as the Canada Council and leaves 
the decision as to who is given what for grants up to the 
council.  I am presuming that this holds true for other arm's 
length agencies within the department as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does give these agencies some autonomy so that they are not 
merely puppets of the governments of the day.  However, on the 
flip side, it does not provide the taxpayer with any 
accountability for their contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads to the question:  Who is responsible?  With the 
principle of responsible government that is  one of the 
foundations of our parliamentary system, the answer should be the 
minister in charge.  However, as I mentioned just a moment ago, 
she does not claim responsibility on how agencies related to the 
Department of Canadian Heritage spend our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must change.  Our government must take responsibility for 
how each and every dollar is spent.  For far too long we have let 
governments spend money without being accountable for how it is 
spent. The taxpayer is demanding that an answer to the question 
on how we spend their hard earned money is given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the purpose of this bill is objectionable.  It is 
not meant to discriminate against any one agency or group that 
receives or gives grants for cultural events and projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Kootenay—Columbia mentioned, Bill C-204 is 
not focused on any one region of the country and is not meant to 
be discriminatory against any of these regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Events and projects are being funded by taxpayers dollars in 
every community across the country.  Although there is some 
discussion and disagreement over the amount of funds provided by 
the federal government to subsidize such events, some individuals 
feel too much money has been spent on events.  Some individuals 
feel more should go toward promoting cultural events.  This is 
not the purpose of this bill.  I will not be debating those 
arguments now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will say that is that under this private members bill, 
the taxpayers will have some say, albeit indirectly, over how the 
tax dollars are being spent and a right to know when and where it 
is spent.  Governments not held accountable succumb to pressure 
and go on wasteful spending sprees, resulting in higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government claims credit for balancing the budget, 
Canadians on the street know that the budget has been balanced on 
their backs.  They are fearful that governments not made 
accountable can easily run a deficit.  There is no law for this 
government to operate within its means and I commend the 
Government of Alberta for introducing the law requiring future 
governments to operate within their means.  Perhaps this 
government will see the light and introduce a similar bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making the public aware of various cultural projects which 
receive grants, either in whole or in part, the arm's length 
agencies, such as Canada Council, will be somewhat more 
responsible and accountable for their choices as to who receives 
what.  Otherwise public pressure resulting from some unwise 
choices may lead, in extreme cases mind you, to funding for their 
agencies being decreased by the federal government in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the many facets of private members' business is to fill 
the gaps that the government leaves open.  Bill C-204 fills one 
of those gaps.  I would encourage all my colleagues from all 
sides of the House to support this initiative.  It is a small 
step in making us more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on record to show that the governing party in 
the House has denied unanimous approval to make this bill 
votable.  It is denying accountability to the Canadian taxpayer 
for expenditures on cultural grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to take a moment to express my personal 
gratitude to those individuals and groups who promote and 
preserve Canadian heritage through various projects and 
performances.  This bill is not intended as a barrier to these 
groups who are receiving funding, but instead it is intended to 
provide some accountability with the expenditure of taxpayers 
funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking today on Bill C-204, introduced by my hon. colleague, the 
Reform member for Kootenay—Columbia, the short title of which is 
the cultural grants acknowledgement act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its object as stated in the summary is, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—[to require] recipients of grants of public funds for 
cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made 
and to specify the amount of the grant at the time the program 
is announced or advertised and opened to the public— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More precisely, this is a bill which is aimed at making 
cultural organizations and artists publicize the funding they 
receive from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this a reasonable idea.  People who receive a grant 
ought to mention it; that would be a normal thing to do.  Where I 
disagree is that we should have to pass legislation requiring this. 
As representatives of the people, as lawmakers, it is our role to 
solve problems affecting society and to see that public affairs are 
properly administered.  We do not have to pass legislation on 
everything, endlessly multiplying the number of acts and 
regulations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before considering the bill, we must ask ourselves whether 
there is a problem in terms of publicizing the fact that a grant 
has been given, something which is far from obvious.  One has to 
wonder whether the Department of Canadian Heritage, targeted by 
this bill, has serious difficulty in having its participation in 
artistic projects acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of problem has never been raised on the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.  We have not seen studies 
complaining of the Department of Canadian Heritage's lack of 
visibility.  Would that cause a problem in the riding of the member 
for Kootenay—Columbia or in English Canada?  If not, is the focus 
of this bill solely Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to my colleagues that this issue of 
acknowledging public funding is not a problem for artists.  With 
the cuts to the cultural sector in recent years, the problem is 
often the lack of public funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, even artists who are known sovereignists are not 
shy or ashamed to reveal the federal government's participation. 
For example, the credits of the film <I>Octobre</I> by federally 
blacklisted filmmaker Pierre Falardeau acknowledge the financial 
participation of Telefilm Canada in the film's production.  It 
appears in big capital letters.  The next line, also in big capital 
letters, reveals that the film is a coproduction with the National 
Film Board of Canada.  That does not cause any problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is Micheline Lachance's book entitled <I>Le roman 
de Julie Papineau</I>. 
This book gives a fictional account of the days of the Patriotes 
as seen through the eyes of Louis-Joseph Papineau's wife.  It is 
mentioned at the beginning of the book that Les éditions 
Québec-Amérique are funded by the Canada Council's block grant 
program. Once again, this poses no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members, and certain zealous federalists in the 
House, must be made to understand that, although these 
organizations contribute to Quebec's artistic production, the 
citizens of Quebec pay taxes, and Quebec and its culture are for 
now still part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be natural for grants to be distributed equitably 
among artists, whatever their political persuasion, and works that 
are funded should reflect reality.  The reality is that there is a 
people in Quebec and that a growing proportion of Quebec's citizens 
want this people to have a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there is no legislation like that being proposed 
today.  Most organizations have guidelines and this is negotiated 
freely in collaboration with grant recipients.  For example, 
Quebec's Conseil des arts et des lettres merely requires that 
recipients of grants display the Conseil's logo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party often complains of excessive government 
interference and too many regulations.  Now it proposes a bill that 
seems to have no purpose.  The only purpose of this bill is to 
increase the federal government's visibility so as to strengthen 
its central authority or national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A closer look at the bill reveals that it gives the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage extensive powers of political control over the 
awarding and announcing of grants.  Under the bill, recipients of 
grants would be required to submit a certificate of good conduct to 
the minister. 
The minister would have the power to decide the time and manner in 
which acknowledgement of grants must be made.  If recipients refuse 
to comply with the minister's political will, the minister may 
retaliate by requiring the return of all or any of the grants 
received.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of progress in cleaning up politics in Quebec and 
in Canada, a return to an era of political patronage is out of the 
question, an era when artists would be subject to the whims of 
political power and hostages of interparty feuds.  Giving such 
direct powers of retaliation and control over grants to the 
heritage minister is opening the door far too wide to arbitrary 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system for awarding cultural grants by federal bodies is 
intended to be a merit system, one which recognizes people's 
creative talents and not their political views or the values they 
espouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In English, this concept goes by the term arm's length, which 
would translate as something like out of the reach of the 
government. 
The reason artists are often judged by their peers or by juries of 
experts known more for their artistic sense and for what they know, 
rather than whom they know, is to ensure that the risk of political 
interference is minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to parliament to set the overall objectives of 
cultural policy.  The government implements those objectives by 
funding cultural organizations.  It ought not to go any further 
than this.  The government must not interfere in the choice of 
artists or creators whom these organizations decide to fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may disagree with certain choices of works or artists 
which are funded, I admit.  Our criticisms, however, ought to focus 
on whether or not the cultural organizations are fulfilling their 
mission, and not on the personality or opinions of those receiving 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is an attempt, as with this bill, to subject 
culture to an ideology, experts sometimes talk of sovietizing 
culture.  This refers to the absolute control exercised by the 
government of the former Soviet Union over means of communication 
such as radio, television, film, newspapers, books and plays.  This 
approach is of no interest to either Canada or Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of Parliament, we should work to create laws that 
encourage creativity rather than control it or use it for political 
propaganda.  Last year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs tried to 
get artists who were working abroad to promote national unity. 
When they refused, he realized his mistake and cancelled his 
directive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the member for Kootenay—Columbia should do as 
well.  He should withdraw his bill and find positive ways to 
encourage artists rather than try to use them as pawns on his 
political chessboard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
remind the House that we are discussing Bill C-204.  Its title is 
very precise.  It is the Cultural Grants Acknowledgement Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as we will have gathered from its supporters, deals 
with grants, contributions or loans for cultural projects funded 
from within the portfolio of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
It has a very narrow focus.  It deals with funding, but in 
particular it proposes that the acknowledgement of such support 
become a legal mandatory requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recipients would have to acknowledge support and specify the 
amount of the grant at the time the funded project is announced 
or advertised or opened to the public.  This obligation would 
apply to individuals as well as to corporations and 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides the Minister of Canadian Heritage with powers 
to regulate the time and manner in which an acknowledgement must 
be made.  Such regulations would define the compliance 
certificate, which is the term used in the bill, the recipient 
would have to produce.  Non-compliance would result in a 
recipient having to repay the financing granted by the minister 
or the agency.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the bill in one sense is based on a sound principle. 
Governments are accountable to the public for financial support 
that they provide for projects and organizations of all kinds. 
Accountability starts with the faithful reporting of what is done 
with taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe it is very legitimate for governments to expect 
an acknowledgement when a grant contributes to the realization of 
a project.  Government money is taxpayers' money.  It is only 
fair that corporate or individual citizens acknowledge receipt of 
such support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private donors and sponsors routinely obtain such 
acknowledgement.  There is no reason why governments should not. 
This principle should be extended to the provision of financial 
assistance by all government departments and agencies to any 
project.  However the bill singles out one type of support 
referred to as cultural grants.  These grants are singled out 
from within a particular ministry, the Canadian Heritage 
portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such a principle is a matter to be based on law then surely 
we must also consider public support granted to cultural projects 
by other government departments, but is this a matter requiring 
legislation specifically applicable only to cultural projects? If 
we agree that such a principle is valid and requires the force of 
legislation to be implemented then we must consider that the 
government also grant support to small businesses, health groups, 
human rights groups, foreign aid projects and so on.  We should 
also consider them and not just culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we restrict legislation to cultural projects alone? 
Is there something in culture to be feared to such a degree that 
by no other means can we ensure that an individual or an 
organization will acknowledge support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to cultural projects funded within the heritage 
portfolio, it is normal practice for recipients to acknowledge 
support.  It is well understood and documented how this should be 
accomplished.  Applicants are instructed on minimum requirements 
concerning acknowledgements.  They are advised of this through 
program criteria when they apply and through the application 
guidelines and standard clauses regarding acknowledgement in the 
case of negotiated signed agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these formal requirements I would have thought 
that most grant recipients would acknowledge support as a common 
courtesy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy regarding acknowledgement in the Department of 
Canadian Heritage is open and transparent.  It is integrated 
throughout the process and accommodated with the express will and 
consent of the recipient as a condition of receiving the grant. 
Support can be acknowledged in advertising and at openings, in 
catalogues for exhibitions, and in other print or video resource 
material produced as a result of the grants.  We heard some 
examples of that from the Bloc member this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognition of public support is also acknowledged by means of 
annual reports including audited financial statements.  In the 
case of incorporated organizations most proposals, if not all, 
include a plan for marketing and/or distribution which recognizes 
public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amounts of grants are a matter of public record as soon as they 
are awarded often by means of a press release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of principle, legislation should be used when other 
means are insufficient or inadequate.  By and large current 
measures can be characterized as self-regulatory.  They work 
reasonably well.  Should there be room for improvement—and there 
always is—I believe that in this case anyway improvement can be 
accomplished without the intervention of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time acknowledgement is not obtained through a 
coercive process.  Acknowledgement policy as practised by 
Heritage Canada and agencies such as the Canada Council retains 
the integrity of the objective for providing support in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one am glad that the Government of Canada supports the 
Canada Council and I believe that most Canadians are of the same 
mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would place the government in the awkward position of 
saying that the focus of public support for culture is not 
culture itself but government visibility.  This would 
unnecessarily thwart the development of the government's 
relations with the cultural community and its many public and 
media supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compliance is presently assured by more informal means.  Groups 
and individuals know their future funding could be placed in 
jeopardy should they refuse to play by the rules and respect what 
are very reasonable requirements for acknowledgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Split payments in the case of grants and the specific negotiated 
schedules of payment for contributions and loans additionally 
serve as an informal mechanism to draw attention to the 
importance of acknowledgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-204 is unnecessary and will not be supporting 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak to Bill C-204, an act to require that in the 
advertising and at the opening of a cultural product supported by 
public money a public acknowledgement of the grant be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to bring the good news to the hon. member for 
Kootenay—Columbia that what he is proposing to pass into law is 
already occurring.  It is something which cultural industries are 
already doing voluntarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he has ever had opportunity to attend a Canadian play he will 
find that in the program routine acknowledgements of all funding 
sources, public and private, are made.  If he has been at the 
screening of a Canadian film lately he will be amazed at the 
length of the section in the credits dedicated exclusively to the 
funders.  It seems to stretch out forever, longer than the 
credits acknowledging the film's crew.  In fact I sometimes 
squirm about in my seat in the local movie theatre waiting for 
the acknowledgements to end so that I can get home, pay the 
babysitter and go to bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long suffering taxpayers who attend our cultural events do 
know what the funding sources are in Canadian plays, films, 
books, magazines and concerts.  It is no secret that almost every 
arts organization receives some level of funding and makes it 
public.  They do not always attach the dollar amount publicly at 
the event.  That is not why people go to an artistic event.  They 
go to be elevated, delighted, challenged and revitalized.  They 
go to learn something new about themselves and the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if after seeing a particular artistic event they feel 
the need to find out how much it costs, the dollar amount is 
available for anyone who wants to know through an annual Canada 
Council for the Arts listing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian cultural industries are grateful and eager to thank the 
funders of their work.  Canadians working in the arts are proud 
of their work and proud to present it to their neighbours and 
fellow citizens and, yes, their fellow taxpayers.  They too are 
an integral part of the economic landscape of the country, doing 
their part to reflect on and contribute to the whole of what we 
are as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the desire for acknowledgement I am sure the Liberals who 
are still remaining across the floor tonight at this late hour 
are probably delighted to hear that we want to see their efforts 
at public funding for the arts made more public.  I believe that 
the level of public funding to culture has reached a dangerously 
low level and I see no joy in this.  I would like to see the 
level of support for our artists increased.  Public funding to 
the arts still exists and I know of no one who is trying to keep 
it a secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is really intent on educating the public about 
where its hard earned tax dollars go, and this is not simply 
another bill to harass Canadian artists, I suggest that he go 
even further in his public education efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next time he pulls into an Esso station he might expect to 
find a sign saying “This gas has been made possible by $585 
million in tax breaks to western oil producers”.  Or, when he 
buys his next Michelin tire he might see a sign saying “Brought 
to you by a $27 million gift from the long suffering taxpayers of 
Nova Scotia by the Liberals in an election year”.  The next time 
the member for Kootenay—Columbia takes a flight back to his 
riding he could have a sign on the back of his jacket saying how 
much that flight is costing the taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can put a price tag on everything if we want to.  There is a 
myth afoot that there is no accountability in the arts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there are far more checks and balances in place around 
funding to the arts than there are around funding to 
corporations.  Perhaps the member's next private member's bill 
might tackle that particular sector if he is concerned with the 
long-suffering taxpayer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really 
wish there were questions and comments because I would like to 
throw some questions at the hon. member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his introduction of this bill, the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia used some examples that are very offensive, 
particularly to women.  The use of taxpayers' money in the 
production of some of these so-called art things are pornographic 
and demeaning, particularly to women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely he cannot be in favour of using taxpayers' money for 
that.  I am not and I do not think any decent Canadian is in 
favour of that, yet it is done all the time with impugnity.  We 
give money to agencies without the need for accountability.  We 
simply say “here is the money, spend it any way you wish”. They 
find some of the most obscene ways to spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I would have known I was going to get up to speak because 
I would have brought along with me a little more detail on a 
little thing I heard one night on CBC radio.  It was a usual 
Sunday evening and I was about to hit the pillow for the night. 
As always, I reached over to set my clock radio.  I thought I 
would listen to CBC-FM a bit to hear some nice music because 
sometimes is does have nice music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, it was after midnight on a Saturday night and the time of 
night when the culture of CBC does a metamorphoses.  Maybe there 
is a connection to it being after midnight, I do not know, but I 
was totally appalled at what I was hearing on a publicly funded 
radio station, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  It was 
incredibly obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess maybe it is a good thing I could not research it because 
then I would have brought the words along.  I was so offended by 
it that I ran downstairs to put on the tape recorder because I 
wanted to have a record of it.  Unfortunately I could not find a 
tape soon enough and missed most of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make a scene about that but I never did.  Instead I 
ran for Parliament and came here with one real good purpose which 
is to stop the funding for this kind of obscenity.  It has no 
market in Canadian society.  We need to stop it.  It is no wonder 
we have all the violence against women and children when we have 
a publicly funded radio promoting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member's bill is a very important step to making 
Canadians realize that when this type of stuff is being put out 
it is being financed with their tax dollars, tax dollars that 
will not go to the education of their children or to keeping a 
hospital bed open for a mother who is suffering and who needs it. 
Instead it is being used for this kind of garbage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step in stopping this flow of taxpayers' money has to 
be for the Canadian people to a large extent to know how it is 
being spent.  Once they know how it is spent, they will get angry 
enough to tell their politicians in Ottawa to stop that flow of 
their money and use it for purposes that are much better and more 
justifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just could not resist adding that little bit to the debate on 
this bill.  I commend my hon. colleague for presenting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I, like my colleague who spoke before me, had not planned to 
speak on this private member's bill.  I think my colleague who 
has just spoken was a little bit perturbed by the comments of the 
hon. member for Dartmouth.  Well, maybe not perturbed but perhaps 
concerned and it generated in him the desire to address some of 
the comments that were made by her and indeed some of the 
comments in the bill itself. 
Having heard the debate as he did, I too am moved to speak.  The 
comments of my hon. colleague just prior to my rising made me 
more determined to speak.  They give the indication more than 
anything else about what the intention of this bill really is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a little about accountability and a little about 
taxpayers' dollars but it is mostly about art that offends 
certain individuals.  It is an attempt to use dollars— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> If you would have heard what I heard on 
CBC— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I have heard many things on CBC that 
have offended me.  I have heard many things in the private 
broadcasting sector that offend me more.  I note that in this 
bill there is no requirement for the private sector to indicate 
the influence it may have on cultural events that take place. 
There is no accountability there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get the sense we want to go back to the way it was in the time 
of Caterina de' Medici when certain privileged groups were 
patrons of the arts.  In that case individuals with gifts and 
abilities were supported by private patrons instead of the 
public.  Then an individual may have used his creativity to write 
love songs for his patron's mistress.  I don't know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way.  We have come to a point where we 
recognize that culture and art are a part of the fabric of this 
nation.  We have come to a point where we recognize the right of 
artistic expression whether we agree with that expression or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Dartmouth explained it like this.  We go to a 
public event to be educated, sometimes to be offended.  We do not 
go to be offended but sometimes we are.  We go to be stirred.  We 
go to be enlightened.  We go to create the kind of debate we are 
having here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were no public funding for the films mentioned, for 
some of the plays that have been written in this country, for 
some of the music that some colleagues or I might find offensive, 
then we would not have this debate.  We would hear endless reams 
of Lawrence Welk playing on some radio station that could be the 
most general and least offensive type of music that anyone could 
listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is artists need to be supported in their creative 
efforts.  They do not need to worry that because someone does not 
like their work, their funding is going to be cut, and that is 
what this is really about.  It is about saying that we find this 
film about incest offensive, we find this music offensive and for 
that reason we are going to use the fact that some public money 
was used in this to end it.  That means we will go back to 
private funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listen to the sitcoms that come across the border every day 
because nobody asks the sponsors how much money they have spent, 
and I think that is the intent of this bill.  I speak in favour 
of the freedom of the artist to express himself or herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time for private 
members' business this evening is just about over.  It is 
customary to allow the mover of the bill to wrap up for a couple 
of minutes.  If the mover does so, that will suspend debate on 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you will forgive the Chair an editorial comment, I think most 
Canadians watching would agree that tonight's debate in private 
members' business was very good insofar as it was extemporaneous 
and heartfelt.  From the perspective of the Chair it was a very 
good debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
indeed the speaker prior to myself put his finger on it.  If we 
do not like the sitcoms we are looking at that have been prepared 
at the expense of the studio and paid for by the sponsors, we 
turn them off at no cost to ourselves because the sponsors are 
the people who are paying the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In an instance when Canadians are paying the bill, how is this 
House held accountable?  The speaker spoke of the right of 
artistic expression.  That is a wonderful term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that I receive on a weekly basis at least a dozen 
letters from concerned Canadians saying that they are being taxed 
to death.  They take a look at the material that is being 
produced and find it vile and offensive.  Who is accountable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have this speaker from the NDP and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage comparing today's vile pornographers to the 
Group of Seven, I find that a leap that is a chasm far too wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill is about and indeed what we should be talking 
about in this House of Commons, the action we should be taking in 
this House of Commons is to hold this House of Commons 
accountable for the taxpayers' dollars, whether it is going out 
to the Canada Council or it is going out to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever it is going out to, I am here because the people sent 
me here to be accountable.  Indeed I have gone to the artists, as 
I mentioned in the finance committee, I have gone to the minister 
in the heritage committee and now I come to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from Reform members of Parliament, there is no one in this 
House of Commons who is prepared to stand to be accountable for 
the Canadian taxpayers' dollars and the way in which they are 
being spent.  That is a shame.

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 3, on pay equity, I asked the President of the Treasury 
Board if he intended to return to the bargaining table with the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
The question arose from a response the minister had made several 
days previously, one of the clearest ones he has made on the 
subject of the decision by the tribunal of the human rights 
commission in the matter before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded, and I quote “We stand ready to apply 
the various judgments once they are made final”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has just now told us that he will abide by the 
tribunal's decision.  I must confess I had doubts about the 
seriousness of the minister's word.  In fact, following this 
surprising response, I wondered whether, with this statement, the 
President of the Treasury Board was announcing his withdrawal from 
the bargaining table.  And I hastened to ask him if this were the 
case.  His  response, let me tell you, left me somewhat stunned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we all know that it was the employer who broke off 
negotiations, the minister told me that he was quietly waiting for 
the union to come back to the bargaining table, and went on about 
his $1.3 billion offer.  The employees are not stupid.  They know 
very well that the minister is trying to get them to settle for 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my hon. colleague will soon rise in the House to 
tell us proudly that bargaining resumed on October 30.  I wonder 
whether my colleague will be honest enough, however, to admit that 
he is not even in a position to offer a settlement larger than $1.3 
billion, when he knows full well that the Public Service Alliance 
is demanding close to $2 billion.  I look forward to hearing him 
boast about his wonderfully charitable offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be known that, with Christmas around the corner, what 
the government owes its employees is not charity, but simple and 
fair justice. 
And this justice presumes the payment of the money to which they 
are entitled.  Instead of asking me to use my influence with the 
unions to get them to accept this second-rate offer, I suggest that 
the minister should instead use his influence with the Minister of 
Finance to obtain the necessary room to manoeuvre and finally 
respect public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second half of my question of October 3, I also asked 
the minister if he intended to use all the legal stalling tactics 
at his disposal to delay a settlement in this matter.  I imagine he 
will tell us that he certainly does not, that he would never wish 
to delay a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague replies in this vein, I will believe him. 
Better yet, I will say that he wants such a rapid settlement that 
he is using all the stalling tactics at his disposal.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to give you some examples of what seem 
to some to be bargaining tactics, and to others, simple bad faith. 
Given that the tribunal's decision will not be handed down until 
the spring of 1998 and that this issue has been dragging on for 10 
years, it is clear that everything is in place to rush employees 
into accepting a second-rate offer.  Let us also remember that 
there is still the threat of special legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We honestly believed in the government's good faith when we 
learned of the return to the bargaining table, but the tactics 
being used to influence employees are shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read an information bulletin issued to employees, which 
points out how the settlement process will drag on if the 
employer's offer is rejected, I cannot help thinking that this is 
a tactic intended to influence their decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I understand that bargaining must include a 
minimum of strategy, but the government must also understand that 
its employees are not its enemies.  They too are taking part in the 
public effort.  The government must work with, not against, its 
employees.  I have only this to add:  do the fair thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on October 3 the 
President of the Treasury Board answered a question from the 
member for Longueuil. She asked the Treasury Board a question 
about pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to fulfill its obligations to pay 
equity.  As part of its commitment, it enacted legislation for 
Canada in 1978.  It has paid over $1 billion in pay equity 
payments.  During the most recent negotiations it has offered 
$1.3 billion to PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 11, 1997 the government tabled an offer of $1.3 
billion to resolve the pay equity dispute.  On October 30, PSAC 
tabled a counterproposal to the current Treasury Board offer of 
$1.3 billion.  In addition to salary adjustments that represent 
more than $2 billion, the PSAC counterproposals include interest 
back to 1983, compensation for hurt feelings and other related 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that a negotiated settlement would be in 
the best interests of all parties and would end the uncertainty 
to employees.  The tribunal decision will provide the parameters 
for calculating the pay equity gap but will most likely leave 
some issues unresolved and this will require further discussions 
with PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means further delays.  Furthermore, any of the parties could 
file a judicial review.  Negotiations will allow the employer and 
PSAC to resolve this matter and show that the trust and 
commitment can generate solutions to these difficult issues.  A 
joint resolution will get the cheques in the hands of the 
employees sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is firmly committed to the principles of pay 
equity and it wants a fair, speedy and equitable solution to the 
dispute with PSAC.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier I 
asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs if, in the spirit of the 
Beijing conference on women, he would assure that funding for the 
women's group going to APEC this week in Vancouver would be 
there, as I had had calls from my constituents who are members of 
women's groups and who were not getting any funding to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that funding had been there and it was up to 
the groups to decide what to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turns out, APEC has been funded by the government for $46 
million, a total of $57 million, $46 million by Canadian citizens 
to APEC, $9 million as business write-offs, and the association 
of citizens groups that had put together the people's summit has 
received $200,000.  Barely three weeks before the summit was to 
begin it had only received $100,000 and that has forced the 
indigenous peoples to pull out of the people's summit which is 
running parallel to the APEC conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These citizens groups represent human rights groups, women's 
organizations, environment workers, migrant workers and 
anti-poverty groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>APEC represents 18 countries.  It is an association of economies 
and its goal is to pursue unfettered trade, unfettered meaning it 
does not have to deal with human rights or workers rights or the 
fact there may be child labour or forced labour. 
The people's summit was an attempt to bring a balance to this 
process.  These countries are home to 2.2 billion people, which 
is 40% of our globe's humanity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the world conference on human rights in Vienna restated 
that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
and inter-related.  APEC's agenda is to separate trade as having 
nothing to do with human rights or workers rights, the very 
people who produce the money for transnational corporations and 
large economies.  They do have rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way APEC sees it.  APEC curtails democracy 
through informal understandings.  Democratic countries align 
themselves with the most repressive and corrupt regimes in the 
world while at the same time shutting out the voices of the civil 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the argument that better trade will increase human 
rights.  However, when trade agreements changed in China in 1988 
and 1989 we saw the Tiananmen massacre.  In Indonesia there 
continue to be vile human rights abuses, yet in the name of trade 
we will meet with these people and everything will be fine as 
long as it is in the name of the dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The countries of APEC and the corporations of APEC, some 
elected, some unelected, refuse to discuss their impact on human 
rights, on working conditions, the freedom to associate, the 
freedom to negotiate, child labour, forced labour, environmental 
standards, immigration, migrant labour and their affect on 
indigenous peoples.  Again I will state that the indigenous group 
had to pull out because there was no funding for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to shut out the voices of civil society because they 
are not funded equally by any standards; $57 million to APEC, 
$200,000 to the people's summit.  They were not allowed to 
participate.  There was no money for transportation.  Even 
transferring the cost of one business reception would likely have 
covered every expense needed for the people's summit.  It would 
have allowed them to fully participate.
