before I begin my statement may I say that you said it well this 
morning on behalf of us all.  Surely Nelson Mandela will take his 
place among the greats of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in the House to recognize two of my constituents who have 
made their contributions to the 20th century. These two 
individuals, Stan Judd and John Mackillop, have made 
contributions through the Canadian Executive Services 
Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stan Judd spent a month in Panama to help a company engaged in 
the purchasing, classification and distribution of specialty 
grains.  Among other things, Mr. Judd designed a better cleaning 
and classifying process, developed a new faster cooking grain and 
designed effective packaging.  Because of Mr. Judd, this company 
expects to increase production, reduce costs and improve product 
quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mackillop went on assignment to Sri Lanka to assist in the 
production of artificial limbs.  He helped prepare study material 
and training for a company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stan Judd and John Mackillop are to commended for their efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are becoming increasingly aware that one of the keys 
for a strong society is not more costly government programs but 
respect and encouragement for the millions of committed parents 
who are raising our next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, the studies show what we already intrinsically 
know:  a stable and loving family is a child's best hope.  For 
example, recent studies confirm that children raised by birth 
parents in a stable relationship are significantly more likely to 
graduate from high school and less likely to have behavioural 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly though, academics, bureaucrats and social 
do-gooders present themselves as the champions of the best 
interests of children.  What they seem to forget is that parents 
have a natural authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respecting the authority that both parents have and tangibly 
encouraging the work that they do is one of the best long term 
investments we can make.

speaker at the annual meeting of the Ontario Regiment Veterans. I 
was presented with a poem written by Charles Province that I 
would like to share as a reminder of the supreme sacrifice made 
by so many: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of

It is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of

It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, who has given us 
freedom to demonstrate.<BR> 
It is the soldier, not the lawyer, who has given us the right to 
a fair trial.<BR> 
It is the soldier who salutes the flag, who serves under the 
flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the 
protester to burn the flag.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured and delighted to welcome a great man to 
our nation's capital today, the President of South Africa, the 
Hon. Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Mandela is a living symbol of the power of the human 
spirit and a true modern day hero.  Nelson Mandela has fought and 
stood by his strong beliefs in fundamental human rights, the 
right to dignity, freedom and equality that we all cherish as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His courage to challenge the injustices of the oppressive system 
of apartheid in South Africa cannot be understated.  Like many 
Canadians such as Sherona Hall and other ANC supporters, I spent 
my youthful years in anti-apartheid support activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are all bursting with pride as under President 
Mandela's leadership South Africa is making a peaceful transition 
into a democratic society that respects the rights of all its 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela will go down in history as one of the stalwarts 
of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mandela, thank you for making South Africa and the world a 
better place.  Canadians are proud that today you walked among 
us.

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Canadian official opposition I ask the members of the House 
of Commons and all Canadians from sea to sea to pay tribute to 
the President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians supported Mr. Mandela's struggle against oppression 
because Canadians believe in the equality of all people.  We 
believe in justice and accountability and we believe in the 
fundamental freedoms for all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadians cheer on and support a renewed South Africa, a 
South Africa that works to achieve the ideals of democracy, 
equality and freedom, a South Africa that is a model for other 
states in and beyond Africa.  Canadians also support South Africa 
as it reinvigorates its domestic democracy, as it reforms its 
institutions of government and moves into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Canada and South Africa have been close in the past 
and will remain friends in the future.  Today it is a great 
honour to welcome Nelson Mandela and his wife and celebrate a 
victory for freedom over oppression.

is my pleasure today to be among those Canadians who welcome 
Nelson Mandela here to our parliament.  President Mandela's visit 
gives us an opportunity to honour a remarkable man for his 
lifetime struggle against racism and apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has fathered a peaceful revolution, guided by his gentleness, 
wisdom and strength.  This remarkable legacy continues through 
his dedication to helping the children and youth of South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is proud to be a sponsor of the 
“Mandela and the Children” event at the Skydome tomorrow. 
Nelson Mandela will reach out to our young people and give them 
an awareness of Canada's activities in South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This event will connect young people of Canada with the South 
African youth in a common cause:  the elimination of racism and 
the promotion of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The struggle of this great leader encourages us all to reaffirm 
our commitment to tolerance, equality and social justice.

Through personal sacrifice, Mr. Mandela stands out as a true 
statesman and as a beloved and respected political leader.  He 
will remain forever an example of a freedom fighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others continue the fight for democracy, Mr. Mandela's

rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems that the Minister of Finance this 
week proposed to his cabinet colleagues that they circumvent the 
Employment Insurance Act in order to be able to use the huge 
annual surpluses of $6 billion for purposes other than 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, is the Minister of Finance not simply seeking to 
legalize the misappropriation of employment insurance surplus 
funds in which he has been involved for several years now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member ought to look at the government's record for the 
past several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the previous government came in, its intention was to raise 
the employment insurance contribution rate to $3.30. We froze it 
at $3.07.  Every year since then, we have decreased employment 
insurance contributions.  Last year, we brought them down 20 
cents.  As well, we did away with employment insurance 
contributions for those under the age of 25.

operation he has been involved in for a number of years, and 
which he plans to continue, will have to be considered illegal, 
if he does not soon make a quite substantial cut to EI premiums? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know that the government has choices to make, and make them we 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice of the Bloc Quebecois is to decrease taxes and 
increase spending, or in other words to ensure that Canada will 
again fall into a deficit position.  That is not our choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the finance minister said Bernard Dussault was fired 
over “management issues”.  This is a public servant with an 
impeccable record as Canada's chief actuary for the last seven 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the minister.  Was the decision to fire

<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

answered that question.  He has said that the answer to that 
question was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  The Minister of Finance was not involved 
in the decision and did not make the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask:  Is the Reform Party saying that the 
Minister of Finance ought to hire and ought to fire the chief 
actuary?  Is it saying that we ought to have the politicization 
of the finest public servants in the world?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has already ordered the slaughtering of 11,000

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a reportable disease in the world and it is important that 
we eliminate it from our livestock herd.  When we do so, we 
compensate the producers for the loss of the animal and we pay

been no proof of the statement she just made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind her that in the last three years the government 
has given the province of Quebec $200 million to assist in the 
farm safety net income program in Quebec.  Had it used that in

have been able to assist its producers in Quebec.

<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

government has reduced the premiums each and every year since we

the premiums for companies that were to hire young Canadians. 
It is important to understand that is the principle the 
government has followed and will continue to follow.

that will spur the economy, will create jobs and will make 
Canadian workers and businesses a lot happier.  Let us make the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, from the very beginning when the country had its back to

approach.  That balanced approach involved the reduction of EI 
premiums, the lowering of taxes, spending in areas which were 
important for the country's future, and the lowering of debt.

response to the hon. member's question, I think that we should 
simply consult the experts. Allow me to quote one of them: “To 
state things clearly, we must not panic but maintain the 
discipline that we worked so hard to acquire in recent years. 
Otherwise, we would very quickly find ourselves with an even 
weaker currency, higher interest rates, lower investments and 
higher unemployment.”  That is what Ken Courtis, the chief 
economist of the Deutsche Bank, said.  The hon. member is 
suggesting we go back to a deficit position. But that is not our

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  Today we heard how 
Canada brought honour to itself as a leader in the battle to end

trampled on the rights of Canadian students to welcome a dictator

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill S-16, an act to implement an agreement between Canada and 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, an agreement between Canada 
and the Republic of Croatia and a convention between Canada and 
the Republic of Chile, for the avoidance of double taxation and 
the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I believe you will find the unanimous consent of the House to 
split the 40 minute speaking time allocated to the official 
opposition into four 10 minute speeches.  There are no questions 
and comments associated with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent to 
the suggestion of the hon. House Leader for the official 
opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak today at second reading of Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will implement the income tax conventions that 
Canada recently signed with Vietnam, Croatia and Chile.  Bill 
S-16 is important as it is part of an ongoing effort to update 
Canada's network of income tax conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties are directly related to international trade and 
thus have a subsequent impact on Canada's domestic economic 
performance.  Their benefits are therefore significant.  Witness 
the almost 40% of Canada's annual economic wealth that depends on 
exports, commerce abroad and direct foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been updating its network of tax treaties regularly 
since 1971 when our income tax system was overhauled.  One of the 
outcomes of this overhaul was the expansion of our network of tax 
treaties.  Canada now has income tax treaties with 64 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has two main objectives in mind when signing tax 
conventions with other countries.  One is the avoidance of double 
taxation.  The other is the prevention of income tax evasion. New 
tax treatments are, for the most part, similar to others already 
concluded by Canada.  However, by necessity they do vary from one 
country to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 guarantees that our income tax rules are integrated to 
ensure that our agreements with Vietnam, Croatia and Chile have 
full force and effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss some of the specifics in the bill I want to 
highlight three major benefits that will result from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, taxpayers will know that a rate of tax limited under any 
of these agreements cannot be increased without substantial 
advance notice of any changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canadian taxpayers with business interests or 
investments in Vietnam, Croatia or Chile will operate under a 
reduced compliance burden as the rules of the game will become 
clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, taxpayers involved in international transactions where 
double taxation occasionally occurs will see this problem largely 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a world where people and capital are increasingly mobile, 
double taxation treaties are crucial because they ensure that 
returns will not be taxed twice.  Canada has 64 treaties, 
including our conventions with Vietnam, Croatia and Chile, which 
eliminate double taxation in one of two ways.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They assign exclusive taxing rights to only the taxpayer's 
country of residence or the source country of the income.  Or 
they require the country of residence to give credit for the tax 
paid to the source country if the income is taxable in both 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Double taxation treaties often encourage the exchange of 
information between revenue authorities to prevent tax evasion, 
the second objective in signing these treaties, and Bill S-16 is 
certainly no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Withholding taxes are another major issue addressed in this 
particular bill.  A taxpayer's country of residence can usually 
withhold tax at a rate of 5%, 10% or 15% on dividends and branch 
profits, and 10% on interest and royalties.  In some cases 
royalties on copyright, computer software, patent and know-how 
are exempt at source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the agreement with Vietnam, there will be a reduced 
dividend rate of 5% for a Canadian company with at least 70% of 
the Vietnam company's voting power, 10% for a company controlling 
between 25% and 70% of voting power, and 15% in all other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there will be a reduced branch tax rate of 5%, a 
reduced 10% rate on interest and royalties and a 7.5% on 
technical service fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Vietnam there is no immediate exemption for royalties on 
copyright, computer software, patents and know-how.  However, if 
Vietnam agrees to any future exemptions with other OECD 
countries, Canada and Canadians will automatically obtain the 
benefit of that same exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the treaty with Croatia, the reduced dividend rate will be 
5% for a company controlling at least 10% of the voting power, or 
holding at least 25% of the capital, and 15% in all other cases. 
The rates on branch taxes and interest and royalties will be 5% 
and 10% respectively.  Again, there is no exemption for interest 
or royalties on copyright, computer software, patents and 
know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the convention with Chile, the reduced dividend rate will be 
10% for a company owning at least 25% of the voting power and 15% 
in all other cases.  A 10% branch tax rate will apply, and if 
Chile agrees to a 5% rate with another OECD country, this lower 
rate will automatically apply to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be a 15% rate on interest and royalties, but no 
exemption for interest or royalties on copyright, computer 
software, patents and know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure I would like to discuss concerns non-resident 
pensions.  Bill S-16 respects Canada's right to tax pensions and 
annuities paid to non-residents.  Under the agreements with 
Vietnam and Croatia, pension payments can be taxed in both 
countries, with the source country collecting no more than 15% of 
the total payment.  Social security benefits will be taxable only 
by the country that pays those benefits.  With respect to Canada 
and Chile, pension and social security payments will be taxable 
by the country from which the payments are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may be interested to know that capital gains on the 
sale of real property, business assets and shares in real estate 
companies, or interest in real estate partnerships or trusts will 
remain taxable by the country in which the property is situated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are some very real benefits for Canadians 
in this bill.  With no tax treaty presently in force with 
Vietnam, Croatia or Chile, these agreements will definitely help 
Canadian corporations and individuals with operations and 
investments there.  Along with promoting international trade and 
investment, and helping to secure Canada's position in the 
increasingly competitive world of trade and investment, their 
existence will also foster an atmosphere of certainty and 
stability for investors and traders that will only enhance 
Canada's economic relationship with each country.  At the same 
time these agreements will help to ensure that Canadian tax 
policy remains consistent internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that there will be no revenue losses to any of 
the countries affected by this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties are part of the normal apparatus of international 
relations for a modern economy and their expansion is part of the 
ongoing operations of a responsible government.  This is 
important and non-controversial legislation and I encourage hon. 
members to grant its speedy passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at the outset I would like to remind the House that, pursuant to 
unanimous consent, I will be splitting the official opposition's 
40 minute allocation between myself, the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford, the member for Medicine Hat and the member 
for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, in that order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition supports Bill S-16, an act to implement 
an agreement between Canada and the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam, an agreement between Canada and the Republic of Croatia 
and a convention between Canada and the Republic of Chile, for 
the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal 
evasion with respect to taxes on income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as a party for free enterprise, strongly support measures of 
this nature which can remove barriers to commerce and make 
efficient financial flows between trading jurisdictions such as 
Canada and the three countries stipulated in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reviewed this bill in detail and find that it is 
substantively in keeping with the model for international tax 
conventions proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would second the substantive remarks of the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance who just detailed for us 
some of the elements of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, make reference to one concern that I have, 
which is with respect to an element of this bill which confirms a 
tax convention with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  While in 
principle I think it is a good thing for Canada to establish 
firmer trade links leading to greater prosperity between 
ourselves and international jurisdictions, I think this gives us 
pause to reflect on the general foreign and economic policies of 
the current government vis-à-vis tyrannical regimes overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a recent example of this kind of cosy, pillow 
fluffing, red carpet treatment that Canada provides to foreign 
jurisdictions, such as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and 
Indonesian, a country we have been talking about in this House 
recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not oppose the effort to establish a tax convention 
of this nature with Vietnam, I do wish that it were tied more 
clearly to a more vigorous articulation on the part of the 
Canadian government of the need for the respect of human, 
religious and civil rights in communist tyrannies such as the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply opening up trade and more efficient means of financial 
balances such as these tax conventions without a concomitant 
effort to press the need for human rights and political reforms 
is, in my view, insufficient and is a black mark on the record of 
this government and of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me say that I and my colleagues object 
most strenuously to the process by which we find ourselves 
addressing this bill as S-16.  For those not familiar with 
parliamentary procedure, it is coded as S-16 because it is a 
bill that was introduced in the Senate in May of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this bill introduced in the Senate?  Conventionally in 
this Parliament, right from its beginning, bills, and 
particularly meaningful government bills, have been introduced in 
the lower chamber, the House of Commons, reviewed, debated, 
passed and then submitted to the upper chamber in the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this case we have before us one instance of the 
growing and troubling pattern on the part of this government to 
introduce legislation such as Bill S-16 in the Senate, to pass it 
there and then to bring it before us here in the Commons. 
We submit this is a contravention of a long established 
parliamentary convention whereby we respect the de facto 
supremacy of the lower Chamber, the elected Chamber, the 
democratically legitimate Chamber over the appointed patronage 
haven we call the Senate to introduce and discuss bills here 
first. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills ought to be introduced and debated, deliberated on and 
passed here and then considered by the Senate as a de facto 
rubber stamp rather than the other way around.  Instead we find 
ourselves, through introducing this and other bills at the 
Senate, increasing the legitimacy of what is in actual fact an 
increasingly illegitimate body in the eyes of the Canadian people 
and the official opposition.  We find this very troubling indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the government in our negotiations with its House 
leadership and in public statements here and elsewhere to respect 
the long established parliamentary convention of introducing 
legislation of this nature, government bills, in the Commons for 
consideration by the duly elected representatives of the people 
before proceeding to the Senate and not the other way around. But 
the government has decided to refuse to respect that convention 
and to refuse to assert the democratic authority of this place 
over the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very unfortunate, particularly in light of the fact that 
this government has virtually no substantive legislative agenda. 
Here we are in Canada with an economy that is slowing down, with 
a nearly $600 billion debt, with the highest personal income tax 
rates in the G-7, with a dollar that has just this summer reached 
historic all time lows.  Here we are with enormous problems to 
deal with in terms of the livelihoods of Canadians and what does 
this government have on its legislative agenda?  Very little 
except for little technical bills of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is no compelling reason for the government to have 
introduced this bill or similar bills in the Senate for its 
consideration before the consideration of the Commons.  There is 
no compelling reason except for the government's decision to try 
to legitimize the upper chamber at a time when in the eyes of 
Canadians it is increasingly an illegitimate body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this about Bill S-16, an act to implement an agreement 
between Canada and the republics of Vietnam, Croatia and Chile, 
because we have before us in this place a rare historic 
opportunity.  That is an opportunity provided to us by the duly 
elected government of the province of Alberta.  The Alberta 
legislature has decided to convene and hold an election for 
senators in that province, an election that will be held on 
October 19.  This election is not being held as some symbolic 
frivolous effort by a political gesture on the part of the people 
of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, the Government of Alberta wants the people of Alberta to 
choose its next senators to begin the long, arduous but 
critically important process of fundamental Senate reform so that 
one day we can reach a situation where the upper chamber is 
elected and is accountable, so it can exercise effective powers 
hopefully with equitable if not equal representation from the 
provinces and regions so that it can consider bills like Bill 
S-16, so that it can even talk about technical government 
legislation such as tax conventions with a modicum of democratic 
legitimacy.  Until that day arrives we assert the prerogative of 
this House, the democratic assembly of this parliament, to 
consider bills of this nature first before they go to the 
patronage haven down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we heard the Deputy Prime Minister say that the Senate 
elections in Alberta are undemocratic.  Undemocratic elections? 
Let me get this straight.  In this strange twisted Orwellian 
world of the government opposite it is undemocratic to have 
elections but it is democratic to appoint people to an upper 
chamber to decide how tax dollars are spent and to use the 
enormous and sometimes coercive power of the state. 
I fail to grasp the twisted logic of the Deputy Prime Minister 
and the government in introducing bills like this and in 
attacking a legitimate effort to push the agenda of democratic 
reform in parliament.  The Liberal Party of Canada and the Right 
Hon. Prime Minister say they favour reform of the Senate.  I then 
invite them to demonstrate that support by introducing bills like 
this in the lower Chamber first.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
you can count on this being a very pleasant speech because I want 
to talk about Bill S-16, an act to implement an agreement between 
Canada and the republics of Vietnam, Croatia and Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective Reform has always supported measures that 
might in any way lower the tax burden of Canadians.  I am sure 
support will be found for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do have, as my colleague has just talked very briefly 
about, some concern about how Bill S-16 came before us.  I stood 
in the House a number of times on points of privilege and points 
of order.  The privilege I spoke about is the privilege that is 
being denied members of the House to look at such bills first, 
have first reading, second reading, have them go to committee, 
perhaps have the committee go across the country if it is that 
important to discuss with people, have the bills go to third 
reading and then off to the Senate for its review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really at a loss once again why we find Bill S-16, yet 
another bill, coming from the Senate first into the House. The 
problem I have is I guess we have to look at what makes the House 
of Commons effective first of all.  I think what makes the House 
of Commons effective is open debate on any issue, dialogue across 
and the accountability, of course.  If we stand up and vote for 
or against a particular bill in the House and the public does not 
like it there is accountability.  There is accountability at the 
polls.  If we look for feedback from our people it is democratic 
and bills get the right filtration they need throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I guess one could look at what would hamper 
that in the House.  What would hamper that is a debate after the 
fact, a bill going to the Senate first through unelected, 
unaccountable individuals, and then coming to the House seeking 
some form of rubber stamp after it has already been discussed by 
the Senate.  I guess we would be hampered if the individuals who 
bring these sorts of bills to the House from the Senate were not 
elected, which they are not, and were not accountable to people 
in this country, which they are not, given that they are 
patronage appointments.  I do not understand for a moment why a 
government time after time in the House purports to have some 
form of democratic process going on when bills are coming into 
the House from the Senate and are not debated first in the House 
of Commons.  There is something wrong with that undying 
philosophy that my friends and buddies have a better process for 
making legislation than individually elected members of 
parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Southeast talked about the 
implications of Senate patronage appointments on the current 
elections in Alberta.  Just what does this government hope to 
gain by flying in the face of Senate elections in Alberta and 
appointing someone to the Senate from Alberta?  What does it hope 
to achieve by that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members what it is going to achieve.  It is going to 
probably achieve no seats in the next election, but then it does 
not have many seats in Alberta anyway.  I guess the arrogance of 
it all is starting to show.  Maybe that's it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is this going to stop in this House?  When is this 
government going to come to the realization that the House of 
Commons was built as an institution that legislates the affairs 
of Canadians.  When is it going to understand that the buddies, 
the hacks, all those friends who have been appointed to the 
Senate are really not accountable for these issues, they really 
should not be initiating bills and sending them to the House? 
They really should not be looking after the clean-up of issues 
the government does not want to initiate in this House in the 
first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of the Senate is not going to go away.  I can assure 
members of that.  It really does not matter to me what the 
content of the bill is coming from the House of Commons.  The 
fact is all those bills should be initiated in this House first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the government it may seem that the other place, the Senate, 
is accountable, it can do all the work there and save the 
government some time.  But that is not in the eyes of Canadians 
what this is about.  If we are going to legislate then we must be 
accountable for our actions.  We cannot toss it off to this group 
over on the other side that is unaccountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals think for a minute that this is not going to be 
a major issue until such time as they initiate change to the 
Senate, they are kidding themselves.  I think the arrogance of it 
all is bad enough but the overconfidence is going to get this 
government.  This is by no means a small issue across this 
country. This happens to be a very large issue where I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a Senate that is accountable, that is elected, 
that is effective and they are going to get it.  If they cannot 
get it through the other side they will get it through another 
party and another government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop talking about Bill S-16 being so important that we 
have to get it through the Senate first.  If it is so darn 
important then put it through the House first. My colleague is 
absolutely correct about the government's agenda. Here we are 
with young people looking for jobs, a dollar that is lower than 
it has ever been historically, taxes that are far too high, debt 
that is far too much and what do we have in front of us? Bill 
S-16 from the Senate.  There is a minister here.  Go back and 
tell the cabinet that Bill S-16 from the Senate does not address 
the issues of getting our kids back to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem today with our dollar.  In case members 
opposite have not noticed, it hit 10 new historic lows in the 
month of August alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How many? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Ten new historic lows, unbelievably, 
and what are we talking about?  A reciprocal taxation agreement 
with Chile, Croatia and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about taxation on this side, specifically about 
the issue of double taxation which the bill purports to deal 
with. However I would like to ask the government opposite why it 
is not concerned about double taxation in Canada.  For crying out 
loud, we have GST on provincial sales taxes and we have GST on 
fuel taxes in this country.  Why does the government not move a 
bill that would remove that type of double taxation?  No.  It is 
only good when it involves countries outside Canada.  It is a 
disgrace that it has such a skimpy agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends opposite have pointed to other issues.  I will point 
to one as well.  We have the social union that is being 
considered by the provinces right now.  We have the federal 
government balking at dealing with the provinces.  They are 
bringing forward for the first time in a long time a unified 
proposal.  We should see the federal government embracing some of 
the things that are being brought forward by the provinces. 
Instead we are dealing with Bill S-16.  It is absolutely 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to an issue that has been heating up all summer and 
actually deals specifically with the bill but not in the way the 
government was proposing.  I am talking about the Senate 
elections in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a bill initiated in the Senate, a bill that, 
granted, is not a big important bill.  However it deals with 
taxation. If a bill begins in a place where there are not elected 
people but actually patronage appointments, it is fair to say 
that essentially what we have here is a case of a taxation bill 
being drawn without representation.  I am extraordinarily 
concerned that we are allowing this to continue to happen in this 
place.  We have pointed this out before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the lower house are elected; people in the upper house 
are appointed.  They are friends of the Prime Minister and 
previous prime ministers.  They are great hockey players in some 
cases but they are not people who were elected.  They do not 
necessarily bring any expertise to these issues.  I am 
disappointed that we have to lecture the government once again on 
what democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we had a great democrat speak in this place, Nelson 
Mandela.  He spoke about democracy and I thought how ironic that 
we have Nelson Mandela in this place speaking about democracy and 
the government balks at allowing democracy to happen in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta today we are trying to hold a Senate election. 
We had 600,000 people vote in the previous Senate election in 
Alberta and we actually elected a senator.  Finally Brian 
Mulroney was forced because of tremendous public pressure to put 
Stan Waters, a Reformer, into the Senate, the first really truly 
accountable senator who has ever sat in that place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are proposing to do the same thing again, and what do we 
get from the Prime Minister?  He says the Senate election is a 
joke.  That is what he thinks of Albertans.  I will tell the 
House what is a joke.  I think the joke is the government's 
approach to the people of Alberta and to democracy.  It is 
ridiculous that the Liberals will sit there day after day and say 
that we rejected a Senate of an elected nature under the 
Charlottetown accord.  Therefore they will not give us any chance 
to elect senators at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister knows that is absolutely untrue.  We rejected 
many aspects of the Charlottetown accord.  We rejected specific 
things about the Senate proposal in the accord but we really 
rejected it because it would not lead to a triple E Senate, 
something that Albertans believe in very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day one of my colleagues asked the Prime Minister what 
he had done in the last five years since he had been in office to 
promote a triple E Senate, to promote an elected Senate.  He 
could not answer.  He has not done one thing in five years 
despite the fact that this is the most important constitutional 
issue, and even non-constitutional unity issue, for Albertans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite that fact, the Prime Minister could not name one thing 
his government had done to push the issue of Senate reform. Now 
the Government of Alberta and Reformers have taken matters into 
their own hands.  Hopefully they will embarrass the government a 
bit by showing it how democracy is supposed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 19 four candidates for the position of senator will 
be on the ballot when Albertans go to the polls during their 
municipal elections.  Two of those people will be selected and 
will ultimately be suggested to the Prime Minister when the next 
Senate vacancy comes up in Alberta.  We certainly hope that this 
time around the Prime Minister will heed the wishes of Albertans 
who frankly were quite insulted the other day when the Prime 
Minister went ahead, even during a Senate election, and chose to 
put a patronage appointee back into the Senate.  It is absolutely 
disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up my remarks by saying that this is not an issue 
that Albertans will soon forget.  We point out that we have been 
working on this matter for a number of years.  One of my new 
colleagues, Bert Brown, who was nominated by Reformers the other 
day, has been working on the Senate issue for 16 years.  His 
colleague, Ted Morton, who was also chosen by Reformers as a 
nominee for the Senate election, is a political scientist who has 
been working hard to push the issue of Senate reform for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not leave this issue alone.  We will continue to pound 
away at the government on that issue and on the issues the 
government should be dealing with today such as lower taxes, not 
reciprocal tax agreements with other countries around the world. 
We will pound away on the issue of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know why there is not a bill before us today 
legislating debt paydown.  We want to know why there is not 
legislation today dealing with some of the issues the provinces 
have raised in their recent discussions in Saskatoon.  We want to 
know those things and we will continue to pound away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting the government on notice that we are prepared to 
bring these issues to this place, even if the government has 
become so disconnected from Canadians that the best it can do in 
its first week back is to bring in a bill dealing with reciprocal 
tax treaties with other countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is shameful and we are putting the government on 
notice that we will continue to bring these issues to the 
government, irrespective of the trashy legislation it has brought 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is ready to rule on the 
admissibility of the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may say the Chair has very serious concerns that the amendment 
is out of order.  I refer hon. members to citation 568 of 
Beauchesne's sixth edition wherein it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to 
the question on which the amendment is proposed.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that is proposed by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford is relevant to the bill in its first part, 
but in its second part it would tend to lead to debate on the 
question of attendance records of the Senate, which, while 
possibly of interest to many hon. members, is not relevant to 
Bill S-16 that is currently before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw the hon. member's attention to citation 666 of 
Beauchesne's sixth edition—and I know that the whip of the 
official opposition is familiar with this citation—which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three types of amendments that may be proposed at the 
second reading stage of a bill.  These are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. the hoist (eg. three months, six months). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. the reasoned amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. the referral of the subject-matter to a committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford fails to meet any one of those requirements. 
Accordingly I must rule the amendment out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to be able to raise my 
voice on Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform caucus supports the content of Bill S-16.  The bill 
is technical in nature and addresses some tax discrepancies 
between Canada, Vietnam, Croatia and Chile, along with agreements 
that Canada has with 64 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is part of the thousands of similar mutual agreements 
that increasingly are being made between countries and 
organizations.  It reflects the growing realization that 
co-operation and friendly competition under the same set of rules 
in the long run benefits all the players.  When enlightened 
peoples learn to play fair economically by established rules, all 
of the world societies can be lifted up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the direct opposite approach from the historical methods 
of socialism and in a partial way the tendencies of NDP 
governments in Canada.  The politics of envy, exclusion and 
special rules for some and of quotas, exclusive regulation and a 
host of many other measures that limit basic freedoms in the 
marketplace are the hallmarks of that kind of thinking. 
Unfortunately those kinds of hurtful ideas are still rampant in 
the academic community of the country and in too much of the 
reasoning from some of the NDP sympathizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the social goals may be the same as mine, the ideas 
about what is wise concerning methods of getting there makes all 
the difference.  It goes much beyond belief.  It goes to the hard 
evidence of what it shown over time to work and what is shown not 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travelled to Moscow last year to meet with Russian 
parliamentarians I was saddened by the similarity in the 
underlying concepts of the arguments I heard in their Duma about 
their resentments requiring economic penalty solutions such as 
disincentive taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politics of barriers rather than agreements seem to carry 
the day.  It is no wonder that average Russians will likely 
always be poor.  It comes from the ideas they carry about how to 
get to a better world and those ideas actually destroy any hope 
of ever getting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the same historical problems in this country to a 
lesser degree.  We even still see remnants of those hurtful ideas 
in the budgets of the present finance minister.  Since my 
election to parliament in 1993 fortunately we have seen the 
government reluctantly move toward better economic fundamentals, 
openness, and move away from socialist tendencies.  There is hope 
that we can become fully a freedom loving country where every 
member of society has a chance to participate in the economy and 
have the opportunity to take responsibility for their welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we get our national economic fundamentals right, the 
more we as a society will be able to help those who cannot help 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are agreements of mutual benefit among nations, provincial 
economic zones, markets and labour zones.  All these must 
continue to be opened up with fairness, avoiding discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes an agreement with three countries.  Yet we still 
have a way to go to get it done, to make agreements within our 
country among provinces to enhance the overall economic welfare 
of Canadians.  If Canada then can set the highest of standards 
for the regulation of a self-renewing economy, other nations can 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when ethical fundamentals were violated in the 
Asian economy the consequences eventually came to us all in the 
world.  It hurt us all.  However the bill represents the 
possibility of the opposite trend where we can get our economic 
fundamentals right and the whole world community can be elevated 
to fulfil its human potential.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mutual agreement in fairness is the goal.  How we get there in 
the process is also important.  That is why I am concerned about 
the precedent this bill sets by being first tendered by the 
government in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree that the bill should come from the other place. 
Did the Minister of National Revenue or the Minister of Finance 
feel that the House was too busy to handle this bill from the 
beginning?  Or did the government think that it needed to give 
the other place a bit of work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform truly believes that bills may sometimes come from the 
other place, however only if the other place is elected, 
effective and equal.  So far, none of these traits generally 
characterize the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week was the first week for a few new senators.  Senator 
Mahovlich put on his new suit on Tuesday, which we know from 
reading the full page ad in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> was picked 
out by his personal shopper at Harry Rosen.  Off he went probably 
thinking to himself that he had it made, no coaches yelling at 
him, no penalty box and lots and lots of vacation time.  Who can 
blame any senator for feeling that way?  Senator Thompson took 
good advantage, as have many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had an attendance record like some of today's senators, I 
would have to begin looking for a new job.  My constituents would 
give me the boot pretty fast.  But senators do not have 
constituents.  They may say they do but it has become more of a 
figure of speech.  I would propose that if one randomly asked 10 
people in Ontario to name one senator from Ontario, most would be 
very hard pressed to do so.  Most would probably say Alexei 
Yashin and although he is a senator, he is not from the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not stand here today to criticize everything that is wrong 
about the other place.  In fact, it could very well be quite 
effective. It definitely has the potential, if it was reformed. 
Senator Ghitter may have said it best when he said “We do not 
need to abolish the Senate.  We need to change it.  It is either 
that or maintaining the status quo which means more and more 
downward slide of the Senate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this past year I served on the Special Joint 
Committee on Child Custody and Access.  The committee was made up 
of senators and members of the House of Commons of all political 
stripes.  Our goal was and is to suggest changes to the 
unbalanced Divorce Act.  I can honestly say that the work 
performed by senators was excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many know already that the attendance record in the other place 
of Senator Cools is very good.  Her attendance and her work ethic 
in the committee was also very good.  I know that Senator Cools 
was also appointed.  I also know that the senator takes her job 
very seriously.  She has been a tremendous advocate for the 
disadvantaged who have been shafted by the judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator DeWare is also another member of the committee who not 
only had a good attendance record but provided a great deal of 
knowledge and compassion to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these two senators seem to be exceptions to the 
rule of the other place. We know full well of the exploits of 
Senator Thompson and his abysmal record.  We also know of Senator 
Lucier who attends less than half of all sitting days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I know that the hon. member 
would like to go into Senate attendance.  I suggest to the hon. 
member that first, it is not relevant to the discussion we are 
engaged in today on Bill S-16.  Second, I must advise him that it 
is out of order to speak disrespectfully of the other place.  I 
know he knows that is the rule of this House.  It is in the 
standing orders of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will want to be very careful in the words he uses.  I have 
allowed him to go on about attendance a bit because he was being 
so praiseworthy of certain hon. senators.  He knows that like us, 
they are members of the houses of parliament and he must avoid 
speaking disrespectfully of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite him to refrain from getting into anything that would 
touch on a personal attack on any hon. senator or that would 
speak in any way disrespectfully of the other house of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, last week the Prime 
Minister appointed Senator Roche to the other place.  For all we 
know this senator may end up displaying excellent attendance 
records.  He may even become valuable when bills need that sober 
second thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the point I am trying to make.  The point is that 
the Prime Minister had every opportunity to wait until the 
Alberta Senate elections on October 19 and then appoint a winner. 
Senator Roche had the opportunity to throw his hat in the ring. 
In recent days he said that he agrees with Senate reform.  He has 
also had the opportunity to honour his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Prime Minister, by not waiting until the election, he 
has told Albertans that they simply do not count. In one easy 
sweep the Prime Minister has thrown Alberta mud on democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney honoured the wishes of 
Albertans in 1989 when he appointed elected Senator Stan Waters. 
The Prime Minister may have protested at first but in the end he 
respected the wishes of Albertans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key word is respect.  It is a word that Canada's Prime 
Minister must comprehend.  The Prime Minister may believe the 
other place is working just fine, but it is unfortunate that he 
does not believe in listening to what Canadians think about it. 
He may even want to listen to the words of those in the other 
place because they too believe that changes should take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are committed to moving ahead, to making democracy 
better and to bringing more accountability.  To the 
dissatisfaction of so many, the Liberals are keen on holding on 
to the status quo.  Canadians are not willing to accept that 
status quo however.  They believe in a strong Canada and believe 
in democracy.  They do not believe in the old top down approach 
preserved by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that the Prime Minister let go of his gigantic ego 
and did what is right for the country.  If the ego means too much 
and if the pride is too deep to change, then perhaps it is time 
to call it quits and let a more creative leader and maybe even a 
better party step in and make Canada a place of pride where all 
can more fully participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “that” and substituting the following therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House declines to give second reading to Bill S-16, an act 
to implement an agreement between Canada and the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam, an agreement between Canada and the Republic 
of Croatia, and a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Chile, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, since the 
principle of bill does not address the issue of an elected Senate 
introducing legislation which this House finds unacceptable in 
today's political environment and, in particular, this House 
finds it offensive that an Alberta senator has been recently 
appointed by the Prime Minister before the people of Alberta vote 
to fill the said position in the upcoming Senate elections in 
October. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby has proposed an amendment to the 
House.  Once again I draw the hon. member's attention to citation 
568 of Beauchesne's which states “It is an imperative rule that 
every amendment must be relevant to the question on which the 
amendment is proposed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reluctance, the Chair finds that the amendment proposed by 
the hon. member is irrelevant to the principles of this bill 
which deals with taxation matters and not with an amendment of 
the constitution with respect to the Senate of Canada. 
Accordingly, I must rule the amendment out of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak to the bill on tax conventions.  But first, 
I would like to make a digression similar to that of my Reform 
colleague earlier.  I do not want to take away from this bill, 
which I consider very important.  Tax conventions are always 
important, as are their provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the precipitous drop in the value of the Canadian 
dollar, its effects on the economy, the three consecutive months 
of slower economic growth, the declining orders with businesses, 
all the composite indexes, including those released yesterday by 
Statistics Canada for the month of August, indicate that we are 
in a period of economic slowdown.  However, the Minister of 
Finance keeps producing fantastic surpluses every month off the 
backs of the unemployed, the sick, the provinces, everywhere 
except his own back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of using these surpluses to stimulate economic growth, 
he most unwisely prefers to pay off part of the debt, whereas he 
should be setting up reserves and using them right now to 
stabilize the economy.  I would like this to have been debated 
in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me important that we do not find ourselves in ten 
months facing the delayed effects of a recession, in a full 
recession with the loss of thousands of jobs, because the 
Minister of Finance failed to carry out his responsibilities and 
failed to use tax revenues wisely to stimulate economic growth, 
create jobs and reverse the trend we have seen in recent months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I would have liked such a debate, but I would like to 
devote the next few minutes to Bill S-16, which I consider very 
important.  It is aimed at implementing three tax conventions, 
which I will explain later and which were signed between Canada 
and three countries: Croatia, Chile and Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these tax conventions? They are agreements Canada has 
signed with the countries I just mentioned to prevent Canadian 
companies, for instance, that have branches in Croatia, Chile or 
Vietnam from having the revenues, capital or profits from their 
branches abroad taxed twice when these revenues are brought back 
into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposite is also true. Chilean companies also have branches 
in Canada. These tax conventions ensure that the same revenues 
are not taxed twice. This would not make any sense and would be 
both unfair and devastating at the economic level and in terms 
of job creation in Canada as well as in Croatia, Vietnam and 
Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax conventions are based on a very good principle. This 
practice has been in effect in Canada and throughout the world 
for many years now. 
Canada has signed dozens of tax treaties with various countries, 
and that is all very fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the tax treaties or tax conventions we sign 
with other countries arises when the tax rates in these 
countries are very different than our own. The difference may be 
so great that, if revenues are taxed in the other country and 
not in Canada, there is a terrible fiscal distortion. Also, 
Revenue Canada stands to lose a lot of money in tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take as an example a country like Barbados. Barbados is 
considered a tax haven, just like Bermuda, Liberia, and other 
countries. In these countries, the rate of taxation is so low 
that it is almost non-existent. In Barbados, the maximum 
corporate income tax rate is 2.5%. 
For your information, the maximum tax rate in Canada for 
businesses is about 40%. The tax rate ranges from 25% to 40% 
depending on the nature of the industry and the tax expenditures 
applicable to each business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, when Canada signs a tax treaty with Barbados, it 
means that a Canadian company with a branch in that country will 
pay only 2.5% tax on its profits there and can bring the rest 
into Canada without having to pay a cent to Revenue Canada. This 
makes no sense at all. The gap is too wide between the taxation 
rates in these two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bahamas, it is even worse: the taxation rate is zero. If 
Canada signs a tax treaty with the Bahamas, Canadian companies 
that have a branch in that country will pay almost zero tax on 
their profits there. They will then bring that money into 
Canada. 
Since the profits will have already been taxed in the Bahamas, 
no tax will have to be paid in Canada by the parent company. 
This creates a substantial imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, when Canada signs a tax treaty with another 
country, we have to make sure that the tax rates are comparable, 
that Revenue Canada will not lose tax revenues and that this tax 
treaty will not encourage companies to open bogus or even 
legitimate branches in countries considered to be tax havens 
simply because tax rates there are very low and because there is 
a tax treaty. The Canadian company pays tax in that foreign 
country and does not have to pay tax in Canada, which means a 
loss of tax revenues for Revenue Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are watching us today should know that it is the 
people of Quebec and Canada who have to foot the bill for this 
loss of tax revenues, for those taxes that are not paid in 
Canada by Canadian companies because of these kinds of tax 
treaties with countries that are considered to be tax havens. It 
is the people of Quebec and Canada who have to pay the taxes 
that these businesses avoid paying through the existence of 
reciprocal taxation agreements also known as tax treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have to avoid signing such agreements with 
countries that have taxation rates that are very different from 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Bloc Quebecois was elected to this place five 
years ago, every time a bill to implement a tax convention has 
been introduced in the House, we have taken these conventions 
very seriously, as they could ultimately result in tax losses 
for Canada, which would have to be covered by individual and 
corporate taxpayers in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time, we have carefully considered the conventions on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether the countries entering 
into a tax agreement with Canada had comparable tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, when we checked in the International 
Tax Summaries, 1998, at first glance, based on the analysis 
contained in this document and our own analysis of the 
situation, comparing tax rates with tax expenditures, supply, 
etc., tax rates in Croatia, Chile and Vietnam seemed to be 
relatively the same as in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income tax rates varied between 20% and 35%. As such, a 
maximum tax rate of 35% is fairly similar to what we find in 
this country. The maximum corporate tax rate was also 35%. 
Canada and Croatia basically have comparable rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to Chile, again, the maximum tax rate was 35%. So, it is 
really comparable to Canadian rates. There is no big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vietnam, tax rates vary between 0% and 60%. Compared to our 
35% to 40%, a maximum rate of 60% may be making this convention 
slightly unfavourable to Vietnam, as far as individual taxpayers 
are concerned at least. It all depends on the type of 
relationship and the subsidiaries that will be established in 
Vietnam by Canadian interests and vice versa. All in all, as a 
basis for assessing comparative tax rates, let us say we do not 
see any problem with this tax convention and we will support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since April 1994, when the Bloc Quebecois first intervened with 
respect to a tax convention bill, we have been asking the 
Minister of Finance and the government to tidy up some 
long-standing tax conventions with countries whose tax rates 
differ radically from Canadian tax rates and, if need be, to set 
them aside because they create imbalances in fiscal exchanges 
between Canada and the parties to these conventions, which are 
considered tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Minister of Finance on countless occasions to 
update these conventions.  As I mentioned earlier, the tax rates 
in conventions signed with Liberia, Barbados and Bermuda are so 
low that there is a real shortfall for Revenue Canada. 
When Canadian companies with branches in these countries realize 
profits that are taxed at anywhere from 0% to 2.5%, instead of 
the 25% to 40% they would be taxed at here, depending on the 
nature of the tax, there is a substantial imbalance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Distortions are created and there is also a shortfall that can 
be substantial for individuals and for Quebec and Canadian 
companies.  They must make up this shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we asked the Minister of Finance to do something 
about this, we received a completely detached and unconcerned 
reply, just as each time we asked him to really reform taxation 
he told us that we had done a good job, that our analysis was 
correct, but completely side-stepped the fundamental changes that 
should have been introduced in 1993 after the election. Behind a 
veneer of equity and fiscal fairness, the Liberal Party talked 
about overhauling taxation. 
Once this government was elected, what happened to its concern 
for tax fairness, for tax equity, and what happened to the 
promised reform of the Canadian tax system, which is still full 
of loopholes? Our tax system still includes tax conventions with 
countries with which we should not have such treaties, because 
it is very costly for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we ask the Minister of Finance to review these 
conventions with countries considered to be tax havens, he tells 
us that it is not an urgent matter. He also tells us that, over 
time, the government will make a few minor reforms here and 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, it would have been so simple—as we suggested to the 
finance minister back then and have kept suggesting every year, 
whenever we have had the opportunity to do so when dealing with 
other bills involving tax conventions—to correct the situation. 
A few years ago, the United States and the European countries 
were quick to react and make adjustments, in light of these 
imbalances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say, for example, that Canada has signed a tax convention 
with a country that has a 2.5% tax rate, as is the case for 
Barbados, or where taxes are practically non-existent, as in the 
Bahamas. But let us assume a 2.5% tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States solved the issue by providing a tax credit to 
companies that have already paid some taxes on profits made by 
subsidiaries in countries such as Barbados. So, a tax credit is 
given to American businesses that have already paid a 2.5% tax 
on their profits. 
These companies are given a credit equivalent to what they have 
already paid in taxes to Barbados, but they have to pay regular 
taxes to the American government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if you paid $10 in taxes to Barbados and would 
normally have to pay $40 in the United States, you now owe $30 
in taxes on your corporate profits. The amount already paid in 
the foreign country is taken into account. This makes it 
possible to continue to have tax conventions with countries 
whose tax rates are much lower than ours. A tax credit is 
granted to companies that have subsidiaries in countries 
considered to be tax havens, for the portion—however small—of 
taxes already paid abroad. These companies then pay to the 
American government the full amount of taxes that they would 
normally have to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not hard to understand. It is logical and it is fair. 
That is called tax fairness, tax equity, which involves the 
payment of the money owed, no more, no less, to the government 
by individuals and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a business owes the government money, but through a 
subsidiary in a country considered to be a tax haven it does not 
pay its fair share, it is the responsibility of the Minister of 
Finance and of the Liberal government to recover this money.  It 
does not mean threatening the survival of a business, it means 
ensuring that all businesses receive the same treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian business operating on Canadian soil without a 
subsidiary in a tax haven pays its share of taxation at a rate 
varying between 25% and 40%.  Why then would a business with a 
subsidiary in a tax haven be required to pay only 2.5% or 
even 0%?  It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are distortions.  There are major injustices. 
Representatives of business ask us why the Minister of Finance 
has failed to act in this matter up to now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance provides little information. It keeps 
no record of financial losses that occur as a result of these 
tax conventions.  Nor does it keep a record of the number of 
businesses set up each year so very carefully in countries 
considered to be tax havens.  However, the information we have 
indicates that nothing has changed.  Quite the contrary, the 
situation has worsened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look just at the six major Canadian banks.  A number of 
criticisms may be levelled at them, but this one is well 
founded.  The six major Canadian banks have 119 branches abroad, 
including 57 in the Caribbean, where tax havens abound.  There 
are not a lot of people, and there is not a lot of wealth. 
What are the 57 branches of the six major Canadian banks doing 
there?  Banking, no doubt, but enough to justify maintaining 57 
branches in the West Indies?  We need some hard answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I explained how tax havens worked.  The tax rate is very 
low. Revenues and tax losses are allowed to circulate between 
head office and the subsidiaries abroad.  There are tricks to 
saving taxes and perhaps the banks use them in the West Indies. 
Of the 119 branches abroad, 57 are in the West Indies.  Now that 
is really something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Cayman Islands, a typical example, the situation has not 
changed, it has worsened.  Around the mid 1990s, in 1994-95, 
there were 28,000 companies on the Cayman Islands, a tax haven 
par excellence, for a population of 30,000.  That is just about 
one company per inhabitant. 
We can see it makes no sense.  However, these are the countries 
we have relations, this sort of tax convention, with.  It makes 
no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we keep asking to have things cleared up and a 
simple rule applied, as the Americans did recently.  There 
should be a tax to be paid in Canada, the usual business tax, 
and a credit given for the tax already paid abroad—whether it 
is 15%, 20% or 25%—and the tax payable less the credit comes to 
something close to zero.  That is the way it should be.  This 
way we could say there was no problem for countries we have tax 
conventions with, if their tax rate is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit amounts to the tax they paid there, and the tax 
payable here comes to zero on calculation.  However, when really 
ridiculously low tax rates are involved, there should be an 
amount payable covering the difference in tax rates with 
Canada's higher rate so these businesses do not rob us.  I 
repeat.  What they do not pay, the taxpayers pay for them.  This 
is indirect robbery by means of a tax convention that is legal 
and has the approval of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often asked myself why we have a Minister of Finance if 
he does nothing, if he does not review taxes, if he does not 
plug tax loopholes and review tax conventions as we ask and if 
he allows hundreds of millions out of the country as the auditor 
general pointed out in 1992.  Why do we pay him?  Why is he there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question was this:  Why is he doing nothing?  I had my 
answer less than one year ago.  We already knew this, but since 
it came from sources other than the Bloc Quebecois, we were not 
going to let it slip by.  Why does the Minister of Finance do 
nothing about tax havens, given the discrepancies I have just 
mentioned?  The simple answer is that, since 1981 when he 
acquired Canada Steamship Lines, he has opened ten subsidiaries 
of that company in other countries. 
These ten subsidiaries are located in Bermuda, Liberia and 
Barbados, three so-called tax havens.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1981, before the Minister of Finance took possession of 
Canada Steamship Lines, these subsidiaries did not exist.  He 
organized his international shipping activities—because everyone 
knows he is involved in shipping, it is public knowledge—by 
opening subsidiaries in tax havens, with preferential tax rates, 
with great flexibility regarding environmental policies, for 
instance.  In some of these countries, very little is respected. 
There was also quite a bit of give in the labour policies. 
These are not necessarily countries with stringent labour laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance himself, who is involved in shipping, is 
at the helm, has subsidiaries of Canada Steamship Lines in 
so-called tax havens.  Is he both judge and jury here?  One might 
well wonder.  The public also has a right to wonder why hundreds 
of millions of dollars are allowed to float away to so-called tax 
havens, why this is allowed to hang fire—for that is what is 
happening—, why tax conventions are maintained with countries 
with tax rates ridiculously close to zero.  We are the ones who 
foot the bill for taxes not paid by Canadian subsidiaries in 
other countries.  We are probably footing the bill for Canada 
Steamship Lines as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfair.  It is inequitable.  There is something about it 
that bothers me and that greatly bothers the public. 
On December 10, 1997, a bill was introduced: Bill C-28. I can 
tell you that we will not drop this matter. We asked that 
special committee be struck to look into Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should remind those who have forgotten what Bill C-28 
was about that its provisions supplemented somewhat tax treaties 
between Canada and countries considered as tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 is a big, massive bill. When it was introduced at 
first reading on December 10, it went almost unnoticed. At 
second reading, however, when it was first debated in the House, 
on February 2, 1998, the Bloc Quebecois went over this bill 
several hundred pages long with a fine-tooth comb. 
We dissected the bill and, toward the end, we found this rather 
short passage—three little paragraphs, 12 lines altogether 
over more than 400 pages of legislation—which proposed a tax 
change with respect to taxes paid by steamship holding 
companies. The Minister of Finance owns such a company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the purpose of this change? It provided for holdings 
involved in international shipping operations in countries like 
Liberia, Bermuda and the Bahamas, where the finance minister's 
ships and companies operate, to be exempt from paying taxes to 
Revenue Canada. And no action would be taken against any of the 
international shipping companies involved. There are only five 
such companies in Canada, and the Minister of Finance owns one 
of them. 
Revenue Canada cannot retroactively prosecute these companies 
for unpaid taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we pointed that out at second reading, we were told we were 
wrong, that it was not the case, that it was not true. The 
Minister of Finance tore up his shirt. For example, when he left 
the House, he had a hard time providing an explanation for five 
minutes. He was stuttering, which is unusual for him. You have 
seen him during oral question period. He is so confident, he is 
so sure of himself that he gives us the short shrift. Even 
though every economic indicator points to a downturn in the 
economy, even though all the experts are talking about a major 
slowdown, and even though an increasing number of them talk 
about a recession in a year from now, as far as the minister is 
concerned, there is no problem. Things are just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two days, he has been using old quotes from the 
experts, and from the Quebec premier, Mr. Bouchard, during oral 
question period. These quotes are old ones dating back to the 
Saskatoon meeting, a month ago. The minister uses old quotes 
from experts that date back to last month, when the Bloc 
Quebecois raised the alarm by saying “be careful about the 
dollar free falling . The Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance are wrong to take this lightly, to play golf and to 
continue to say there is no problem, that there is no adverse 
effect on the economy”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk of a slowdown in the economy. The number of jobs 
could decrease. We pointed that out in early August, and they 
made fun of us. Now, all the indicators point to a downward 
trend. For the past three months the economy has been slowing 
down, the growth rate and the GDP have been decreasing, and the 
Minister of Finance is still quoting what the experts said when 
we raised the alarm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation has changed since then. The experts now agree with 
the Bloc Quebecois. They have asked the minister to use the 
surpluses generated at everyone's expense to, first, reduce 
taxes, second, increase social transfers and, third, lower 
employment insurance contributions, so as to give businesses and 
workers a break. 
But no, everything is just fine, said the minister with 
assurance, no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 2, when this apparent conflict of interest was 
brought out—one that still exists—the Minister of Finance left the 
House, and his assurance left him as well.  He did not have much 
in the way of explanations to offer, since he was the sponsor of 
a bill which offered tax advantages and protection against any 
recourse by Revenue Canada for payment of income and other taxes 
by his shipping subsidiaries located in countries considered to 
be tax havens.  He was stuttering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred us to Len Farber—and I recall it as if it were 
yesterday—his main man for tax policy, but also what I would call 
his main man for shady dealings.  That same Len Farber who told 
us there was no problem with the family trusts condemned by the 
Bloc Quebecois as well as by the auditor general two and a half 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall the two family trusts that moved from Canada 
to the United States.  Two family trusts with total capital 
evaluated at $2 billion, transferred over to the U.S. without a 
cent of tax deducted.  That same Len Farber, the great tax 
expert and organizer of shady dealings for the Minister of 
Finance, told us there was no problem, that everything had been 
done in accordance with the taxation rules, even if the decision 
at midnight to let these two trusts go without any problem had 
been made on December 23, 1990. At the end of the debate, Mr. 
Farber was taken down a peg because the Minister of Finance had 
been obliged to table a bill to block the loopholes that had 
allowed this near-illegal transfer of two two-billion dollar 
trusts to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same Len Farber is given us as a reference by the Minister 
of Finance for an explanation of why there is no problem with 
Bill C-28. 
I met with him personally, along with one other person, in my 
office on the fifth floor, and it was explained to us that there 
might be a problem one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minister introduces a bill which has an impact on a business 
in an area in which he works on the international level. Then a 
person referred by him tells us there could be a problem, a 
potential conflict of interest, that we need to be careful. We 
therefore began to wonder, and the fact is that the appearance 
of conflict of interest remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister then referred us to his ethics counsellor, who 
testified before the Standing Committee on Finance.  Not only 
did he say there might be an appearance of conflict of interest, 
but he put it in writing.  It was repeated time after time that 
a public inquiry was necessary for the sake of the Minister of 
Finance, that all appearance of conflict of interest needed to 
be taken away, because it made no sense to maintain the 
situation as it was. 
The minister always maintained that there was no problem, 
despite all the arguments to the contrary that were put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not often have we seen all four opposition parties present a 
united front. However, on this issue, members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Reform Party, the New Democratic Party and the 
Progressive Conservative Party held a joint press conference to 
demand an inquiry because of the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was their request turned down, but when motions were 
tabled at the Standing Committee on Finance to call witnesses to 
shed light on the impact of Bill C-28 on the Minister of 
Finance's shipping companies, all Liberal members on the 
committee voted against these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the government keep arguing that there is no 
conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. Yet, the Minister of Finance, who is sponsoring a bill 
dealing with international shipping, is the sole owner of an 
international shipping company that operates in tax havens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can you expect changes to the tax system? How can you expect 
the people opposite to be willing to review those tax 
conventions signed with countries whose tax rates are much lower 
than ours, and where tax evasion is possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we know the answer to that question. There is no 
willingness on the part of the government. The people opposite 
may be acting as judge and jury. We will not know for sure—and 
there is still some doubt in my mind—until we shed some light 
on Bill C-28, its impact and the appearance of a conflict of 
interest involving the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder the minister is unwilling to review the tax 
system? 
For five years now, we have been asking him to review the whole 
tax system in order to make it fairer. But he knew that the tax 
rates of shipping companies and our relationship with tax havens 
would fall under the scope of such an extensive reform, which is 
why he did not seem too eager to carry it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we realized what was happening, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
decided to release starting in November 1996 two series of 
studies, some 350 pages, including very serious analyses and 
recommendations. In our studies, we suggested several changes to 
the personal income tax system to make it fairer and to give a 
tax break to middle-income Canadians who, need I remind you, have 
paid most of the $20 billion in new taxes the Minister of Finance 
has imposed since he was appointed in 1994. A large part of this 
$20 billion was paid by middle-income Canadians. 
Businesses in Quebec and Canada absorbed the other $17 billion 
in tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented a document on personal taxes which included 
critical analyses as well as recommendations. When we presented 
this document, the Minister of Finance praised us in the House. 
He said: “I praise the opposition for the serious work it has 
done on personal taxes and for its approach to this issue. I 
recognize there are problems and I recognize this document 
contains some good solutions”. He then took the document and put 
it at the bottom of his desk. When his desk was cleaned at the 
end of the summer, the document was put away in the circular 
file. We got no tax reform proposal from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we presented another document on corporate tax expenditures 
in Canada. It was an analysis of the main tax loopholes used by 
large businesses in Canada. 
Our analysis showed that some of these were outdated but cost 
billions of dollars a year to the Canadian treasury, and they 
still do, with the people of Quebec and Canada having to pay the 
difference in personal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed abolishing certain tax expenditures and transferring 
these savings to small businesses to encourage job creation: for 
example, reduced payroll taxes and tax breaks for businesses 
that create jobs year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance said: “Another serious exercise”. Right. 
We can do without his praise. What we want is tax reform, and we 
never got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance was so embarrassed about not doing 
anything that he decided to establish the Mintz group, a working 
group presided by Mr. Mintz, a highly competent tax expert. This 
group produced a large document. It took them a year as the 
deadline kept being postponed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some recommendations are worthwhile. Others are absolutely 
worthless. But to ease his conscience, the Minister of Finance 
asked the Mintz group to produce an analysis of tax reform. The 
group submitted its report last year. The Minister of Finance 
probably put that report on a shelf or in his desk. It did the 
same with it as it did with our two analytical studies on 
personal and corporate taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no political will on the other side of the House to 
reform our tax system for the reasons I stated earlier. 
I see what the minister has done over the last five years. If 
there is anyone who follows him closely, it is me.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the minister was coasting. Business was good, so he 
surfed, he rode the crest of economic growth. Money was coming 
in—corporations and individuals have paid $37 billion in taxes 
into the federal coffers over the past four and a half years—and 
he collected it. He also took in surplus after surplus in 
the employment insurance fund, to the tune of $6 billion a year, 
during three and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is still collecting and wants it to be legal. He will ask his 
fellow ministers to be his accomplices in robbing the EI fund. 
He has cut assistance to the poor and the sick. 
He has cut billions from transfer payments to the provinces; by 
2003, he will have cut $42 billion from transfers for social 
assistance, higher education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pocketed the money. Everyone—the sick, the disadvantages, 
seniors, students—tightened their belts while he collected. A 
real money machine. Favourable economic conditions, combined 
with cuts imposed on the poorest of the poor and cuts to health 
transfers, that is what he calls sound management of our public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have taken positive steps instead of achieving the 
exact same result through decline management. He could have 
reviewed the whole tax system five years ago, when we asked him 
to; it was in fact part of our platform. He could have plugged 
the loopholes in the tax system with respect to tax havens. 
He could have reviewed the reciprocal treaties, that is, the tax 
conventions with countries considered tax havens.  He could have 
avoided voting in favour of bills promoting international 
shipping, where he has some involvement.  He could have done a 
whole lot of positive things for employment, equity and tax 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, the Minister of Finance took advantage of the economic 
situation.  Money was coming in and everything was fine.  He 
looked like a good manager, but he is one of the worst we have 
ever had.  In the past, the economy was not so kind to finance 
ministers.  We have had Ministers of Finance who were less 
draconian than this one.  They would not have dared take money 
from the sick, the unemployed, those on welfare, students and 
the less fortunate. 
There was respect at that point, which the Minister of Finance 
no longer has for anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 is a good bill, because the countries involved have 
comparable tax rates.  But it has given us an opportunity—and 
we will seize it whenever we can—to criticize the inertia and 
the lies of this government along with the measures it has not 
taken but ought to have to improve the lives of people in Quebec 
and Canada.  These measures could still be taken, because the 
surpluses generated could be used properly instead of to repay 
part of the debt in a context that is very uncertain at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that we do not oppose repayment of the debt.  When 
things are more sure, we will be the first to advocate using a 
large part of the surplus to repay the debt. 
At the moment, however, we have had three consecutive months of 
economic slowdown.  The Statistics Canada composite index tells 
us there was no growth in August, something we have not seen for 
two years.  Businesses' orders are down and jobs are beginning 
to stagnate in the area of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that all this together with the fact that the 
Bank of Canada stupidly raised interest rates by one whole 
percentage point on August 27 sent considerable shock waves 
through the economy, which was already weakened after three 
consecutive months of reductions in the rate of GDP growth. 
We thus have all the ingredients for a major economic slowdown 
in the months to come. Let us not forget that such a downturn 
means fewer jobs created, a loss of wealth and less tax revenues 
for the government. In short, it means hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance now has surpluses he should use to 
stimulate economic growth. He should at least do that good deed, 
given that he has not done any in the past five years. Let us 
give him the honour and ask him to take our request for a 
special budget seriously. 
He should consider using the surpluses to stimulate domestic 
economic growth by reducing taxes for middle-income people—who 
have been paying a lot in the past four years—and by reducing 
EI premiums, so as to give a break to businesses and workers, 
who have contributed more than their fair share in the past few 
years.

premiers. They are asking him to reinvest what he shamelessly 
took from federal transfers to the provinces, and to use that 
money to fund social assistance, higher education and health. 
That is all we are asking him to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we will support Bill S-16. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Palliser, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to 
inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is as follows:  the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest—Hepatitis C. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to be back in the House and to follow my learned 
colleague from the Bloc.  I listened with great interest to his 
speech and his recommendations.  I commend it to the finance 
minister and to government members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to associate myself with most of the other speakers 
who have been up on the bill to talk about the relative 
unimportance of Bill S-16 in comparison with the important 
financial, fiscal and other needs we think we should be 
discussing in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably like many other members of parliament I conducted some 
accountability sessions recently before returning to parliament 
to find out what was on the minds of the constituents in 
Palliser.  We talked about a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the low dollar, the crisis in agriculture, how 
any surplus the federal government has will be apportioned, the 
lack of a national transportation system, the fact that Canada is 
virtually the only country in the OECD that does not have a 
national transportation system, the recent hike in interest 
rates, the lack of national funding for medicare, what to do with 
the EI surplus and the Tobin toll.  I assure the House that 
nobody talked to me at all about tax treaties between Canada and 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Republic of Croatia and 
the Republic of Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very thin gruel by comparison to what Canadians 
would like to be talking about here this afternoon.  I know it is 
up to the government to propose legislation.  I will give it the 
benefit of the doubt and suggest that this is perhaps a bit of 
housekeeping that needs to be tidied from last June.  We in this 
caucus would certainly hope that the government moves forward in 
a speedy fashion to bring in more substantive pieces of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caucus will be supporting Bill S-16.  It is a tax treaty 
bill that we do support on its merit to avoid double taxation and 
to prevent fiscal evasion.  The taxation rules of the treaties 
need to be passed by an act of parliament in order to give them 
precedence over domestic legislation, and the conventions follow 
OECD models on double taxation conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is quite similar to several tax treaties introduced in 
parliament in past years, for example Bill S-9 and Bill C-10. 
Fortunately Bill S-9 is that infamous piece of legislation passed 
in the 35th Parliament that was embraced, supported and promoted 
by both the government and the Reform Party that offers 
substantial tax breaks for Canadians who make donations to 
American charities and American universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is reciprocal it is not terribly because we have about 
25,000 Canadian students in the United States compared to only a 
very few thousand Americans who come north for their 
post-secondary education.  It is a huge tax break for the wealthy 
in this country.  Added to it was the U.S. estate property taxes 
dating all the way back to 1987, paid for not by the Americans 
but by the Canadian government. This is just a reminder about the 
very significant shortcomings of Bill S-9.  Bill S-16 was studied 
by the Senate foreign affairs committee and returned to the 
Senate without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, the tax treaties are between Canada and the 
Republic of Vietnam, the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of 
Chile. 
Currently we do not have tax treaties with these three countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's rationale for the legislation is that it is 
necessary because the provisions of the respective agreements are 
sometimes different from the provisions of the Income Tax Act and 
it is necessary to ensure that as much tax reporting as possible 
be allowed.  These agreements will override the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we note the tax treaties are necessary to avoid 
double taxation and to prevent fiscal evasion.  They also provide 
tax certainties to individuals and companies carrying on 
businesses abroad, foreigners carrying on business in Canada, and 
individuals receiving income from Canada who are living abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pension payments between the respective countries are treated in 
the following way:  Vietnam and Croatia apply withholding tax 
rates limited to 15%, while Chile allows all pension payments to 
be taxed only in the country where they are paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social security payments under the tax treaty provisions are 
taxable only in the country in which they originate and in 
accordance with domestic legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid double taxation each of the treaties also 
contains specific rules which in the case of Canada refers to an 
exemption for certain dividends received from foreign affiliates 
and for credit in other cases.  One exception is the treaty with 
Vietnam which contains a rule referred to as the tax sparing 
provision, ensuring that the most developed countries will not 
tax away some incentives provided under the domestic legislation 
of less developed countries.  This is apparently to be a short 
term provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties provide for an exchange of tax information 
between the revenue authorities of countries to assist them in 
the fight against tax fraud and evasion.  The problem, however, 
is that the treaties only say that information may be exchanged 
and do not say it must be exchanged or is required to be 
exchanged.  For example, individuals and companies which may want 
to play around with the tax system run a risk of tax authorities 
obtaining tax information but no guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While supporting this initiative to create better checks and 
balances on taxation information matters between these countries, 
however, we should encourage the same government to look further 
to the concerns about large flows of investments that go 
unrecorded and the level of fiscal evasion that these unrecorded 
investments represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on my feet it is important to make reference to the 
Tobin tax on foreign exchange transactions which can be used in 
this area.  Indeed there are areas of the international economy 
that require active supervision and control.  That is our strong 
contention.  International trade and investment grow best during 
the careful process of long term planning and prediction. 
Uncertainty such as the current turbulence in today's financial 
markets and their effects on domestic interest rates and dollar 
values are too costly.  The biggest challenge we have is to 
regulate the financial markets so that their speed is slowed and 
their powers reduced somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a fair amount of talk about the Tobin tax or the 
Tobin toll.  I will take a few minutes during this intervention 
to comment on it.  The Tobin tax derives its name from James 
Tobin, a Nobel prize winning economist who first proposed the 
idea of a tax on foreign exchange transactions that would be 
applied uniformly by all major countries.  I believe he was 
talking about a small amount, less than .5%, to be levied on all 
foreign currency exchange transactions to deter speculation on 
currency fluctuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the rate would be low enough not to have a significant 
effect on longer term investment where yield is higher, it would 
cut into the yields of speculators moving massive amounts of 
currency around the globe as they seek to profit from minute 
differentials in currency fluctuation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask why the support is growing for such a tax.  The 
interest has grown rapidly in such a mechanism as the place of 
foreign exchange transactions and financial deregulation has 
accelerated significantly over the past decade.  We believe that 
today about $1.5 trillion U.S. is traded every day on unregulated 
markets and less than 5% of this activity is related to trade in 
goods and services.  The remaining 95% is simply speculative 
activity as traders take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations 
and international interest rate differentials.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of financial speculation plays havoc with national 
budgets, as we have seen this summer in our own country, economic 
planning and the allocation of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and citizens are becoming increasingly frustrated by 
the whimsical and often irrational activities in global financial 
markets that have such an influence over national economies and 
are seeking some means to curb damaging and unproductive 
speculative activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A uniform tax on foreign exchange transactions would deter 
speculation by imposing a small tax on such activities.  This 
would reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations and 
provide exporters, importers and long term investors a more 
stable exchange rate in return for paying the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax would give more autonomy to governments to set national 
fiscal and monetary policies by making possible greater 
differences between short term interest rates in different 
currencies.  Such a tax would also reinvigorate the capacity of 
central banks to alter exchange rate trends by intervening in 
currency markets.  By cutting down on the overall volume of 
foreign exchange transactions, central banks would not need as 
much financial clout in order to intervene in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax would raise revenue.  By all estimates there would be 
significant sums and receipts.  Assumptions vary about the actual 
rate of the tax, the decline in volume of trade, the amount of 
trade circumventing the tax and which transactions would be 
exempt; however, for illustration, assuming a conservative tax 
rate of 0.2% and an effective tax base of $75 trillion U.S. 
annually, the tax would yield about $150 billion annually in 
receipts.  Given the declining commitments to bilateral 
development assistance around the world, the tax should generate 
important resources to support sustainable human development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two key political issues involved with putting such a 
tax into place.  First, it would be necessary to forge agreement 
amongst the major countries to implement a uniform tax.  Second, 
there would have to be agreement on the collection and 
distribution of the tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing countries have always been much more vulnerable to 
exchange rate volatility, but there is for the first time a 
convergence of interest between industrialized and developing 
countries as they all seek stronger government autonomy and more 
effective central bank intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressure is building on national governments, including this 
one, and international institutions to support a Tobin tax from 
coalitions of non-governmental organizations representing labour, 
church, environment, women, youth, seniors and poverty groups as 
they seek to restore some measure of democratic control of their 
national economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more significant is the fact that many governments face 
large deficits and strong anti-tax populism among the electorate 
and are looking for new sources of tax revenue that are not 
politically suicidal.  Such a minimal tax will not hit main 
street in this case, but rather Bay and Wall Streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise of a new source of revenue will likely be the 
primary motivation for reaching agreement to implement the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collection and distribution of the tax revenue is a much 
trickier question.  The tax rate would have to be applied 
worldwide at the same rate in all markets.  There would also have 
to be agreement on precisely which transactions would be 
subjected to the tax.  Compliance would depend on the banking and 
market institutions.  Tracking the activity would certainly be 
possible as the financial industry has the sophisticated 
technology required to do this, but enforcement would rest with 
the major economic powers and the international financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would certainly be some strong resistance from members of 
the financial sectors, some of whom have already begun to speak 
out against this proposal.  That is not surprising.  It is 
possible that some members of the financial community might 
support the tax; however, the pace and volumes traded in the 
markets has added a level of risk to doing business, for as much 
as great profits can result from speculation, so can great losses 
such as the Barings Bank fiasco of a couple of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some experienced business people may see the value of the 
limited risk of more stable markets suggesting, if not the Tobin 
proposal, other strategies to limit the volatility of the current 
global money system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are supporting and recommending is a tax to curb 
speculation in foreign currency exchange as an innovative and 
fair proposal that will contribute to restoring democratic 
control over our national economies and generate substantial 
revenues to build a sustainable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments around the world, the UN, the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank should take the steps necessary to 
implement a tax to curb currency speculation as quickly as 
possible.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill S-16, passed 
by the Senate on June 2, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill S-16 is to implement an agreement between 
Canada and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, an agreement 
between  Canada and Croatia, and a convention between Canada and 
the Republic of Chile for the avoidance of double taxation and 
the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my Bloc Quebecois colleague mentioned, our party will not 
oppose the tax conventions signed between Canada and the three 
countries I have just named, in so far as the purpose of these 
agreements is to ensure fair and equitable tax treatment of 
persons, and to encourage trade and investments between the 
countries.  I would point out that the term “person” includes 
private individuals, corporations, trusts and any other group of 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the countries concerned in this bill have a rate of 
taxation that is almost the same as Canada's, I will not speak 
against the bill.  But, while we are on the topic, I would like 
to use the time I have to speak about tax conventions in force 
between Canada and certain countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although tax conventions avoid double taxation, they are in many 
cases a source of problems and tax evasion. 
Care must therefor be taken that these treaties do not open the 
door to tax evasion.  To that end, tax conventions must be 
limited to countries with a tax rate comparable to Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the tax conventions avoid double taxation on people's 
incomes, in certain cases they are a source of problems and 
encourage serious tax evasion.  Although the most recent 
treaties, which are based the OECD model, are relatively 
standard, Canada does have some older ones with countries 
considered tax havens because their individual and corporate tax 
rates are low, or non-existent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, let us keep in mind that the Auditor General 
of Canada has raised this matter on more than one occasion.  I 
would like to quote to you what he wrote in his 1992 report. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Netherlands Antilles subsidiary of a Canadian company had 
assets of $865 million and income of $92 million not subject to 
the FAPI rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the income of the foreign subsidiary has not been taxed 
at a rate that approximates Canadian rates, it can be 
transferred to the Canadian parent as tax-free dividends. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offshore income is not taxed on entering Canada, but it 
carries with it federal and provincial tax credits on dividends 
paid out  to Canadian shareholders. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And he concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parent incurred the financing costs for its 
investment in the subsidiary and reported a tax loss in Canada 
of $29 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is shameful. I could talk about many other similar 
instances, in the case of the government, but it would fall on 
deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another danger in certain tax treaties, namely that of 
being able to change tax rules in favour of friends of the 
government or in favour of people in the government. I am 
referring here to Bill C-28. 
Members will recall that the Minister of Finance is both judge 
and jury in this bill and that, should this bill become law, it 
will bring millions of dollars to his company, Canada Steamship 
Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That outrageous stunt was discovered by my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. Members will also recall that all 
opposition parties supported the Bloc in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance should protect the interests of Canadian 
taxpayers the same way he protects his own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties and the manipulation of legislation cost billions 
of dollars to taxpayers. These are billions of dollars in tax 
revenues that are lost to the detriment of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any serious and responsible government, however, would spend a 
lot of resources to assess, adjust and renegotiate the tax 
treaties that cause problems, especially those most likely to 
cost Canada a lot of tax money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But guess how many public servants in the finance department are 
working on these tax treaties: 100, 25, 12? No, in fact, the 
finance department has only one employee working on tax 
treaties, but fortunately, he works full time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not question the competence and seriousness of this public 
servant. Our only regret is that, in Canada, we only have one 
public servant to oversee some 60 tax treaties and work on 30 
more to come, when there are hundreds of millions, if not 
billions of dollars, at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a government turning a blind eye to the 
potential exodus of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue because it undermines the overall 
integrity of our tax system. With all these holes in our system, 
Canada's reputation is also tarnished. It is very troublesome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the billions of dollars the Minister of Finance has cut in 
transfers to the provinces for hospitals, schools and social 
assistance, the honest citizens of our country, who pay their 
taxes to Ottawa, want their government to at least ensure that 
everyone pays his fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One good thing is that, in some cases, tax conventions apply to 
our performers and all Canadian and Quebec artists who perform 
abroad, even our athletes, like our hockey players and all the 
others who are earning a living abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we know that tax agreements are nothing new. 
They have always existed and will always exist, and will even 
increase in numbers with globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax agreements establish what we call reciprocal taxation, 
insofar as Canada's corporate tax rates and those of the 
countries with which Canada signed these agreements are 
equivalent or comparable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of tax 
agreements signed between Canada and other countries when these 
treaties are aimed at ensuring fair and equitable taxation of 
residents and non-residents, thus encouraging trade and 
investments between countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But make no mistake: these treaties should not open the door to 
excessive tax evasion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
bill lets Canada ratify income tax treaties with Vietnam, Croatia 
and Chile.  It is all part of a very important process that is 
consistent with our position as a nation in embracing the global 
opportunities that we have. It also addresses the challenges we 
have dealing with a world whereby globalization and the forces of 
international trade are making national borders less and less 
relevant in terms of economic matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways, it is extraordinarily important that we move 
quickly to ratify these types of tax conventions to ensure that 
we are not allowing companies, particularly in a global context, 
to escape paying fair taxes and by the same token that we are not 
duplicating taxes.  In light of the declining role of the 
nation-state in terms of its ability in many ways to effect taxes, 
this type of treaty is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a background on the whole issue of trade, many of the people 
in the House today will remember that in 1988 our party, the 
Progressive Conservative Party and the government of Brian 
Mulroney spearheaded the free trade efforts in Canada and fought 
a general election openly with the Canadian public.  We engaged 
in a dialogue with the Canadian public in the most open sense. 
That battle was won by the Progressive Conservatives. Canada has 
won since then by engaging in open trading relationships with 
countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot as a fairly small country in terms of our population 
which numbers fewer than 30 million people, prosper and grow our 
economy and employ more Canadians unless we are willing to 
embrace the opportunities of free and unfettered trade.  It is 
that path I am proud to say our party put Canada on.  As such, we 
are supportive of Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to reference the fact that this bill was 
introduced in the other place.  I know there has been significant 
discussion on that issue in that the other place is introducing 
legislation like Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the other place and recognize the 
tremendous pool of talent that we have in the other place, 
particularly on the extremely technical tax treaty type of 
legislation. Frankly, it would be an affront to the Canadian 
taxpayer if we were not to utilize the other place by engaging 
them in the very important work they are capable of.  In the 
Senate we have a significant pool of talent and abilities that it 
would be absolutely wrong for us not to utilize.

billion and our imports totalled some $329 billion.  The majority 
of our trade is with the United States.  Naturally, it is very 
important that we continue our focus on improving our trading 
relationships with our largest partner, the U.S. That being the 
case, it is extraordinarily important that we continue to work 
and build relationships with other countries, Vietnam, Croatia 
and Chile.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we now have more trade barriers within 
Canada due to interprovincial trade barriers between Newfoundland 
and Nova Scotia than we do between Nova Scotia and Chile.  This 
points out the fundamental flaw of the whole policy of 
interprovincial trade barriers which again serve to deny 
Canadians an opportunity to build a comparative advantage right 
here at home, but that is another issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of trade has been a significant one as of late 
particularly in light of the global currency markets and the 
tumult that the currency markets have seen recently.  It has been 
very convenient for the government to blame commodity prices and 
the “Asian crisis” for the weakness of the Canadian dollar but 
it is far greater than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that there has been a secular decline in 
the Canadian dollar for the past 30 years and that structural 
issues need to be addressed within Canada.  These include 
productivity related issues like the interprovincial trade 
barriers, like the fact that we have the highest rate of income 
taxes of the G-7 countries, like the fact that we have a 
regulatory burden that exceeds that of many of our largest 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those types of issues will become more and more relevant in the 
future.  As we sign tax conventions in the future it will be 
important to recognize not only that we should sign tax 
conventions but that our rates of taxes within Canada not exceed 
the rates of taxation of our partners.  We are handcuffing 
Canadian producers and Canadian companies and individuals.  We 
are preventing them from producing and performing to their utmost 
ability in competing globally, and that is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the Progressive Conservative government opened up the 
world to Canadians when it opened up global opportunities to 
Canadians.  That courageous policy leap was followed by 
structural changes in the Canadian economy which included the 
elimination of the manufacturers sales tax and the deregulation 
of financial services and transportation industries.  Those were 
the types of structural changes we needed then and which have 
proven to be successful now. I call upon the government to 
continue to make these structural changes, to hearken back to 
some of the courageous policy initiatives of the previous 
government and to continue on the path Canadians need to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough that we open up global opportunities to 
Canadians.  We need to ensure that our domestic economic policies 
provide the type of economy that produces the entrepreneurial 
expertise and excellence that are necessary not only to compete 
but to succeed in a global environment. We need to ensure 
domestically in terms of tax issues that both our corporate taxes 
and our personal taxes become fairer and flatter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mintz report on business taxation which was introduced some 
months ago was an extraordinarily well written document.  It 
dealt with the complex issue of corporate taxation in a holistic 
and rational way.  I hope the government will give a significant 
amount of attention to the Mintz report and will move to simplify 
and reduce both corporate and personal income taxes within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians cannot compete and succeed if we handcuff them to the 
past, if we handcuff them to high rates of taxation, regulatory 
burden, interprovincial trade barriers and an interventionist 
economy that is simply not realistic or sustainable in a modern 
global context.  We need to continue to ensure that Canadians pay 
their taxes and that foreign companies doing business in Canada 
pay their taxes.  We have to ensure those taxes are fair and not 
so convoluted and complex that Canadians and Canadian companies 
have to hire accountants simply to deal with their own 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to push for increased access to global markets 
from this party.  I recognize members of the Liberal government 
have become born again free traders.  Many of the members 
opposite fought vociferously against free trade agreements in 
1988.  However I do commend them for having learned so much from 
us at that juncture and in having come so far in embracing sound 
economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask them again at this juncture to do what they have 
done very well over the past several years which is to take 
policies from Conservatives and move forward into the 21st 
century with the type of economically realistic and economically 
necessary policies that some believe only the Conservative Party 
can introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important periodically that a Conservative 
government be elected, such that those types of policies be 
introduced, even if they are adopted by the government after. The 
only thing worse than their having taken our policies so 
blatantly and shamelessly would have been for them not to have 
taken our policies because they would have substituted some of 
their own which would have been far worse. In fact, the Liberal 
government opposite has been a government of sound and original 
ideas but unfortunately its original ideas are seldom sound and 
its sound ideas are never original. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is encouraging to see that the government has come so far, 
even in terms of the deficit reduction issue.  That was an issue 
we addressed very clearly by reducing the deficit as a percentage 
of GDP by half during the period of time that our government was 
in power and by reducing program spending growth from 15% to 
zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the kind of courage the previous Conservative 
government demonstrated before fiscal responsibility became cool. 
Back in 1979 Joe Clark introduced a budget that was defeated 
because it was too fiscally responsible for the time.  Today even 
the New Democrats talk fiscal responsibility.  It has become a 
buzzword. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, we have no problem with Bill S-16 and will be 
supporting it today.  We just hope that in the future we will 
continue to see not only income tax convention legislation but 
also the types of structural changes made in the Canadian 
domestic economy that allow Canadians to compete successfully 
abroad and to not just compete but to succeed and to prosper in 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some discussions among all the parties and with 
everyone's co-operation, the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca 
would be the last speaker on this bill and in fact would conclude 
his remarks no later than 5.35 p.m. If that is reasonable to all 
members here, then we would proceed with the debate and we would 
ask that the question be put at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  As a clarification, I assume that the 
question will be put on the motion and it is understood that 
there would be no questions or comments at the conclusion of the 
remarks by the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it agreed that we proceed as outlined by the chief government 
whip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill S-16 which deals 
with double taxation with the countries of Vietnam, Croatia and 
Chile.  This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Double taxation has often been seen as a real hamstring to our 
private sector.  The removal of double taxation also enables 
developing countries in particular to develop a stronger economy 
in the future.  It also enables companies in other countries to 
work effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end effect of the removal of double taxation actually lowers 
the taxation levels for the private sector so the private sector 
can engage effectively in these countries.  We should strive to 
ensure that taxation occurs only in one country rather than two. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of South Africa, the removal of double taxation 
which took place a few years ago was very effective and helped to 
stimulate investment in that country in a very effective way.  It 
all boils down to a way of improving development in developing 
countries.  It also helps the neediest people in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to address the aspect of taxation within 
our country.  As we know, the taxation levels here are probably 
the greatest barrier to the ability of our private sector to be 
competitive.  In comparing our situation to that of the United 
States, couples with two incomes are actually earning 44% more 
take-home pay than an equivalent couple in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses are labouring under a tax level that is at least 13% 
greater in Canada.  It hamstrings the ability of our private 
sector to be competitive with countries down south and, as a 
result, has contributed to brain drain and the inability of our 
private sector to be as aggressive as it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to look at the egregious rules and 
regulations that hamstring our private sector.  We continue to 
put rule after rule after regulation on the books without taking 
a step back and looking at whether the rules and regulations are 
necessary.  It would be wonderful if the finance committee 
created a subcommittee and utilized the private sector and its 
experience to look at the rules and regulations that exist on the 
books and remove the ones that are ineffective.  By doing this we 
would greatly improve the nimbleness and efficiency of the 
private sector and, by doing so, enable the private sector to 
hire more individuals and be increasingly competitive in the 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look more carefully at research and development. 
Research and development is a cornerstone and a pillar of our 
economy.  Right now we are at the bottom of the barrel of all 
OECD nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education needs to be spruced up.  We need to look at how 
education can better reflect the needs of our economy in the 
future.  I would ask the government to work with its provincial 
counterparts in developing a think tank to ensure that our 
post-secondary institutions and students can better understand 
the needs of the future and thereby get skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also room for looking at the European experience in 
non-post-secondary university type settings where people can get 
the technical skills that are going to be required in the future. 
This does not require a university education.  The technical 
skills are desperately needed in our country today and will be 
needed in the future.  The government can certainly take a 
leadership role along with its provincial counterparts in 
creating institutions which will teach technical skills to our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill comes from the Senate.  Our party has spoken at length 
about the Senate and the desire of many members of the House, as 
well as many others, to have a democratic Senate.  Senators have 
recently been appointed by the Prime Minister.  If the hallmark 
of democracy is the ability of the people to vote for their 
representatives in this House, the Senate fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many good people in the Senate, but there are some who 
are not pulling their weight.  It would benefit all members of 
the Senate, the good ones in particular, if we were to have an 
elected Senate.  If we had an elected Senate people from all 
across the country, the best and the brightest, could become 
candidates.  The Canadian people could then decide. We would have 
a much more vigorous Senate.  It would truly be a House of sober 
second thought which could more effectively work with members of 
parliament to provide the best legislation to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to move an amendment, seconded by the 
hon. member for Surrey North, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor:

Chile, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, since the 
principle of the bill which was proposed by the unelected Senate 
fails to address the matter of the Prime Minister's refusal to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251, entitled “An act to amend the Criminal Code and the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about making our streets safer for all Canadians. 
This bill is about punishing serious offenders in such a way that 
their sentence accurately reflects the gravity of their offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about restoring public confidence in our criminal 
justice system.  There is a very popular saying that goes 
something like this “In order for justice to be done, it must be 
seen to be done”.  When a serial murderer or rapist is sentenced 
as though only one crime was committed, justice has not been seen 
to have been done and therefore it has not been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a system that is designed to protect the public falls into 
such disrepute and loses the respect and confidence of the 
public, action must be taken.  This bill is about showing the 
proper respect to victims and showing the proper respect to their 
families, whose suffering is so often underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the primary function of our criminal justice 
system is the prevention of crime and the protection of society. 
Unfortunately the system cannot protect everyone all the time. 
People do get hurt.  They are wronged.  They are victimized.  But 
once an offender is apprehended and convicted, sentencing is 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different views with respect to the purpose of a 
criminal sentence.  The prevailing opinion among justice and 
correctional officials is, in my view, appropriately focused on 
rehabilitating the offender and ensuring that he or she does not 
commit another offence upon their release from prison.  We cannot 
lock up everyone and throw away the key.  However, I believe the 
focus is so single-minded that it neglects other critical 
aspects.  Very seldom do we hear the word punish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of repeat murderers and rapists I would think most 
Canadians are not interested in rehabilitation.  They do not want 
to see these people on the streets again.  I agree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must be permitted to express their outrage at and 
condemnation of such brutal acts of violence.  Our current system 
of sentencing repeat offenders does not serve this need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrent sentencing provides one sentence for multiple crimes. 
What is left to deter criminals from committing further 
atrocities once they have committed their first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put the current situation bluntly, we offer volume discounts 
for rapists and murderers in Canada.  The current sentencing 
regime cheapens life.  Virtually no regard is given to the lives 
of the individual victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of what I am saying has been said before in this House, but 
it needs repeating.  The pain and suffering and the death of a 
second, third or eleventh victim is of no consequence to the 
court.  The minimum penalty always applies, even for the most 
prolific killers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of murderers and serial sex offenders are returned 
to neighbourhoods, often without publicity or warning.  Trials 
and convictions attract public attention and the public is 
usually lulled into the hoax that a life sentence means life. 
They have read it in the morning paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a life sentence is not a life sentence.  Ten years later 
they actually hear the truth.  The parole board has short-changed 
justice, written off the victims as if yesterday's news, just to 
free up a bunk for the next serial killer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Canadians are gradually catching on to this deception of 
life imprisonment.  Half of those convicted of second degree 
murder are sentenced to life and are released in less than 12 
years.  For first degree murder the median has historically been 
14 years.  Life only means life for the murder victim who 
is not there to protest his or her sentence and is never eligible 
for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own family knows too well about the loss of a loved one, 
knowing that the perpetrator of the crime, the fellow who took 
the life of a young officer in the prime of his life, who left a 
wife and three children, is eligible for parole within the next 
year.  Kitty and her children will never have Vernon back.  Life 
was life for Vernon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predator has dealt a life sentence to the victim's family. 
For them the comforting illusion of safety in our streets has 
been shattered.  They have to live with the stark truth that the 
only law that protects them is the law of averages, the chance 
that none of the predators roaming our communities will get 
around to them again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad truth is that judges already have the power to sentence 
consecutively but they simply are not doing it.  I say this is 
very sad because although judges are charged with applying the 
law in a fair and impartial manner they should also reflect 
community interests and values in doing so.  Judges claim to be 
doing this when dealing with issues of public nudity and 
obscenity.  Why when it comes to sentencing serial rapists and 
murderers do they not apply the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to parliamentarians and lawmakers to send a message 
that the courts are not.  It is that predators will be punished 
and punished severely.  There are no mitigating circumstances for 
a predator.  There is no need to rehabilitate a predator.  No 
predator is a safe addition to any neighbourhood, no matter what 
therapists say.  Predators belong in prison permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will argue that consecutive sentencing serves no purpose 
other than revenge.  If a predator knows that he is going to jail 
for the rest of his life, that he will never have a chance at 
parole, that he will die in prison, he may think twice.  If the 
prospect of consecutive sentence does not act as a deterrent in a 
specific case, it will serve to express more genuinely the 
revulsion, horror and outrage of the Canadian people.  It will 
also serve to show the family and friends of the victim that 
their government cares about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two reasons together or individually are sufficient to 
justify consecutive sentencing.  Our institutions are very 
responsive to lawyers, lobbyists, inmates and advocates. 
Criminals can rely on the system that orphaned the victims.  The 
murder victim has no representative, has no lobbyist, has no 
lawyer because the victim is dead.  The only argument we will 
hear about the victim's lost rights will come from the family and 
from people who recognize the injustice and the obscenity of the 
current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we offering a Wal-Mart two for one sale for criminals 
committing serial crimes?  Commit one, get another one free, a 
third one, a fourth one.  This has to stop.  Each life is 
valuable.  Sentencing must reflect the value of each individual 
life.  Currently the second victim means nothing.  Very simply, 
we are offering a bulk rate deal to murderers and rapists.  One 
25 year so-called life sentence is a penalty for premeditated 
murder no matter how many victims.  A mere seven years in prison 
is the maximum parole ineligibility for a rapist no matter how 
many victims.

am pleased to speak to the bill brought forward by the member 
for Mississauga East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To start with, I too would like to congratulate her on her bill 
since it opens up a part of the Criminal Code. It is important 
to review it, check a few things and eventually perhaps go along 
with the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say right away that I am in favor of the bill and its 
being scrutinized by the committee to see—I will go into it in 
more detail later—whether the bill is in keeping with the 
Criminal Code, the case law, the Canadian way and especially the 
Quebec way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind listeners that the bill provides for the 
imposition of consecutive sentences where a person commits 
sexual assault and another offence arising out of the same 
events or where a person is already serving another sentence at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the bill amends the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. This amendment provides that a person 
sentenced to life imprisonment for first degree or second degree 
murder is not eligible for parole until the person has served, 
in addition to the portion of sentence that the person must 
serve for murder, one third or a maximum of seven years of any 
other sentence imposed on the person in respect of an offence 
arising out of the same events. The mandatory portion of each 
life sentence imposed on a person who is convicted of a second 
murder must be served consecutively before the person is 
eligible for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all very technical, but those who are somewhat familiar 
with the Criminal Code will have understood what I said. I will 
try to shed some light on this during my allotted time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seriousness of the offence is one element I take into 
account when I look at a bill, especially a private member's 
bill. I try to see what exactly is the intent. This bill deals 
with the most heinous crimes. Therefore every member of the 
House should pay close attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If murder has as a consequence the taking of a life, sexual 
assault defiles the victim forever. One must look at this 
offence with a very careful eye and try to see the parallel that 
exists between various criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentences given for those crimes must reflect the seriousness of 
the offence, in light of the circumstances. 
Imposing a fair and adequate sentence is difficult in that we 
have to make sure it takes into account the characteristics of 
the offender, protects the interests of the community, which 
largely depend on the values it cherishes in a given period, and 
meets the victim's need for protection and reparation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentencing judge must make sure the sentence is 
proportionate to the seriousness of the crime and the degree of 
responsibility of the offender. Bill C-251 raises a fundamental 
question: Does Canadian criminal law deal adequately with 
murders and sexual offences, given the seriousness of these 
crimes? This is an extremely important question, and it deserves 
an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would like to tell the House that I am currently 
working on a bill similar to the one introduced by the hon. 
member, because I am also of the opinion that sexual offences 
are very serious. I hope she will return the favour and support 
my own bill. My goal is to allow judges to take the 
psychological damage inflicted on victims into consideration in 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think we could indeed improve the situation 
now prevailing as far as sentencing for sexual offences goes, 
because these offences are very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Criminal Code already allows judges to impose sentences 
to be served consecutively. This is in section 718.3(4) of the 
Criminal Code. This provision deals with sentences for offences 
in general and not sexual offences specifically. 
That is probably why the hon. member felt she had to introduce 
Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is probably right, and we should add this special provision 
relating to sexual offences so that judges not only may but are 
in fact required to impose sentences to be served consecutively. 
When I say we should see whether that provision is compatible 
with the Criminal Code or with Canada's case law and way of 
doing things, I mean that we should see whether this bill 
deprives judges of a degree of discretion they now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, I honestly and sincerely think “sexual 
assault” should be added, to send a signal to the public to show 
that we are taking sexual offences seriously, given that such 
offences are committee every day, are serious and all too often 
involve children, who are scared for life by such vicious crimes. 
In the end, it is society that pays for this at the 
psychological, medical and other levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause could include specific provisions on sexual assault, 
so as to force judges to impose consecutive rather than 
concurrent sentences as they sometimes do. However, this would 
take away some of the discretionary power of the courts.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns in this respect. I am in favour of the 
bill. I would like the committee to give very serious 
consideration to the bill as a whole to determine if the changes 
proposed by the hon. member would not in fact hinder the smooth 
operation of the judiciary and infringe on the discretionary 
powers currently enjoyed by judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at how sexual assault and sexual offences against 
children, women or minors are dealt with by the courts across 
Canada, in Quebec, Ontario and the other provinces, I think 
judges do not take this kind of offence seriously enough. 
There are cases where certain comments made by a judge lead us 
to question the sentence imposed by that judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this amendment, when there is more than one offence, the 
judge would have to impose consecutive sentences and we would 
then be sure that the accused would serve all his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that offences against the person 
must not be taken lightly. Our criminal justice system must 
consider the seriousness of offences such as sexual assault and 
murder. 
We also believe that the establishment of a rule with regard to 
consecutive sentences for sexual assault should be studied by 
the Standing Committee on Justice in light of our concern not to 
unduly limit the discretionary powers of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts are still in the best position to analyze individual 
cases, but I think that sometimes we have to force the hand of 
justice. We do it from time to time in certain pieces of 
legislation. As legislators, it is our duty to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois still wants to issue a word of caution—and 
it is not necessarily the member but rather the Reform Party 
that has a tendency to do that—to those who could be tempted to 
legislate on the basis of an exceptional case such as the tragic 
case of Clifford Olson. 
The justice system as a whole must not be judged on the basis of 
a few exceptional cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if we look at the Canadian justice system as a whole, it 
is a good system. It works well. Naturally, we can try to 
improve it and I think Bill C-251 is a step in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I will co-operate in committee to see to it that this 
bill is adopted or even to improve it if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to rise this afternoon to speak in 
full and complete support of Bill C-251 and to salute the efforts 
of our hon. colleague, the member for Mississauga East.  I 
believe the member has done Canadians a great service with the 
bill and I am pleased that it has been deemed a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague's sincerity and dedication when it comes to issues 
of justice, sentencing and working with victims of crime are 
recognized and appreciated, for perseverance and raising 
awareness of this issue and her devotion and commitment to 
helping victims of crime are qualities for every Canadian to 
admire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251, as members will know, provides for the imposition of 
a consecutive sentence where a person commits sexual assault and 
another offence arising out of the same event or where the person 
is already serving another sentence at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's summary clearly states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a person sentenced to life in prison for first degree murder or 
second degree murder is not eligible for parole until the person 
has served, in addition to the portion of sentence that the 
person must serve for murder, one-third or a maximum of seven 
years or any other sentence imposed—in respect of an offence 
arising out of the same events or that person is already serving. 
The mandatory portion of each life sentence imposed on a person 
who is convicted of a second murder must be served consecutively 
before the person is eligible for parole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see it, you do the time if you do the crime.  It is 
important to point out that both victims groups and the Canadian 
Police Association support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a citizen of Canada and as a member of parliament, I am fully 
aware of the tremendous service men and women in law enforcement 
provide us as they discharge their responsibility to protect and 
defend our lives, liberty and property.  We honour them and offer 
encouragement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law enforcement officers are the most unselfish and dedicated 
public servants in society.  We have all heard over and over 
again that each day as they go about discharging their 
responsibilities law enforcement officers place their lives on 
the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should not just pay lip service to this statement.  The 
citizens whom they protect should be conscious that many times 
law enforcement officers experience a tremendous amount of 
frustration.  They are required to work within a criminal justice 
system which at times is too inefficient and too technical to 
handle the various examples of crime in society. Regrettably on 
terrible occasions they make the supreme sacrifice for the people 
they serve.  They know that Bill C-251 would help keep hardened 
criminals off the streets.  In my capacity as an elected member 
of parliament I want to be able to give them the tools to work 
with and within. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each day we are reminded with vivid reality that we live in an 
imperfect world, one beset with many problems such as poverty, 
injustice, disease, war and most assuredly crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some who are skeptical would say that this is nothing new, that 
these problems are part of the human condition and will be with 
us as long as men and women remain on earth.  They will get 
caught up in the magnitude of the world's dilemmas and with 
fatalistic acquiescence.  They will sit and do nothing, 
justifying this inactivity with the platitude “I am just one 
person.  I can't change the world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga East is doing her part, and I may add 
doing it well.  Without individual action by citizens the 
problems may continue to worsen as more people become victims of 
crime.  There is no greater satisfaction than that which comes 
from the feeling that one has contributed something good to 
society, that one has given in the support of others.  The 
profession that gives an opportunity to achieve this is law 
enforcement work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 will give Canadians and victims of crime perhaps some 
additional peace of mind than otherwise would occur.  It will 
correct a shameful volume discounts to rapists and murderers 
through concurrent sentencing.  The bill is about reasonable and 
required change that every major victims group is demanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 has three important objectives:  to reduce 
inhumanities to families of victims, to restore some truth in 
sentencing and to stop gambling lives away on the chance that a 
multiple murderer or serial murderer will not attack again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is punishment?  Punishment is a detriment imposed for 
committing a crime.  The four widely accepted purposes of 
punishment are deterrence, retribution, incapacitation and 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last 20 years many American states have shifted away 
from indeterminate sentencing.  The Canadian Sentencing 
Commission issued a 592-page report in 1987 that found abundant 
evidence of unwarranted disparities in sentences as judges took 
different approaches to similar cases.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is important due to the shift away from indeterminate 
sentencing.  It seems to reflect a reduction in confidence in 
rehabilitation as a purpose of punishment and a reduction in 
confidence of parole boards in deciding when an offender should 
be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When sentencing an offender for multiple offences in Canada the 
primary focus is on the global sentence that results from the 
judge's discretion.  Some offences, most notably prison escapes 
and breach of conditional sentence, require mandatory consecutive 
sentences under subsection 718.3(5) of the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  However throughout the focus remains on the global 
sentence to be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 would change that for the better.  As my colleague 
from Mississauga East stated during debate on June 4, 1996: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrent sentencing cheapens life.  The lives of individual 
victims are erased from the sentencing equation. The suffering, 
the pain and the death of the second, third or eleventh victim is 
of no consequence to the courts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could apply that kind of sentencing if we had a 
parking ticket.  If we got one or ten, would the court see fit to 
only charge us for one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, families must continue to attend parole hearings, 
reliving and rehashing pain, anguish and grief over the loss of a 
loved one.  Let us support victims of crime.  Let us support our 
law enforcement officers.  We as members of parliament have an 
important role to play with this unique privilege we have been 
bestowed by our electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing and improving legislation is a vital part of that role, 
and each of us take it very seriously.  That is why private 
members' hour is crucial to our effectiveness as members of the 
House.  Individual members have the opportunity, free from party 
constraints, to express their views and concerns on behalf of 
their constituents, their conscience and their genuine interest 
in trying to make some positive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with that spirit that I urge all hon. members to support 
Bill C-251 and the exceptional work on this issue by our 
colleague from Mississauga East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak to Bill C-251, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire the hon. member for Mississauga East for her tenacity 
toward this legislation.  This is the third time she has 
attempted to bring this legislation to fruition.  She has 
indicated that she has the support of 166 members of the House, 
including support from all parties.  That would appear to be 
sufficient to reach a majority, but I will not be holding my 
breath.  We have seen how government members soon forsake 
conscience and common sense once they receive the marching orders 
from the front benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals campaigned on a promise to give 
backbenchers more weight in the government by providing MPs with 
a greater role in drafting legislation.  More free votes were to 
be allowed.  Now, almost five years later, we still do not have 
successful private members' legislation in the area of criminal 
justice.  The House can appreciate my scepticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may also appreciate my concern over the 
inconsistencies of the hon. member for Mississauga East and many 
of her colleagues on that side of the House.  In Bill C-41 in 
1995, when they voted in favour of conditional sentencing, one 
must assume they did what the former minister of justice 
instructed them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week I note another sexual offender received 
absolutely no jail time for sexual assault and forcible 
confinement.  This example is but just one of the most recent. 
There have been many other cases where sexual offenders have 
received the benefit of the Liberal Bill C-41 get out of jail 
free legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the proposer of the bill before us seeks 
increased sentencing for sexual offenders, but on the other hand 
she appears to say that it is okay for sexual offenders to serve 
their time at home.  No wonder Canadians have lost faith in their 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this legislation was last debated in this place the then 
parliamentary secretary to solicitor general clearly put the 
writing on the wall for government members.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, may take away 
flexibility and discretionary power from our courts and add to 
the already heavy burden of correctional bodies, when it comes to 
administering sentences.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He appears concerned about the administrative cost of keeping 
violent offenders in prison.  We could only wish the Minister of 
Finance would express the same concern over the cost of 
administering the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later the then parliamentary secretary stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments, however, invoke punitive measures that 
far exceed the restrictions now set out in the Criminal Code and 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act as well as threaten 
freedoms defended by the Charter, as I mentioned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the word freedoms has no place in any discussion of 
sanctions for criminal activity. Here again we have an example of 
the Liberals' paralyzing fear of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on in his speech he added: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the proposals now before us do not at this time reflect the 
best interests of the Canadian public. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a typical Liberal response that government knows best 
and the Canadian public is too stupid to decide for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary was speaking for the front bench of 
the government.  In this place there is little in the way of free 
votes for the government side.  There is little likelihood of a 
substantive role in drafting necessary legislation by any 
backbencher, even those on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary once again used the charter as a 
reason for failing to respect the desires and needs of Canadians. 
It was noteworthy that he failed to explain just how the charter 
protects our most heinous criminals from receiving consecutive 
sentences.  It was also noteworthy when he stated that these 
proposals did not reflect the best interests of the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 proposes to ensure that those offenders who commit 
sexual assault and another offence receive consecutive sentences. 
It ensures that murderers are not eligible for parole until they 
have served the sentence for the murder plus a stated minimum for 
any other sentence imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked about the best interests of 
Canadians.  I think he may only be thinking of the best interests 
of our criminals.  He is certainly not thinking about the victims 
of those crimes and he is not thinking about the safety of our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past week another university study into sexual 
violence severely criticized our criminal justice system for not 
seriously dealing with this issue.  It is more concerned with the 
interests of criminals than it is with the needs of victims or 
public safety.  The study found that only 13% of child molesters 
and 30% of sexual assaults of adults result in sentences of more 
than two years.  This was compared to robbers who in 53% of cases 
receive more than two years.  Children and women are most often 
the victims of sexual offences but the government is doing little 
to address this anomaly.  Perhaps this private member's bill will 
help to correct that failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consecutive sentencing would provide incentive for our justice 
system to pursue a complete record of our offenders.  Too often 
crown prosecutors proceed only with one or two charges against 
the accused.  There is usually only one cumulative sentence so 
there is nothing to be gained from proceeding with multiple 
offences, but this results in a major travesty and injustice at 
the time of parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parole is based strictly on convictions.  For example, Larry 
Takahashi was granted day passes even though he had admitted to 
sexually assaulting up to 30 women and police believed he was 
responsible for up to 100 sexual assaults.  As far as the parole 
system was concerned he was responsible for 11 sexual assaults on 
seven women.  When it came time to review his record for day 
parole purposes, only the convictions were considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consecutive sentencing would bring about truth in sentencing. 
Multiple offenders would be distinguished from the one-time 
offender.  There would be more honesty in sentencing.  Presently 
our judges impose, for example, a one year sentence for a sexual 
assault.  The victims and the public are deceived into believing 
the offender actually serves one year in custody, but as we all 
know parole takes place for every offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders such as in this example often get out in a few days or 
a few months.  The judges say they do their job by applying an 
appropriate sentence for the crime, but then the parole system 
gets involved and officials have the responsibility to get the 
prisoner out of incarceration at the earliest legislated 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parole system states that they are just doing their job of 
following the rules toward release, but there is no truth in 
sentencing.  Few if any actually serve the full court imposed 
sentence of incarceration.  Even our most heinous murderers get 
reviews of their life sentences at 15 years pursuant to section 
745.  A notorious child killer whose name I will not say in this 
place murdered 11 children but was sentenced as though he had 
killed but one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, a section 745 hearing is in progress in Vancouver 
for a man who killed three bar patrons and then drove to an RCMP 
detachment where he murdered the constable behind the counter. 
He too was sentenced as though he had taken but one life.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I might add, in that case the killer allegedly shot another 
constable in the police detachment but was never prosecuted for 
that because there was no reason for it as there would be no 
difference in the sentence.  The message to the criminal: kill as 
often as you wish, only the first one counts, the rest are 
freebies. The message to the victims:  only the first life is 
important, the rest are inconsequential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the specifics of Bill C-251, I wonder why the hon. member 
restricted her bill to section 271, the sexual assault offence. 
If her bill is successful I can only wonder how things will work 
when we have an offender who commits a sexual assault with a 
weapon pursuant to section 272 plus other offences.  Will the 
crown proceed with the lesser offence of mere sexual assault with 
the hope that the sentence will be added to those for the other 
crimes or will the crown proceed with section 272 and hope that 
its sentence alone will meet society's objective? It appears as 
though our crowns may become professional gamblers in our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder why the hon. member proposing this bill restricts 
it to sexual assault and murder.  She does not include 
manslaughter, instances of use of a firearm in the commission of 
an offence and she does not include aggravated assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, I will support this member's initiative but I 
seriously question whether her own party members will have the 
fortitude to support their conscience rather than meekly 
following the orders from the front bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill as a start.  It is certainly a long way from 
providing sufficient protection within our communities.  It is a 
long way from being totally honest with our citizens.  It is also 
a long way from attending to the interests of victims.  However, 
I urge all members of the House to support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today in the House in support of this 
worthwhile bill, a bill the member for Mississauga East has been

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this member has tried on now three occasions to see that 
this legislation gets passed or at least recognized and 
thoroughly treated by parliament.  It is an 
honour to know this member of parliament who subscribes to the 
view that if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with that that I am here today to once again speak to an 
issue that I believe seems to have a consensus developing in the 
House, at least making sure that this issue gets thoroughly 
debated not only in the House but in the justice committee .

partisan issue.  We can play the usual jousting between both 
sides of the House.  We all have different philosophies and we 
certainly have different dynamics within our constituencies. 
However, one thing we can agree on is the value of a human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses very squarely, whether it be in the area of 
criminal justice or social understanding of humankind, the need 
to respect and to not denigrate the value of every human being.

criminal offences of a sexual nature. I totally agree with him

can proud of and which we will be able to review together in 
order to come up with a better criminal justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer the men and women who represent our front lines 
were assembled in at least three locations across the 
country to commemorate the passing of one of their own.  In my 
riding of Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge we mourned the tragic loss of 
Det. William Hancox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether we have had an opportunity to recognize 
that but I would like to take the time now to make sure the House 
of Commons hears his name and the great effort he made on behalf 
of keeping this nation a secure nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are people in the gallery today representing our 
finest in this country.  They are not here to simply hear about 
the outcome of this bill but to understand that there is a 
relationship between the need for public safety, the security of 
the person and the whole definition of a social contract on which 
this whole issue seems to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for those reasons that I applaud the attempts of my hon. 
colleague from Mississauga East.  I applaud the efforts of so 
many of the victims rights groups in the country who have been 
crying out for a voice and who ask above all that we not play 
this simple game of politics, of divide and conquer, or to hide 
behind certain laws, customs or traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common sense dictates that this House today consider the impact 
it has on the security of the individual and the value of life. 
The status quo is clearly not acceptable and it is in that regard 
that the wisdom of the subcommittee on private members' business 
chose wisely for the first time to make this bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is certainly deserving of an opportunity to be treated 
by the justice committee.  I have some difficulty with the 
interpretation of where this could go and I would probably want 
to ask for a clarification of a statement that was made by the 
Chair a little earlier, that this bill be referred to the finance 
committee.  I seek unanimous consent of the House, seconded by 
the member for Huron—Bruce, to amend the direction of this bill 
from the finance committee to the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  For the information 
of the member, the bill is going to the justice committee, not to 
the finance committee, as the member thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Thank you for that clarification.  I 
know this bill is very important and we want to make sure there 
is absolutely no equivocation and that this bill does proceed in 
the direction it so clearly deserves to go in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this bill is about vengeance.  I do not think 
this bill is about retribution.  I do not believe this bill was 
born out of some idea of vindictiveness.  I believe rather that 
this bill has everything to do with the value we in this House 
and we as Canadians place on human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself, as I suggested earlier, comes from an evolution 
of a number of thoughts that have been brought forth.  It is easy 
to talk about the Clifford Olsons of this world, the Paul 
Bernardos, the Denis Lorties, but I think we need to look at 
something a little more substantial about the role of the victim 
in terms of the system that currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, the status quo is not acceptable.  My 
hon. colleague from Whitby—Ajax indicated that second degree 
murderers sentenced to life are released after less than 12 
years.  The median for first degree murderers is only 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe anybody in their right state of mind would 
accept that a human life is only worth such a trivial time behind 
bars. 
It is for this reason that I believe there is an opportunity for 
us as members of parliament to recognize the great gulf that 
exists between common sense, the view of the public, the view of 
so many legalists who have pronounced themselves on this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of ensuring that we have a sentencing system that 
reflects the seriousness of the crimes that are committed, it 
seems only reasonable that if you commit one murder, one rape, 
one assault you should serve the time for each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of simply the trite statement if you can't 
do the time, don't do the crime.  It is rather a question of 
ensuring that an offence against an innocent human being is 
treated adequately and appropriately.  In that context there is 
no need to talk about tying the hands of judges. I saw in 
Burnaby, B.C. last year with the hon. member and so many other 
members in the House the spectacle as a result of 745 of Clifford 
Olson being allowed to manipulate the system.  The judge did not 
have in his mind the desire to make sure this individual would 
never see the light of day and that he would spend his time 
behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about revisiting capital punishment.  It is rather 
an important step ahead in recognizing and in modernizing our 
justice system to reflect accurately the angst of victims, the 
sensibility of their families and the reasonability of all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be here today. As I said the last time I 
spoke to Bill C-274, moved by the member for Mississauga East, 
this issue will brought back to the House as long as it is not 
willing to acquiesce to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure members it is a good bill.  It deserves our support. 
Let us support the bill.  Let us get the bill to committee and 
let us protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Madam Speaker, on a point of order, may 
I just correct the last speaker. He referred to Burnaby.  I would 
like to correct that to Surrey.  Surrey is my town and I cannot 
let that go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today on Bill C-251, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important piece of legislation and I salute 
the hon. member for Mississauga East for bringing forward the 
bill despite the opposition from her own government.  We need more 
initiative and free thinking from both Liberals and Reform instead 
of their respective leadership constantly cracking the whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope the hon. member for Mississauga East will not face 
the same wrath from the Liberal leadership as the hon. members 
for North Vancouver and Nanaimo—Alberni had to face in September 
at Banff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-251 this is very timely when one looks at 
how the Liberal government has responded to the various justice 
issues this week in the House.  Yesterday we witnessed the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice defend the 
faint hope clause by proclaiming I am proud to be a bleeding 
heart Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday we witnessed Liberal after Liberal stand up to defend 
Bill C-68, the false hope law, by criticizing law abiding gun 
owners as being part of some vast right wing conspiracy.  I am 
nonetheless encouraged to see a member from the Liberal benches 
stand up for what she believes in with this bill.  I know she has 
been working very hard over the past number of years to bring 
this matter forward in the form of a votable motion.  She has 
stated in the past that Bill C-251 is based on three simple 
principles: inhumanity and how to avoid it, improving humanity 
toward victims, and certainly to protect us against those who 
offend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Progressive Conservative caucus and I share 
the deep concern of the hon. member for how difficult it is for 
victims of crime to face the justice system and how far too easy 
it is for them to lose faith. 
Our party's justice and solicitor general critic, the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, has proposed a number of 
solid initiatives to ensure that our laws better reflect the 
needs of victims and their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians now have an opportunity to support this 
important piece of legislation to help improve our justice 
system, to help restore the confidence of Canadians in the system 
and more important, to improve the protection of society from 
violent offenders.  These are very positive suggestions the hon. 
member has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 provides for truth in sentencing, something we must 
see.  It is a very brief, straightforward and easy to understand 
amendment to the Criminal Code.  This is something which all 
members of this House should encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the issue of sexual assault and section 271 of 
the Criminal Code, there is a strong need for this amendment. 
There is a need that sentences which are imposed by judges be 
served consecutively so that the punishment reflects the gravity 
of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time there is the ability for these types of 
sentences to be served concurrently.  That is, if there is more 
than one offence or the offence of a sexual assault occurs at the 
same time as other offences such as break and enter, theft or 
simple assault, the sentences are served at the same time. In 
simple terms this would be similar to having loans from three 
different institutions and only having to pay back one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of sentencing are set out in the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  Section 718 of the code sets out what legislators in the 
past have tried to do and tried to reflect in the sentencing 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 718.1 states “A sentence must be proportionate to the 
gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the 
offender”. It goes further in setting out what these principles 
are and it speaks of the need for reformation and rehabilitation 
to be balanced against the more important principle, the 
protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code further states “Where consecutive sentences 
are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or 
harsh”. Try explaining that to a victim of a violent crime.  Try 
explaining that to those who have lost their loved ones or had 
their loved ones attacked, beaten or killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must revisit the principles of sentencing.  The suggestion by 
the hon. member does just that in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 would expand the ability of judges to impose a fair 
sentence.  No one should be getting a free ride in our justice 
system.  Sadly this is precisely what happens far too often. We 
permit sexual offenders and other offenders who commit two, three 
or more crimes to serve one sentence at one time.  It is 
absolutely absurd. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name Clifford Olson is heard much too often in this House 
and the mere mention of this name makes me shiver. This 
individual killed 11 children and received only one life 
sentence. He should be serving 11 life sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manipulative and self-serving testimony he gave at his 
section 745 hearing was simply outrageous and an embarrassment 
to all of Canada, and particularly to our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No sentence could be harsh enough considering the horrible 
crimes committed by that scum. 
The details of some of them would be enough to turn anybody into 
an alarmist and a reactionary. However, we must look at 
sentencing carefully. Common sense must always prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of individuals like Olson and Bernardo, it is 
absolutely ridiculous to pretend that a sentence ranging from 15 
years to life is an acceptable punishment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why my colleague the justice critic for the PC party 
continues to fight for the repeal of section 745, the faint hope 
clause.  That is why we support the efforts of other members of 
this House, such as the member from British Columbia yesterday, 
to repeal the faint hope clause.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members from the member for Mississauga East to 
the members from the Bloc and the NDP to join with us in our 
fight to get rid of this ill-advised section of the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles that underscore this bill are completely useless 
as long as we continue to have section 745 in the Criminal Code. 
It is my belief that each of the innocent lives that were taken 
at least deserve the validation of having a consecutive sentence 
to represent their lives.  A person who commits multiple crimes 
should be given an appropriate sentence to reflect each and every 
one of those offences, if committed at a different time with 
different circumstances. This principle reflects the views of 
most of my constituents and most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 addresses this principle in a common sense manner. 
Therefore I support the member for Mississauga East and I support 
her bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely proud to support it. I recognize the importance 
of consistent sentencing. I personally think that the justice 
system should not weaken the ability of our society to protect 
itself and to show its abhorrence of violent crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second clause of Bill C-251 amends section 120 of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  It requires offenders 
sentenced for first and second degree murder to serve their full 
parole ineligibility period on the sentence plus one-third of a 
maximum of seven years, whichever is less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the first clause of Bill C-251, it is an innovative way 
to ensure that there is some truth in sentencing.  There are 
times and factual circumstances when the judge should impose a 
sentence that would really reflect what the crime represents.  If 
a judge says 25 years, it should be 25 years.  That should be the 
end of it.  That would give the offender and society faith in 
their justice system.  Cumulative sentences play a very important 
role when it comes to parole eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 would be the best way to address cases of double 
murders.  The victim's family of the second murder are forced to 
face the fact that their victim is not being addressed by the 
justice system when the sentence has to be served concurrently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, I support this 
bill and hope that all members support the efforts of the member 
for Mississauga East.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, given what little time is left, 
it will be extremely hard for me to get into the details of the 
presentation I have prepared. However, I still want to speak 
briefly of Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before addressing the issue, I want to mention all the respect I 
have for the work my hon. colleague has done on this bill. She 
gave a lot of thought to this issue and the results of her work 
deserve a lot of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, for both my colleague and I, the safety of the people 
is always foremost in our minds. Canadians feel safe at home and 
that is the most important factor to take into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly point out some statistics the 
International Centre for the Prevention of Crime included in its 
latest report. It said that, asked to choose among several 
factors those that best described what it is to be Canadian, 88% 
of respondents ranked the feeling of belonging to a safe society 
among the nine most significant factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this bill for reasons I had hoped to have more 
time to explain in detail, but which I will get into briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I think there is in Canada a myth about what is 
called a life sentence.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean?  In the case of first degree murder or repeat 
second degree murder, the mandatory sentence is life without 
parole eligibility for 25 years.  What does it mean?  It means 
that the offender will be subject to the control and supervision 
of correctional authorities for the rest of his life.  It means 
that a multiple murderer is ineligible for judicial review for 
the reduction of parole ineligibility.  It means that that 
eligibility for parole after 25 years does not mean automatic 
release from a penitentiary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am on my feet to go back after the health minister in 
regard to a question I put to him in June prior to the House 
recessing for the summer regarding the hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of Canadians are very upset by the government's 
determination that it would only compensate those victims from 
1986 to 1990.  We feel that is fundamentally wrong.  We feel that 
it is wrong for a number of reasons but primarily the victims we 
are talking about prior to 1986 and certainly some even after 
1990 are all innocent victims of a tainted blood scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to Justice Krever's recommendation that all victims 
should be compensated because there was wrongdoing on many 
levels.  I just want to give a couple of examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that we actually brought blood into this country that 
came out of the U.S. prison system.  Think about it.  Sick 
Canadians were given blood given by U.S. prisoners. I think we 
know what goes on in prisons.  We will not go into detail.  Some 
Canadians contracted hepatitis C because of that very error and 
all the other difficulties surrounding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government holds fast on its position that we will not 
compensate those innocent victims outside of the convenient 
timeframe of 1986 to 1990.  The only reason the minister can give 
is because those years 1986 to 1990 are the years that we most 
likely could not defend ourselves if it did go to the courts.  In 
other words it would be very difficult for the government to 
defend its position in those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A victim who contracted hepatitis C on December 31, 1985 would 
not be compensated but a victim who contracted hepatitis C a day 
later on January 1, 1986 would be compensated. This is absolutely 
bizarre and it is absolutely wrong.  We are going to continue to 
fight on this side of the House along with a lot of other 
Canadians to make sure there is fairness in this compensation 
package.  All victims should be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often blame the health minister.  I am going to be fairly 
generous to him and say he has most likely tried as hard as he 
could in cabinet to get compensation for those victims.  At the 
end of the day it falls at the doorstep of the government, the 
leader of the government, the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister conveniently falls into the role of the 
little humble man from Shawinigan. 
Water just runs off his back.  Talk about being coated in Teflon. 
This Prime Minister is absolutely and totally coated with Teflon 
from top to bottom.

testing of plasma donors.

and across the country feels very badly when anyone who they know 
gets an illness through no fault of their own, whether that 
illness is cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis or diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important we all understand that when people across the 
country get sick, the values embodied in the Canada Health Act 
are that we offer those people care and access to treatment, 
which hopefully will give them a good health outcome.  That is 
what the Canada Health Act is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to address the member's question on June 10 with regard 
to the hepatitis C testing of plasma donors between the period of 
1990 to 1993.  I wanted to point out to him that a critical 
distinction needs to be made at the outset of this issue and 
discussion.  That is the distinction between the testing of blood 
donors who are donating blood which will be transferred directly 
into persons needing a blood transfusion as contrasted with the 
testing of donors of plasma which is then sent to a manufacturing 
operation to be fractionated into plasma derivatives such as 
coagulation factors, immune globulins and albumin.

donors of fresh blood for transfusion—

Parliament you had only recently been released from 27 years in 
prison.  Apartheid was still the law of South Africa and your 
country was an outcast from the community of nations.  Fresh from 
prison, you were in the midst of a heroic and still uncertain 
struggle to dismantle the apartheid state and end a shameful 
legacy of racial exclusion, minority domination and 
institutionalized injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today all that is changed.  A new non-racial constitution with 
an entrenched bill of rights is in place.  Public policy is 
vigorously debated in 11 official languages, not only in the 
national parliament in Cape Town, but in the nine provincial 
capitals as well.  A united and democratic South Africa has 
rejoined the family of nations and under your leadership is 
playing a respected and vital role on the international stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada are proud to have been associated with the 
anti-apartheid struggle and to have assisted in your democratic 
transition.  The fight against apartheid was a cause which 
crossed political lines and moved all my predecessors, from the 
stand of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker at the Commonwealth 
Conference in 1961, which resulted in South Africa's withdrawal 
from that body, through the governments of Prime Ministers 
Pearson, Trudeau and my predecessor Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this our governments were reflecting the views of the people 
of Canada.  Canadians of all walks supported the anti-apartheid 
movement individually and through their churches, their trades 
unions, professional associations and non-governmental 
organizations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your return to Canada after eight eventful years gives the 
people of Canada, who shared your vision of a free, non-racial 
and democratic society, the opportunity to celebrate the 
profound and irreversible changes that have taken place in your 
country.  And, just as important, it is an opportunity to pay 
tribute to your own decisive role in engineering a remarkable, 
peaceful and harmonious transformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Canadians, I want to express our admiration for 
the profound and peaceful reshaping of your country, and for the 
spirit of tolerance and reconciliation which has guided that 
transformation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In setting South Africa free you have also unleashed your 
country's immense potential to be a force for peace and stability 
on the world stage.  In the few short years since you have become 
President, South Africa has resumed its rightful place at the UN, 
the OAU and the World Trade Organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become a vital partner in fashioning a safer and more 
secure world.  And it is fitting, very fitting, that the 
Commonwealth, which closed its doors to the old South Africa, 
will hold its next leaders' meeting in the new South Africa under 
your chairmanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same spirit in which we supported your historic struggle, 
today our two countries are working together to bring greater 
peace and justice to the world on establishing an international 
criminal court, on eliminating child labour, on extending the 
non-proliferation treaty and of course as partners from the very 
beginning in the Ottawa process and the international ban on land 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as Canadians worked to help end the apartheid system, we 
are also working to help build the new South Africa.  We are 
providing assistance in areas such as improving the accessibility 
and quality of education, in helping to rebuild the justice 
system, in linking our SchoolNet with young South Africans using 
information technology to its fullest potential and in increasing 
the trade and commercial links between our countries which are so 
important to South Africa's economic development.  The fact that 
you are accompanied by an impressive commercial delegation and 
the key business meetings you are holding here in Canada are 
proof of the importance of that area. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, the fact is that we in Canada care about South 
Africa.  Not just because of our attachment to the struggles of 
the past, but because of our hopes for the future—the future of 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that, at the end of a century of conflict and 
genocide, the only hope for the world is to learn to live 
together in understanding and tolerance.  In South Africa, you 
are working to build such a society.  You are rejecting 
separation based on race or language or religion.  You are 
tearing down old walls of hate.  And building new bridges of 
understanding.  A new society for a new millennium. 
A multilingual society.  A multi-ethnic society.  A society that 
finds its strength in its diversity.  And its soul and 
inspiration in a common sense of humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, in our own modest way, we have tried to do the same. 
But we have not had the burden of history that has weighed so 
heavily on your country for so much of this century.  While our 
goals and values are the same, our experiences have not been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, after decades of hate and oppression, you can succeed in 
building a new society, our hopes for this battered world as it 
enters a new millennium can be just a little bit brighter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, Mr. President, this is the inspiration of South 
Africa to the world today.  Just as important, it is the 
inspiration that you provided to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that there are too few heroes in the world 
today.  That may be.  But today we are in the presence of a real 
hero.  Few people in our time, or from any century, have so 
symbolized the spirit of freedom that lives within every human 
being as you have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your struggle was an inspiration to freedom-loving men and women 
everywhere.  But, in a sense, the courage, optimism and 
generosity of spirit you have shown since your struggle have been 
even more of an inspiration.  Suffering does not only lead to 
bitterness and disillusion, it can lead to wisdom and compassion, 
and to a better world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to present to 
you the leader of his nation, the statesman of his continent and 
a hero for the world, President Nelson Mandela. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Mandela (President of the Republic of South Africa):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, Your 
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I had the honour to 
address the Congress of the United States of America.  Because of 
the warmth of the reception I received, I felt I should share a 
secret with members of the Congress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that one of my fondest dreams was to become the 
heavyweight boxing champion of the world.  As a result of the 
warm reception I received, I said that I was in a position to 
challenge the reigning world champion, Evander Holyfield.  I am 
compelled today to repeat that statement because the warmth I 
have received here is no less than that I received yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that it is a rare privilege for anyone from another 
country to be invited to address this hallowed institution of 
Canadian democracy which includes in its roll of honour leaders 
of world renown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That I should be granted that distinction twice in eight years 
is something that can only be understood as a tribute to the 
people of South Africa by the Canadian people, to whom we owe so 
much, and an expression of the partnership between us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stood before you in 1990, it was as a freedom fighter 
still denied citizenship in my own country, seeking your support 
to ensure an irreversible transition to democracy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I stand before you as the elected representative of the 
South African people to thank you once again for helping us end 
our oppression, for assisting us through our transition and now 
for your partnership in the building of a better life for all 
South Africans.  We will forever be indebted to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we still have a long way to go before we realize our 
vision of a better life for all, there has been a great 
transformation in South Africa since 1990 and solid foundations 
have been laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience of all peoples has taught that our democracy 
would remain secure and stable only if we could unite those who 
were once locked in conflict and if our new freedoms brought 
material improvement in the lives of our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day, 24 September, South Africa marks one of our most 
important national days.  Heritage Day is dedicated to the 
celebration of the rich diversity of our people.  As I speak, 
representatives of all the language, cultural and linguistic 
communities are gathered at a conference discussing how to give 
institutional form to the commitment in our constitution to the 
promotion and respect of the rights of communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that the memory of historical injustice and violations 
of human rights should not remain as a continuing obstacle to 
national unity, our Truth and Reconciliation Commission has 
helped us confront our terrible past.  Painful and imperfect as 
the process has been, it has taken us further than anyone 
expected toward a common understanding of our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we lay stress on uniting the different sections of our 
society, it is because unity and the partnership of all the 
structures of our society are critical to the reconstruction and 
development of our society in order to eradicate apartheid's 
legacy of poverty and inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though there are differences among us, as is natural in any 
democratic society, in particular one in transition from a past 
such as ours, they play themselves out within an allegiance to 
our new democracy and within a broad support for the government's 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have therefore been able to make a good start in bringing 
basic amenities to millions of people for the first time in their 
lives: electricity, clean water, health care facilities, housing 
and schooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economic policies have turned years of stagnation into 
sustained growth since 1994, along with improved productivity and 
exports as we gear our economy for success in a competitive 
global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do face major challenges and problems.  What is important is 
that we are confronting them and we are confident that we will 
overcome them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, though our policies are creating new jobs, the 
number falls short of what we need.  In response government, 
labour and business are therefore joining forces in preparation 
for a presidential jobs summit next month in order to work out 
together a strategy for sustained job creation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we democratize our society, setting up new institutions or 
transforming old ones, we are also dealing with corruption.  The 
institutions of the new democratic order are dealing with the 
corruption in our society.  Among other things, we have appointed 
a powerful commission headed by a judge to expose and root out 
corruption in the public service and recover the proceeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is still at an unacceptably high level but we have turned 
the tide through the adoption of a comprehensive national 
strategy that includes the reshaping of a police force whose 
former function was merely the protection of minority interests 
and the suppression of resistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And though we have made mistakes in government due to lack of 
experience, it is also true that we have achieved much more for 
our people than was ever done under the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all too aware of the great deal that remains to be done. 
What is important is that we are united as a nation as never 
before and determined to succeed, and that we have friends like 
Canada who are working with us as partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is an important presence in much of what we have achieved 
and in what we are building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our democratic elections, our relationship with Canada has 
entered a new and vibrant phase, one that is growing from 
strength to strength.  In drawing up our new democratic 
constitution we drew deeply on Canadian experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government of 
Canada for the technical assistance provided through the Canadian 
International Development Agency and the International 
Development Research Centre.  Critical areas affecting 
transformation have benefited, including science and technology, 
places of learning, our labour laws and our courts.  We look 
forward to the continuation of this assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the critical measures of the growing relationship between 
our countries is the threefold increase since 1994 in trade to a 
level close to 1 billion Canadian dollars per year.  We expect 
this expansion to continue.  We have brought on this trip people 
from the private sector and government concerned with the 
economy.  We look forward to a reciprocal Canadian team in South 
Africa soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also with me are government representatives and officials 
concerned with safety and security who have come to seek support 
for the implementation of our crime prevention strategy, as well 
as others concerned with health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all these ways we are benefiting from not only financial 
assistance and from your expertise and experience, but as well as 
the affinities and shared aspirations which join us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on my way here today I had the honour of unveiling, 
at your human rights monument, a plaque dedicated to John 
Humphrey, author of the first draft of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights.  I would like, if I may, to pay tribute to his 
contribution to the central philosophy of your country and his 
dedication to the cause of human rights worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area in which your country and mine march hand in 
hand in practical action to make a living reality of the rights 
to which we subscribe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard we think of Canada's hard work together with 
other countries to bring to fruition the anti-land mine 
convention.  We were very proud in December last year to be the 
third country, after Canada and Norway, to sign that convention 
here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and South Africa also together played a part in the 
recent establishment of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>South Africa is increasingly being called upon to play a role in 
peacekeeping, in southern Africa and in Africa as a whole.  Our 
approach is that we will play whatever part we can within our 
limited means and within a multilateral framework, whether it be 
the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Non-Aligned Movement, 
the Organization of African Unity, and the Southern African 
Development Community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essential to our vision of a new and more humane international 
order is the belief that inevitable as differences may be, they 
need not and should not be resolved by the force of arms.  We 
look to peaceful resolution of differences because this is the 
only way in which humanity can prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this context that South Africa has in recent days found 
itself called upon to contribute its forces to a joint regional 
security initiative aimed at assisting, at its own request, the 
democratically elected government of a neighbour by securing a 
measure of peace and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too we look to Canada as a partner.  We recognize Lester 
Pearson as the founder of modern peacekeeping because of his 
innovative intervention in the Suez crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the same token, we salute Canada's distinguished service over 
many years in Cyprus, Bosnia, Somalia and more recently in the 
disarmament process in Northern Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, Canada's internationalist record gives us 
confidence to know that you understand and share our vision of an 
African Renaissance.  If history has decreed that our continent 
at the end of the 20th century should be marginalized in world 
affairs, we know that our destiny lies in our own hands. 
Yet we also know that we cannot bring about our Renaissance 
solely by our own efforts, since the problems we face are rooted 
in conditions beyond the power of any one nation to determine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the turmoil in far off economies that we have had to 
weather has, we know, affected Canada too.  In the interdependent 
world in which we now live, rich and poor, strong and weak are 
bound in a common destiny that decrees that none shall enjoy 
lasting prosperity and stability unless others do too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These harsh lessons of our global economy were the focus of 
attention at the summit at the Non-Aligned Movement held in 
Durban in our country earlier this month.  They have forced 
themselves upon the attention of the world international 
community.  A debate about the global trade and financial system 
that has been too long in the making has now been joined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge you to join with us in seeking to redirect the system 
and its institutions so as to cater for the needs of development 
and the interests of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing we would be affirming a fundamental principle of all 
human society, namely that the existence and the well-being of 
each of us is dependent on that of our fellows.  In a globalized 
world, that is as true of nations as it is of individual men and 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, this occasion marks something 
of a farewell.  I am deeply grateful that it has been possible, 
before my retirement from public life, to make this second visit 
to a people that has made our aspirations their own.  You 
insisted that the rights which the world declares to be universal 
should also be the rights of all South Africans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But though it is a personal farewell and in some sense an 
ending, I do know that it is also a beginning, marking the start 
of a new and more profound relationship between our peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, hon. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I thank 
you from the bottom of my heart.

Justice and Madam, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues in parliament, and 
ladies and gentlemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, no words of mine can ever convey the depth of 
feeling of Canadians toward you better than the applause that you 
heard here this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the members of the Senate of Canada I want to thank 
you, Your Excellency, for returning to Canada once again and 
addressing a joint assembly of our parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just over eight years ago, on June 18, 1990, you spoke to us as 
the Deputy President of the African National Congress.  Just 
newly liberated from a South African jail, you came to seek our 
continued support in the final stages of that great struggle of 
your people and yourself against apartheid and all other forms of 
racism and discrimination.  As you said at the time, the message 
you brought was indeed simple:  South Africa should be 
transformed into a united, democratic and non-racial country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has some knowledge of how difficult it is to remain “a 
united, democratic and non-racial country”.  It is because of 
your skilful statesmanship and the wisdom and moderation of the 
inhabitants and chiefs of South Africa whom you represent that 
you have made such tremendous progress towards the goal you and 
your compatriots have set yourselves.  Perhaps you would favour 
us with some advice? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decade ago it seemed inevitable that the struggle against 
institutionalized racism would lead to a violent and bitter civil 
upheaval that would tear South Africa apart and leave the country 
bitterly divided, prostrate, and in the hands of anti-democratic 
regimes.  This unfortunately has proven to be the fate of too 
many countries, and at a terrible cost they have freed themselves 
from the rule of one oppressive regime, only to fall victim of 
another often more radical tyranny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight years ago your address to our parliament gave us hope that 
South Africa might avoid that fate.  It indicated that your long 
27 years in prison had not led to bitterness.  Rather, it had led 
to wisdom and the determination to use your immense personal 
prestige in South Africa, in the African National Congress and 
throughout the world to bring about a united, democratic and 
non-racial South Africa through mediation and negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of healing, of reconciliation and of building featured 
largely at your inauguration as President of South Africa. 
At that time you entered into a covenant to build, and, Mr. 
President, I quote your very words: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a society in which all South Africans, both black and white, 
will be able to walk tall, without any fear in their hearts, 
assured of their inalienable right to human dignity—a rainbow 
nation at peace with itself and the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years that followed your election to office, the 
government you lead held fast to this noble ideal, although it 
was not always easy.  The challenge was a formidable one. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been easy; changing a racially based, repressive, 
democratically limited political structure in which the internal 
power is in the hands of a privileged few has been a major, major 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, revolutionary political change gives rise to 
exaggerated hopes of immediate, wide-ranging social and economic 
improvement.  Such expectations are difficult to meet.  Yet, with 
time, with deep personal commitment by yourself and like-minded 
colleagues, and with broad support from your people, you are 
bringing about long-lasting and deep-seated changes in living 
conditions and social structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are doing more than making dramatic progress in domestic 
affairs.  You are showing the world what can be done.  You are 
exercising a moderating influence on the world stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under your leadership South Africa has become a continental 
force of stability and peace.  On behalf of the Senate of Canada 
I thank you for sharing with us your knowledge about the progress 
South Africa is making and your views of the world situation.

to die.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Young South Africans were the first to honour you with their 
idealism, their support and their willingness to sacrifice 
themselves in the cause.  Soon however your reputation spread 
abroad and young people all over the world honoured you by 
electing you honorary president of their university and college 
students unions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other honours were to follow, not the least of them the 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what has earned our greatest admiration, 
Your Excellency, is that you have never turned away from the 
ideal you espoused.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, you could have preached and practised the 
politics of vengeance and retribution, but instead you, sir, have 
devoted your energies and influence to the process of healing and 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, sir, have chosen the path that uses political change as a 
means of bringing about peaceful change in the hearts and minds 
of individuals, as well as in society.  That was the message that 
you brought to the Canadian Parliament eight years ago, and that 
was the commitment you made when you became the President of 
South Africa. Sir, you have kept your word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I choose my words carefully.  You honour us who are here today. 
You honour the Canadian people.  You honour this place, this 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When historians write of the 20th century, beside the names of 
giants who have advanced the causes of peace and democracy, 
giants such as Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr., the 
name of Nelson Mandela will be inscribed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us thank God for you having been with us in this world. 
You have made it, sir, a better place and we thank you.
