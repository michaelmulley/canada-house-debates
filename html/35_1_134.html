	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is 
World AIDS Day.
<P>
	The presence of HIV and AIDS in our communities is a 
constant reminder of our vulnerability as individuals and as 
members of the human race. Many members of this House, and 
far too many Canadians, many of whom live in my riding of

	The effects of HIV and AIDS are suffered by individuals and 
families now estimated worldwide at 17 million men, women 
and children. Measures to reduce the vulnerability of women to 
HIV/AIDS, the need to strengthen AIDS associations, and the 
need to address related human rights and ethical issues are now 
of paramount concern to us all.
<P>
	These issues, as well as the cure and immunization against 
AIDS, can only be effectively dealt with by co-ordinated, 
intensive, national and international efforts which Canada must 
not only support but lead.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Wes and Santo are dead. It doesn't matter to me that they were killed by a

The end result is the same. Our children are dead. The gun didn't kill them. Two 
poor excuses for human beings did. Now, when these men came into possession 
of this gun, the murder weapon, did they have an FAC? Did they register it? Did 
they store it safely? Of course not. Criminals or wanna-be criminals don't respect 
our country's gun laws. Safe storage to them is having the gun stuck down the 
back of their pants or inside a boot until they need to use it. This is the problem that 
our justice minister should be addressing. We need criminal control, not gun 
control.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the number of children living in poverty has grown from a little 
under one million to nearly 1.3 million.
<P>
	In its most recent report, the Canadian Council on Social 
Development criticized the reform the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is conducting. The Council considers 
that the minister's reform plan may well make child poverty 
worse because of cuts in assistance programs for poor families. 
Single-parent families, in which 41 per cent of poor children in 
Canada live, would be particularly hard hit by this reform.
<P>
	The council has now joined the ranks of those who, like the 
Bloc Quebecois, object to any reform that cuts blindly into

last spring gas prices jumped seven cents per litre across Canada

protest followed and it dropped one or two cents more per litre 
around the country leaving a two or three cent a litre increase 
intact.
<P>
	The Bureau of Competition Policy today said it does not see 
price fixing. This is a bizarre conclusion with unanswered

yesterday in this House, the Prime Minister agreed with the 
verdict of the Canada-Newfoundland board which denounced 
awarding a contract without tender to Saint John Shipbuilding. 
The Prime Minister instructed the Minister of Natural 
Resources to require the Hibernia consortium to review its 
decision that was unfair to MIL Davie, the only bidder able to 
carry out this contract which had been awarded to Saint John.
<P>
	How can the minister explain the government's decision to 
hold another call for tenders on this contract, when MIL Davie 
was the only other shipyard that bid on it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me clarify that which the Prime Minister 
and I said yesterday.
<P>
	In light of the Canada-Newfoundland offshore board decision 
which indicated all Canadian shipbuilding companies were not 
given a full and fair opportunity to bid or tender for the contract 
in question, we have asked through the president of the Hibernia 
Management Corporation that the owners review their decision.
<P>
	I understand from Mr. Hull, the president, that he will be in 
contact with the other owners and seek that review. Pending the 
outcome of that review, I think it would be unfair or 
inappropriate for me to anticipate the outcome.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
everyone admits that MIL Davie was wronged in this affair, why 
does the minister stubbornly refuse to recognize that the only 
way to correct the injustice done to the Quebec shipyard is to 
award it automatically and without delay this contract which it 
should have had from the beginning?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate the position of the Prime 
Minister and myself. What we are concerned about in this 
situation is the process that was used by the Hibernia 
Management Corporation. It is clear based on the report of the 
offshore board that all Canadian companies were not treated 
fairly. We have asked the management board of Hibernia to 
review that decision. Our concern is with the process. We have 
never commented on the ability or lack thereof of any shipyard 
in this country to do the job in question. We are concerned that 
everyone get the opportunity to be treated fairly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we see 
how complicated and difficult it is to obtain justice when a 
Quebec company like MIL Davie is involved. Does the minister 
realize that by reopening the bidding, she is leaving MIL Davie 
vulnerable to its competitors since they will probably have 
access to the documents from the first bid and find out about 
their contents? Does she realize that?
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply reiterate the concern of this 
government. It is with the process that was followed. We are 
committed to ensuring that all Canadian shipbuilders have a fair 
and full opportunity to bid on contracts.
<P>
	I think, for whatever reason, my learned friend across the way 
is having some difficulty comprehending the fact that our 
concern is always with fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. If 
someone has problems in this House, that person is on the other 
side.
<P>
	The MIL Davie shipyard, in Quebec, is on the verge of 
closure. The company needs new contracts to ensure its 
survival. If the Hibernia contract for a sub-module of electric 
equipment was transferred to MIL Davie, the company could 
immediately recall 400 of its recently laid off workers. It is still 
time to act, since the component housing the modules has not yet 
left Marystown, in Newfoundland.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, with over six billion 
dollars of economic spin-offs related to the Hibernia 
megaproject, the MIL Davie shipyard, the only one in Canada 
with the expertise to build drilling platforms, has so far been 
awarded only one contract representing a mere $15 million?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that this government does 
not wish nor is it in any position to comment upon the relative 
merits of one shipyard over another in relation to this contract. 
What we are in a position to comment upon is fairness and full 
opportunity on the part of all shipbuilders to participate in this 
contract. That is what we will ensure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us not forget that Quebecers invested $800 million 
of their tax dollars in Hibernia, only to see MIL Davie get a 
small $15-million contract. In the meantime, the Sorel-Tracy 
shipyard and the Montreal shipyard were closed and every 
attempt is being made to also close the one in Lévis, while 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8476"> 8476 </A></B>
<P>
shipyards in Newfoundland and New Brunswick are being 
subsidized and contracts are  awarded without any tender to 
Saint John Shipbuilding. Is this all part of a scheme to kill MIL 
Davie? How can the government be proud of such an attitude?
<P>
	How can the minister abdicate her responsibility regarding 
management of Hibernia by always telling us the same old story 
and hiding behind the private partners of the consortium, when 
the federal government guarantees close to 50 per cent of the 
funds for this megaproject, or some $30 billion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources,

way that the Hibernia project has been of considerable benefit to 
the province of Quebec over the years that it has been in 
operation and will continue to be in the future. Over half a 
billion dollars worth of contracts for over 100 Quebec 
companies.
<P>
	They do not want to listen, but let me assure my hon. friends 
that this government has no desire to hurt MIL Davie or any 
shipyard in this country. What we want to ensure is that every

General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the announcement of 
our decisions will take place this afternoon.
<P>
	As a matter of courtesy I have furnished copies to my 
provincial counterparts. In answer to the question put by the 
hon. member, let me express my own belief that when all the 
provincial attorneys general look at these proposals and 
decisions in their entirety, they will support these initiatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, time will tell.
<P>
	With respect to consultation, first the justice department leaks 
its gun control proposals to the media with appropriate spin 
doctoring. Then it breeds the support of the interest groups and 
only then, five days later, does Parliament get to see the 
documents and the provinces are included almost as an 
afterthought.
<P>
	The government puts public relations and interest groups 
ahead of Parliament every time. It has done this on social policy. 
It has done it on immigration, on finance and gun control.
<P>
	Does this order of preference, media leaks first, interest 
groups second, Parliament third and provinces dead last, reflect 
the government's consultative priority?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I make no 
apologies for the four months of personal consultation that I 
conducted across the country.
<P>
	During the course of the last several months, I have been in 
continuous touch with senior officials and indeed with 
provincial counterparts, attorneys general and ministers of 
justice, exchanging views about the proposals that will be 
decided upon and announced this afternoon.
<P>
	May I make it clear that any leaks to the media were entirely 
beyond the control of the Department of Justice. What steps we 
took were as a matter of courtesy to furnish representatives of 
the hon. member's party and of the official opposition with 
advance copies of the material so that they could see it before 
this afternoon.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	We heard the news that MIL Davie was treated unfairly by the 
Hibernia consortium in the matter of a contract that would have 
maintained several hundred jobs at the Lévis shipyard and, 
meanwhile, the federal government has yet to announce what it 
intends to do about the proposal by the Government of Quebec 
for the construction of a ferry for the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	When is the minister going to respond to the proposal made by 
the Government of Quebec on November 14, and how can he 
justify his government's slow response?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Transport Canada is responsible for providing a safe 
and efficient service between the Magdalen Islands and Prince 
Edward Island, and we will do everything we can to ensure that 
the people of the Magdalen Islands have this service.
<P>
	However, I want to point out to the hon. member that we have 
asked the operator who is now responsible for providing the 
service with the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> to advise us of his 
requirements, and then Transport Canada will award him a 
subsidy.
<P>
	Acquiring, leasing or building a ship is the sole responsibility 
of the service operator, not of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
started our first session a year ago, I asked the same question and 
today, the answer is still the same.
<P>
	Considering how the government deals with matters that 
concern MIL Davie, how can the minister expect us to believe 
that the government is not making a concerted and deliberate 
attempt to close down MIL Davie?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have made some progress in trying to determine 
exactly what is required to provide the service between Iles de la 
Madeleine and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	I want to say to my hon. colleague that we have made 
significant progress in this place since yesterday. One of the 
things that has been cleared up, I hope to the satisfaction of 
every one, particularly my friends who are concerned about the 
future of MIL Davie, is that in the future whenever the 
Government of Canada is concerned there will be no question of 
sole sourcing ships. Any process for acquisition will be through 
a clear, transparent and competitive bidding process.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Terence Wade report commissioned by the Department of 
Justice reveals that the handgun registration system is replete 
with confusion, inconsistencies, non-compliance and 
mismanagement. Most important, the report reveals how 
completely useless the handgun registration system has been as 
an aid to law enforcement agencies and in reducing the criminal 
use of handguns.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice why this report, which was 
available in July, was not tabled with the standing committee on 
justice, why it was not tabled in the House, and why I was denied 
access to the report by his officials when I requested it three 
weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will get answers to 
those questions and I will put them in writing to my hon. friend. 
As I told him yesterday, he should have a copy of that report and 
I shall see to it that he does have one.
<P>
	Let me make clear, before we lose the point the Terence Wade 
report made, that the manner in which the registration system 
for handguns was organized during the past two decades was 
flawed and needed improvement. It did not condemn the 
principle of registration nor the purpose of registration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, right now 
there are firearm interest groups locked up pending the 
announcement of the Minister of Justice regarding gun control 
later today.
<P>
	The minister has expounded upon his virtuous cross-country 
consultation process this summer. While in consultation with 
these various groups did the minister inform them of the 
findings contained within the Terence Wade report, or was the 
report concealed from them as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the course of those 
dozens of meetings I had across the country I took it as a given 
that the registration system in place at present in the country for 
handguns will not serve as a model for any future registration 
system. It is indeed flawed, without argument.
<P>
	The point of the discussion in those consultations was how 
such an approach could be effected to serve the very important 
social goals that registration can and will achieve.

question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	On the issue of the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, the 
Quebec government is prepared to discuss with the federal 
government how the transition plan proposed by the mayor of 
Saint-Jean should be implemented. In Quebec's view, this is an 
interesting proposal, as it could ensure the survival of the 
college the long term.
<P>
	Now that he has finally seen reason, or so it seems, can the 
minister who welcomed with interest this proposal by the mayor 
of Saint-Jean tell us if he intends to assign federal officials to 
resume talks with the Saint-Jean authorities and the government 
of Quebec?

<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, Minister Beaudoin should know that negotiations 
are not conducted through the media. I have received nothing 
official from the minister yet. I therefore have no answer to give, 
since no question has been asked in the first place.
<P>
	It is essential however that any negotiations regarding the 
mayor's proposal be conducted on the basis of the two 
conditions the mayor and myself have agreed upon, that is to 
say, first, that the conversion of the military college to civilian 
use must take place and, second, that there must be a transition 
period. These two basic principles are part and parcel of the 
agreement proposed on July 19, which the government of 
Quebec has yet to comply with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are 
not negotiating through the media. I have put a question to the 
minister and I would like to get an answer.
<P>
	How can this minister have the gall to parade about with the 
``Sauvons Saint-Jean'' badge on his lapel when, once again, he 
is showing bad faith in refusing to resume talks?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Members must refrain from assigning to other 
members motives that are not honourable. Perhaps the hon. 
member could rephrase his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, does the minister intend to 
resume talks, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the opposition may be under the impression that 
using unparliamentary  language will improve the negotiation 
climate, but that, of course, is wrong.
<P>
	The reason I am wearing the ``Sauvons Saint-Jean'' badge is 
because we hold the key to the continuation of the college in 
Saint-Jean and this key is the July 19 agreement. I sent a letter to 
Mrs. Beaudoin two weeks ago, indicating that I was prepared to 
resume negotiations on the details of the agreement which is in 
effect under the terms of the agreement signed on July 19.

<P>
	Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's mission to 
Sarajevo today has failed. The Bosnian Serbs refused to meet 
with him and the Bosnian government refused to agree to a 
ceasefire.
<P>
	Should Canada not now take the position that unless all UN 
detainees are immediately released, there be no further 
aggression against UN personnel, the Sarajevo airport be 
reopened to humanitarian flights and convoys allowed to 
proceed and an effective ceasefire be put in place, Canada 
should call for the withdrawal of all UN forces from Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has been quite clear on Canada's participation in this 
very troubled mission and I do not propose to repeat it.
<P>
	I subscribe to some of the points raised by the hon. member. 
We in Canada believe that obviously those detained should be 
released, that the hostilities should cease, that there should be a 
ceasefire, and that the Sarajevo airport should be reopened. We 
believe all of that and we believe that can be accomplished by 
negotiation.
<P>
	We are very sorry that the Secretary-General of the UN was

bargaining ploy on the part of those who refused to meet with 
him and that they will get down to meaningful negotiations

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. On 
November 30, 1993, exactly a year ago today, the Royal 
Commission on New Reproductive Technologies published its 
final report after studying the issue for four years and spending 
over $28 million. We are still waiting patiently for the federal 
government to respond to the commission's recommendations.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Justice explain that, one year after 
the Baird report was tabled, he still has not introduced a bill to 
regulate reproductive technologies, research on human embryos 
as well as the sale of ova and human foetal tissue in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health and the 
Ministry of Health have been working on the response to the 
royal commission for quite a while.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the royal commission created far 
more controversy than it answered questions. We need to look at 
how we can deal with provinces and with special groups, to look 
at how we can set guidelines for recommendations and to follow 
the recommendations.
<P>
	However, as far as taking our time, I bring to the hon. 
member's attention the fact that the royal commission was 
supposed to have reported in two years. It took four years to 
bring in its report.
<P>
	Because the matter is so controversial I think it is quite 
acceptable that we have to deal with the same controversies in 
formulating our response.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think that blaming the government's delay in 
introducing a bill on the commission's own two-year delay in 
tabling its report is a pretty poor excuse. Is the  minister aware 
that by delaying the introduction of his bill, he makes it even 
more difficult, if not impossible, to counter abuses in research 
on human embryos and to prevent the sale of ova and foetal 
tissue on the black market?

Canadian shipyards were not given a fair and full opportunity to

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, clause 
45 of the Canada-Newfoundland Atlantic accord states that in 
instances where the budget or the time restraints are in question 
the accord allows for contracts to be given without tender.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister why she would jeopardize the 
budget and the completion date of the entire project by

explain to us how someone can work for four months in his 
office, quit his job voluntarily and pocket a bonus of $31,000, 
then be rehired by the minister in the same office at an annual 
salary of $93,000, without having to pay back even a cent of his 
severance pay? How?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

assistant to the minister of fisheries. Last February he was 
named in a matter that was under  investigation in the 
Parliament of Newfoundland regarding fundraising practices in 
the province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	The individual in question, my executive assistant, resigned 
his position in my office the next day until the matter had been 
cleared up. As it turned out the matter in question was 
subsequently referred to the RCMP because it involved a 
provincial cabinet minister.
<P>
	Seven and a half months later the RCMP concluded that 
notwithstanding questions raised in the House initially by the 
opposition, subsequently referred to the RCMP for a thorough 
seven and a half months investigation, that individual was 
cleared of any question of wrongdoing whatsoever.
<P>
	In that seven and a half months period the individual, Mr. 
Gary Anstey, sought no employment with any other operational 
organization, received no other income, in fact went without 
income for three and a half months.
<P>
	After he was cleared of any wrongdoing he was restored to his 
job as executive assistant. He has done without three and a half

$12,000 for an Ottawa apartment that is used 24 days a year and 
$34,500 in travel from his home in Vermont. Does this sound 
like fiscal restraint, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Will 
he undertake an immediate review of per diems, honoraria and 
expense accounts of all government appointees to federal 
agencies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

it very quickly.
<P>
	I look forward to the assistance of members of the third party 
and other members of the House as we review in depth the 
operations on the maritime side of my responsibilities at 
Transport Canada. We have already announced that we are going 
to be looking at the structure of Ports Canada and how these 
arrangements are arrived at.
<P>
	The case that the hon. member raises today is a result of an 
order in council appointment that I understand was made in 
1987. It exemplifies the need to review all of these matters in 
depth, whether they have to do with the per diems of the 
chairman of Canada Ports Corporation or orders in council.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that we are going to be doing it 
as quickly as we can. I look forward to their co-operation on this 
matter, unlike some of the things we have tried to correct where

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
address my supplementary question to the Minister of the

<P>
	Reviewing is one thing, we want action after the review. The 
government is sending all the wrong signals to its federal 
officials. How can we expect the bureaucracy to spend more 
responsibly when the executive assistant to the minister of 
fisheries received a $31,000 severance package for four 
months-or seven months even, I could certainly live on 
that-and is not  even required to repay a penny when he is 
rehired to the same position several months later?
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of the Treasury Board. How 
can the government dare to ask Canadians to tighten their belts? 
What part of fiscal restraint does he not understand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has made it quite 
clear that the employee involved resigned.
<P>
	Until an investigation could be completed that person was 
without employment for some seven and a half months, which 
means that the $31,000 covered only the first three and a half 
months. There was a considerable period of time when that 
person was not employed and yet that person had not done 
anything wrong, as the minister clearly said.
<P>
	The government is dedicated to ensuring the cost efficiency of 
every taxpayers' dollar that comes into the revenues of the 
government. We are tightening up on many of these procedures 
which previous governments had put in place to make sure that 
happens.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. We just learned from Statistics Canada that the 
tuberculosis rate among status Indians is 43 times higher than 
for non-native Canadians born in this country. In fact, the 
infection rate is higher than in some of the world's poorest 
countries.
<P>
	Since this incredible rate reflects appalling living conditions, 
can the minister tell us which concrete proposal his colleague 
from Public Works made to native leaders who recently met with 
him, to improve the housing conditions which are at the root of 
these health problems?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has brought 
forward a question that is of great concern to public health and to 
the Ministry of Health.
<P>
	We have been spending a million dollars a year so far to curb 
tuberculosis in aboriginal communities. We have now added 
$2.8 million extra per year over the next three years to try to 
eradicate tuberculosis so that by the year 2000 there will only be 
20 per 100,000 affected and by the year 2010 we will have 
eradicated it completely.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian Press has reported that an 
interdepartmental working group co-ordinated by the PCO is 
studying the issue of electronic surveillance by federal 
authorities.
<P>
	The group is concerned with the development of a clipper chip 
that would ensure that government agencies like CSIS, the 
RCMP and the CSE are able to intercept telephone, fax and 
computer transmissions despite attempts to encrypt them.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he confirm the 
existence of this working group and explain why, if CSE does 
not have a mandate to spy on Canadians, it is concerned about 
ensuring the ability of government agencies to spy on Canadians 
when the CSE is supposedly prohibited from doing so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the tasks of the CSE is to advise the government 
on the protection of the data in its computers because of the 
issue of cryptography.
<P>
	It is quite normal that the CSE would be on a working group 
within the government where the working group is looking at 
developments in the United States and has been asked to give 
advice to government of what measures we may have to take to 
protect the privacy of  information in our data banks from 
possible questionable intrusion.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	It has to do with the stated intention of the government to 
expand NAFTA to include first Chile and perhaps other southern 
American countries. Recently the government opposed an 
attempt by the NDP to inject a social dimension into the 
legislation having to do with the Uruguay round.
<P>
	I ask the Minister for International Trade whether in the 
Canadian negotiations leading to the expansion of NAFTA it is 
the intention of the government to continue to shy away from 
introducing a social clause or a social dimension into these 
treaties or whether he could say today that in those negotiations 
leading to the expansion of NAFTA the government does intend 
to insist on a social clause, charter, dimension, whatever you 
want to call it so that we have a truly level playing field in these 
agreements.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the NAFTA agreement includes two side 
accords, one on labour and one on the environment. Those will 
be an integral part of the negotiation with Chile with regard to its 
accession.
<P>
	On the broader question of social policy and trade, that issue 
is being addressed in the International Labour Organization and 
indeed to a degree in the OECD. The recommendations and the 
findings of the ILO will come in time before the World Trade 
Organization.

Mr. Speaker, I will be brief and to the point.
<P>
	When the leader of the Reform Party questioned the Minister 
of Justice regarding the leak of his statement on gun control, the 
Minister of Justice suggested that confidential material 
concerning his statement on gun control may have been leaked 
by the opposition.
<P>
	This is not only entirely untrue but it is impossible because 
this material was broadcast on television last night and is in the

<P>
<I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning. Our party and the Bloc received 
the information only after eight o'clock this morning.
<P>
	I would ask that the minister retract this statement and clear 
the air so that there is no condemnation and no unfounded 
charges against this party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the record will show 
that I said no such thing.
<P>
	I make it clear if there is any doubt that I was not suggesting 
that. Rather, I was responding to the statement that I was 
preferring interest groups and journalists to the House of 
Commons. I was making the point that I gave no information to 
journalists. I do not know who did. The people I gave it to were 
my colleagues in the House and in accordance with the time 
honoured practice on a lock-up basis for those who are 
particularly in the issue.
<P>
	I did not suggest nor do I say that hon. members opposite 
breached the terms on which I gave them the documents. I make 
no such statement.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the defining 
characteristics of our country is its deep commitment to order 
and to civility. It has been that way from the beginning.
<P>
	Ours is a nation created by consensus, not by revolution. Our 
domestic history is a chronology of quiet accommodation rather 
than dramatic conflict. We are known throughout the world for 
our distinctly peaceful character. Our proudest international 
symbol is the blue beret. Our most valued asset at home is the 
safety of our cities and of our streets.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians firmly intend to preserve and strengthen the 
outstanding civility that has always distinguished them. The 
political and legislative program on safety in public and private 
places shows this government's commitment in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is in the context of that unconditional commitment to public 
safety that we undertook and have now completed a thorough 
review of Canada's laws in relation to firearms.
<P>
	I rise in the House today to announce the decisions that we 
have arrived at and to table a document that sets them out in 
detail.
<P>
	Let me first report to the House on the process that I followed 
in preparing the decisions that are being announced today. Since 
May of this year when the Prime Minister asked me to take on 
this challenge, I have worked with the caucus of the Liberal 
Party to meet with Canadians from all walks of life who are 
interested in this issue.
<P>
	During the past five months I have visited for this purpose all 
10 provinces and both territories. I have met with more than 150 
national and regional groups of firearm owners and users: with 
farmers for whom the rifle is a tool in their daily work, with 
hunters, with gun collectors, and with sports shooters, some of 
whom have achieved international distinction in their sport.
<P>
	I have visited aboriginal communities and I have spoken with 
families that hunt for sustenance. I have also met with police, 
doctors, nurses and victims organizations. I have reviewed the 
research relating to firearms safety and public health. I have 
listened and I have learned. I now wish to report on this 
extensive process of consultation.
<P>
	In the first place there is of course no doubt that the entire 
subject of the regulation of firearms is controversial, but I can 
also report that there are broad areas of consensus. First, 
Canadians believe strongly that they do not want a country in 
which people feel they must own a firearm to protect 
themselves. That is simply not the way we wish to live.
<P>
	Second, Canadians want above all to have a lawful and safe 
society in which the criminal misuse of firearms is dealt with 
severely. Canadians do not want to follow the approach taken to 
firearms by the United States. They want this government to 
chart a different course that will lead us to a different 
destination.
<P>
	Third, I have learned that the firearms question is not a 
rural-urban issue. Canadians who live in the rural environment 
are just as concerned about their safety as are the rest of us. 
Indeed, they have reason to be concerned. Studies have shown 
that the homicide rate in rural areas is almost twice that in the 
urban environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8484"> 8484 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, Canadians want our firearms laws to acknowledge 
and respect the legitimate interests of hunters and of farmers. 
They too are an important part of the Canadian way of life. 
Hunting is a long and valued tradition in Canada. It is a pastime 
enjoyed by many Canadians and, of equal importance, it is a 
very significant economic activity for many regions of this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore our goal must be to strengthen and safeguard our 
Canadian approach, which allows people to own and use a 
weapon only for purposes that we as a society consider to be 
justified. An approach that ensures a fair and reasonable control 
on the possession and use of firearms. An approach that provides 
safety standards for the use and storage of firearms throughout 
the country. An approach that severely punishes any criminally 
negligent use of firearms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With the careful consultations now concluded, the time has 
arrived to act. I wish to table in the House a document which 
describes the approach that the federal government will take 
through legislation.
<P>
	Let me be very clear in doing so. The process of consultation 
leading to legislation is now over. As I have said, we have 
listened and we have learned but now we will lead. We will lead 
with the support I hope of this House. We will continue to work 
with the provinces, the territories and the aboriginal 
communities to ensure that our proposals are implemented in 
the fairest manner possible.
<P>
	The areas in which we will act follow the three broad 
categories: First, criminal sanctions for the use of firearms in 
crime; second, controls over firearms in private ownership; and, 
third, efforts to reduce firearms smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me turn first to the question of criminal penalties. There is 
a disturbing trend particularly in urban areas toward violence 
with firearms. Five Canadians each week are victims of 
homicide by guns. The increased use of handguns in crime is 
particularly troubling. To strengthen the law and to provide real 
deterrents in sentencing we will introduce new strong penalties 
for 10 specific serious crimes.
<P>
	Where firearms are used for robbery, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, sexual assault, and six other serious offences, 
there will be mandatory minimum penitentiary terms of four 
years together with a lifetime prohibition against the possession 
of restricted firearms.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those who choose to use a firearm in such a way must know 
that they will surely incur severe consequences. We will also 
propose minimum mandatory prison sentences for the 
possession of a stolen firearms and the possession of handguns 
without permits if they are loaded or if the owners have ready 
access to ammunition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our second theme deals with the controls over private 
ownership of firearms in Canada. There are two measures here. 
The first is our proposal to ban most handguns and a wide 
variety of military type weapons. The second is the proposal for 
a universal registration system for all firearms.
<P>
	I will deal first with the banning of military type weapons and 
most handguns. I say at the outset that we start from the 
principle that only those firearms that we agree as a country are 
appropriate for legitimate purposes should be available for 
private ownership. Hunting rifles and shotguns of course are in 
that category.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But there are also several types of military and paramilitary 
firearms that are designed to imitate weapons used by the army 
and the police and are intended not for hunting or farming but 
for combat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am able to tell the House today that we will prohibit effective 
January 1, 1995, 21 types of such paramilitary firearms 
comprising more than 200 individual models. When the laws we 
propose are in place we will also ban, among others, the Ruger 
Mini-14 used in the murders at l'École polytechnique.
<P>
	We will also ban the further sale of most handguns because we 
have determined they have no legitimate sporting purpose. 
Almost 60 per cent of the handguns currently registered to 
Canadians fall within that category, some 553,000 handguns. 
With respect to those handguns that remain, we will strengthen 
the controls over access and use and we will require their owners 
to prove each five years that they continue to qualify or they will 
lose the privilege of possession and use. We will also ban the 
import, the manufacture and the sale of replica firearms.
<P>
	Let me turn to the subject of universal registration. We will 
introduce such a system for all firearms. Indeed such a system is 
the foundation for all three strategies that I am describing today, 
criminal sanctions, controls over private ownership and efforts 
to reduce smuggling.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For years, the chiefs of police and medical community in 
Canada have been asking the federal government to adopt such a 
system. They believe that such a registration system can 
contribute to greater public welfare without imposing excessive 
constraints on hunters, farmers and target shooters. Our 
government agrees with them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During a reasonable period of transition a registration for all 
firearms will be introduced in order to identify the owners of 
firearms and to record all firearms they own. Registration will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8485"> 8485 </A></B>
<P>
encourage compliance with safe storage  requirements. It will 
allow police responding to emergency calls to know the firearms 
that are present before they arrive. It will allow police to seize 
all firearms owned by someone who is the subject of a 
prohibition order in the criminal court.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I ask that the House not underestimate the importance of that 
last point, of enforcing prohibition orders in the context of 
domestic violence. The House must bear in mind that on average 
one woman every six days is shot to death in this country, almost 
always in the home, almost always by someone she knows. 
Almost all of the firearms used for that purpose are legally 
owned. Almost all of them are rifles and shotguns. The people 
who pull those triggers become criminals by that very act.
<P>
	We must also not lose sight of the fact that 1,100 Canadians 
commit suicide with a firearm each year. Too many of them are 
young people who act on an impulse. We must also remember 
that in the years since 1970, 425 children have died because they 
were accidentally shot and killed in Canada.
<P>
	Increased compliance with safe storage, encouraged by 
universal registration will make it more difficult for these young 
persons to get access to a firearm either in a moment of torment 
or by tragic accident.
<P>
	Registration will also be the key to ammunition controls. 
Once the system is in place only those persons who are 18 years 
of age or over and who can produce proof of registration will be 
entitled to purchase ammunition.
<P>
	May I pass now to the control of Canada's borders and 
emphasize at the outset how large a task that is. I need not tell 
anyone how vast the frontier is we share with the United States. 
In terms of preventing the illegal entry of firearms the challenge 
is extraordinary.
<P>
	We share the border with a country where guns are readily 
accessible. There are 130 million border crossings a year. It is 
simply impossible to open every trunk and glove compartment, 
but there are ways in which we can and will do better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Further to the vigorous measures already taken by the revenue 
minister, we are announcing additional strict measures today to 
control the importation of firearms and to reduce illegal imports 
and gun trafficking.
<P>
	First, we will end the practice of using Canada as a transit 
point for deliveries of weapons to countries that would not allow 
their direct entry.
<P>
	Second, all shipments of firearms arriving in Canada will 
therefore have to be accompanied with a permit issued in 
advance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, inspections and enforcement at the borders will be 
enhanced.
<P>
	Fourth, new criminal offences and stiff penalties for 
smuggling will strengthen our hand.
<P>
	Fifth, every firearm entering Canada will be registered. This 
will allow guns that disappear from bulk shipments to be traced 
and will permit us to follow every firearm to the point of sale.
<P>
	May I finish as I began by talking about the kind of country we 
want to live in. The laws we will introduce are for all of Canada. 
They are sensitive to the concerns and the lifestyles in both the 
rural and the urban environment but they are also designed to 
achieve a single national purpose: safety in our homes and in our 
streets.
<P>
	It has been said that the best way to predict the future is to 
invent it. Today we propose a way to invent a Canadian future 
that will reflect the best about us and to preserve what matters 
most.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice deceived us, fooled us, took us for a ride with 
the help of the Prime Minister himself. He had been promising a 
new gun control act for months, instead we get lip service from 
the minister.
<P>
	In September, the minister said that he would table a bill in 
November and today he has the nerve to tell this House that it 
will be delayed until February. And we are supposed to trust 
him!
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We will not, Mr. Speaker. We took his word for it, but we will 
not be caught a second time. We no longer believe the justice 
minister's promises.
<P>
	There is nothing before us today, but good intentions. A 
ministerial statement does not commit the government to 
anything in particular. The justice minister may very well 
change his mind again tomorrow morning, and we will not be 
any further ahead, we will be at a standstill. Since the past is an 
indication of the future, the minister will probably change his 
mind and postpone the tabling of his bill till kingdom comes.
<P>
	I find it very suspicious to see the minister wriggle out of it. 
Obviously, even if he takes the trouble to deny it, he yielded to 
the gun lobby to which several of his cabinet colleagues belong. 
A vocal minority easily won him over in spite of his supposedly 
strongly held beliefs.
<P>
	On September 22, the minister stated in the House that the 
Liberal government was ``going to deal with illegal firearms in 
this country, toughen the criminal law in its response to those 
who use firearms in the commission of offences, and deal with 
the regulation of firearms in the hand of lawful owners in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8486"> 8486 </A></B>
<P>
manner consistent with safety in our society''. When, Mr. 
Speaker, when?
<P>
	The same day, the justice minister stated that he had spent the 
summer consulting with Canadians. In response to one of my 
questions, he said, and I quote: ``I spent most of the summer 
consulting Canadians throughout the country and I listened to 
what they had to say''. Either he is hard-of-hearing or he 
listened only to what the pro-gun lobby has to say. Apparently, 
nothing positive has transpired from these consultations. We are 
still dealing with good intentions.
<P>
	Today, the minister tell us that now is the time to act. What is 
stopping him? It seems that action does not mean the same thing 
across the way as it does on our side of the House. On this side, 
when we say the time has come to act, it means that appropriate 
action is being taken and, in the present case, it should have 
taken the form of a gun control bill. But for the Minister of 
Justice, now means three months down the road, maybe.
<P>
	The minister quoted disturbing statistics: ``on average, one 
woman every six days is shot to death in this country''. How 
many more will have died three months from now?
<P>
	Does the minister need a better reason to act? He should 
realize that the longer he waits, the worse it is. With its action 
plan, the government is sitting on the fence.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not know if can you hear, as I do, the noise 
coming from the back, but I must admit it interferes with my 
concentration.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, hon. colleagues. I give the floor 
back to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was saying that the 
government action plan is best characterized by 
fence-straddling. It reflects in part the position of citizens 
requesting gun control and gives in to the pro-gun lobby by 
postponing indefinitely the universal registration of firearms.
<P>
	The minister has no intention of seeing universal registration 
implemented during his mandate. He expresses concern for the 
number of victims of homicides by gun, but tables no bill and 
puts off until 2001 the requirement for gun owners to obtain 
firearms certificates. They will have until the next millennium 
to comply with the minister's action plan.
<P>
	As for firearms registration per se, owners are given until 
2003 to register their firearms. How can the Minister of Justice 
think that he can be taken seriously when he says that the time 
has come to act and, in the same breath, tells us that weapons 
currently in circulation will not have to be registered for nearly 
ten years?
<P>
	On the subject of penalties, the government action plan 
proposes a number of improvements regarding maximum 
sentences for crimes involving the use of a firearm. The list of 
offenses, however, includes neither assault with a weapon nor 
confinement.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice also promised us tough measures on 
the smuggling and importation of firearms. Strangely enough, 
his action plan suggests stiffer penalties for owners of hunting 
rifles without registration cards than for those who import or 
own smuggled weapons.
<P>
	While the hunter will be liable to a minimum sentence of one 
year in prison for a second offence, the smuggler may not even 
have to go to jail. Today, the minister tried to cover all bases of 
gun control, except perhaps when it comes to issuing 
registration cards for cannons, without biting into any of the real 
issues.
<P>
	The Liberal government's lack of action does not take into 
account the realities faced by gun owners. In this regard, the 
regulations already in effect are inconsistent and difficult to 
enforce, even by police officers, who often are not familiar with 
them. On November 15, the minister replied to me in this House, 
and I quote: ``We will make every effort to simplify (the 
regulations)''. This does not seem to be among his priorities 
today.
<P>
	Nowhere in the paper tabled by the Minister of Justice do we 
see an attempt at regulatory reform. The minister has failed to 
ensure that the existing regulations, particularly on the display, 
storage and transportation of firearms, are consistent and easy to 
enforce. These regulations are not published in an equitable 
manner. For example, the Minister of Justice is currently 
distributing among police forces throughout Canada an 
information booklet with different French- and 
English-language versions. It is this booklet I am talking about.
<P>
	The inconsistency can be found in the chapter on the 
transportation of restricted weapons. Francophone and 
anglophone readers do not have to transport the weapon in the 
same way to conform to the regulations. In fact, the 
English-language version specifies that restricted weapons 
must be locked and stored individually, while the 
French-language version stipulates that these weapons only 
have to be stored individually. Does the minister promise to 
withdraw this misleading booklet from circulation?
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is quite aware of the investigation 
conducted this month in Montreal by coroner Anne-Marie 
David. For his information, some 20 witnesses representing 
various organizations told coroner David how inconsistent and 
confusing these regulations are. Their lack of clarity leaves 
room for interpretation and its attendant dangers. In addition to 
promising new measures attempting to plug all the holes, he 
should have revised the faulty regulations already in effect.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
creation of gun control legislation in a democracy places an 
obligation upon the government to balance the right of the 
individual to own property, in this case firearms, with the 
responsibility of the state to protect members of society from 
the dangerous or illegal use of firearms.
<P>
	Like many Canadians, Reform members support gun control 
legislation based on common sense. In fact we fully support any 
and all gun regulations that will enhance public safety by 
reducing the criminal use of firearms. However, the onus is on 
the Minister of Justice to prove to us and to Canadians that 
current regulations have reduced the criminal use of firearms 
and that his proposed restrictions will be successful in this 
regard before we support the final product.
<P>
	In his 1993 report the Auditor General of Canada expressed 
some concern about the effectiveness of Bill C-17. He 
questioned the motivating factor behind it, concluding that Kim 
Campbell proceeded for reasons of public policy and without a 
statistical base.
<P>
	The Auditor General stated: ``Our review of the new 
regulations indicated that important data needed to assess the 
potential benefits and future effectiveness of the regulations 
were not available at the time the regulations were drafted. 
Because of this, we believe it is important that the measures 
chosen by the government be evaluated at the earliest 
opportunity''.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Although we had asked the minister whether he had taken the 
advice of the Auditor General we never were quite sure of the 
answer until today. Given the proposals the Minister of Justice 
has introduced, I suspect he may have ignored the 
recommendations of the Auditor General and proceeded to 
implement his own agenda for gun control.
<P>
	In November of last year the minister stated that only police 
officers and the military should have guns. In respect to the 
minister he has clarified that remark to me since. Nevertheless, I 
see this sentiment still reflected in some of the proposals 
presented today.
<P>
	The minister has proposed the banning of certain handguns 
from society without statistical justification for doing so. He is 
saying to law-abiding Canadians that if you do not use your 
handgun the government will take it away from you. I think this 
is wrong and we will stand opposed to this if it appears in the 
final legislation.
<P>
	The minister has introduced mandatory minimum sentences 
of four years in prison in addition to a lifetime prohibition 
against the possession of a restricted weapon when committing 
any of the ten specific violent offences with a firearm. He has 
introduced a new mandatory minimum jail sentence for 
possession of a stolen firearm and possession of a loaded 
restricted weapon without a permit. The use of imitation or 
replica firearms in the commission of an offence will draw a 
minimum  mandatory sentence of one year in jail under section 
85 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	It is good to see that the efforts of the Reform members have 
not gone unnoticed by the justice minister. It is indeed 
encouraging to see the Minister of Justice following our lead.
<P>
	On June 15 private member's Bill C-260 of my colleague 
from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley was read for the 
first time in the House. That bill expands the present offence of 
using a firearm in the commission of an offence by including 
replica firearms. It also increases the penalty for a first offence 
from one to fourteen years to five to fourteen years and for a 
second offence from three to fourteen years to ten years to life.
<P>
	That same bill establishes the theft of a firearm as a new 
offence with a penalty of three to fourteen years. It also creates a 
new offence for the unlawful importation of a firearm for the 
purpose of selling it or using it in the commission of an offence. 
This offence would carry a penalty of three to fourteen years.
<P>
	Finally, a person who sells a firearm other than by the process 
proscribed by law would be deemed to have aided in an offence 
later committed by the purchaser of the weapon.
<P>
	Reform's position on justice has been very clear and 
consistent from the start. We firmly believe that the justice 
system should provide for harsh punishment as a deterrent for 
committing crimes and for just punishments once a crime has 
been committed.
<P>
	The minister's position with regard to deterrence is however 
questionable. In debates on the Young Offenders Act, the 
minister has stated that he does not believe harsher penalties to 
be a deterrent to preventing youth crime. It seemed he had to be 
pushed to raise the maximum penalty for murder from five to ten 
years. This was the only area under the Young Offenders Act 
where the penalties were increased to any substantial degree.
<P>
	Therefore, I place this on the record. The justice minister has 
been inconsistent in his support of a deterrent principle in 
criminal justice.
<P>
	As well as supporting the criminal sanctions created by this 
proposed legislation, we also support the efforts of the 
government in regard to smuggling and the stiffer penalties 
created for illegally importing and trafficking firearms. 
However, we will remain sceptical about whether or not the 
government will be successful in catching gun smugglers.
<P>
	To date, the government has not been successful in catching 
drug and alcohol smugglers. In fact there has been an increase in 
smuggling activity in this country which I have reason to believe 
in some cases is a result of the prohibitively high taxes and 
prices found in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8488"> 8488 </A></B>
<P>
	The only way the government was able to stop the 
proliferation of tobacco smuggling into this country was to 
reduce the taxes, thereby making it an inexpensive item that 
was not as lucrative on the black market. In other words, it was 
not able to deal with the criminals who were involved in that 
illegal trade. It simply reduced the taxes on cigarettes and was 
able to reduce the smuggling by using that means.
<P>
	We also have some concerns regarding whether the border 
controls will be effective, given that Bill C-34 has granted the 
Yukon Nation self-government. From statements the Minister 
of Justice made on October 4 while in Yukon, we have reason to 
believe that special legislation may be granted to reserves.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Since a number of reserves are on the Canada-U.S. border and 
the minister of revenue has stated that the U.S. is awash with 
weapons, how does the minister propose to deal with smuggling 
and black market activities that is already so prevalent on 
reserves adjacent to the international boundary? In this regard 
the proposals of the Minister of Justice do not go far enough and 
we have some concerns in this area. What use are the penalties 
on border controls if there are other areas that may be left wide 
open?
<P>
	Reform does not believe in tinkering and amending only parts 
of the system. We believe in full reforms which are aimed at the 
total picture, not just one small aspect of the problem. This is 
true with our policies on immigration, deficit cutting, social 
policy reform, and other matters.
<P>
	I now turn to the area which poses the greatest concern to me, 
my colleagues and constituents and that is the registration of 
shotguns and rifles.
<P>
	A confidential report commissioned by the research section of 
the Department of Justice clearly points out the defects in the 
current handgun registration system. In fact it identifies 
approximately 30 problems with the registration system. The 
system has been in place for 60 years and it has failed to work. I 
cannot see how the minister can justify extending this failed 
system. How can he honestly tell Canadians it will reduce the 
criminal use of firearms when the criminal use of handguns has 
been on the increase?
<P>
	The statistical justification for the registration of rifles and 
shotguns has not been made available to us in these proposals. 
How can we and how can Canadians in the absence of such 
information be confident that universal registration will in fact 
reduce the criminal use of firearms and thereby make society 
safer? We cannot.
<P>
	We cannot afford ineffective legislation, particularly in the 
area of criminal justice. We must have sound and proven 
controls in place that ensure public safety.
<P>
	On the banning of handguns, where is the information and 
where are the statistics that the Minister of Justice used to 
justify such a draconian measure?
<P>
	It has been proven by various sources that gun controls do not 
prevent criminals from getting firearms on the black market. 
They do however make it more profitable for individuals to deal 
in the black market of these items. Repeatedly governments in 
this country have learned that prohibitive or restrictive 
measures lead to an underground market where people thrive on 
the challenge of obtaining something illegal and where ruthless 
entrepreneurs profit tremendously.
<P>
	We witnessed this years ago with the prohibition of liquor and 
we have seen it for years with the trafficking of cocaine, speed, 
marijuana and other narcotics into our country. Guns are not 
immune from the underground economy. In fact trade in that 
market has not been diminished but rather enhanced by 
government action.
<P>
	I observe the minister has outlawed hand-held crossbows and 
the registration of other crossbows has been put into place 
through these proposals. What is the justification for this? Does 
this not indicate an unrealistic degree of fear or apprehension 
underlying this legislation? I think it does. More murders are 
committed with knives than with handguns. Are we to see the 
justice minister move to the registration of these weapons?
<P>
	We look forward in the coming months to the minister tabling 
the legislation. We assure him and the people of Canada that we 
will support legislation that is aimed at the criminal activity 
involving firearms. The case for such action has been evident far 
too long in this country. However, we will be closely 
scrutinizing that legislation which is a further encroachment 
upon the rights of law-abiding Canadians.
<P>
	In closing I would like to quote from a letter written to me by a 
loyal and dedicated Canadian. He stated: ``The people of Canada 
will not accept the suppression of our rights and freedoms by 
criminals and they will not accept the suppression of those same 
rights and freedoms by our government''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETARYPOLICY">BUDGETARY POLICY</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 28 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to participate in the debate with three 
purposes in mind: first, to hold the federal government 
accountable for its management of public finances over the last 
year; second, to put forward constructive alternatives where the 
performance of the government has been weak or inadequate; 
and, third, by accomplishing these first two things to endeavour 
to assist the finance committee and the finance minister in the 
preparation of the 1995-96 budget.
<P>
	The focus I would like to make is on five major deficiencies in 
the government's fiscal performance, all of which have negative 
consequences for the economy and, second, to make some 
recommendations for remedying those deficiencies.
<P>
	The first deficiency pertains to the inadequacy of the 
government's deficit reduction targets. The government's target 
to date has been to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in 
three years. The target is simply inadequate. It is too modest. 
The business community says that it is inadequate. The money 
markets say that it is inadequate. Just this week the IMF said in 
no uncertain terms that it is inadequate.
<P>
	Why is it inadequate? It is inadequate because it does not get 
the job done, because it permits the government to add over 
$155 billion to the federal debt over the next two years, because 
it does not stop the erosion of social programs, because it creates 
upward pressure on taxes, because it fails to stimulate private 
sector confidence thereby retarding job creation.
<P>
	Most important, the 3 per cent of GDP target is inadequate 
because it will not eliminate the deficit during the current 
upward swing in the business cycle. When the business cycle 
turns down, the deficit will not have been eliminated and it will 
be infinitely more difficult to make the spending cuts required 
under those conditions.
<P>
	In other words, the government will have missed its window 
of opportunity for deficit reduction just as the Mulroney 
government missed its window in 1984-85. The reality is that 
the government's deficit reduction target is totally inadequate 
and our recommendation is that the government set a fiscally 
responsible deficit target soon. That target should be to aim to 
reduce the deficit to zero by the end of this Parliament.
<P>
	The second deficiency is the inadequacy of the government's 
grasp of the real costs and benefits of social spending. Over 50 
per cent of total federal government's spending is now spent in 
the social areas. Yet the Auditor General has pointed out that this 
is the area where the federal government has the poorest grasp of 
the actual cost of what it is doing and the values received.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	If the auditors of a resource company that had over 50 per cent 
of its business in the oil and gas development area were to issue 
a statement saying that the company's accounting was defective 
with respect to both costing and values received in the principal 
area of its business, the stock of such a company would be driven 
through the floor.
<P>
	This is, however, the great weakness of the discussion paper 
produced by the Minister of Human Resources Development: 
insufficient and inadequate data on the real costs of social 
programs and values received and virtually no data on the costs 
and benefits of alternative social programs proposed.
<P>
	Professed social concern without fiscal responsibility makes 
a mockery of social service. In the 1990s the politician who is 
genuinely concerned about the well-being of the young, the old, 
the sick, the poor or the unemployed will ensure that the 
programs upon which those people are dependent are financially 
sustainable. The old style Liberal politician who fails to ensure 
that will do more to damage the people dependent on those 
programs than the most hard headed fiscal conservative.
<P>
	Our recommendation in this area is to bring the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage before the finance committee of 
the House and to grill them on the costs of their existing 
programs and proposed alternatives; to have that committee ask 
them the hard questions that they never ask themselves and are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8492"> 8492 </A></B>
<P>
rarely asked by their own officials; to have them answer those 
questions before they run the Canada pension plan into the 
ground, before they run medicare into the ground and before 
they run the Canada assistance plan into the ground; and to ask 
them those questions until they learn the meaning of fiscal 
responsibility in the 1990s.
<P>
	The third deficiency concerns the insufficiency of the 
government's spending reduction proposals. In October the 
finance minister made a sobering presentation to the finance 
committee and the public, saying that he could not meet even his 
soft deficit reduction targets without cutting an additional $6 
billion to $9 billion in spending. The minister presented no list 
of spending cuts. The minister was coy and he asked the 
committee and the public to provide that list for him.
<P>
	Members of the business community have since presented 
such lists to the finance committee. Last week Reform members 
of the finance committee provided it with a detailed specific list 
of $10 billion in spending cuts outside major social spending 
areas.
<P>
	During the same period of time, however, various 
parliamentary committees have been treated to the spectacle of 
ministers-the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and heads of agencies like the CBC-endeavouring to protect 
and defend high levels of spending and high levels of 
overspending rather than putting forward responsible proposals 
for spending reduction, which is what the finance minister asked 
for. In other words they just do not get it. They are not listening 
to the finance minister. They are part of the problem, not part of 
the solution.
<P>
	Reform members of the finance committee have provided that 
committee and the minister with a $10 billion spending 
reduction list. We challenged the committee to endorse it and to 
implement it. If we cannot persuade the government or Bloc 
members to support our list, perhaps we can stimulate their 
imagination to produce their own spending reduction list.
<P>
	I ask Liberal members to put themselves in the place of the 
finance minister and pretend they have just received a call from 
their fiscal agent that the money markets are rejecting a major 
Canadian government bond issue. The Government of New 
Zealand once got such a call. The Government of Sweden got a 
call like that a little while ago. What then?
<P>
	They would have to reduce spending overnight. Where would 
they make the cuts? They would have to produce the list. There 
would be no other alternative. We are saying produce the list 
now while there is time to buy time.
<P>
	I ask the Bloc members to imagine themselves as finance 
minister of Quebec, the most highly taxed jurisdiction in North 
America, or soon to be.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	They have just received a call from their fiscal agent saying 
that the latest Quebec bond issue cannot be sold. It has been 
rejected by the market. They cannot borrow any more. Quebec 
Hydro cannot borrow any more. What then? It would have to 
reduce its spending overnight. It would have to produce the list. 
We are saying why not produce the list now while there is time to 
make a difference.
<P>
	The fourth deficiency: The incapacity of the government to 
estimate the employment impacts of either government 
overspending or deficit reduction. For 30 years the federal 
government has operated on the assumption that government 
spending and overspending is a stimulus to economic growth 
and job creation. It is finally discovering the falsity of that 
assumption. The finance minister acknowledged this in his grey 
paper.
<P>
	If government spending and government overspending could 
indefinitely stimulate an economy and job creation, Canada 
would have the highest economic growth rate and the lowest 
unemployment rate of any country in the G-7. However, Canada 
has over one million people unemployed. The premise that 
government overspending creates jobs is false, particularly 
when you are overspending at high debt levels and high taxation 
levels.
<P>
	Increased government spending and the increased taxation 
that goes along with that kills private sector job creation, 
particularly under those conditions. The policy models and the 
econometric models used by the government do not measure 
this. It is infected with the Keynesian virus that ignores the 
negative effects of government overspending and 
underestimates the positive employment effects of deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	The premise that deficit reduction, particularly deficit 
reduction that leads to tax relief, is a powerful economic 
stimulus to the private sector is not built into the equations of 
those models. In effect we are flying blind when it comes to 
estimating the negative employment effects of government 
overspending and the positive employment effects of deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	The finance minister is flying blind, the finance department is 
flying blind, the finance committee is flying blind and the Bank 
of Canada is flying blind on both of those issues.
<P>
	Recommendation: That the finance department, with the 
assistance of the finance committee of the House and the Bank 
of Canada, issue a request for proposals for a new econometric 
model that accurately reflects the employment impacts of 
government overspending and deficit reduction. The finance 
department and the Bank of Canada need a new compass to chart 
their way through the years ahead and they should order that 
now.
<P>
	The fifth deficiency: The unwillingness of the government to 
explicitly recognize the connection between the management of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8493"> 8493 </A></B>
<P>
federal finances and the management of the national unity issue. 
One of the principal arguments that separatists will make 
against the federal system is that the federal government 
systematically mismanages its finances and then tries to offload 
its mistakes and its debts on to the provinces.
<P>
	The current size of the federal debt, the current size of the 
federal deficit, the current federal tax burden and the decline of 
federal-provincial transfers will all be offered as evidence in 
support of this thesis. These arguments will be made by 
separatists in Quebec despite the evidence shown every day in 
this House that most members of the Bloc do not have the 
foggiest notion how to balance a budget either federal or 
provincial.
<P>
	Two recommendations, one general and one specific. If the 
finance minister and the government cannot be persuaded to 
redouble their efforts to eliminate the deficit in the name of 
fiscal responsibility, if the finance minister and the government 
cannot be persuaded to redouble their efforts to reduce the 
deficit in the name of social responsibility to preserve the 
financial underpinnings of the social service safety net, perhaps 
they could still be persuaded to redouble their efforts to 
eliminate the deficit in the name of national unity, to 
demonstrate that the federal government can balance its books 
thereby refuting separatist claims that it cannot or will not.
<P>
	More specifically, before the national unity debate begins in 
earnest, federalism versus separatism, the finance committee 
should also make a specific recommendation to bolster the 
confidence of investors and lenders in the Canadian dollar and 
the securities of Canadian governments.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	They should recommend that the finance minister, the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada, and all 10 provincial finance 
ministers, including the finance minister of Quebec, make a 
solemn public declaration that it is their intention to honour all 
the debt obligations of their respective governments regardless 
of the outcome of the federalist sovereignty debate or 
referendum. Such a declaration would be in the interests of all 
governments and the interests of all taxpayers no matter where 
they live in the country.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have identified five major deficiencies in the 
government's management of the fiscal affairs of this country, 
deficiencies that have a major impact on economic 
performance. These are not insignificant things: the weakness of 
the deficit reduction target, the inadequacy of the government's 
data on real costs of social spending and values received, the 
inadequacy of the government's spending reduction proposals, 
its inability to measure the employment impacts of either 
government overspending or deficit reduction, and its 
unwillingness to recognize the connection between the federal 
deficit issue and the national unity issue.
<P>
	On the positive side, I have made six major recommendations 
which I sincerely hope the finance committee, the finance 
minister and the government will take to heart: one, set the 
deficit reduction target at zero deficit by the end of this 
Parliament; two, drag the human resources minister, the health 
minister, and other soft headed ministers before the finance 
committee and  grill them until they understand the meaning of 
fiscal responsibility in the 1990s; three, adopt the Reform 
Party's list of $10 billion in specific spending cuts in non-social 
areas or produce an equally specific alternative; four, issue a 
request for proposals for an econometric model that will 
actually reflect the employment impacts of both government 
overspending and deficit reduction; five, urge the finance 
minister and the government to redouble their efforts to 
eliminate the deficit not only in the names of fiscal and social 
responsibility but also for the sake of national unity; six, 
recommend that Canada's finance ministers and the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada issue a solemn declaration of their intent to 
honour the debt obligations of their respective governments 
regardless of the outcome of any federalist-sovereignist debate 
or referendum in 1995.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to direct some questions 
and comments to the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I listened carefully to what the leader of Reform Party had to 
say. In fact, I always listen very carefully to what Reform 
members have to say, and there are two points I would like to 
make. My first point is that the leader of the Reform Party does 
not have the foggiest idea of what is happening today in Quebec, 
of what is shaping and promoting the sovereignist option in 
Quebec to make a country out of the land we cherish. It is not 
because of poor management by the federal government. It is, 
first and foremost, about choosing the kind of society and 
country we want, and above all, it is about getting out of a 
system that is impervious to reform, a system that is doomed.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party is accelerating the process in Canada, 
because last week they proposed cuts to all the symbols that are 
a source of pride for Canadians. I do not feel more Canadian than 
the Reform Party, but I think they lack vision.
<P>
	They brag about proposing $10 billion in cuts, but just look 
where they want to make those cuts! It is so vicious and 
shortsighted, for instance, to suggest cutting and slashing and 
even destroying the CBC, as well as everything connected with 
the language, culture, development and international presence 
of the country they claim to defend. They want to save $10 
billion by destroying the very foundations of what they claim to 
defend. This is odd, to say the least.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8494"> 8494 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	About a month and a half ago, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
presented proposals that would raise between fifteen to twenty 
million dollars. Mr. Speaker, consider the difference between 
our approach and theirs. Consider that $8 billion worth of 
unpaid revenue is out there, $8 billion owed to the federal 
government, a point that was raised in the Auditor General's 
report last week. They are not talking about going after those $8 
billion worth of unpaid revenue and taxes, and do you know 
why? Because most of those accounts receivable are big 
accounts, people with very high incomes who owe money to the 
federal government and who can count on the right incarnate on 
our left-I know it sounds peculiar-to defend them with blind 
dedication. They know these people will defend them 
practically to their dying breath. They are not interested in those 
$8 billion because these are their pals out West.
<P>
	They also ignored the fact that $1.5 billion could be cut in the 
National Defence budget, as we suggested. They did not even 
consider what the Auditor General had to say about wasteful 
spending at National Defence. Why? Again, probably because 
they have some friends there, so they will not admit there is any 
wasteful spending in the Public Service and at the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	They did not take a look either-guess where, Mr. Speaker? 
At the tax treatment of corporations. They do not want to touch 
it. Why? Because they are so dogmatic. As far as the Reform 
Party is concerned, these big corporations can do no wrong.
<P>
	I suppose if they are prepared to say it is morally right-they 
are very keen on morality-to have a classified ad in the 
newspaper that says ``unused federal tax deduction for sale'', 
and accept that, they will not look at the tax treatment of 
corporations, which I think is disgraceful. They have no social 
conscience and do not have the foggiest notion of what Canada 
is all about.
<P>
	They approve of an outrageous family trust system which 
defers for 80 years taxes payable on capital belonging to the 
wealthiest in this country, and there again, I think they lack a 
sense of morality and they lack vision.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I think it is disgraceful that Reform 
Party members set themselves up as great reformers. It looks 
more like they are out to destroy the country they claim to 
defend. We are anxious to get out of this country because we are 
sick and tired of these dogmatic speeches.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. Let me respond on two fronts. I believe the 
member's comments demonstrate exactly what I was saying, 
that with all due respect the Bloc members do not have the 
foggiest notion as to how to balance a budget.
<P>
	With respect to unpaid taxes, we could collect all the unpaid 
taxes referred to in the Auditor General's report, the $5 billion to 
$6 billion, every one of them, and we would not even help the 
finance minister to get up to his soft target. He needs $6 billion 
to $9 billion.
<P>
	This idea that they can tax our way out of the problem we are 
in, either in Canada as a whole or in Quebec, is completely 
fallacious. Any government that attempts to do that will turn 
itself into the most highly taxed jurisdiction in Canada. If they 
followed their advice they would end up having the most highly 
taxed jurisdiction in Canada.
<P>
	On the second point, that Reform goes after all the things that 
people hold dear, the $10 billion in spending reductions that we 
advocated in front of the finance committee are outside the 
social area. That is one of the reasons for focusing there first. 
Second, I challenge this whole thesis. It has been people who 
said: ``Don't reduce your spending because all these things are 
sacred'' in many other countries that have helped destroy those 
very things they said were sacred. They let the debt get higher 
and they let the interest on the debt get higher until it eroded 
every social service they considered important.
<P>
	My point, and I conclude with this, is that to demonstrate 
social concern today is not to use the rhetoric of the 1930s that 
we need more social programs. It is to come up with ways of 
making essential social services financially sustainable. That is 
the social conscience of the 1990s.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what 
I hear from the Reform Party leader. I want to ask him a specific 
question and I would like to get a specific answer. If he does not 
have it today he can table it some time soon in the House. Over 
and over again during the campaign the Reform Party told 
Canadians it would balance the budget in three years.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I want the hon. member to give me the specific programs that 
would be cut, the specific initiatives that would be undertaken, 
item by item, and table them in the House before the end of the 
week. Then we will see how they will eliminate the deficit in 
three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have done this over and over 
again for two years. We have tabled this already. We have tabled 
the Reform Party zero in three program for reducing the deficit. 
Now we are in the process of updating it, using the minister's 
latest figures. The first phase was the $10 billion in detailed, 
specific cuts that were laid before the finance committee last 
week.
<P>
	The problem is not getting the list. The problem is finding a 
government with the political will to implement it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8495"> 8495 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I wish to advise 
the Speaker and the House that from this point on government 
members will be dividing their time, 10 minutes each.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
brief question for the hon. member. He said in his statement that 
the government has not taken into account the impact of deficit 
financing on jobs, et cetera.
<P>
	Does the member not agree that the impact on the Canadian 
economy of slashing the deficit at such a pace would drive 
Canada into a worse recession than we have just come out of and 
would create even more hardship on the Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the thesis that balancing the 
government budget in that three year period would create 
recession is a view that was in vogue 30 years ago if you 
subscribe to Keynesian economics. In our view it does not 
operate today.
<P>
	The reason it does not operate is because at our levels of debt 
and taxation, a dollar left in the hands of a taxpayer, a lender or 
investor today is more productive than that dollar in the hands of 
a politician or a bureaucrat. That is the 1990s economics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
honoured to take part in the debate on Canada's budgetary 
process.
<P>
	It is important to spend a little time trying to realize how we 
got to where we are. Studying the history of where we are and 
how we got here may allow us to reach a conclusion on how to 
get back out. We got here by getting on what I call the STB 
formula for disaster, which is basically spend, tax and borrow.
<P>
	The concept of spend, tax and borrow has caused a ratcheting 
effect, constantly spiralling interest rates with the debt 
expanding and growing ever faster. It is very much like a 
mortgage where you never pay the interest. It just keeps getting 
bigger and bigger until we get to the point where we cannot pay 
it off. That is what we have done.
<P>
	We started back in 1982, just to use a very short period of time 
to reflect on. From 1982 until 1992 federal government 
spending increased from $67 billion to $141 billion, a 210 per 
cent increase. Governments have become insatiable spenders. 
We have been sold on the idea that somehow we can continue to 
enjoy services without paying for them.
<P>
	It is partially the fruition of the baby boom generation. Some 
of this is psychological. The baby boomers believed they could 
continue to consume without paying. Politicians told us this was 
possible and we wanted to believe it.
<P>
	The exasperating formula of STB is also partially related to 
the fact that there is no division of these powers within 
government. In other words, the power to spend, the power to 
tax, the power to borrow is all in the same hands. Some people 
have suggested that we should  have a special commission, one 
that simply collects taxes so that governments would have to 
match their spending to the taxes that were available, rather than 
the other way around.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In addition to the spending we also started building up a huge 
civil service. Currently 6.5 per cent of our labour force, 866,000 
people, is employed by government. We seem to have growth for 
the sake of growth.
<P>
	In most of these areas we did not actually add any productivity 
into the economy. In spite of the fact we were told we could do 
this for free, taxes slowly started rising. Many people in the 
House have complained about the complexity of our tax system. 
They search for some kind of new Utopia, a flat tax, a simple tax. 
To me that is a recognition of not knowing why the tax system is 
what it is and how it got to where it is.
<P>
	The tax system is designed to extract the maximum amount of 
money out of the pockets and purses of the people of Canada. It 
gets more and more intuitive and more and more inventive as 
our insatiable desire for more taxes increases. A simplistic tax 
system is very easy but it may allow the escape of some moneys 
in the system.
<P>
	For instance, even in the Income Tax Act there is an 
anti-avoidance section, which simply says in layman's terms 
that if we cannot catch you somewhere else in here, we are going 
to catch you anyway; we can override the income tax system. I 
often thought that we should call the GST or a new value added 
tax the value added cumulative user utility method or vacuum 
tax which is basically what we want to do. We can put a vacuum 
into everyone's house and suck every last cent out of it.
<P>
	Not happy enough to increase our spending, to increase our 
taxation levels to the point where people did not have any 
disposable income, we then started borrowing. First we started 
borrowing from ourselves. The baby boomer generation 
borrowed from its predecessors who knew how to save, who had 
gone through the depression and had great savings. Canadians 
were the second highest savers in the world. Even so, we 
outstripped that. We used all their savings.
<P>
	Then we started borrowing from foreigners. We started 
borrowing from people in the United States. We started 
borrowing from people in Japan. Currently 44 per cent of our 
gross domestic product is accounted for in foreign borrowing. 
Twenty-five per cent of our total outstanding debt is owed to 
people outside the country.
<P>
	This creates an additional problem. We have to keep getting 
investment money into the country so that we can earn foreign 
exchange reserves to pay the interest. We are caught in a 
constant ratcheting spiral.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8496"> 8496 </A></B>
<P>
	Where are we today? People talk about continuing to spend. 
We have curtailed some of our spending. We have discovered 
that some of the benefits in our current governmental system 
are really earned by people going back to work, causing upward 
changes in our revenue and a downward push on the UI account. 
The reality is we continue to spend. Worse than that we 
continue to tax.
<P>
	I have some interesting statistics on the average Canadian 
family that earns $57,696 in 1994. Here is the bill: social 
securities, unemployment insurance, Canada pension plan and 
medical taxes, $5,011; gas taxes, vehicle licences, $926; liquor, 
entertainment taxes, $1,274; property taxes, $2,041; federal and 
provincial sales taxes, $4,284; other taxes such as import duties, 
$2,630; income taxes, $11,037; total, $27,203 which is almost 
50 per cent of what it earns.
<P>
	During the recession this got worse. Suddenly some lost their 
jobs and half the income went out the window. The Auditor 
General reports that he is concerned about the over $6 billion in 
arrears of income taxes. What I cannot understand is why it is so 
low. The reality is that when people could not put food on their 
tables they stopped paying their income taxes. We only left a 
small pittance for these people to pay their mortgages, feed and 
cloth themselves and still we continue to borrow.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Some of our smarter people started thinking: ``Wouldn't 
another country be better to live in?''. Some people think we can 
continue to tax. People earning over $250,000 pay a 53 per cent 
marginal rate of tax. In the United States it is 32 per cent. In the 
United Kingdom it is 42 per cent. Suddenly people start 
thinking: ``Let's get out of here. There are better places to live''.
<P>
	We talk about assisting small and medium sized businesses 
but in reality the federal government crowds out the capital 
markets. People cannot borrow. Why loan money to Joe's auto 
body up the street when you can get a mortgage on all the people 
of Canada?
<P>
	The federal government, in trying to resist spiralling interest 
rates, started shortening the length of its debt instruments. 
Currently the federal government debt is out to four and a half 
years. That is the equivalent of refinancing your mortgage 25 
per cent every year. What does it mean? It creates all kinds of 
volatility. What if some day somebody does not want to lend you 
any money? That is exactly what is happening. People are 
starting to look at Canada and wonder about our insatiable 
appetite for spending. They start debating whether they should 
lend to us at all. They certainly start pushing up the interest rates 
and for a short term period of time.
<P>
	In September in the private sector there was the greatest 
conversion of Canadian denominated bonds in two years; $1.9 
billion was converted into foreign currency away from the 
Canadian market.
<P>
	Where do we want to go? We want to get the ratchet working 
the other way. We must look back at these three aspects of  
spending, taxing and borrowing, and reverse the process. We 
must cut spending but we have to be very judicious as to how we 
do it.
<P>
	Public sector unions are trying to maintain their existing wage 
structure. The reality is that the public sector unions in all 
segments of their employment are paid 20 per cent higher than 
all private sector wages.
<P>
	We have a guild system in our transportation network. These 
are things from the past, from history. We cannot afford to 
continue. Everybody, whether it is labour, business or 
government has to be part of the solution. Everybody has to 
realize that they have to accept less to make the country whole 
again.
<P>
	As well as the Reform Party, I have made some suggestions. 
We should roll back RRSPs from $12,500 to $7,500. This would 
save the government half a billion dollars a year.
<P>
	On the question of international aid, I do not think it is a 
matter of being mean. It is a matter of doing what we can afford 
as a country. Canada's foreign aid is twice as high as that of the 
United Kingdom as a percentage of our gross domestic product, 
twice as high as the United States, and a third higher than 
Australia. We simply cannot afford that degree of spending. By 
cutting foreign aid by half so it is consistent with all these other 
countries would save a billion dollars.
<P>
	We have to restructure our social programs. This is not to take 
money from the people who need it, it is to make those systems 
work more efficiently. We are not eliminating them but we are 
trying to cut those areas of abuse from the system. Over $3 
billion could be saved in this area.
<P>
	Money could be saved in the area of the CPP. We could make it 
more efficient by being more efficient in collection 
methodology. That would save a quarter of a billion dollars.
<P>
	We need a further cut of $2 billion in defence spending. By 
cutting the funding of cultural and advocacy groups a small 
amount of money, $.01 billion could be saved. Agricultural 
subsidies are another area that we are going to have to cut. We 
just cannot afford it, a billion dollars.
<P>
	I looked at civil service wage reductions. How we are going to 
get them, I do not know, but the bottom line is savings of $3.6 
billion. We can make our prison system more efficient by 
making it more income sensitive, saving half a billion dollars. 
By restructuring of our transportation industry, another half 
billion dollars can be saved. That is $12.36 billion.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8497"> 8497 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I also estimate that a reduction of that magnitude will actually 
lower interest rates in Canada by 2 per cent. This will reduce 
interest on the federal government debt by a further $12 billion. 
That is a $25 billion reduction. These things are possible. These 
things are necessary. We have to do this and we have to get on 
with it.
<P>
	In conclusion, regardless of whether they are in the labour 
movement or in business all people in Canada realize we have to 
address this problem. This country can no longer continue on the 
road to wrack and ruin. We can no longer afford champagne 
when we have a beer budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> I shall be brief, Mr. Speaker, 
because I believe we are allotted only five minutes.
<P>
	One of the remarks that caught my attention in the speech of 
my hon. Liberal colleague is the one to the effect that perhaps 
civil servants are too well paid, unless I misheard because I was 
listening to the interpreters. I find this is shifting the blame onto 
someone else than oneself.
<P>
	They are the ones, the Liberals, in charge of administering 
government finance. They are the ones in charge of giving 
instructions to civil servants. As far as I know, civil servants 
listen and do as they are told. Personally, I always asked my boss 
for pay increases when I was in the private sector, but I would 
assure him at the same time that he would get his money's worth.
<P>
	The problem-and it is easy for the Liberals to put the blame 
on the civil service-is that employees are not given clear 
orders. They are not given a mission. They are not instructed to 
listen to what the public has to say. The message they get is: ``Do 
as you are told and when you get on my nerves, I will beat you 
over the head''. As I said, I think that using civil servants as 
scapegoats is cheap. They should instead be given clear 
instructions and mandates so that they can make savings. But 
you cannot put the blame on they if you did not listen to what 
they had to say earlier. This baffles me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
questions.
<P>
	The reality is there are all kinds of factors and forces within 
our economy. Needless to say in the public sector there are 
public sector unions. They have signed contractual obligations 
with the Government of Canada and the Public Service Alliance 
is also involved with the provincial governments.
<P>
	The bottom line is that some bummer contracts have been 
negotiated over the years. The government has been very 
judicious at trying to reduce the civil service by way of attrition. 
It is not working in the sense that it is not working nearly fast 
enough for what we need to do to make us more efficient.
<P>
	We have to look at all aspects of government spending. This is 
very much on the government's agenda, that is not necessarily 
rolling back public sector wages but to negotiate with the unions 
a more effective and efficient civil service.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems like only yesterday that we were sitting here listening to 
the finance minister presenting the very first budget of this new 
government. It brings home the fact that there is precious little 
time left between now and the next budget.
<P>
	The motion of this debate is that Parliament take note of the 
views of Canadians on the fiscal situation in giving advice to the 
finance minister and to the government of the day in developing 
the 1995 budget.
<P>
	I know that many of us are out there consulting with our 
constituents. For the first time in the history of this country 
consultations on the budget are taking place not behind closed 
doors but in open and in public. In every corner of this land we 
hope to engage Canadians in addressing the fiscal problems we 
have, in addressing what kind of country they want and how 
much they are prepared to pay for it. In my view this is the way 
to do a budget.

	I had what would be the first stage of input to the 1995 budget 
in Ottawa West several weeks ago when we held a consultation 
on the social programs review. The message that came out of 
that consultation which was attended by over 150 people was 
very clearly a budget message. The message was that yes, they 
are aware of the fiscal problems of the country. Yes, they want a 
sounder, economic situation for our country, but they want 
fairness above all and a country that is still committed to those 
values of sharing, of fairness, of compassion and of shared 
responsibility for the collective well-being and for the 
well-being of fellow citizens.
<P>
	All of us have been receiving much input from our 
constituents as the media has speculated about measures that 
might possibly be taken in the budget. Therefore I certainly want 
to share with this House and with the finance minister what I 
have heard from my constituents and the specific messages 
around that fundamental message I am hearing.
<P>
	People are very much aware of the fiscal situation we are 
facing. In the Liberal red book we said very explicitly that any 
responsible government has to have the goal of a zero deficit. 
We felt it was a responsible target to commit ourselves to reach 3 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8498"> 8498 </A></B>
<P>
per cent of GDP, that is, cutting the deficit in half compared with 
our GDP in the first three years of our mandate, by 1997. That is 
the goal we set and that is the goal we intend to reach.
<P>
	I will spend a couple of minutes on why it is important that we 
do that. For the people I am hearing from in Ottawa West certain 
things are important to them about this country's programs and 
values.
<P>
	The fact is that the debt and deficit restrict our ability to move 
our nation forward and to build our economic prosperity. Right 
now close to one-third of every dollar we spend is being spent 
just to pay interest on the debt. That is money we do not have for 
other things that are important not only to the Canada of today 
but to the Canada of our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	Let me talk a bit more about some specific issues people have 
been bringing to my attention. They realize that this level of 
debt and this level of interest payment on our debt restrict the 
sovereignty of a government. They restrict its ability to make 
decisions and to make plans for the country and for its people.
<P>
	The question then to my constituents and to every Canadian is 
as to how they want us to deal with that, which means a better 
balance between what we are spending and what we have in 
revenue. That is what we are asking Canadians. How do they 
want us to achieve that balance?
<P>
	We indicated our direction clearly in the last budget where 
cuts in spending were five times the increases in revenue. Those 
increases were achieved on the revenue side by getting rid of 
perceived special treatment for certain groups in society.
<P>
	I want to express the concern that we not make decisions that 
look good in the short term but that impact on our ability to be 
strong economically in the long term. I am very concerned that 
we not harm our scientific and research base to the point where 
we may look better in this year's budget and in the budgets for 
the next few years, but we are starting to undermine our ability 
to have jobs 10 years from now.
<P>
	I want to make sure we are not cutting back in areas now that 
are feeding the economic growth of the small and medium sized 
businesses. They provide 85 per cent of the new jobs in this 
country. I want to make sure we are not cutting back on our 
ability and our contribution to the development of countries 
around this globe that are our future customers if they can 
develop their economies and if they can develop their 
democratic systems of government.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Above all I want to make sure we are not cutting back on the 
development of our most important resource: the talent of our 
young men and women, the young boys and girls who will 
become our young men and women.
<P>
	Fairness is a strong theme I hear. People want to know that 
everybody is paying their fair share. They want to know that 
they are not being targeted for cuts in benefits they now enjoy 
while others continue to get away with not paying their fair 
share into the pot from which we all benefit.
<P>
	Seniors are particularly concerned. A very large proportion of 
them live in Ottawa West. They want to remind this House that 
old age security and the Canada pension plan are not charity and 
are not welfare. I read the debates again from the fifties when the 
old age security was implemented. It very specifically said that 
this pension is a right of citizenship and everybody is going to 
pay on their income tax for that pension. They did that and they 
continue to do it.
<P>
	A few years ago it was rolled into the general tax rate, but it is 
still there, a special payment for old age security. That is a 
pension people have paid for. They want me to remind this 
House and our government how much they have sacrificed, the 
hardships they have put up with, the things they did without, to 
take responsibility for providing for their own retirement. They 
want me to remind this House that we owe a debt to them, a debt 
of gratitude and a debt for the quality of life we have in this 
country.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about the public service as my colleague 
before me has done. I remind the House that we could cancel the 
whole public service tomorrow and we would still have a huge 
deficit and a huge debt. We could cut all government spending 
on the actual operating of government tomorrow and it would 
not take care of our deficit and debt problem.
<P>
	Everybody who works for the public service knows we are 
going through a tremendous period of change. They know that 
period of change will certainly mean changes in jobs and a 
smaller public service. Again we have to be sure that we are not 
targeting specific segments of our society, including the public 
service, to bear an unfair portion of the burden that belongs to all 
of us as Canadians.
<P>
	We want to continue to reaffirm the value of government 
services across this country. They are the kind of services that 
keep our transportation and food supply safe, that keep goods 
and services moving across this country and without which we 
would not have an economy.
<P>
	In the few seconds I have left I also want to say that above all 
my constituents want to keep reminding us that the best way to 
solve our debt and deficit problem is to have more Canadians 
working, more Canadians employed and contributing to the 
economy instead of requiring the assistance of their 
communities and their society.
<P>
	They do not want us to lose sight, as we have not done, that our 
main target is jobs and economic growth, that fiscal 
responsibility is part of that but so is social responsibility. We 
should not solve our fiscal deficit by creating a social deficit. 
They remind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8499"> 8499 </A></B>
<P>
me and I remind the House that disparity is growing in this 
country, not decreasing. Those who are well off, those for whom 
the Reform Party seems to speak are better off than they have 
ever been. It is below that where everybody is a little worse off. 
That means our country is worse off.
<P>
	Like the constituents I have spoken with, and I will be 
speaking with many more when we hold another consultation on 
the budget specifically on December 11, I wish the finance 
minister the best of wisdom in the deliberations he has ahead of 
him. I wish him above all an open ear to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the comments by the deputy whip. I wish to draw my colleague's 
attention to a point: she talked about the finance minister's 
budget, about the red book's objective of 3 per cent of GDP. She 
repeated what people in her riding told her. I would like to 
remind her that someone in my riding said that the Liberal 
Party's objective of 3 per cent of GDP was like being in a sinking 
ship and worrying about peeling paint.
<P>
	With this comparison in mind, my question to my colleague is 
this: What does she think of the lifeline thrown by Premier 
Jacques Parizeau regarding areas of overlap? There are firm 
proposals on manpower training, so that we can make rational 
use of your surplus public servants. What do you think of 
transferring job training to the provinces? That is a nice lifeline.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague knows full well 
that we are carrying out a full review of federal government 
programs and how we deliver them to Canadians. One of the 
goals of our review is certainly to identify duplication and 
overlap and reduce problems in this area, because it is indeed a 
form of waste when two levels of government deal with the same 
problems and programs.
<P>
	Although my approach to the division of responsibilities 
would be different from that of my colleague, we are certainly 
trying, in co-operation with all the provinces in the country, to 
rationalize services in order to reduce overlap and duplication.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask my hon. colleague her definition of the 
relationship between the increasing debt load and the level of 
employment. If there is such a relationship in her mind, how is it 
affected by the fact that the target of 3 per cent really does not 
eliminate the debt load? It is increasing the debt load.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are members in this House 
who have different levels of private wealth or income. I 
represent people who earn different levels of income. The 
ability to borrow, the kind of mortgage you can carry and afford 
depends on your income and wealth. It is the same with a 
country. That is why we have chosen to express our debt and 
deficit target in terms of the GNP, which is the wealth of the 
nation.
<P>
	Obviously if you have an income of $100,000 you can afford a 
different kind of mortgage and can afford to borrow and pay 
more for a car than if you have an  income of $20,000. It is that 
simple. That is why linking what is an appropriate target for 
reduction of debt and deficit to the GDP is a proper way of doing 
it.
<P>
	I will answer the question, but not quite in the way I think the 
member wanted an answer. I believe very firmly that in large 
measure the debt and deficit have risen because of our declining 
level of employment in this country. It has been increased by 
major steps over several decades. Clearly if there are 10 people 
contributing to paying for a project, it is more expensive for 
each one of those 10 than if there are 20 people contributing to 
pay for the same project.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike 
my colleagues, I am not too pleased to speak on Motion No. 17, 
because for me it is a waste of time. This motion is mainly about 
tabling a committee report. Imagine the time we take while 
people, taxpayers, Canadians are worried and unemployed and 
have no solutions. What Canadians and Quebecers want is a 
government that acts, a government that will present programs 
and do things to put people back to work and give them some 
pride. That is what Canadians expect of us.
<P>
	Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. I forgot to tell you at the beginning 
that I was sharing my time with my colleague.
<P>
	In the present economic situation, of course, the debt is $150 
billion-everyone says so and condemns it. Everyone knows the 
cuts that could be made when preparing a shopping list but no 
one ever makes them. We are not presented with anything to do 
it. When facing such an economic situation, of course they want 
to hide and above all they want to avoid debating the 
government's finances.
<P>
	Why? I ask you why they want to avoid this debate. It is time. 
The people have been consulted. It is time to come up with 
something.
<P>
	Are we ashamed of the budgetary policies that they want to 
bring in to control the deficit? Are they ashamed to apply them? 
Of course I would be ashamed to hold phony pre-budget 
consultations, if my budget strategy, already established in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8500"> 8500 </A></B>
<P>
advance, was to reduce the deficit on the backs of the poor, 
welfare recipients, the unemployed and especially students and 
to slash transfers to the provinces. This is what the Liberal 
government wants to do, but it does not dare to put it on the table 
for discussion. It holds phony consultations. It wants to limit 
debate so as not to make too many waves.
<P>
	The government set a target for deficit reduction of $39.7 
billion. This same government also says that a change of policy 
is needed to put its finances back in order. This government's 
budget policy has three main thrusts: economic recovery, 
attacking the poor and cutting transfers to the provinces, as I 
shall explain.
<P>
	On the subject of economic recovery, the Minister of Finance 
says that 80 per cent of the federal deficit is structural. The fact 
that it is structural means that the deficit has nothing to do with 
the current economic conditions, or with the unemployed. 
Contrary to what this government thinks, Quebecers and 
Canadians are faced with a structural unemployment problem 
and they are not out of work by choice.
<P>
	The Liberals sincerely believe that a large proportion of 
jobless people are lazy and are unemployed by choice. The 
Liberals also think that they will stimulate employment by 
forcing many unemployed individuals to look, and I emphasize 
the word look, for work. Yet, jobless people constantly come to 
our constituency offices to find out about programs. But these 
programs are in a state of chaos. Employment centres cannot 
keep up with the demand for work. The fact is that our 
unemployed are energetic and more than willing to work. It is 
the structure which is at fault.
<P>
	The government's policy consists in targeting the poor by 
making cuts in social programs. The government wants to cut 
$7.5 billion in the budget allocated to these programs. However, 
it will not eliminate the deficit by targeting the poor. Instead of 
making thoughtless cuts through their social program reform, 
the Liberals should define clear and specific objectives, and 
they should also develop a job-creation policy, as they promised 
they would in their red book and during the last election 
campaign. They have failed miserably on this one. Indeed, they 
only managed to create a few temporary jobs through the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government also wants to reduce the deficit by 
making unilateral cuts, with no compensation, in transfer 
payments to the provinces. The Minister of Finance is once 
again passing the buck to the provinces. The debt will not go 
away by depriving the provinces of $2.6 billion. Other solutions 
are needed to eliminate that debt, as well as the deficit.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance keeps asking us for suggestions. We 
say that the time has come to eliminate duplication and 
overlapping with the provinces. Ottawa must withdraw from 
those sectors which fall under provincial jurisdiction, and it 
must compensate the provinces accordingly. Eliminating 
federal interference will translate into savings of $3 billion for 
Quebec alone. Moreover, Quebec would finally be able to devise 
its own integrated policy regarding job creation, a policy that 
would really answer the needs of Quebec men and women.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the Minister of 
Finance when he says that the deficit cannot be eliminated 
simply by cutting government spending. This is why we have 
made fair and equitable proposals that would lead to savings of 
$34.5 billion. These proposals should be taken seriously by the 
government, because they are far above the $25.6 billion 
savings that the government wants to realize at the expense of 
the neediest, mostly by cutting unemployment insurance and 
transfer payments to the provinces for education.
<P>
	The Liberal government should draw up a budget which 
would focus on cuts in government spending and in subsidies to 
companies which do not undertake to create jobs, in its deficit 
reduction measures. Programs should be managed more 
efficiently, that is to say we should have sound management of 
business subsidies. We should stop giving money to companies 
which are neither productive nor competitive, money which is 
very often a form of patronage. We are talking about $3.3 billion 
here. It is high time that the minister and his government look 
squarely at the problem and stop dumping their problems on the 
provinces.
<P>
	The red book promises jobs, and the Liberal government must 
adopt concrete job creation policies to bring us back to 
pre-recession employment levels. We need close to 825,000 
new jobs, a far cry from the 45,000 temporary jobs they created 
during the past year. They still have a long way to go.
<P>
	Let the government keep another one of its promises: not to 
raise taxes. To this end, the time has come to review certain tax 
loopholes enjoyed by high-income earners and big 
corporations. We all know in this House that family trusts, 
which are an important tool used in tax planning, are for the 
government a source of losses we can assess. According to some 
tax experts, they amount to several hundreds of millions of 
dollars.
<P>
	The government has the tools to disclose the value of the 
assets in these trusts. Let the government tell us how much 
money is lost in tax revenues. This question was raised on 
several occasions in different committees. We never got an 
answer. But above all, let the government be true to its position 
when it was in the opposition, when it opposed delaying 
payment of taxes on capital gains until the death of the last 
beneficiary.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The finance minister and his government must come forward 
and say how they intend to deal with the nation's finances. Let 
them stop procrastinating and let us start tackling immediately 
one of the most pressing problems for our future, namely public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8501"> 8501 </A></B>
<P>
finance. This is the reason why the Bloc Quebecois is going to 
vote against the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the presentation made by my hon. colleague from the 
opposition. In his remarks, he attacks the federal government on 
the grounds that apparently, the federal government does not 
work in co-operation with the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, this is exactly what this government is doing. With the 
Minister responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs, we are 
presently reviewing all federal programs to find out the best way 
of delivering these programs. If, for example, it turns out that 
the provinces are the ones in the best position to look after a 
given program, this program will be transferred to the 
provinces. If the most appropriate level of government is the 
municipal level, then the program will be transferred to the 
municipalities. That is how this program review works.
<P>
	As for federal transfer payments, the problem we used to have 
in the past is that the provinces did not know from one year to the 
next how much they would be getting from the federal 
government. Our government has assured the provinces that 
arrangements will be negotiated to cover more than a year, at 
least five years, so that the provinces will know in advance how 
much they will receive from the federal government.
<P>
	I can assure my colleague that, when he talks about education, 
whether the money comes from the federal, provincial or 
municipal government, the money all comes from the same 
place, out of the same taxpayers' pockets.
<P>
	Social services programs do not require additional funding, 
but the system certainly needs to be simplified. Efficiency has to 
be improved and money spent more wisely, especially in 
education, where we spent $50 billion each year. This is more 
than in almost any other country in the world. All these 
programs must be assessed to ensure adequate program delivery. 
We must make sure that essential services, national services, 
remain national essential services. That is why a review is 
necessary.
<P>
	If my colleague wants the federal government to introduce 
new programs, he is going to have to tell us where to get the 
money. However, the idea is not to turn off the tap, as our 
colleagues from the Reform Party are suggesting, and leave all 
existing programs as they are. How can one eliminate the deficit 
in this manner? They have yet to bring forth in this House a 
single proposal as to how they plan to eliminate the deficit 
within three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. I am quite pleased 
with the comment that my colleague just made. He is ready to 
transfer programs to the provincial governments. They are 
analyzing them and want to disperse them either to the 
provincial or to the municipal level.
<P>
	That is what Quebec has been asking for for a long time; that 
is what Quebec has been telling you for a long  time, to eliminate 
duplication and return jurisdiction to Quebec and also to the 
other provinces. We quite agree on that.
<P>
	Except that this government is not facing up to its 
responsibilities. Why? Because it is not making any decisions in 
this area. It is indecisive. Make some decisions and tell us what 
field of jurisdiction you want to return to Quebec and to the 
other provinces. That is what we want to do here.
<P>
	The Liberal government should table a list of programs where 
overlapping is very expensive so that these programs can be 
administered directly by the provinces concerned. Do it and 
table it so that we can discuss it as soon as possible. Quebec 
could save $3.3 billion as a result. That is one reason we want a 
sovereign country.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, before giving the floor 
to the member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, I must inform the House of the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment: the hon. member 
for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Northern Tax Allowance; 
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast-CRTC.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for someone who did not feel like speaking to 
Motion No. 17, my hon. colleague from Chicoutimi has 
delivered quite a passionate speech.
<P>
	I, for one, am pleased to speak to this motion, which I would 
like to read for the benefit of the Canadians who are listening to 
us. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the opinions expressed by Canadians on the 
budgetary policy of the government and, notwithstanding the provisions of 
Standing Order 83.1, authorize the Standing Committee on Finance to make a 
report or reports thereon no later than December 7, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The committee was supposed to table this report on December 
2. The motion under consideration asks us to authorize the 
committee to postpone this report until a later date. This will 
reduce the time allocated for consideration of this report. It is an 
old magic trick involving reducing the attention span of those 
who should be looking at this report, that is, the people of this 
country. This is one of the numerous magic tricks being used by 
the government to hide from citizens what they should see. Let 
me give you a specific example, a simple magic trick now being 
performed by the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8502"> 8502 </A></B>
<P>
	We know how magic tricks are done in general. We know how 
they are performed but we still get fooled, so I will explain 
again for the benefit of the people. Magic tricks are always 
simple: the magician hides with the right hand what he wants 
to hide while moving his left hand to draw the public's 
attention. That is why people do not see what is really 
happening. What is the government holding in its right hand? 
Things that are totally amazing.
<P>
	First of all, every year, the Auditor General of Canada tells us 
about the shameful waste of billions of taxpayers' dollars. Every 
year, it is the same story: we talk about it for two or three days 
before shelving these reports, then the cycle repeats itself.
<P>
	There is also the issue of overlap, which my hon. colleague 
tackled just before me. The inefficiency cost of this overlap of 
federal and provincial programs was estimated at $3 billion per 
year in Quebec alone.
<P>
	What lies under the right hand? Family trusts, where we find 
enormous amounts of tax-exempt money that the federal 
government refuses to disclose. There is no way to find out how 
much money is involved.
<P>
	We also have tax havens. On this subject, in 1992, the Auditor 
General pointed out that many big companies had invested some 
$16 billion worth of profits in tax havens around the world, thus 
avoiding payment of their fair share of taxes. We are not talking 
about peanuts but about $16,000 million.
<P>
	The right hand also hides smuggling rings whose traffic in 
cigarettes, alcohol, guns and drugs amounts to several billions 
of dollars every year. They are apparently unable to solve this 
problem.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Auditor General has just told us about $6.6 
billion in uncollected taxes.
<P>
	Then there is the issue raised by the Liberal member for 
Gander-Grand Falls, who just wrote to the minister, to the 
effect that Canadian companies use a forward averaging 
provision to defer the payment of $40 billion in taxes.
<P>
	In his letter, the hon. member also mentions that 1,200 
companies with profits of over one million dollars do not pay 
taxes.
<P>
	Then there is the Hibernia project. Huge amounts of money 
are poured into this project which will never be a profitable 
venture, and the government tries to keep that a secret.
<P>
	There are also more mundane current issues such as the 
situation of CN's president, Mr. Paul Tellier.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Tellier, whose annual salary is $345,000 and who made 
cuts in CN services to streamline that corporation, received, on 
top of a $52,000 yearly allowance for petty expenses, an 
interest-free loan of $432,000 to buy a house, all this at 
taxpayers' expense. It goes without saying that Mr. Tellier's 
case is another issue which this government does not want to 
publicize too much. This is what the right hand is doing.
<P>
	Then there is the case of Gary Anstey, which was discussed 
today and yesterday, during question period. After four months 
on the job, Mr. Anstey, who was executive assistant to the 
Minister of Fisheries, received a severance pay of $31,000. Mr. 
Anstey was rehired last month at a salary of $93,000 per year. He 
kept the severance pay, even though he voluntarily quit his job.
<P>
	As you know, people who have a job and who voluntarily 
leave that job do not get any UI benefits. Yet, the executive 
assistant of the Minister of Fisheries got $31,000 from 
taxpayers. Fishermen in the Gaspe Peninsula certainly have the 
right to wonder who the real suckers are.
<P>
	Then there is Operation William Tell, during which the 
Canadian Armed Forces had a good time in Florida, from 
October 10 to 23, 1994, with artillery pieces worth $395,000 
each. Always in Florida; all this sun is good for the army. There 
is also a statement made by Mr. Yves Séguin, a prominent tax 
expert and a former minister in the Bourassa government, who 
said, not long ago: ``In 48 hours, I would get $3 billion for the 
federal government by imposing a two per cent tax on shares''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the left hand is getting a lot of exercise. They 
have to explain to the public what they are going to do to deal 
with the problem of our public finances which are, as you know, 
in a parlous state. It seems that the real problem in Canada, and 
the Prime Minister said so himself, is those beer drinkers 
slumped in front of their television sets, people who are totally 
unproductive. This includes all those unproductive people who 
lost their jobs at Hyundai, at CN, at CP, at MIL Davie in Lauzon, 
the refineries in Montreal, fishermen in the Gaspé who cannot 
go fishing any more because there are no fish, and miners who 
cannot go down into the mines because the money is being used 
to operate mines in Chile or somewhere else. So all these people 
are drinking beer in front of their TVs and that is where the cuts 
are going to be made.
<P>
	They are going to traipse all over Canada, the MPs, the press, 
the media and they are going to ask people: ``What do you think 
is the best way to cut these people's benefits?'' They will cut 
unemployment insurance, cut welfare benefits, raise students' 
tuition fees, cut transfer payments to the provinces. They keep 
waving their left hand but never say what the right hand is doing.
<P>
	Meanwhile, our social fabric is starting to unravel. People 
feel somewhat frustrated. So, as we saw yesterday in Toronto 
and as we saw not so long ago in western Canada, people are 
starting to fill the halls every time they organize meetings of 
committees on social programs. People are invading the halls 
and taking over the meetings from their members. They are 
saying: ``Now you are going to listen to us''. There is a basic 
feeling of frustration.

	We also had students who demonstrated here on the Hill, at 
least 10,000 of them, and they told us they were not prepared 
to pay for the sins of others and pay the full shot, on top of that. 
These may not be huge demonstrations, but I may remind you, 
and you were probably there, that huge demonstrations are not 
necessarily the most effective ones. I remember an 
extraordinary demonstration held on Parliament Hill a few 
years ago, a demonstration by one person. This person went to 
the Prime Minister at the time, the Hon. Brian Mulroney, and 
told him: ``If you touch our pensions, Brian, goodbye Charlie 
Brown!'' That sent a shiver through the government. So I hope 
we will not be hearing that on the Hill.
<P>
	Of course, some people are prepared to explain how this trick 
works, and they actually do that. There are at least two Liberal 
members, the hon. member for York South-Weston, for 
instance, who told us that for ten years they were in the 
opposition and they condemned what the Conservatives wanted 
to do, which was to cut the deficit at the expense of the most 
vulnerable. That is exactly what they are doing. I may remind 
you that the hon. member for York South-Weston is not a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois. He is a Liberal member. There 
was also the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls, to whom I 
referred earlier, who at the end of his letter to the minister gave 
an excellent summary of our proposal, and he put it in these 
words: As you can see, you can get the billions you need simply 
by collecting taxes owing by the corporations that are making 
the biggest profits and do not pay taxes. That is also the position 
of the Bloc, and we will vote against the motion.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am somewhat surprised to hear the Bloc, the opposition, say the 
same thing over and over. They keep saying that this deficit 
reduction effort will be at the expense of the disadvantaged, yet 
they have no positive alternative plan to reduce this deficit we 
are faced with.
<P>
	I would have a question for the hon. member. I would like him 
to suggest some truly specific ways of bringing the deficit down 
to three per cent of the gross national product, as we have 
promised to do and the Minister of Finance fully intends to do. I 
would really like him to tell us how exactly, within our global 
budget, as relates to social programs in particular, we could 
manage to streamline this deficit we are struggling with at 
present.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are all ears.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just given a ten minute 
speech on the subject. I do not know if my hon. colleague paid 
close attention to what was said.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Of course I did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Let me simply read this specific suggestion 
back to her, a suggestion coming from the Liberals themselves, 
from the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls: go and get the 
$9 billion you need  in the pockets of those who do not pay their 
taxes. Start there and see what will happen after that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary has 
30 seconds to ask a question or make a comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the 
hon. member did not answer my colleague's questions. We have 
put forth a proposal through the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, to receive feedback from the public. We would 
like to know what the Bloc has to suggest.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has approximately 
30 seconds to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, here is a suggestion, the 
simplest one I can find in here: give us the exact amount, the 
exact current amount, of capital invested in family trusts in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to participate in this debate.
<P>
	I intended to review some of the background of the 
consultation process but in view of the drift of the debate in the 
House I want to speak about specifics.
<P>
	I would at least like to highlight some of the principles that 
the finance minister has articulated to the members of the House 
and to the Canadian public. He said that in approaching our 
budget for this year deficit reduction indeed is part of our 
overall strategy for jobs and for economic growth. He also 
stressed that fairness is paramount so that the most vulnerable in 
our society will not be left behind.
<P>
	I think it is an extremely important part of the budgetary 
process to ensure that whether it is the social security review, the 
review of our social safety net, or whether indeed it is part of the 
budgetary measures, we are constantly going to focus on the 
needs of those who are most needy in our society first.
<P>
	He also said that the deficit reduction must be selective and 
strategic, clearly reflecting our priorities. He said that 
budgetary action should weigh on the side of cuts in 
expenditures and not, and I stress not, on increased taxes.
<P>
	Finally he said that the economic assumptions must be 
prudent to stimulate confidence so that our deficit targets would 
in fact be achieved. As you know, Mr. Speaker, a problem of 
former governments was setting targets that never were 
achieved.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I commend to all members and all Canadians the book 
<I>Canada's Economy: What Past, What Future?</I> This workbook 
which has been prepared by the Canadian Foundation for 
Economic Education is available to all Canadians in all public 
places; post offices, grocery stores, et cetera, and even through

<P>
their members of Parliament. I find, having gone through this a 
couple of times, that this is an excellent layman's language 
discussion on the kinds of issues that the government is  
addressing today in dealing with the challenges of balancing our 
budget over the coming years.
<P>
	In the last couple of hours there has been quite a bit of 
discussion about whether or not the deficit should be eliminated 
in three years, whether it should be five years or whether it 
should be ever. These, as members well know, are the same 
discussions that went on during the last election campaign. I 
think that the Canadian people made their choice, a very clear 
choice.
<P>
	Members may recall that the Conservative government 
proposed that it was going to eliminate the deficit in five years. 
The Reform Party said it would do it in three years. It was almost 
like a bidding war. The Prime Minister said during the election 
campaign that we have to be realistic, picking targets which are 
achievable within the time frames that are available to the 
government.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made a commitment in his election 
platform that his government would achieve a deficit reduction 
strategy which would achieve 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 
the third year of the mandate. We are on target now. The minister 
has assured the House and Canadians that we will continue to 
introduce whatever changes are necessary to make sure that we 
stay on track and that we meet that target.
<P>
	That means that by the end of the third year our deficit will 
reduce to some $25 billion. That is only an interim target. By the 
time that third year is over and we have hit that $25 billion target 
Canadians will have before them a further strategic plan for the 
next period to balance the budget for Canada.
<P>
	Yet today the leader of the third party comes again to the 
House and reiterates: ``We could do it in three years: We could 
slash that deficit''.
<P>
	I was at the finance committee when the Reform Party 
presented its program. I was astounded that of the $40 billion 
deficit the Reformers just said: ``Here is our plan''. They started 
off saying that $18 billion of the $40 billion deficit was going to 
be eliminated by economic growth. That has absolutely nothing 
to do with the Reform Party. It has to do with the initiatives that 
have been taken within our country to ensure that we stimulate 
economic growth in Canada. The Reform Party is somehow 
taking credit for some $18 billion reduction in the deficit.
<P>
	The Reformers then went through a mathematical exercise to 
identify areas where they would cut. Not one explanation, not 
one rationale of how that would impact on the delivery of the 
services of those areas that they were going to cut; not one 
analysis or statement as to the impact on jobs for Canadians; 
indeed, not one indication of what that might do to the economic 
confidence that Canada has been developing over this period 
since the election.
<P>
	The Prime Minister yesterday said in the House, and I quote: 
``If tomorrow we were to eliminate the deficit, $42 billion to 
zero, there would be a huge recession in Canada. The wise thing 
is to do it in a progressive way''. I  think that is the fundamental 
difference between the approach of the Reform Party and of this 
government, that we do have to keep control, we have to keep 
things in perspective.
<P>
	I want to move on because I know that my time is very short. I 
want to share with Canadians a few facts which I think they may 
find interesting as they go through their assessment of where we 
are and the kinds of things that we should do. One of the key 
areas in which Canada would like to make progress and our 
budget would intend, and indeed our social security review, is to 
help Canadians to acquire skills. We have to help Canadians 
acquire skills to get jobs, to keep jobs and to find better jobs.
<P>
	As Canadians know there has been much debate and much 
discussion about potential cuts in funding for post-secondary 
education. I want to share some figures.
<P>
	Last year there was a 19 per cent growth in jobs for those who 
had a post-secondary education. At the same time there was a 17 
per cent decrease in jobs for those who did not have a 
post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	All of the experts say that over the next decade 45 per cent of 
all new jobs will require a post-secondary education. The 
government has included these facts, figures and initiatives in 
its priorities because our young people who are now in school 
must be given every incentive and opportunity to continue their 
education. We do not want them to be sitting on the curb 
watching the rest of Canadians go by.
<P>
	During the 1990 to 1993 period, 190,000 jobs were lost during 
the recession. However, if we look very carefully at how that is 
composed, we find that 640,000 jobs were lost for Canadians 
who had a high school education or less. Offsetting that, 450,000 
jobs were gained during the recession by those who had a 
post-secondary education. I think that indicates to all Canadians 
how important that education component is in terms of our 
overall strategy for Canada in the coming years.
<P>
	The next area I want to share with hon. members is an analysis 
I did of taxation from 1992 as to who paid how much taxes and 
when. I found it very interesting that the top 10 per cent of 
taxpayers made $50,000 or more. That means if someone made 
more than $50,000 in 1992 they were in the top 10 per cent of 
Canadians. Interestingly enough, that top 10 per cent of Cana-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8505"> 8505 </A></B>
<P>
dians, approximately two million, contributed 32 per cent of all 
taxes paid and 44 per cent of all charitable donations.
<P>
	When people start discussing should we tax more, should we 
raise our tax rates or should we go after the rich, they should first 
understand that they are talking about people who make over 
$50,000 and there are only 10 per cent of them.
<P>
	Second, they have to understand that they already paid 32 per 
cent of all taxes and of their disposable income they are the 
major contributors to charitable donations. I find that very, very 
important to understand when we start discussing whether or not 
we should for instance cut RRSPs. At the $50,000 level one 
cannot even contribute more than $9,000 to RRSPs. Therefore, 
if the level were reduced we are basically talking about reducing 
it only for those taxpayers who are making much more than 
$50,000. Those things will have to be taken into account as we 
discuss the measures with regard to RRSPs.
<P>
	With regard to matters such as employer paid health benefits, 
that has come up. Eight million employees receive employer 
paid health benefits tax free. The fairness of that has to be 
assessed.
<P>
	Today in the newspaper it was reported that the mayor of my 
city, Mississauga, said that if the government raises taxes it is 
going to force more people into the underground economy than 
it has now. It is also going to force people to withhold taxes. I 
agree with the first statement but not with the second one.
<P>
	With regard to the underground economy, there is no question 
about that. If we make serious and tough but fair cuts as a result 
of this budget there is no question that there will be increased 
pressure on the underground economy. As a result, I believe the 
government should as part of this consultation, and I hope 
members will consider this, have a parallel defensive measure to 
ensure that there is no increased pressure on the underground 
economy.
<P>
	I have many more things to say but I will-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member says Reform is taking credit for assuming some 
$18 billion in growth. On the other hand, the hon. member says 
the economy has grown since the Liberals were elected, taking 
credit for that of course.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if he thinks that any growth in 
the economy to date is really due to the natural business cycle 
and not to the accomplishments of his Liberal Party? Surely he 
does not think that way. I would like him to try to express 
himself a little better as far as the business cycle as opposed to 
what the Liberal Party has done and forget the red book rhetoric.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am astounded that the member 
would not give some credit to what has happened in Canada 
since the election. One of the most important ingredients to 
growth in the economy is the  confidence of the Canadian 
people, of the lending community and of business.
<P>
	Three hundred and twenty-seven thousand jobs have been 
created since the government came to power. Much of that has to 
do with the confidence and credibility the Prime Minister has 
brought to political life, which the member enjoys as well. The 
hon. member should give credit where credit is due.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must agree with my colleagues in the Reform Party 
this time. The Liberal government has done nothing at all for the 
economic recovery. On the contrary. A few weeks after Mr. 
Martin tabled his first budget, interest rates shot up. That is why 
we will have to pay $2.7 billion more for interest alone.
<P>
	Not only the finance minister's credibility, but the measures 
he advocated in his first budget did not help the economic 
recovery and job creation; rather, they hurt economic growth 
and the growth of employment. If he had taken effective-I 
would say tougher-measures on February 22, more jobs would 
have been created and the financial picture would have been 
much better in the last few months.
<P>
	I ask him where the Liberal Party contributed to greater 
growth, when everyone says that it has not in the past six 
months?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member knows that the 
Government of Canada does not control global interest rates. 
The member is an economist. He knows the national debt is 
denominated in long rates, not in short. The Bank of Canada has 
influence only on the short end.
<P>
	He is somehow suggesting the government has not done 
anything with regard to those rates. He is living in a fantasy 
world that somehow the government flips switches to make 
things happen. He knows interest rates have risen and are higher 
than the assumptions that were included in the finance 
minister's previous budget.
<P>
	The finance minister has made corrections to ensure he meets 
his targets. That is responsible government. The finance 
minister understands the economy much better than the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with considerable pride that I stand in the House today to make 
my submission to the first significant prebudget consultation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8506"> 8506 </A></B>
<P>
process in Canadian history. On behalf of the constituents of 
Vancouver South I want to thank the Minister of Finance for this 
opportunity to express our views.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that there continues to be a 
tremendous amount of confidence within my riding for the 
Liberal plan for reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 
1996-97.
<P>
	As many have remarked in the House before, this 3 per cent 
target serves as one of the major benchmarks for entry into the 
European Union. It is also a target that has not been achieved in 
Canada in 20 years. Still there are those on the opposition 
benches who continue to argue this 3 per cent target is not tough 
enough.
<P>
	What is indisputable is that the Liberal government made a 
promise to the Canadian people on October 26, 1993. We 
promised Canadians we would meet this target within the 
specified time. Then we would begin our ultimate objective, the 
complete elimination of the deficit. I would like to quote the 
Minister of Finance: ``Come hell or high water we will meet this 
promise to Canadians''.
<P>
	Recently the Reform Party attempted to bring some 
credibility to its original zero in three claim, which I know is 
very difficult for it to do. I am glad that today the leader of the 
Reform Party has changed that zero in three to zero in five, to do 
it in five years. He is learning that our goal is much more 
rational and balanced. He has moved from a zero in three 
approach to a zero in five. I ask my colleagues to check the 
record.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party have outlined a remarkably 
vague and draconian plan to cut a number of government 
programs. All one has to do is read the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> which 
is often quoted on the other side to understand about what has 
been brought forward.
<P>
	This plan along with the announcement of more brutal cuts to 
come to programs like post-secondary education and old age 
pensions demonstrates what I will call the half-marble approach 
to deficit reduction, an approach that only deals with half of the 
whole solution. Dealing with the deficit in Canada requires a 
two-sided approach: decreasing government expenditures by 
streamlining programs and services and increasing government 
revenues by promoting a healthy and vibrant economy.
<P>
	Trying to solve Canada's economic problems through 
extracting $25 billion from the economy in two years without 
any plan for economic growth is like trying to roll half a marble. 
Like the marble, it is an idea that will not go very far.
<P>
	Further, anyone who believes that government revenues will 
not be seriously diminished through a plan which, while cutting 
regional development spending, also cuts Canada's social 
security system is not only trying to roll half a marble but is not 
playing with all the marbles.
<P>
	If members take a moment to look at the plan of the 
Reform-I do not know from where it gets its economics-it 
thinks that by cutting $42 billion over three years that will 
somehow create great confidence in the economy and will create 
jobs. Then everybody will be  spending money and we will get a 
tremendous amount of growth. The Reform Party has a lot to 
learn. What we are presenting is a much more balanced and 
rational approach. Canadians see that.
<P>
	Recently I took the question of how to solve some of Canada's 
economic problems back to small business owners in my riding 
through the venue of a public policy forum. I would like to share 
some of their valuable ideas with the House today.
<P>
	Overall, my constituents have requested that the budget 
continue to reflect the commitment of the government to 
promoting the health and growth of Canada's small business 
community. I am sure all my colleagues would agree with that.
<P>
	With regard to access to capital, my constituents feel that the 
federal government should introduce strong measures to ensure 
that Canadian financial institutions are more equitable and 
accountable to small business owners.
<P>
	With regard to federal deficits, my constituents feel that the 
federal government should do everything possible to find areas 
of waste and overlap, duplication and extravagance and 
eliminate them immediately. I know I will get lots of support 
from the other side on that issue. In terms of government 
expenditures on programs and services, there is considerable 
support among my constituents for the extensive program by 
program review currently under way.
<P>
	With regard to taxation, they felt that the federal government 
should begin reducing the tax burden on average Canadians 
through a reduction in personal income taxes. It should begin 
harmonizing and simplifying the tax system so as to decrease 
administrative costs, expensive paper burden and overall 
taxation. It should lower payroll taxes through savings made 
through the UIC system. It should give serious consideration to 
the recommendation made by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business and supported by the region's small 
business working committee to increase the small business tax 
deduction to $400,000 from $200,000.
<P>
	As I have noted before, this measure has not been adjusted 
since 1982 when it was first introduced and should be increased 
to the rate of inflation.
<P>
	With regard to the most effective role for government, small 
business owners stated that they want their governments to offer 
a hand up not a hand out. They feel that the best route to take is 
not through grants, subsidies and expensive tax deductions, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8507"> 8507 </A></B>
<P>
through addressing wide ranging concerns such as 
interprovincial barriers and global trade.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	They feel that government should promote a healthy business 
environment with low taxes and minimal regulations and that 
they should support the business sector in meeting their own 
needs in job training and knowledge networks.
<P>
	They feel that the federal government should target 
businesses operated by Canadians with special needs but should 
do so by reallocating current budget expenditures, not by 
making further expenditures.
<P>
	With regard to women in small business, my constituents feel 
that the federal government should give serious consideration to 
a system of affordable national day care, allowing more women 
the freedom to begin small businesses. This can be done either 
directly through the federal government or with government 
support. They feel that the federal government should find ways 
of offering training which will help female entrepreneurs get 
started and expand their business operations.
<P>
	In conclusion, there was a reason I went to my constituents for 
their advice. I knew the government was listening to Canadians. 
For the first time in Canadian history a government has gone to 
the people for their input on the budget before the budget is 
introduced. For the first time the government is making a 
genuine attempt to include Canadians in the decision making 
process that will affect them. These prebudget consultations, 
like the other extensive government consultations currently 
under way, are part of the Liberal election promise to do things 
differently, to make government more inclusive and to make 
government more responsive.
<P>
	We promised to listen to Canadians and that is exactly what 
we are doing. I am proud to be a part of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to talk in terms of marbles to the hon. member. I 
could say he has lost some but he has not. He is talking some of 
the talk but that is really all it is. I want to ask him a question 
about the infrastructure program.
<P>
	The government is faced with a $40 billion deficit. One of the 
answers to resolve this situation is to create an infrastructure 
program. The infrastructure program uses $2 billion tax dollars 
from the municipal level, which the municipality gets by taxing 
people on their residences and so on. Then the infrastructure 
program uses another $2 billion from the provincial government 
which it gets from the same taxpayer. Then the federal 
government throws in $2 billion to make $6 billion. It all comes 
from the same taxpayer.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to explain the logic of another 
$6 billion out of the taxpayers' pocket as a positive influence in 
trying to balance a budget of $40 billion deficit a year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague for a very good question. There is a very good answer 
for that question.
<P>
	Some time last year I was in Singapore and I had an 
opportunity to look at some of its infrastructure program. As 
many members know, Singapore has been a miracle of economic 
development over the past few decades. It is a model that other 
countries have looked at.
<P>
	The reason that country has been so successful is because it 
has an incredible infrastructure program. It had a vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member a quick question. I have not heard 
any response other than the fact that we are going to meet this 
goal that is so easy to achieve, of 3 per cent of GDP. Three years 
from now we will only have a $25 billion deficit at which time 
we can bring in new ideas and all that sort of thing.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The IMF, the <I>Globe</I> and many economists nationwide 
indicated recently that it was not nearly good enough, that it was 
going to be a failure. They do not seem to read the newspaper or 
they do not pay attention to what they read. It is one or the other.
<P>
	There does not seem to be any mention of the fact that in three 
years the debt is going to be another $100 billion deeper in the 
hole. They do not seem to take into account that the interest on 
the debt will go from $40 billion a year to probably $50 billion a 
year, unless interest rates keep going the way they are.
<P>
	I would like the member to address the future in that sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my hon. colleague 
that the debt is going to increase. However, we have to make 
sure that we deal with the deficit before we can deal with the 
debt issue. That is what we are doing in a reasonable, common 
sense approach.
<P>
	If we say we will do it within a year, I guess if we cut every 
program in government it could be done within a year. But what 
would be the long term cost of that? It could be done in two years 
if we wanted to cut every program. We would have to look at the 
cost of the programs.
<P>
	Let me respond to the question of my hon. colleague. I am 
sure he is willing to listen to my response. In our cultural 
industry and scientific community it takes years to build 
infrastructure. They do not pop up from nowhere. We as the 
government are not going to cut them wholesale, which would 
cause serious problems in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8508"> 8508 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the same with our social programs. We can ignore and 
cut our social programs, but what price do we pay in the future? 
I ask the hon. member to look at the future cost of cutting those 
programs because in the end we will have to face the social 
costs.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I only have one 
very simple comment, since unfortunately I must admit that I 
missed the beginning of the speech by my hon. colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary to the fisheries minister.
<P>
	Since he is responsible for fisheries, instead of talking to us 
about big infrastructure programs, I would have liked him to tell 
us, in his area, his department, what he will suggest to his boss, 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Since the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans is to be reorganized, what kind of 
reorganization does he foresee? The provinces are expecting 
cuts but also policies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member. 
Unfortunately he missed the first half of my speech. It was an 
excellent part of my speech. I know he will not do that again.
<P>
	I will be telling the minister, and I am very happy to share it 
with the member, that we need to look at duplication. We need to 
look at the overlap between the provinces and the federal 
government. We need to look at that to see if we can save money 
by dividing some of the responsibilities. Let us have a look at 
them. We will look at the different departments.
<P>
	Is there something in the coast guard? Can we amalgamate the 
services of the coast guard fleet with the department of fisheries 
fleet to create more efficiency? Can we consolidate those 
services so a better job can be done in a more efficient and 
effective way?
<P>
	I will be telling the minister that we need to look at small craft 
harbours. Maybe we can privatize them. Maybe they can be 
privatized at a much lower cost than for us to continue holding 
on to them.
<P>
	I will be advising the minister that we have to look at overlap. 
We have to look at duplication, not only between the provinces 
and ourselves but between the different departments like the 
Department of the Environment and the coast guard. Let us see 
what services we can consolidate and save money.
<P>
	Why should we have within a mile fleet maintenance services 
for the coast guard and close by one for the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans? It does not make sense.
<P>
	We have to look at the common sense approach. We need to 
look at overlap and duplication. I hope the minister will listen to 
what I have to say because coming from the business sector I can 
provide some good advice on saving money for the taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The bells will ring at 6.05 p.m. so if the 
two colleagues in the Reform Party would like to divide their 
time perhaps it would work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
say to the hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
fisheries that the government had better soon decide whether it 
is going to fish or cut bait. He should stick around; he may learn 
something. Here we are in 1994. We have an overtaxed worker 
and we have a frustrated taxpayer, all of whom depend on us to 
relieve them of their concerns.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I listened to the comments today. A Liberal member 
suggested that because they were in office the economy was 
growing and we were doing well. Let us imagine how the worker 
in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland or elsewhere 
across the country thinks about the rhetoric in Ottawa. His 
pockets are empty. He is overtaxed and he is frustrated. It is 
abysmal that they can stand here and talk about how well we are 
doing.
<P>
	We are not doing well, folks. We owe $40 billion. We have a 
debt load of $530 billion. We cannot delay any longer the 
implementation of a tough budget. We often talk about the baby 
boomers versus generation <I>x</I>, the next generation so labelled 
after us. To some extent the generation of baby boomers has 
been a fairly unrealistic group. We have overspent the last 20 
years. Now we are whining about the fact that we have to cut. 
That is exactly what is going on across the way. They are 
whining.
<P>
	We in this party have the courage to come up with a plan. That 
is exactly what we are doing and what we are going to proceed 
with. They can whine as much as they like. We are right and they 
are wrong. It is as simple as that. I think fish or cut bait should 
apply not only to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans but to 
everyone sitting across the way.
<P>
	One of the jobs I have in the Reform Party is to look at 
regional development grants. That is what I want to talk about 
today. Many of my colleagues have spoken about areas in their 
expertise, in their portfolios, but regional development grants 
are of particular interest. They represent about $1.3 billion. We 
are advocating the phase-out of regional development grants.
<P>
	ACOA is one of them. The Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency has a budget of about $376 million. I spoke about 
blueberry research the other day and a Liberal member 
commented. He said: ``I am sick and tired of hearing 
anti-Atlantic Canadian comments coming from members of the 
Reform Party''.
<P>
	That is clearly not the case. Regional development grants are 
located in Atlantic Canada through an organization called 
ACOA, in western Canada through an organization called West-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8509"> 8509 </A></B>
<P>
ern Economic Diversification, and in Quebec through an 
organization called FORD-Quebec. FORD-Quebec has a 
budget of $437 million each year of taxpayers' dollars to give 
out in its  area and Western Economic Diversification has $452 
million.
<P>
	A taxpayer sits in his home and says: ``I am going broke. The 
taxes are more onerous every day. How am I going to survive?'' 
And the government says: ``That is okay. We cannot look at 
these programs because they are regional development 
programs and we best know how to spend your money''. That is 
basically the way it is.
<P>
	These agencies have about $1.3 billion to know how best to 
spend taxpayers' money. I will go through some of the ways in 
which they spend the money and give some examples later.
<P>
	The concept of regional development grants, as I understand 
from the government, is that it wants to support and promote 
opportunity for economic development and to foster 
development of entrepreneurship. That is an interesting one. A 
fellow who was given the entrepreneurial award of the year in 
one of the regions had six or seven grants from a regional 
economic development organization. I do not know what the 
Liberal concept is of an entrepreneur, but to me it is somebody 
who does not live off the taxpayers' dollars, who does not get 
any grants whatsoever. It is somebody who has done it on his 
own. He is not counting on government. They are not fostering 
the development of entrepreneurship in regional development 
grants. It is not happening. That is contrary to the concept, but 
the award was good.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	One concept is to increase the rate of new business formation 
and another is to improve the competitiveness of small and 
medium sized enterprises. We have done a lot of research into 
regional grants. How does one improve the competitiveness of a 
small or medium sized business in an area when the government 
comes along and says: ``Just a minute. You want to update a 
motel. Here is $67,000 for you'', and the next motel says: ``Wait 
a minute. What about me?'' The government says: ``There is 
none for you; this is going to be a competitive world''.
<P>
	He walks away with $67,000 profit from the taxpayer. It goes 
out of the taxpayer's pocket to somebody else. That does not 
improve competitiveness and is why we have to start 
eliminating regional development grants. I am sure we will have 
a great debate on this matter, because that is not the way the 
government thinks.
<P>
	The concept of entrepreneurs does not include government 
handouts, at least where I come from. If we ask businessmen in 
my community what an entrepreneur is, they will tell us that it 
does not include government money.
<P>
	We all know that Canada has a serious problem. We all know 
the Liberals are facing a $40 billion deficit. They are 
overspending each year. We know they have to cut it. They know 
they have a $530 billion debt and the interest on that debt is 
increasing by the day, by the hour, by the second.
<P>
	What are they going to do about it? They are going to close the 
gap. They are going to get it down to 3 per cent of gross domestic 
product. That is around a $26 billion a year deficit. Imagine 
going to the bank, paying our bills on more and more debt, and 
the Liberals are saying: ``We are going to look after that, folks. 
We are going to bring it down to about $26 billion a year''. That 
is insufficient.
<P>
	Over a short three-year period let us look at what we will 
have. We could look at four years or over the whole mandate. We 
are adding to the debt load in excess of $100 billion.
<P>
	Who will pay for it? Our children will. If we think of nothing 
else in the country, we have to think of the little ones behind us. 
We have to think of the ones in university who are wanting to get 
out and get jobs. Jobs are stifled by business being overtaxed 
and by debt load. We have to give them something to look 
forward to. It is time to make some tough decisions. We know 
they do not like zero in three. We know they do not like to fish or 
cut bait, but we know they have to deal with the problem.
<P>
	The average taxpayer uses a litmus test when he hears about 
giving a grant to any organization. A civil servant from the 
Department of National Revenue knocks on the taxpayer's door 
and says: ``The motel down the street needs $67,000 to upgrade 
its facilities. Would you give us $3 out of your pocket to do 
that?'' The individual would wonder why he would give him 
money out of his pocket and would ask: ``Does he not make a 
profit? If he does not make a profit should he be in that business? 
I do not have $3 anyway so I really have to borrow it''.
<P>
	What will the individual say? He will say: ``No, I need that 
money. I am not going to the bank to borrow it and give it to 
you''. That is exactly how the taxpayer feels.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has taken it upon it itself to make the 
decision on behalf of the taxpayer to give out the taxpayer's 
money to projects he does not agree with. I only have a minute so 
let me mention a few: $38,000 to acquire fencing and improve a 
go-cart race track; purchase of equipment for a luxury tour and 
outdoor recreation, $15,000; purchase and renovate an inn to 
higher quality; acquire office furniture and computer 
equipment; construct a two bedroom cottage; and to refurbish an 
existing cottage. If we ask the taxpayers they will say: ``No. If 
you want that then you earn your own profit and you upgrade 
your own facility''.
<P>

<P>
	I would love to say more but I am out of time. It is time to 
fish or cut bait over there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the member for finally coming out of the 
closet in front of the entire House, declaring that he is a baby 
boomer that is.
<P>
	The member continues to mention that we have a deficit and 
we have a debt. Hypothetically if the Reform Party had formed 
the government over $100 billion of additional debt would have 
been incurred even with their plans. It is almost as if there would 
be absolutely nothing happening.
<P>
	The member said this very large debt was accumulated over 
the last 25 years by the baby boomers and that they are the ones 
who are going to have to pay it back. I wonder if he would care to 
comment on whether he feels that seniors were in any way 
responsible for any of this debt. Does he feel that seniors should 
pay some portion of that debt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, do you know 
who is responsible for this debt? They are sitting in here. The 
politicians in this place are responsible for the debt. The 
Liberals and Conservatives are responsible for this country's 
debt regardless of their age. Do not blame it on the average 
taxpayer. It is politicians, the ones sitting right in here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to be 
brief. The point I want to make to the hon. member from western 
Canada is that we are not only separated by distance: We also 
have diverging views on economic development.
<P>
	Economic development in the east means something specific, 
whether it is in Quebec or in the Maritimes-I do not want to 
speak for the Liberals, they are quite capable of digging a hole 
for themselves. It is a development tool to help people; for 
example, instead of providing transfer payments and social 
assistance, you give people tools to look after themselves.
<P>
	In this respect, I wish the hon. member would be careful when 
addressing easterners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I 
have been informed to be careful about how we talk about the 
east. I thought I opened this up with the Western Economic 
Diversification Board, Quebec and ACOA. The facts are that a 
lot of the dollars given out as grants in all three of these all 
across the country are not serving the purpose for which they 
started out, the concept which I described earlier.
<P>
	Please, let us not get into being careful how we talk about 
Atlantic Canada, or Quebec, or western Canada. It is the concept 
that we have to look at, the larger picture of economic 
development in this country. Is the money better off in the hands 
of the taxpayer or in the hands of the politicians?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. member 
for Wild Rose will end the debate in about two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
speech was prepared for a lot longer than two minutes but I will 
try to reduce it.
<P>
	The basis of this whole topic which bothers me is that it 
appears the government does not realize we are out of time and 
that we cannot afford Cadillac services any longer. We have to 
take a step backward. We have to drop the frills. It is time to 
trade in the Cadillac for a smaller car and realize that the days of 
wine and roses are over.
<P>
	It amazes me. We asked for a simple thing. It would be a nice 
gesture on the part of the government to give up $10 million a 
year. Maybe it could go to the hungry children that the minister 
of human resources keeps talking about. It would be a good 
gesture. From the Bloc, from the Liberals and from everywhere 
else but the Reformers we hear: ``No way, we are not giving up 
the good old pension plan, not for a moment. It is the rest of the 
country that has problems. Let them figure out what they are 
going to do. We do not want to do anything''.
<P>
	I look around the Hill and I see those blue cars courting 
ministers wherever they want to go. There are green buses that 
will take us any place we want to go on the Hill.
<P>
	I understand that if they were willing to sacrifice a little, they 
each could cough up $45,000 a year that would really go well in 
the hands of the Children's Aid Society in Ottawa or Toronto. 
That is the kind of attitude I would like to see.

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House support the principle of disclosing the salary ranges of all 
senior executives of crown corporations and publicly traded companies 
incorporated under federal charter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in this motion I am asking the House to 
support the principle of disclosing the salary ranges of all senior 
executives of crown corporations and publicly traded companies 
incorporated under federal charter.
<P>
	I admit right off the top that I do not think this motion really 
goes far enough. That was suggested by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
newspaper which suggested that the motion include boards and 
commissions of the federal government.
<P>
	I tried to keep the motion as simple as possible. Adding other 
entities, in my opinion, only complicates the issue. I wanted, in 
a fashion, to set the bar as low as possible so that we could get 
some kind of easy discussion on this matter.
<P>
	I wanted to discuss this issue so that Canadians can get an idea 
of how members of Parliament feel about generous and 
sometimes extremely lucrative benefits which executives of 
public companies and crown corporations receive.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Why did I introduce this motion? It has not been designed to 
settle the impossible question of what executives are worth. I am 
not trying to do that in this motion. After all we live in a free 
market economy in which employers can pay employees 
whatever they feel is acceptable.
<P>
	If my purpose is not to determine an executive's worth then 
why the motion? Consider how the public would feel if both 
politicians' and senators' salaries and benefits were not 
disclosed. People would be very unhappy. People want to know 
how public servants or public representatives treat themselves. 
Similarly, and I think in a growing fashion, people want to know 
how powerful, influential people in the private sector treat 
themselves.
<P>
	Also consider the province of Ontario which under its 
securities act requires companies currently trading on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange to disclose the compensation packages 
of senior executives. Ontario is the only province with this 
requirement. The Ontario example provides a basis for us. 
Summaries of all companies should be required regardless of 
location in Canada and whether that company is publicly traded 
or a crown corporation; in other words, extend the Ontario 
example right across the country.
<P>
	Ontario's securities act was implemented several years ago. It 
was implemented to force companies trading on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange to disclose the compensation packages of 
senior executives. As well, the Ontario legislature has given 
first reading to two private members' bills relating to salary 
disclosure.
<P>
	Bill 108 would amend provincial access and privacy statutes 
to provide access to information relating to the salaries of public 
service officers and employees at the provincial and municipal 
levels. Bill 114, entitled an act to provide for the disclosure of 
executive compensation in the public sector, would require the 
Ontario government to report annually the salaries of the five 
most highly paid officials in each government ministry and 
crown corporation.
<P>
	Perhaps through example we can more clearly understand the 
motivation for the introduction of disclosure regulations. Let 
me give some examples.
<P>
	Hartland MacDougall, the former chairman of Royal Trust 
was handed a combined salary, bonus and severance package of 
$2.9 million for 1993. That came after the collapse of Royal 
Trust.
<P>
	Marvin Marshall is CEO of Bramalea Ltd., a real estate firm. 
In 1993 even though Bramalea lost something like $90 million 
Mr. Marshall was paid almost $1 million in salary, $971,225.
<P>
	Bill Stinson, CEO and chairman at Canadian Pacific, received 
a 31 per cent increase in salary in 1990, earning $1,181,895 
despite the fact that Canadian Pacific's profits declined by 52 
per cent in that same year.
<P>
	Paul Stern, former CEO of Northern Telecom, left that 
company in 1992, receiving $164,000 for two months of 
employment. Stern also took with him a compensation package 
totalling $6 million. Also we cannot forget another $1.5 million 
in stock options.
<P>
	When Stephen Banner joined Seagrams he received a signing 
bonus of 200,000 Seagram shares with a market value of $5 
million as well as his salary and a bonus package worth $1.2 
million. In addition Mr. Banner received a $1 million interest 
free loan to buy a house in Montreal and additional stock options 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8514"> 8514 </A></B>
<P>
worth $2.1 million. As for his performance that has to be yet 
evaluated.
<P>
	Those are examples. Some people might say those are 
examples of lucrative benefits. Some people might say that is an 
example of greed. There are cases where greed is not so 
apparent.
<P>
	Paul Desmarais, the chairman of Power Corporation of 
Canada, a Montreal based firm, paid himself $1.6 million while 
the firm's net earnings were $201 million.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion such salaries become more than a simple matter 
of disclosure, but disclosure is at the heart of this issue. 
Executives of large firms and crown corporations are powerful 
people, perhaps in some instances more powerful than ministers 
or even the Prime Minister. In this respect there needs to be 
some legislation to inform Canadians how corporate moneys are 
dispensed with or spent.
<P>
	One reason for introducing this as a motion rather than a bill is 
that several legislative changes would be required in order to 
facilitate salary disclosure. I do think though that salary 
disclosure means that salaries or compensation packages would 
be tied more closely to performance: the better the performance, 
the better the compensation package; lower performance, lower 
remuneration.
<P>
	Disclosure at the federal level would require all kinds of 
legislative changes. For example, under the existing legislation 
in section 3(19)(iii) of the Privacy Act the federal government is 
now required to only disclose the salary ranges for senior civil 
servant positions. The Federal Court has interpreted salary 
range as meaning the exact salary amount of officials and shall 
remain personal information and not subject to public scrutiny. 
However, the Canada Business Corporations Act does permit 
public access to documents such as letters patent and annual 
returns which do not include certain information on a 
corporation's directors.
<P>
	Federally there has been an effort to amend the Privacy Act to 
require the exact salary to be announced with order in council 
appointments. In a 1987 report the Standing Committee on 
Justice and the Solicitor General recommended but did not 
implement the amendment which would have made specific 
salaries of government officials mandatory.
<P>
	Financial institutions are major corporations incorporated 
under federal charter. Several acts would have to be amended to 
effect this change, namely the Bank Act along with its 
counterparts, the Insurance Companies Act, the Trust Loan 
Companies Act, and the Co-operative Credit Associations Act.
<P>
	The Canadian Business Corporations Act could also be 
amended to include an order to state executive remuneration. 
When filing annual returns with the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions a corporation could be required to report the salaries 
of its senior directors. This information would be accompanied 
by a report of the corporation's operations and activities of its 
directors already provided to the superintendent in  accordance 
with section 262 of the act and open to public scrutiny as 
required under section 266.
<P>
	It may also be necessary to make an amendment to the 
definitions in the Privacy Act to clarify the intent and need for 
salary disclosure for the sake of public interest. The 
amendments mentioned here could sufficiently cover the 
salaries of private sector executives.
<P>
	Those are some necessary legislative changes. That is down 
the road. Right now we are more or less talking about the 
principle of disclosure.
<P>
	As politicians we are continually reminded of the notion that 
absolute power corrupts absolutely. I am not trying to imply that 
senior executives are morally corrupt or have ethics that are 
worse than any other person. I do not think they are any more 
greedy than anyone else, but I do think that because of their 
influence and power they may be in a better position to act upon 
the greed they may possess. I suppose we all have some greed in 
us.
<P>
	I am saying that senior executives are so powerful that even 
though they are technically employees their compensation can 
be extreme relative to the company's economic performance. 
Currently some executives can virtually set their own salaries 
and bonus packages. I suspect there would be a considerable 
debate on this point, but they are very powerful, especially in 
their own realm within their own companies.
<P>
	Senior officials are also in a position to stack or heavily 
influence advisory boards or shareholder boards with friends 
and allies. Corporations are not the most democratic 
institutions. One might ask at this point: Why not leave this 
matter to the shareholders?
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I do not expect private companies to be as democratic as this 
old institution we call the Parliament of Canada is. Given the 
fact they are not that democratic I do think that shareholders 
need a little helping hand to open up the process and to provide 
better disclosure. We have to remember that shareholders in 
private corporations are a disparate group and are spread all over 
the place. It is very difficult for them to get together to make 
things happen.
<P>
	Legislation would do executives a favour in some instances, 
in those cases where salary and compensation packages are 
reasonable relative again to company performance. They would 
receive strong public support and it would be good for their 
image. In cases where remuneration is unreasonable there would 
be some reason to worry and they would have to bring about 
some adjustment on account of adverse public opinion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8515"> 8515 </A></B>
<P>
	Countless times executives are quoted as saying that the 
government should cut back on its expenditures. What I am 
proposing in this motion would require that private sector 
executives practise what they preach. Or, if one believes that 
executives in private corporations already practise what they 
preach maybe this kind of disclosure would ensure that they 
would continue to practise what they preach.
<P>
	During the recent recession a number of companies lost a 
great deal of money, yet executives of some of these companies 
were rewarded handsomely. In some cases executive salaries 
went up despite the fact that the performance of their companies 
went down. The greatest irony is that in many of these cases it 
was these individuals who made decisions which cost their firms 
a great deal of money, yet they were in receipt of greater rewards 
and greater compensation. Should we be rewarding bad 
decisions and bad choices? If we do that then I suppose the 
Conservative Party would still be ruling this country.
<P>
	Crown corporations also play a significant role in the 
economy and should be subject to the same rules of disclosure. 
The fact that executives can earn more money while the 
companies they work for lose money suggests that executives 
have the power to design their own packages in secrecy, behind 
closed doors and out of sight of public scrutiny. The public 
should know how the packages of crown corporations are 
established.
<P>
	In recent days there has been a controversy surrounding the 
head of CNR. We discovered that as part of his package he was in 
receipt of a $300,000 loan interest free, which probably makes it 
worth another $30,000 or $40,000. There is no need in my 
opinion to hide that kind of thing. If in this case the head of the 
CNR deserves that kind of assistance, if we want to put it that 
way, then it should be open and above board. He has no reason to 
hide it. My guess is it was made as obscure as possible because 
the man involved did not want that kind of information out. He 
probably thought it would add to his discomfort.
<P>
	Disclosure is not intended to embarrass executives. It simply 
outlines the need for constraint. Disclosure gives us those 
constraints.
<P>
	Initially this action may be considered intrusive. However, in 
the case of crown businesses they are the businesses of the 
government. Because they use government money they are 
using tax dollars. Furthermore, these businesses are important 
to the Canadian economy. Consider for a moment the 
significance of General Motors, Canadian National Railways, 
the Bank of Canada and the Department of Finance.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish this motion had been made votable but 
the powers that be decided otherwise. I wanted it to be votable 
because it would have given us the vehicle to express ourselves 
on this issue. I think  Canadians want parliamentarians to 
express themselves on this matter.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	In the remaining 40 minutes of this debate, I welcome the 
comments and the insights of my colleagues. If there are 
members who believe that executive compensation is nobody's 
business but their own, then let us hear about that. If in the 
opinion of some members disclosure is deemed to be harmful to 
the public interest or harmful to the private sector, I would like 
to hear about that too. Let the debate continue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
start by commending the hon. member for Winnipeg St. James 
on the way he presented his motion. His motion was well 
researched, and his arguments were excellent. I just wanted to 
say that. I would also like to take this opportunity to bring 
another perspective to the subject of this motion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg St. James moved: ``That this 
House support the principle of disclosing the salary ranges of all 
senior executives of Crown corporations and publicly-traded 
companies incorporated under federal charter''. I think I should 
add, for the benefit of those who are watching and listening, that 
there are three types of companies. First, private companies 
which usually belong to a single owner or are family-run 
businesses. Publicly-traded companies are usually big 
corporations or could be SMEs but, as a general rule, they are 
traded on the stock exchange market and the owners are 
shareholders. Finally, we have a third type of company, Crown 
corporations, which have a single owner: the government.
<P>
	I may recall that in October 1993, the TSE, following the 
example of the New York Stock Exchange, required companies 
traded in Toronto to disclose the salaries and bonuses of their 
five most senior executives. The remuneration of these 
executives includes salary, bonuses, options or share premiums 
as agreed by the issuer. It also includes allowances, annual dues 
and life-insurance premiums. This policy applies to all 
companies trading on the TSE and the Montreal Exchange. 
Companies trading on both exchanges are subject to the 
regulations set by the TSE.
<P>
	With this measure, the Ontario government makes it 
incumbent on heads of Crown corporations to give an account of 
their remuneration to shareholders. The TSE's policy follows 
the example of American exchanges, and about 3,700 Crown 
corporations have been affected by the TSE's new policy.
<P>
	Quebec, however, seems to be the exception in North 
America. The Montreal Exchange requires only disclosure of 
the total remuneration of the five best paid executives of 
companies trading on the exchange. Toronto requires disclosure 
of the salaries of these executives, while Montreal simply wants 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8516"> 8516 </A></B>
<P>
know the  total amount, without requiring detailed information 
in each case.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	In December 1993, the Quebec minister responsible for 
finance, Mrs. Louise Robic, said that she did not believe that it 
was necessary to require the disclosure of individual salaries of 
executive officers of companies listed on the Montreal Stock 
Exchange. She mentioned their need for privacy.
<P>
	The Conseil du Patronat in Quebec was of the same opinion. 
Its spokesperson, Ghislain Dufour, opposed the Ontario policy 
for the sake of protecting the right to privacy.
<P>
	Yet, the Ontario policy already applies to a vast majority of 
companies listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange. These 
companies are usually listed on both exchanges and, since they 
must abide by the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange, they 
have to make public the salaries of their best paid executives. At 
the time, Mr. Dufour praised Mrs. Robic's decision.
<P>
	We should add to this the opinion the Deputy Premier of 
Quebec, Mr. Bernard Landry, expressed when his party was in 
opposition. He said, in January 1994, that his party was totally in 
favour of the disclosure of executive salaries. He said and I 
quote: ``We are following the example of the Americans'', and 
he went on to say that the public and semi-public sectors would 
have to follow suite.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois favours openness. ``What worker would 
agree to make sacrifices if he felt that the salary spread was 
much too great?'' asked Mr. Landry. He points out that during its 
first term in office, the Parti Quebecois came very close to 
making the individual disclosure of top executives' salaries 
mandatory. But at the time, it was not a requirement in Toronto, 
and such a discrepancy in the rules of both stock exchanges 
could have been a problem.
<P>
	It is important to note that, in October 1994, the Quebec 
Deposit and Investment Fund issued a different policy in this 
matter. It is opposed to the individual disclosure of top corporate 
executives' salaries, preferring instead the policy adopted by 
the Montreal Stock Exchange. However, the fund adds in its 
regulations that it expects corporations to abide by the 
disclosure rules established by regulatory agencies such as the 
Toronto Stock Exchange.
<P>
	The Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund clearly states its 
preference for a policy like that of the Montreal Stock 
Exchange, although it expects companies listed on the Toronto 
stock exchange to obey TSE regulations and authorize 
disclosure, as well as other companies entitled to follow the 
applicable regulations. Companies are expected to comply with 
these regulations.
<P>
	Let us go back to Motion No. 309 tabled by the hon. member 
for Winnipeg St. James. It is apparently aimed at extending the 
policy adopted by the Toronto Stock Exchange to everything 
under federal jurisdiction, including Crown corporations and 
publicly-traded companies incorporated under federal charter. 
Crown corporations have a single owner and are not currently 
required to follow the policy of the Toronto Stock Exchange 
since they are not listed on the TSE.
<P>
	To give our viewers an idea of what these Crown corporations 
are, I would like to identify some of them. The list of parent 
Crown corporations includes the St. Lawrence Seaway 
Authority, the Canadian Wheat Board, the National Capital 
Commission, Canadian National Railways, the Canada Council, 
Canada Development Investment Corporation, Atomic Energy 
of Canada, the National Gallery of Canada, Canada Post 
Corporation, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the 
Canada Lands Company, the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, VIA Rail Canada, etc. These are examples of what 
we are thinking about when we talk about parent corporations.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	This motion would require not only parent corporations but 
also other companies incorporated under federal charter to 
disclose the salaries of their senior executives.
<P>
	The situation of publicly-traded companies incorporated 
under federal charter is more complex. We must keep in mind 
that most of these companies are listed on the TSE but that some 
Crown corporations are not. This matter comes under provincial 
jurisdiction and does not require the adoption of a federal law.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government has been unsuccessfully trying 
for several years to control the securities industry. In any case, I 
do not think that this law should apply to publicly-traded 
companies incorporated under federal charter.
<P>
	The motion should be restricted to parent corporations, 
although federal public corporations are already subject to 
Ontario or Quebec laws. I think that we should let them 
administer their own affairs as they see fit and let the provinces 
continue to regulate them as they have done until now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the motion that stands before us today is interesting because it 
highlights a problem that has existed for many years.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to address the issue of disclosure of 
the salaries of the executives of crown corporations. The motion 
strikes at the balance between the right of the individual to his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8517"> 8517 </A></B>
<P>
own privacy and the right of the taxpayer to know where his tax 
dollars are being spent.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from <I>Hansard</I> of November 21, 1983, just 
about 11 years ago to the day. <I>Hansard</I> records a question in the 
House of Commons on that day, a question that arose out of the 
tabling of a report detailing all the orders in council appointees 
by the government, a report that is still regularly published 
today. The report was 264 pages long. It gave the salary ranges, 
not the actual salaries, of all order in council, and by that I mean 
cabinet, appointees.
<P>
	On that November day 11 years ago, a Conservative member 
asked the Deputy Prime Minister why salaries of the heads of 
crown corporations were not publicly disclosed. In his 
characteristic fashion, the Deputy Prime Minister replied: ``The 
information that was tabled was in compliance with the law 
passed by the Parliament of Canada. Obviously with respect to 
public servants we have made public the range of salary. In this 
particular case, because it is impossible to find anything 
equivalent to a range, we have shown the maximum salary and 
the minimum salary''.
<P>
	I am not sure exactly what that means but in any case the 
former Deputy Prime Minister in perfect Liberal fashion 
avoided answering the question altogether. That member is of 
course sitting in the Senate today.
<P>
	The answer more coherent people usually give to this question 
is that while the public has a right to know what civil servants 
are being paid, those who are heads of crown corporations work 
at arm's length from the government. They are not purely public 
servants and therefore they have a right to their privacy when it 
comes to personal information like salaries. In a grand Canadian 
fashion we have compromised and split the issue right down the 
middle by publishing salary ranges, allowing us to say that we 
know but we do not know at the same time.
<P>
	It kind of reminds me of the question: ``Why did the Canadian 
cross the road?'' The answer of course was to get to the middle.
<P>
	Almost immediately after the Conservative government took 
power in 1984, it began to publish more accurate salary ranges 
of the heads of crown corporations because they had been the 
ones asking the government to do that for some time.
<P>
	Please notice that it did not publish the actual salaries of the 
executives either, but it published the ranges with one 
significant difference from the Liberals. The ranges it began to 
publish were much narrower than had been previously 
published.
<P>
	We learned from another question in the House asked by 
another Conservative member, again in November 1983, that the 
salary range of 18 employees of Canada Post was at the time 
$63,000 to $228,000 a year. Given this range, appointees could 
receive a salary anywhere within that range, maybe $170,000 a 
year. That is a range.
<P>
	That gave very broad anonymity to all 18 executives 
appointed to Canada Post in 1983. Today the situation is much 
different.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	The salary range for the chief executive officer of Canada 
Post is more accurately stated at $255,000 to $319,000 a year. 
This still leaves the actual salary of the CEO unknown, but it 
gives such a revealing hint that there is very little left to the 
imagination.
<P>
	In addition, most order in council appointees are given a 
ranking number, called a governor in council rating that falls 
between 1 and 11, each showing a progressively higher salary 
with a range somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000. The 
yearly reporting of order in council appointees called ``The 
Governor in Council Appointment Guide'' also gives a complete 
list of 15 CEO salary ranges of senior executives of crown 
corporations and a few other executives. The salary ranges given 
have about $30,000 between the minimum and maximum 
salaries for these positions.
<P>
	Over the last decade and a half a trend toward greater 
disclosure has been established until we have today reached 
what I would call almost virtual disclosure. Although interest 
was high when salaries were fully veiled, now less is being left 
to the imagination, so interest in the topic I think is naturally 
waning.
<P>
	If I were the CEO of a crown corporation I would argue that 
my salary has been virtually revealed and there is no more 
danger to the public from the small amount of secrecy that still 
exists. What is the harm in a little bit of secrecy?
<P>
	On the other hand the taxpayer would argue what would it hurt 
to know the exact salaries? Since a trend toward greater 
openness has already been established over a period of years and 
since we already have full disclosure in all but name, since the 
privacy of these individuals with respect to salary is only a 
charade anyway, what is there to lose by revealing all? The 
taxpayer would feel that a corporation may well be at arm's 
length from the government in the legal sense, but the taxpayer 
is not at arm's length in any way at all.
<P>
	Every time the CEO receives a pay cheque the taxpayer feels 
it directly in the wallet. The taxpayer would argue that he has a 
compelling interest in full disclosure, knowing the exact salary 
he is paying anyone, be it a clerk in a UI office or the chairman of 
CN rail. We have two opposing arguments with two competing 
interests. The question then becomes: Which group has a more 
compelling interest, the taxpayer or the one who serves the 
taxpayer either as a public servant or as an arm's length 
quasi-public servant?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8518"> 8518 </A></B>
<P>
	In my former life I operated a contracting company with 
about 230 employees. As the manager of those employees I had 
to know their exact salaries or I could not have run the 
company. The requirement of full disclosure is not only 
important, it is necessary for the manager. Just let the listener 
try to run his or her own household when they do not know all 
of their expenses. It is, of course, impossible.
<P>
	If full disclosure is necessary to the financial manager, it begs 
an important question. Just who is the boss of Canada? Is it the 
government or the people who elect the government? I would 
say that the people of Canada are the boss and they have hired 
this government for a short period of time to manage the public 
affairs for them.
<P>
	The government is not the boss, it is the servant. It is 
impossible for the taxpayer, the employer of the government, 
the real boss, to adequately judge the performance of its servant 
without exact information. This applies across the board, not 
just to the salaries of chief executive officers, but to government 
information across the great span of the federal government.
<P>
	As a matter of principle, the taxpayer deserves full disclosure 
of all government expenditures. By receiving employment from 
the public purse and by fulfilling some type of a public mandate 
through their work, an individual gives up his or her right to 
privacy regarding salary. We can see why this principle is so 
important.
<P>
	Just a few days ago the CEO of Canadian National revealed 
that in addition to his salary of something between $324,000 and 
$377,000 he has received an interest free loan of $300,000 to 
mortgage his house. This practice of mortgage perks is 
longstanding. I would refer the listener to the 1981 report of 
Petro-Canada where we first got wind of this in which $16.5 
million was listed as mortgages. Is there anything else that the 
president of CN receives today for instance?
<P>
	How can the ordinary member of the public judge whether the 
taxpayer has received a fair deal without knowing the details of 
the remuneration? If I owned a company and I found out that my 
manager was hiding important financial information from me, 
we all know what I would do. I would require that manager to 
tell me everything immediately or I would find a different 
manager. The principle becomes much larger and much more 
important when the poor taxpayer begins to delve into the 
government books and finds out how huge the whole system is.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	The governor in council appointment guide I referred to 
earlier now has well over 286 pages in it, not 264 as in former 
times. The guide has a list of political appointees, 51 pages long. 
There are 2,500 names on the list.
<P>
	If we are to assume that each one of those persons receives 
$70,000 a year, which is a fairly conservative estimate, it means 
that the salaries paid to those political appointees amount to 
$175 million a year. If we consider that these employees receive 
salaries within a range that  is perhaps $30,000 a year more, then 
the salaries build to $250 million and so on.
<P>
	The electorate will never see this information because it is 
hidden. The Liberal government, I would propose, has carefully 
hidden it so that we will not be able to see who gets what.
<P>
	When we move on to other sectors of government full 
disclosure is even more necessary. For instance, the Department 
of Canadian Heritage gives out $552 million in grants to 10,000 
different groups every year. It is a shame. On August 18 I asked 
for that list. It is somewhere in the bowels of the department. I 
cannot get it. They will not give it to me.
<P>
	To summarize my remarks today, the taxpayer has a 
compelling interest in full financial disclosure from the 
government. There are many aspects of individual privacy about 
which the public does not have a right to know. When it is an 
individual employed by the taxpayer to fulfil a public mandate 
in service to the taxpayer, the interest of the taxpayer to know 
outweighs the right of the salary to be held secret.
<P>
	Disclosing where the taxpayers' dollars are being spent and 
just who are the beneficiaries are valid principles. Where the 
motion helps to accomplish this, I think I could support that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to take part in the debate on a very worthwhile motion by 
the member for Winnipeg St. James. I am very much in favour of 
his motion.
<P>
	The motion really addresses, even though it does not quite say 
so, the concept of transparency and the possibility that people 
should be remunerated based on their performance. I do not 
think there is anything particularly wrong with that. In the case 
of crown corporations the customers are the taxpayers of 
Canada.
<P>
	I have been involved with the Lobbyists Registration Act. 
People are concerned about the accountability of government 
and people working with government and interrelating with the 
public in general. Basically the motion attempts to address that 
accountability.
<P>
	The Ontario Securities Commission requires the reporting of 
salary ranges in publicly traded corporations. This is a 
jurisdictional problem as the previous member from the Bloc 
pointed out. One advantage of having federally chartered 
corporations respond in that way is that it will actually be spread 
across the country. We could have federally incorporated 
companies which operate mainly in Vancouver now coming 
under the guise of this legislation.
<P>
	Another important aspect, although it was not really 
addressed in the member's motion, would be to deal with some 
of the problems of the securities exchange commissions in the 
country. I firmly believe there is a definite need for a national 
securities commission that would have a uniform standard of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8519"> 8519 </A></B>
<P>
securities legislation across the country. There are many people 
who believe  that as well. It has an additional advantage in that it 
could possibly create new capital markets for small and medium 
sized businesses. That is an issue for another day.
<P>
	We speak about transparency in corporations. The 
shareholders are very interested in what their executives are 
being paid. I can remember during some of the bad troughs of 
the last recession when our banks were having problems with 
Canary Wharf. I actually watched some of these institutions 
raise the salaries and remunerations of their executive officers, 
the very people who had made the decisions concerning that 
project. It was amazing to note at the same time that some 
foreign banks, especially some in the United States, were 
actually firing those people. It gives a different onus.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	I am sure the people in the Royal Bank and others were very 
happy to receive at least the information. Although they might 
not have liked the results, they were certainly pleased to be in 
receipt of the information that these people had decided to give 
themselves a salary boost.
<P>
	The transparency aspect in the recording of salary ranges is 
not a matter of simple curiosity. The reality is that when we 
expose them people start thinking the very thing we are 
thinking: ``What is it that you did to earn that money?'' Having 
crown corporations provide that information is nothing but 
good.
<P>
	For instance, Canada Post was mentioned earlier in the 
debate. Why should its remuneration not be more directly linked 
to its actions as a crown corporation? In other words there 
should be a portion, if not dollar for dollar, of its remuneration 
directly related to customer satisfaction which is basically the 
people of Canada who use Canada Post services.
<P>
	Today I attended an interesting interview. Some people from 
IBM were telling us how they run their corporation these days. 
Ten per cent of the remuneration of their employees is now 
based on a combination of five per cent on the profitability of 
the corporation and five per cent on customer satisfaction. They 
have a way of measuring customer satisfaction. We have to go 
more toward that in our governmental institutions.
<P>
	I take the train to Ottawa quite often. I have often thought the 
executive officers of VIA Rail should possibly be paid, at least 
partially, based on the performance of that service. It seems that 
every time that train is late we should focus on the profitability 
of VIA Rail and customer satisfaction. Of course a lot of people 
would understand that these people may well have to pay money 
to work for VIA Rail today. If that focus were available, we may 
well get more efficiency in government as well as in our private 
sector.
<P>
	I will conclude to allow other members to discuss the motion 
by raising the aspect of the civil service. I do not want to be 
getting into a position where I always seem to be bashing the 
civil service. Many civil servants do  worthwhile jobs. I am very 
conscious of their concern for the Canadian citizen. I would, 
however, like to restore the word civil to the term civil servant. I 
looked it up in the dictionary on the way to the Chamber today 
and the word civil means belonging to the citizens, polite, 
obliging and not rude. Those are some of the things that we 
would address by making the remuneration more directly 
related to the citizens of the country.
<P>
	I am very supportive of the motion of the member for 
Winnipeg St. James. It is quite appropriate that he brought it 
before the House tonight.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might indicate that the debate is to 
end at 7.37 p.m. If there are two members who wish to speak, 
perhaps they could divide the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
quite brief. I rise in support of the motion. I congratulate the 
hon. member for Winnipeg St. James on his motion that will 
help to bring Canada fully into the 20th century in terms of 
business.
<P>
	Other countries are ahead of us by many years in terms of the 
requirement to disclose. I approach the question perhaps a little 
differently than my colleagues who have spoken before. It has to 
do with the question of fiduciary responsibility. We know the 
term fiduciary responsibility applies to business, to stock 
companies and so on. That responsibility is to the stockholders, 
to the people who buy the stocks, who are entitled to attend 
annual meetings and who presumably are entitled to all 
pertinent information about the company, the financial 
information particularly.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	We have lagged behind in this country by not acknowledging 
that salaries, especially significant salaries of senior executives, 
have been exempt. It would seem to me, and I do not want to 
comment on the size of the salaries or the stock options, the 
perks or whatever, that a lot of senior executives probably 
deserve more than they are making. Perhaps some of them 
deserve less. Those are privately held opinions as often citizens 
hold about members of Parliament as to whether their salaries 
are adequate, overadequate or under, or whatever.
<P>
	Since the incomes of those senior executives have a direct 
relationship with the profitability of the company and with the 
dividends that are paid and so on and presumably in the end the 
value of the stock that it would be in the positive interests of that 
business if those things were revealed. A prospective 
sharehold-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8520"> 8520 </A></B>
<P>
er then would not be made aware of only part of the financial 
information it needs but would have all of the financial 
information. I believe that is correct.
<P>
	In the case of crown corporations naturally the fiduciary 
responsibility is to the people of Canada, to the citizens. It 
seems to me that they are as entitled to that kind of information 
as are private shareholders in companies.
<P>
	It is for those reasons that I rise in wholehearted support. I 
hope this goes ahead and the thrust of this motion prompts us to 
adopt legislation that will bring us into line at least with other 
countries we compete with around the world because it will be 
good for our business and good for investment in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg-St. James respecting the principle of public 
disclosure of salaries of senior executives of publicly traded 
private corporations and crown corporations.
<P>
	Unfortunately because of time I do not think I am going to get 
through my whole presentation but I thank my hon. colleague 
for sharing the time.
<P>
	The issue as it relates to provisions of the Canada Business 
Corporations Act rests mainly with my colleague, the Minister 
of Industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For Crown corporations the government has a more direct 
responsibility because of the public policy purposes these 
corporations serve and has a strong interest in ensuring 
appropriate compensation levels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The subject of salary disclosure of executives in Canada's 
corporate world has always been one of great debate and great 
importance. Our government has traditionally attempted to 
balance the right of the public to access information concerning 
both public and private institutions against the rights of 
individuals to privacy.
<P>
	Disclosure rules in the private sector for publicly traded 
corporations reflect an increasing desire on the part of investors 
and creditors to exercise their corporate governance rights and 
responsibilities in ways that ensure that compensation packages 
to management harmonize to the degree possible with the 
interests of the shareholder. Compensation should reflect 
corporate performance and industry standards.
<P>
	Provincial securities legislation deals with disclosure rules 
for public companies. For example, Canadian companies which 
do or may file debt securities which trade under the Ontario 
Securities Commission jurisdiction are required to file 
information on executive compensation for the presidents of the 
companies and the four most highly compensated officers. 
These rules appear to be well designed to meet the needs of 
private investors and creditors. They provide assurance and 
accountability.
<P>
	Disclosure of compensation for CEOs and chairpersons 
establish a reasonable and welcome degree of public 
transparency concerning corporate affairs for some of Canada's 
most important corporate bodies whose shares trade on the open 
market.
<P>
	Sound corporate governance for crown corporations continue 
to be a matter of concern to this government. This past October 
the President of the Treasury Board hosted a conference of 
chairpersons and CEOs of crown corporations to discuss ways of 
improving the performance and accountability of crown 
corporation boards.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that all crown corporations represented 
displayed sensitivity to the public's changing expectations 
concerning the responsibilities of corporate boards. This 
sensitivity extends to the development of appropriate 
compensation policies for corporate employees.
<P>
	In recent years a number of studies in the area of corporate 
governance, including the report prepared by Mr. Peter Dey for 
the Toronto Stock Exchange, have addressed the changing role 
of the board of directors.
<P>
	Crown corporation boards face difficult challenges 
complicated by the need to balance the corporate agenda with 
the public policy agenda. They also face problems similar to 
those in the private sector such as ensuring open communication 
programs with shareholders, stakeholders and other affected 
parties, and that includes the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	In the Dey report there is a particularly challenging concept of 
a modern business corporation put forward by the Canadian 
Centre for Ethics and Corporate Policy. The centre sees ``the 
modern corporation as both an economic institution and a social 
institution''. The role of the ``economic institution'' is ``to 
conduct affairs with activities with a view to enhancing profit 
for the benefit of the shareholders''. This of course is the 
traditional role.
<P>
	However, I think we can go further and say that ``as a social 
institution a corporation in the conduct of its business activities 
must take into account those ethical principles and 
considerations that are reasonably regarded as appropriate for 
the responsible conduct of business'' in Canada. This expands 
the traditional view and puts the onus on boards of directors to 
become accountable for much more than only the bottom line on 
a set of financial statements.
<P>
	Crown corporations by their very nature have always had to 
consider the public policy principles and considerations to a 
much greater degree of public scrutiny than private sector 
corporations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8521"> 8521 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Treasury Board secretariat continually 
reviews corporate government issues as they relate to federal 
crown corporations. The review of annual corporate plans and 
budgets, including salary budgets, is one aspect of their work. 
In addition, much information on crown corporations is now 
publicly available.
<P>
	Hon. members are probably aware that for crown 
corporations, directors, chairpersons and chief executive 
officers, these are appointed by order in council and have their 
remuneration fixed by the governor in council. Salary ranges for 
these appointees are in fact now very much public information. 
The practice has been to provide easy access to information 
concerning the salary range of a particular person. This protects 
the privacy of the individual concerned, especially with respect 
to exact salary, while allowing the public to have access to 
significant information. Similarly, the salary schedules of 
senior appointments to federal agencies and commissions are 
publicly available.
<P>
	Crown corporations seeking to issue debt instruments follow 
rules established by respective provincial securities 
commissions. They too are subject to disclosure requirements as 
are their counterparts in the private sector.
<P>
	With respect to the current public sector wage freeze, all 
crown corporations have been asked to follow government 
policy. Order in council appointments such as board chairs have 
had their wages frozen. Senior crown corporation officials who 
are not government appointees have had their compensations set 
by the boards of directors of their corporations. Crown 
corporations subject to access to information or privacy 
legislation can be required to provide salary ranges and 
discretionary benefits of a financial nature for these officials.
<P>
	The Financial Administration Act requires as well that any 
benefits other than remuneration paid to directors, chair or chief 
executive officers shall be fixed by the board of directors in 
accordance with the regulations made under this act. The 
regulations require that these benefits do not exceed any 
industry norm.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that federal crown corporations are 
subject to more stringent accountability and control rules than 
are publicly traded corporations.
<P>
	The Financial Administration Act, part X, sections 83 to 154, 
establishes very thorough and comprehensive reporting 
requirements. This law requires corporations to submit annual 
corporate plans and budgets to Treasury Board for approval.
<P>
	Corporations must conduct internal audits as well as being 
audited externally. In most cases, external audits are undertaken 
by the Auditor General who is empowered to make special 
reports on the matters he believes require the attention of 
ministers and Parliament.
<P>
	In addition, crown corporations under part X must undergo a 
special examination at least once every five years. These 
examinations are established to ensure that systems and 
practices respecting financial and management controls are 
maintained in order to provide assurance that the resources of 
the corporation are being managed effectively and efficiently.
<P>
	How much more disclosure is reasonable for other crown 
corporation executives? Is there a further need to add more rules 
for Canada's 48 crown corporations? Should smaller 
corporations which do not issue debt instruments and have only 
a handful of employees be treated in the same manner as a larger 
corporation? It would be premature to go beyond what we now 
have in the area of salary information reporting by crown 
corporations. Public accountability for crown corporations is 
now well and adequately established under a sufficiently 
rigorous statutory and regulatory framework.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	The corporate form together with this framework has served 
Canadians well. In the 1993 report to Parliament, the Auditor 
General of Canada stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1991, we reported that the control and accountability framework 
established in 1984 represented a vast improvement over the previous situation 
and provided for greater vigilance and stability. It has, in our view, improved the 
management of crown corporations as well as the receipt of essential 
information by Parliament on a more timely basis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government will continue to monitor this system to 
ensure its effective functioning and make whatever amendments 
are needed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under Standing Order 44, the member 
who began the debate is entitled to approximately two minutes 
in which he might close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not going to use up the whole two minutes.
<P>
	In closing off the debate I want to express my sincere thanks 
to all the members who participated in the debate. I want them to 
know that I really appreciated their participation and 
contribution.
<P>
	Tonight's debate, even though we did not have a vote, 
indicates that there is an interest, there are different points of 
view and we should not let this debate go. Perhaps we can pick it 
up again under some other format at some other time.
<P>
	The public is interested and they too would not want us to let 
this go. It is a matter of importance to all of us. We in Parliament 
truly believe in transparency, openness and disclosure whether 
it applies to crown corporations or private sector corporations.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NORTHERNTAXALLOWANCE">NORTHERN TAX ALLOWANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to again raise the issue of the northern 
tax allowance, a matter that I and my constituents have 
expressed concern about for many years. This was an issue that 
concerned my constituents and other Canadians during my first 
election campaign in 1988. It was an issue that the Mulroney 
government completely misunderstood and in responding to the 
complaints raised it made the situation worse.
<P>
	I have always seen the northern tax benefit program as a 
simple acknowledgement that not all taxpayers in Canada have 
equal access to the programs and services to which they 
contribute as taxpayers. Northern residents live at a 
considerable distance from the majority of federal government 
services and the northern tax program provided them with some 
relief on their income tax as a result.
<P>
	For example, an individual living in Pierceland, 
Saskatchewan has less access to federal government programs 
and services than does an individual living in Saskatoon. 
Therefore, it seemed the right thing to do when the original tax 
benefit program was initiated and brought into being.
<P>
	However, there were problems in its implementation. Some 
communities achieved northern benefit status and others did 
not. There were arguments about why the residents in one 
community received benefits while residents in another did not. 
Instead of reviewing the criteria for the program and finding 
ways to increase its fairness, the Mulroney government 
appointed a special task force which reported to Parliament in 
October 1989.
<P>
	The task force recommended that instead of fixing the 
problems the federal government should simply move the 
eligibility line so far north that few communities would argue 
about where the line was drawn. In other words, the task force 
recommendation walked away from the problem, took the easy 
way out and completely ignored the needs and desires of the 
people who were living in the area previously defined for 
eligibility.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	According to the Mulroney government, which accepted the 
task force recommendations, the people who were receiving the 
benefits would be best served if they lost those benefits, not all 
at once but slowly, phased out over three years.
<P>
	Despite their protests, these residents will see the end of the 
northern tax allowance this year. When taxes for 1994 are 
calculated and the benefit taken into account, that will be it. In 
1995 these hard working Canadians will lose their benefits.
<P>
	As a result it also means that each and every one of these tax 
paying families will see a dramatic increase in their tax bill 
beginning in the 1995 tax year. At the time of the task force 
report, I said it did nothing but address the cash grab needs of the 
federal government and completely ignored the needs of the 
people who live in the areas designated to receive the benefits.
<P>
	I acknowledged the unfairness of the existing program, but I 
suggested that a review and some new criteria would be better 
than completely removing the benefits from so many tax paying 
residents.
<P>
	Although the Liberal government since its election one year 
ago has refused to review the northern tax allowance program at 
my request, I decided last week to try once again so that in the 
development of the 1995 budget the government might consider 
reinstating the program to ensure that additional tax increases 
are not going to be unfairly forced on northern residents.
<P>
	I was pleased to learn there is the possibility of a review. I 
hope the government will again tonight confirm that it is going 
to look at this program and give the residents of a part of my 
constituency and other northerners some reason to be 
optimistic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked that 
the government reconsider the phasing out of the tax benefits for 
residents of the north and isolated areas.
<P>
	I would first like to clarify that the program is not being 
eliminated at the end of this year. Rather, a new approach to 
providing benefits to residents of the north was implemented at 
the beginning of 1991.
<P>
	This new system was accompanied by a transition period 
ending this year for those communities whose benefits were 
being reduced or eliminated. I can appreciate that some 
individuals living in communities no longer eligible for some or 
all of the benefits might oppose these changes.
<P>
	However, after reviewing the events that led to the 
implementation of the current system, I believe that the zonal 
approach is the right one. The current system was the result of a 
comprehensive study. It was implemented on the basis of the 
recommendations of the task force on tax benefits for northern 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8523"> 8523 </A></B>
<P>
and isolated areas established in 1988 and of further 
consultations as well.
<P>
	The previous community by community approach to 
allocating benefits was widely criticized as inherently unfair 
because it created border problems between adjacent 
communities that were treated differently for tax purposes.
<P>
	The existence of ill-defined boundaries made inequities 
inevitable. The new system is based on carefully delineated 
broad zones and it minimizes inequities. I believe that the 
current policy will prove to be fairer, simpler and more effective 
than any of its predecessors, providing tax assistance to 
residents of northern and isolated areas.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRTC">CRTC</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
asked a single question of the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
during question period on Friday, November 25.
<P>
	I asked the minister to explain why cabinet had decided to 
order a review of the CRTC exemption order on direct home 
satellites. Even though cabinet had made its decision for the 
review, even though cabinet had directed the details of the 
review to be gazetted, even though cabinet had decided who 
would conduct the review and who would be on its advisory 
council, even though cabinet had decided that the CRTC would 
not be the body to conduct the review, the minister refused to 
answer the simple question I posed.
<P>
	I was aware of the details concerning the review. Surely the 
minister was informed so he could respond to my question. It is 
unfortunate that he could not explain the reasons supporting this 
decision. The decision had been made on Tuesday and yet three 
days later, on Friday, he still refused to explain fully to 
Canadians the basis of the decision and why it was made.
<P>
	Telecommunications policy in Canada is rapidly being 
outpaced by the developments that are being made in the 
industry. Technological convergence is occurring at an 
exponentially increasing rate and the government must 
recognize that it can no longer adequately regulate the industry 
while providing fair treatment.
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	Competitive fairness is what this issue is about. The Reform 
Party does not oppose the idea of a review of the direct to home 
satellite distribution policy. We encourage such a review. 
However, we must ensure at all times that this review like all 
matters of government is dealt with fairly.
<P>
	In order to maximize the level of fairness the process should 
be as unbiased as possible while still securing a high level of 
competency. At no time has it been suggested that competent 
people should be excluded from making contributions to the 
debate. However, we must ensure that no one interest is given 
more weight or is seen as being given more weight than any 
other.
<P>
	The cabinet also decided to appoint three members from 
private industry to advise it on the decision. First, I would like to 
know the criteria for the selection process. Second, how much 
will this six month process cost? Third, how much are these 
advisers to be paid? Fourth and last, what exactly is their role?
<P>
	It is not even clear why the government needs advisers on this 
issue. Surely there are competent people within heritage, 
industry, and the CRTC who understand how DTH policy will 
affect both the industry and Canadian culture.
<P>
	As well, the review calls for interventions from the public and 
then it allows for comments on the interventions. Without 
advisers the only one who could influence the process would be 
the minister. However, if the minister wants an independent 
review of DTH policy and how it affects Canadian culture, then 
he should either let the CRTC do it or give it over completely to 
an independent public panel where there will be no undue 
influence.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support the review of this policy. It is 
important that we ensure government regulations accurately 
reflect the needs of the industry and allow for all interested 
parties to compete on a level playing field.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the minister's in house review with advisers 
who many in the industry believe will favour one company over 
another cannot accomplish these goals unless he makes it 
non-partisan. No matter what decision results from the review it 
will be viewed with skepticism from the industry because it will 
appear to have been influenced. The only way to ensure a quality 
review is to overhaul the process before it begins.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage have launched a review of 
policies relating to direct to home satellite distribution 
undertakings because of the impact these new services will have 
on Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications system.
<P>
	The new generation of direct to home satellites combine the 
use of high powered satellites, digital technology and small dish 
receivers to provide up to 200 channels of broadcasting and 
other services.
<P>
	Some of these systems are operating now in the United States 
and there are plans to have Canadian direct to home systems in 
the near future. However, if Canadian systems are not 
competitive with the U.S. systems, then Canadians may choose 
to get their TV direct from American suppliers which have no 
requirement to offer any Canadian programming at all.
<P>
	On August 30 the CRTC exempted Canadian direct to home 
undertakings from licensing provided that they meet a number 
of criteria. Some of these criteria limit the ability of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8524"> 8524 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian direct to home undertakings to compete with cable 
systems and with American direct to home undertakings.
<P>
	On September 12 the Ministers of Industry and Canadian 
Heritage announced their intention to review policies governing 
direct to home undertakings. There is in no way an overruling of 
the CRTC decision. The CRTC has enunciated its views on how 
it would issue such orders in the future.
<P>
	A notice was published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> on November 
26 seeking public comment on a range of policy issues raised by 
the introduction of direct to home satellite undertakings in 
Canada.
<P>
	Issues to be examined include competition, Canadian content, 
programming distribution rights, and the use of Canadian 
satellite facilities among other concerns. In addition, as the 
member recognized, the Ministers of Industry and Canadian 
Heritage have announced Gordon Ritchie, Roger Tassé and Bob 
Rabinovitch as the panel who will review submissions and make 
recommendations which will assist the government in 
formulating policy in this area.
<P>
	Although some have argued that the matter should have been 
referred to the CRTC, it is the government's responsibility to 
establish policy and the CRTC's job to implement it.
<P>
	The introduction of direct to home systems will have an 
impact on individual Canadians and on a range of industries. 
Concerns have been brought to the government's attention from 
a number of sources on this issue. We intend to balance the 
interests of all parties and consider the best interests of the 
Canadian public in formulating policy in this area.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38 the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.50 p.m.)
