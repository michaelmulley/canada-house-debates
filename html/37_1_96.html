	Mr. Speaker, today is the International Day for the
					 Eradication of Poverty. Its purpose is to raise public and governmental
					 awareness of the importance of eradicating poverty and destitution, not only in
					 Canada but also in all countries, the developing countries in particular.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is strongly committed to
					 contributing to that objective. We support development activities on the world
					 scene. One hundred of the poorest countries benefit from Canadian aid via
					 cooperation for development projects. We also support a number of international
					 strategies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage our government to continue its actions in
					 this area. In conjunction with our partners, we will be able to lessen poverty
					 in Canada and throughout the entire world.</p>

	 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, October 9, I held a town hall
					 meeting in my riding of Richmond. The topic was the leaky condo crisis and more
					 than 120 people attended. I have been listening, as have my colleagues from the
					 lower mainland, but unfortunately the government has not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week a delegation of leaky condo owners has come
					 to Ottawa to make the government listen to their plight and to get some relief
					 in the face of this disaster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the government would agree that all Canadians
					 should be treated equally and would ensure that the B.C. leaky condo owners
					 receive the same type of relief as those homeowners in Quebec who were rightly
					 helped for their problems related to pyrite. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the government moves quickly to help the
					 thousands of British Columbians who are facing bankruptcy and in some cases
					 grave illness.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, public life is an honour bestowed on a
					 very small percentage of our population. It can be very rewarding and yet very
					 challenging. I would never suggest, even if I disagree with their politics,
					 that I do not respect their intentions as they relate to their constituents,
					 their province or their country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this light that I congratulate Premier Mike
					 Harris for having the courage to make a very personal decision and retire. He
					 wants to spend more time with his family. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served with Mike at Queen's Park for eight years. He
					 was my opponent, never my enemy. Our mutual enemies were complacency and anyone
					 who wanted to harm our province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political ideology that developed as the common
					 sense revolution was certainly not something that I shared in any way. However
					 the ability to lead, the ability to fight for what one believes in and execute
					 the ideology faithfully, is something that I respect. I extend congratulations

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Savard is the second woman to be chosen as

	Mr. Speaker, in our precincts today are members of the
					 coalition of leaky condo owners from British Columbia. Among them is a former
					 colleague, Simma Holt, and the mayor of Port Moody, Joe Trasolini.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 9 the House debated Motion No. 293, an
					 initiative of the Canadian Alliance member for Port Moody--Coquitlam--Port
					 Coquitlam which purported to remove GST from repairs to leaky condos.
					 Regrettably the Liberal dominated committee deemed the motion non-votable and
					 absolved itself of any responsibility to the aggrieved B.C. condo
					 owners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not satisfied with this abandonment, during the May 9
					 debate of the motion five Liberal MPs from British Columbia and the minister of
					 public works did not have the interest, let alone the courtesy, to be here and
					 be part of the debate. Their contempt for these neglected and betrayed leaky
					 condo owners is representative of the Liberal government's approach to B.C.
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the minister of public works could find $17.5
					 million to relieve the Montreal homeowners, he cannot find similar money to aid
					 those in British Columbia. The Prime Minister, if he wants to do right, should
					 listen to the former Liberal member from British Columbia, Simma Holt, and help
					 these people with their dire needs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landmines are among the cruellest of all weapons
					 because they do not recognize the difference between a soldier and a child.
					 They kill and maim long after the warring soldiers have left the battlegrounds.
					 They are not only a weapon of terror but also an impediment to social recovery.
					 At this moment there are between 50 million and 100 million landmines in 70
					 countries lying in wait to kill innocent people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the tragic events of September 11 the world has
					 asked how it can contribute to fighting terrorism. In response I would suggest:
					 host a dinner. Terrorists need tools like landmines to create their havoc. By
					 having a dinner in their homes on November 30 Canadians can directly contribute
					 to the worldwide de-mining operation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple act represents an opportunity for Canadians
					 to do something that will enhance the quality of life for many innocent people

					 It is a policy that allows us to feel free and proud that we are Canadians
					 without having to discard our culture of origin which enriches our entire
					 society.</p>

					 Centre, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my point of order arises out of events
					 that took place during the last hour of debate last night on private members'
					 business, Bill C-287, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (genetically
					 modified food), which stands in the name of the member for
					 Davenport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House will be voting on this bill this evening,
					 I felt it was urgent to bring this matter to your attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like you as Speaker to examine the record
					 pertaining to the debate on Bill C-287 last night, and attempt to find some
					 remedy to avoid this problem in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer here to page 919 of Marleau and Montpetit,
					 which states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Although there is no practice of a
						  fixed pattern for the recognition of Members wishing to speak during Private
						  Members' Business, the Chair seeks to ensure that there is a smooth flow of
						  debate, providing opportunities for all points of view to be
						  expressed.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of speaking order and rotation during
					 private members' business has been raised many times in the House. The
					 procedure book cites the occasions of March 16, 1992, March 18, 1992, November
					 30, 1992 and October 18, 1995 as examples. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time the debate flows smoothly. Time is
					 shared on both sides of the House and among members from all parties. Indeed,
					 many times the Chair upon seeing a lot of interest in debate on the subject
					 matter of private members' business will consult the House as to division of
					 the remaining time, so that all those who are in the Chamber and who wish to
					 participate may.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very frustrated by the flow of debate last night
					 and raised this with the Acting Speaker at the time, who stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>At some point in time the Chair had
						  to make a decision to balance those who were for and who were against the bill.
						  I wanted to ensure a better understanding for the public and for our colleagues
						  in the House to help members make up their minds before voting tomorrow
						  afternoon. That was the reasoning behind it. There was no offence intended. I
						  was trying to accommodate as many members as possible.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notified the Table early in the day yesterday that I
					 wished to speak on this bill. I was continuously in the House from the very
					 beginning of private members' hour and rose in my place several times, but to
					 no avail. This matter did not just affect me. Other members in the House
					 intervened with the Acting Speaker as well, but to no avail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you will understand, Mr. Speaker, my frustration
					 in not being allowed to speak on this bill during debate last night, so that I
					 could place on record my full support and that of my party on Bill
					 C-287.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly had a unique position to bring to the House
					 on this bill, not just to speak in favour of it, but in fact to bring a
					 different argument forward and to put that on the record, one that focused on
					 the precautionary principle, guaranteeing food safety, health protection and
					 survival of the family farm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Speaker last night could not have known that
					 these were the points I wanted to get on the record, yet he did state in the
					 House that he knew that other speakers were speaking pro and con, which is why
					 he recognized them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I resort to raising this with you today because of my
					 interest in this issue. I have been working hard on this matter in the House
					 and in committee during this and the previous parliament. In fact, on March 28,
					 2001, I introduced my own private member's bill, Bill C-310, an act to amend
					 the Food and Drugs Act, and I also brought forward a motion in May
					 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, in the interest of ensuring as much debate
					 as possible during private members' business, I wonder if it is possible that
					 when a private members' bill is deferred by order of the House that the full
					 hour, rather than 45 minutes, is allowed for debate, and that in fact you will
					 review the record and my concern that all sides of the House and all members in
					 the House who would like to participate in such debate have an opportunity to
					 do so.</p>

	The Chair is in a position to deal with this matter. I

					 intervention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is when there are time limits on debate some
					 members do miss an opportunity to speak on a bill, but I am advised and I
					 understand this was debate at second reading stage. There will be an additional
					 two hours on this bill should it return from committee, both at the report and
					 third reading stage, so a total of two hours is allowed for debate
					 then.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the hon. member will be making
					 representations to the committee in respect of this bill given the position she
					 has stated. There are other opportunities available to her beside the limited
					 time that is available for debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the 15 minutes taken up by the early
					 termination of the debate, might I suggest she raise that matter with the
					 Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that have wondrous powers to
					 deal with changes in our rules and is always amenable to consider sensible and
					 useful suggestions that are put forward by hon. members from every side of the
					 House in that regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the matter under advisement and get back to
					 the House if necessary, but I suspect in the circumstances this will be the end
					 of the matter.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they have been throughout our history, our Canadian

	Mr. Speaker, on October 7, Canada agreed to provide
					 military support to the international coalition against terrorism. The Bloc
					 Quebecois immediately said that it agreed with the important support role the
					 Canadian armed forces had been given.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international community must respond to the
					 terrible attacks of September 11 by striking back at the terrorists and those
					 who are aiding them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Bloc Quebecois salutes the first
					 Canadian troops leaving today for the theatre of operations. We have every
					 faith that they will accomplish their mission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sailors departing the Port of Halifax today, and
					 to the troops who will follow, we say “We hope that all of you will return
					 safely, once your tour of duty is over”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight against terrorism must result in as few
					 victims as possible, both within the coalition and on the ground. I therefore
					 call upon the troops to safeguard their own lives as well as the lives of
					 Afghani civilians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian troops have a responsibility to assist the
					 international coalition in its efforts to spare the civilian population as much
					 as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pay tribute to their courage, we thank them for

	Madam Speaker, the following questions will be answered
					 today: Nos. 56 and 69.</p>


	<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 56--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Peter
					 Adams:</b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the involvement of Canadians (as
					 distinct from Canada) in activities in the Antarctic, can the government:
					 (<i>a</i>) provide a list of these Canadian activities; (<i>b</i>) indicate if
					 it monitors these in any way and if so, how; and (<i>c</i>) estimate its share
					 of the cost of these same activities?</p>


	<b>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Polar Commission, CPC, has responsibility
					 for gathering, promoting and disseminating knowledge of the polar regions,
					 including the Antarctic, contributing to public awareness of the importance of
					 polar science to Canada; enhancing Canada’s international profile as a
					 circumpolar nation; and recommending polar science policy direction to
					 government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out its mandate, the commission hosts
					 conferences and workshops, publishes information on subjects of relevance to
					 polar research and works closely with other governmental and non-governmental
					 agencies to promote and support Canadian study of the polar regions. The
					 commission established the Canadian Committee for Antarctic Research, CCAR, to
					 serve as a national advisory body on Antarctic matters and to act as a link
					 between the international Antarctic science community and Canadian scientists
					 active in or seeking to become involved in Antarctic and/or bipolar research.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information on projects involving Canadians in the
					 Antarctic or on Antarctic-related subjects is submitted voluntarily to CCAR and
					 published by the CPC. The July 2000 report entitled “Current Canadian Research
					 Activities in the Antarctic, 1999-2000” identifies Canadian institutions
					 working on a wide range of Antarctic themes including human adaptation,
					 landscape evolution, ecology of extreme environments, paleoclimate
					 reconstruction and ice sheet dynamics. The report also contains a bibliography
					 of more than 80 Antarctic/bipolar scientific publications involving Canadians
					 since 1997. “Current Canadian Research Activities in the Antarctic/ is updated
					 on a periodic basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians pursuing research activities in the Antarctic
					 and on Antarctic-related subjects receive funding form a wide range of sources,
					 including academic, governmental, non-governmental and private funders.
					 Canadians also often partner their research efforts with national programs of
					 other countries. As such, it is difficult to obtain accurate and reliable
					 information on the share of the costs Antarctic research that is provided by
					 the Canadian government. </p>


	<center><b>Question No. 69--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Rick
					 Borotsik:</b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the government developed strategies to attract
					 young people to farming and, if so, what are those strategies?</p>


	<b>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of
					 Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 29,2001 the federal, provincial and territorial
					 agriculture ministers agreed, in principle, on a national action plan to make
					 Canada the world leader in food safety, innovation and environmental
					 protection. Part of the action plan includes efforts to renew the sector
					 through programming for farmers that addresses their unique needs and helps
					 them to change. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sector is facing rapid change and is becoming an
					 increasingly knowledge intensive industry. As well, a demographic turnover will
					 occur over the coming years as a significant number of farmers retire.
					 Ministers agree that it is important for governments to help farmers adapt to
					 this changing environment and will work over the coming year to develop the
					 details of the agricultural policy framework encompassing specific
					 federal-provincial-territorial agreements in the areas of renewal,
					 environmentally sustainable agriculture and on-farm food safety. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For beginning farmers, this means ensuring that they
					 have the tools to prepare for successful careers in agriculture and access to
					 viable farming operations and financing arrangements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Jordan:</b> I ask, Madam Speaker, that the
				remaining questions be allowed to stand.</p>

	Madam Speaker, on September 6 the Minister of Justice
					 amended the firearms fees regulations by order in council waiving the fee for
					 registering firearms under certain conditions. I give reference to the Canada
					 <i>Gazette</i>, Part 2, Volume 135, No. 20 SOR/2001-336.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these amendments the minister bypassed
					 parliament and avoided using the laying of proposed regulations stipulated in
					 section 118 of the Firearms Act. She did so by using the authority granted her
					 under section 119(3) of the act which states in part:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--if
						  the federal Minister is of the opinion that the making of the regulation is so
						  urgent that section 118 should not be applicable in the
						  circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 119(4) of the Firearms Act states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Where
						  the federal Minister forms the opinion described in subsection (2) or (3), he
						  or she shall have a statement of the reasons why he or she formed that opinion
						  laid before each house of Parliament. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has had six weeks to explain to the House
					 why it was so urgent to bypass parliament with the regulations. To date, the
					 minister has failed to comply with section 119(4) of the Firearms Act. I appeal
					 to the Speaker to ask the minister when her statement of reasons will be tabled
					 in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that the Speaker does not normally rule on
					 matters involving constitutional law or the common law. However in cases where
					 the constitution or common law contain procedural requirements I believe it is
					 the Speaker's duty to ensure that they are enforced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House, through the enactment of section 119(4) of
					 the Firearms Act, ordered the minister to make a statement of reasons and table
					 it in the House of Commons. She has failed to do this, once again showing
					 disrespect for parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer the House to Joseph Maingot's <i>Parliamentary
					 Privilege in Canada</i>, page 14, which states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

<td><small>--the

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is in danger of being in contempt for a
					 third time. Not only that, she expects gun owners in Canada to obey a law she
					 herself has not complied with.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-57515"></A><a HREF="#Int-57527"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-57560"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, the anti-terrorist legislation is a
					 substantive, complex piece of legislation which attempts to balance two very
					 important interests: the interests of security and the interests of our liberty
					 and openness. This is not an easy task. CA members will be proceeding in
					 committee with their ears and eyes open and their minds cognizant of the task
					 at hand. As the bill proceeds into committee, it is also incumbent upon all
					 members of the House to realize the seriousness of this task and to do the
					 balancing that is required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things we should be cautious of as we
					 move in this direction. Clearly, in the interests of security, we are going to
					 have to modify some of the liberties and freedoms and we are going to be
					 transferring more power to the state. Any time we transfer power from the
					 people, the individuals in our society, to the state, we should be cautious. I
					 think everyone remembers what Lord Acton said a while back in British history,
					 that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It was true then
					 and it is true today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although corruption and abuse of powers exist in
					 democracies, they are far less a problem than in those societies dominated by
					 authoritarian regimes. It is clear we will not make our society purer, safer or
					 less corrupt by simply granting more powers to the state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at this legislation, we have to take a
					 serious look at a thing called unintended consequences and to limit that
					 possibility. For example, trade unions may be a bit apprehensive of this sort
					 of legislation. The power of a strike can have a disrupting effect on the
					 economy and society and we can get into problems in that area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are activists on both sides of the fence, right
					 and left, who are not in terrorist groups. They are strongly trying to advocate
					 their positions in a democratic society. In these times it is very easy for
					 people to include more than terrorists in the ambit of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to understand another point, too. One of the
					 objectives of the other side in this war on terrorism is to attack our open and
					 free society. If our methods of fighting back have the effect of destroying our
					 openness and our freedom, I wonder what we have achieved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the proper balance between these two competing
					 interests? I do not think there is an absolute answer but I am going to raise
					 some considerations which I think we should be looking at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing called an absolute right in this
					 world. There is no such thing. Freedoms and individual freedoms have always
					 been tempered by public good and the freedoms of other people in our society.
					 One need look no further than the famous U.S. supreme court decision of Justice
					 Holmes where he stated that freedom of speech stops when a person stands up in
					 a crowded theatre and yells “fire”. That type of reasoning is what we have to
					 be looking at in our war against terrorism, what that balance is.</p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much is said about rights. Much is said about the
					 charter of rights. Section 7 of the charter identifies two rights that we have
					 as individuals in the country, the right to life and the right to security of
					 the person. Obviously terrorists have no respect for either of those. In order
					 to protect those two rights we may have to moderate or compromise some of the
					 other rights that we take for granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be concerned with unintended consequences and
					 guard against them. Section 183 leaves a lot of discretion to the government to
					 decide what is a terrorist organization and what is not. I think the decision
					 will be made behind closed doors. There will not be a lot of accountability on
					 it. There will be a lot of leeway in that area. There are people who are
					 concerned that groups that are terrorist groups may not be classified as such
					 for political reasons. That is one side of the sword. The other side of the
					 sword is that groups that are not terrorists may be identified as such for
					 political or other reasons. These are concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear that the actions of the terrorists
					 violate a lot of existing laws. The entire criminal code must have been
					 violated by the actions in New York and Washington, so there are laws in place.
					 In the House very often we think the solution to problems is to pass more laws
					 and regulations and that will win the war, but that is something we have to be
					 careful of. It is going to take more than laws to win this war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite apparent to anyone who looks at the
					 situation that holes in the immigration system and the security systems are
					 largely responsible for some of these problems. The U.S. has spent something
					 like $10 billion on immigration and security systems, however 19 hijackers and
					 hundreds of others moved freely in and out of North America monitoring their
					 subjects, studying up on them and even getting the training they did and no one
					 seemed to know what was going on. The intelligence agency was literally caught
					 with its pants down. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere along the line in this politically correct
					 age someone said it was not right to send spies and informants into groups.
					 Back in the 1950s and 1960s when intelligence agencies did these sorts of
					 things we would have been aware of the threat and the danger of these groups
					 and would have been better prepared. It is incumbent upon us to focus on the
					 target and marshal our resources and aim them right at the target rather than
					 shooting off in all sorts of directions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More intrusive laws may be the answer. However the
					 immigration system is an area where we have to close loopholes and do things a
					 lot differently. We are going to have to hire more people. We will have to have
					 more resources. We are going to have to use information a lot better.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall in the House last February or March when we
					 were dealing with the Amodeo situation. Mr. Amodeo had moved in and out of the
					 country 17 times, if I recall correctly. Three ministers responded. The
					 solicitor general basically said he does not monitor what is going on in his
					 department and the RCMP does not co-ordinate its activities with the
					 immigration department. The immigration minister said her people do not
					 communicate with the RCMP. This thing went around and around. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact when Amodeo's wife came into the country the
					 immigration minister even said that we do not ask questions about their marital
					 status or their husbands because that would violate some right that she thought
					 was important. This has to stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck passing is not going to win the war against
					 terrorism. The buck stops in this House. We have to get our act together, quit
					 protecting our turf and our territory and quit passing things around in a
					 circle. Somebody has to take responsibility.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that encapsulates the events of September 11
					 and our response to those events both in the United States and Canada, and for
					 that matter terrorism around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Prime Minister and the House leader for
					 providing me yet another opportunity to address my concerns and comments to the
					 House and to Canadians. There has been in excess of 40 hours of debate and
					 discussion surrounding our proposed anti-terrorism legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on three specific issues
					 regarding the anti-terrorism debate. First, I will shed some light on the act
					 itself. Second, I will address the response from the opposition parties. Third,
					 I will address our overriding responsibilities as Canadians and as a
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have to say about the act will clear up some
					 misconceptions that have been brought forward by the Alliance. The purpose or
					 intent of the anti-terrorism bill is to specifically identify, prosecute,
					 convict and punish terrorists. It provides new investigative tools for law
					 enforcement and national security agencies. What is very important is that it
					 ensures Canadian values of respect and fairness are preserved and the root
					 causes of hatred are addressed through stronger laws against hate crimes and
					 propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism can only succeed if it accomplishes four
					 basic things. First, if it creates a lack of confidence in Canadians or free
					 thinking people with respect to their economy, they will achieve success in
					 some small part. Second, if they compromise our sense of security, they achieve
					 a bit of success on that part. Third, if they transfer the hate in their hearts
					 into ours, they accomplish in some small bit their resolve. Fourth and most
					 important, if they cause us to forgo some of our civil liberties, some of the
					 things enshrined in our charter of rights and our constitution, then they truly
					 succeed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the delicate balance I want to address in the
					 House today. I will certainly carry that message back to my riding as well. It
					 is a delicate balance between civil liberties and the number one priority and
					 challenge of a government, the protection of its citizens. The government has
					 risen to that challenge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has moved in a very methodical fashion
					 in making sure that Canadians have the protection and receive the security they
					 deserve in the country contrary to much of the untruths, speculations and
					 fearmongering that has surrounded this debate.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the anti-terrorism bill is to
					 stop terrorism from getting into Canada and to protect Canadians from terrorist
					 acts. That is the overriding theme of this piece of legislation. It would bring
					 forward the tools to identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists. It
					 would prevent the Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by terrorists,
					 impacting not only on our society but specifically on our economy. This piece
					 of legislation lays that out very effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many interesting points will be brought
					 forward in committee. I look forward to seeing what the committee brings back
					 to the House. I urge my colleagues in the opposition parties to work in a
					 non-partisan fashion to make sure the legislation gets back into the House, so
					 that we can pass the bill into law and provide the necessary security and
					 support for the citizens of Canada. If the opposition parties drop their
					 partisan approach that will happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I present the next issue with a heavy heart. Most of
					 the people in the House and back in my riding know that I do not often
					 challenge the ideas of the opposition. I normally do not show any disrespect
					 for its views because if I show disrespect I cannot expect it to respect my
					 ideas and values. However I have to demonstrate a precedent and speak against
					 the opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a tremendous number of falsehoods
					 surrounding this debate. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is taking
					 the high road, that he will support his Prime Minister, and that there will be
					 less rhetoric in the House surrounding many of these issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the exact opposite is taking place. It disturbs
					 me greatly and I cannot help it. I do feel sympathy for the fact that the
					 majority of Canadians at this point in time are not supporting the Alliance,
					 but that is no excuse for fearmongering or hot button politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member in the House of Commons has a
					 responsibility to Canadians to come together in this time of crisis against
					 this ultimate evil. They have a responsibility to work collectively to ensure
					 the security of the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just about military action. It is about a
					 number of different things. It is about stability in the economy. It is not
					 about painting various immigrant communities in our country with a brush of
					 evil or as terrorists. That is an absolute shame. It is a travesty that those
					 kinds of discussions have been taking place in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much doom and gloom from the opposition.
					 Our responsibility is to instill confidence in Canadians from coast to coast to
					 coast to make sure they get on with their lives and that the necessary tools
					 are in place so that our economy is not adversely impacted in a significant
					 fashion. Many of the comments coming from the opposition contradict that idea
					 at its base to the greatest extent possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking on behalf of the vast majority if not all
					 Canadians when I say that we must lay down a rule right now. Enough is enough.
					 We need to work in a collective, non-partisan fashion to make sure that
					 Canadians get the level of protection they deserve. I make a pledge to the
					 House and to the 30 or so million people living in the country that I will do
					 everything in my ability as a parliamentarian and as a Canadian to make sure we
					 deal with this terrorist threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last issue I want to touch on is our responsibility
					 as parliamentarians but primarily as Canadians. We have an obligation not only
					 to ourselves but to future generations not to let these evildoers and cowards
					 impact our lives in such a fashion that we would be afraid to make trips and to
					 follow through on the normal plans our families would make whether it be a
					 house, car or furniture purchase, or whatever it may be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we let these terrorist activities impact us in that
					 fashion then they win in some small way. Canadians should rise up with the
					 sense of confidence that our economy has the right tools in place.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our finance minister is looked upon internationally as
					 one of the greatest finance ministers in history, not simply for Canada but
					 around the world. The Canadian economy is in great shape to move forward and
					 deal with this situation with him at the helm of our finances. There is an
					 incumbent responsibility on all Canadians to make sure that they do move
					 forward with their plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one of the largest training bases in Canada in
					 my riding. I extend my best wishes to the men and women in the military;

					 the 120,000 people in my riding, and the 30-some million people in Canada, our
					 hearts and our prayers are with them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make sure that this battle is won
					 effectively. We appreciate the commitment shown to our country and we wish them
					 a safe and quick return. We thank the men and women in our military for their

					 (Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, BQ):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am very impressed at having the
					 opportunity to speak to Bill C-36. When we were elected last year, we were all
					 given the mandate to represent our fellow citizens. I do not think anyone here
					 in this House expected to be carrying out this type of debate. We have a heavy
					 responsibility in doing so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the debate on second reading. It is important
					 to bear in mind that, at second reading, the debate focuses on the principle of
					 the bill, What is involved, then, is the balance between the battle against
					 terrorism and the defence of human rights, between the security that must be in
					 place and freedom, the respect of the right of citizens in this society to act,
					 and their protection in their dealings with the machinery of government and the
					 justice system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, a very important substantive
					 debate. It is also one that leads us to much consideration of the matter of
					 good faith. Today the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice have both
					 admitted that this bill may have been prepared a little hastily and that there
					 may be some elements that will need to be looked at in the committee and report
					 stages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill includes elements of interest. We will have to
					 listen very carefully to the witnesses who come to tell us what they think of
					 this legislation. People such as members of the bar, for example, may deal with
					 the bill's implications and impact, and with the protection of human rights.
					 Others will also address the issue of security and the importance of having an
					 anti-terrorism act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the September 11 events, I think we agree
					 on the need for strong and decisive action. We must eradicate terrorism and one
					 of the tools at our disposal is the proper use of legislation. We have a duty
					 to ensure the protection not only of the public, but also of its rights. This
					 is why the Bloc Quebecois has adopted a very responsible attitude. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aspects of this bill deserve to be examined very
					 thoroughly. I am thinking, for example, of the definition of a terrorist
					 activity. Because of the need to act quickly, we may have a definition that
					 will lead to abuse. We will have to ensure that there a proper balance is
					 struck between police forces' ability to act and the assurance that all honest
					 citizens in our society will nevertheless be protected. This is a very
					 important aspect that needs to be thoroughly examined in committee. This issue
					 is not an easy one. We must give it very careful consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important element is the fact that we are
					 faced with an exceptional situation. We would not want our society to have to
					 take such strong action as a matter of course. We are faced with a urgent
					 problem which we all hope will disappear over time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, perhaps we should consider having an act
					 that will be in effect for a limited time only. This would ensure that when the
					 threat of terrorism no longer exists, when we are in control again and when
					 public security is ensured, there will be a time limit so that the government
					 will not use on a permanent and regular basis means that we do not wish to see
					 used in our society. So, we should determine whether this bill could include
					 specific provisions that would lapse over time and not be of a permanent
					 nature. Are there others provisions that deserve to be of a permanent
					 nature?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, numerous aspects of the international
					 conventions that were signed should be maintained. However, there may be other
					 elements for which this is not necessary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if access to information mechanisms are
					 retained, is what we are asking acceptable, if the government approves
					 revocation of the powers of the privacy commissioner in order to take them over
					 itself? I do not think anyone in the House would dare introduce such a proposal
					 under normal circumstances. The question will have to be asked if the measure
					 is to apply. Is it to apply to the medium term and is it renewable? The
					 government should perhaps make sure that certain elements have a time frame in
					 the legislation and that, as we have asked, there will be an annual review of
					 the law.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides that the review will be at the end of
					 three years. In this area, a lot of things can happen in three years. A lot of
					 bad things can happen. I think the government would do better to pay careful
					 attention, that is have an annual review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will be passed soon, this fall, before the
					 Christmas holidays, and then, in the coming year, action may have to be taken.
					 There must be follow-up in committee. Next year, when parliament resumes, we
					 would have to assess whether we did what had to be done, whether government had
					 gone far enough and whether certain things should be corrected. These elements
					 are important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to speak to the question of
					 wiretapping. Today, in question period, it became clear that simply defining
					 which laws cover this aspect is not clear. Things are not entirely clear. Does
					 it mean issuing a blank cheque and permitting things, which, after a while,
					 could be used for something totally different from terrorism surveillance?
					 These questions must be asked. It is a matter of responsibility to do so; it
					 has nothing to do with impeding the work of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In examining this bill, I believe that the Bloc
					 Quebecois has had a very responsible attitude. We have not blocked the bill. We
					 believe that we must take time to study the bill seriously and carefully. There
					 are many elements to consider.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is of less importance, but Bill C-16 on
					 charities, a bill with some substantive problems, has been integrated into the
					 bill. We must use the opportunity to examine these issues carefully at
					 committee in order to see if improvements can be made in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, this is extraordinary legislation for a
					 society that should normally be able to function without this type of
					 legislation. We agree that Canadians must know that steps are indeed being
					 taken to fight against terrorism, but that we will ensure there will be a
					 balanced approach at the same time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all of these points, I think we must proceed with
					 care. The committee must be allowed to do its work as well and as seriously as
					 it can, and must hear advice and ensure balance at all times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate at second reading is on whether or not this
					 bill should be studied in committee. According to Marleau and Montpetit's
					 <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--passage of the motion for second reading simply implied that

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly important bills such as this test the
					 entire system. They test our parliamentary procedures. This is a bill which
					 merits careful attention. It is a bill which asks us to consider the good will
					 of the parties in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that this bill deserved serious
					 consideration. We expect that, when it returns from committee, there will be
					 suggestions for amendments which could make it much more effective and bring it
					 more sharply into line with the stated objectives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the committee has done its work, it will be up to
					 us to say whether or not the new form it sends us is acceptable. We will also
					 have report stage to evaluate the result of the committee's work and, finally,
					 debate at third reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this process, the Bloc Quebecois considers
					 it very important that it be possible to improve the bill at each stage in
					 order to make it acceptable, useful and desirable to our society in the present
					 special context. We must not forget that it is also a piece of legislation that
					 may have an impact on human rights legislation for a long time to
					 come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international crisis we are now experiencing will
					 have repercussions not just on security, but also on the protection of rights
					 for the future. We must devote whatever time and energy is necessary to make
					 this the best legislation possible. We must be attentive to the requirements
					 submitted so that we end up with a balanced bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be our objective: a bill that strikes the
					 right balance between the fight against terrorism and respect for human rights.
					 This is what I hope we will do together, with a minimum of partisan politics,
					 so that ultimately we have an opportunity to produce an excellent tool to help
					 in the fight against terrorism and the defence of human rights.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise today to address this very
					 important anti-terrorism bill, Bill C-36. I happen to believe that this is
					 historic legislation and certainly one of the most important we will deal with
					 in this the 37th parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have said, and I very much agree with them,
					 that society and the world have changed as a result of the events on September
					 11. We watched in horror as 6,000 people lost their lives. We watched in horror
					 at the kind of terrorist attacks that were perpetrated on our friend, neighbour
					 and ally to the south, the United States. We all wondered what was going to
					 happen next.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to see, in concert with my constituents
					 in Waterloo--Wellington, that there was a kinship of grief around the world
					 that developed in concert with the victims and their families in New York,
					 Washington, D.C. and the surrounding states, as well as Pennsylvania.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in our effort to deal with grief we pass
					 through a number of stages. I think it is fair to say that sadness and despair,
					 fear and anger are some of those stages but after a while we come to resolve,
					 and I think that is where we are now at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways to deal with tragedy, especially in
					 this fashion, is to become determined and resolved to make sure it never
					 happens again. That is why I thought the Prime Minister spoke very well the
					 other day when he talked about getting together the kind of resolve necessary
					 to carry forward in a very meaningful way and to act on behalf of all Canadians
					 in concert with what they believe are fundamental and core values, not only for
					 this country and the people of this great country but for other freedom loving
					 people around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, the member states of the United
					 Nations have joined in a common purpose, and that is to shut down terrorism.
					 Canada, like our international partners, must move on all fronts. It is
					 important to note that we are prepared to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days we have seen increased security measures
					 adopted at our airports. The assets of Osama bin Laden and his associates, the
					 people who have brought about such destruction, have been frozen. The United
					 Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution on September 28
					 calling on states to work together urgently to prevent and suppress terrorist
					 acts, including increased co-operation and full implementation of the important
					 and relevant international conventions relating to terrorism, such as the
					 convention on the financing of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the Canadian government has acted and
					 acted with caution, noting full well that we need to think through our actions,
					 and has implemented new regulations to target terrorist financing. The proposed
					 anti-terrorism act that we are debating today further criminalizes the act of
					 contributing to terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it is essential to act on all fronts if we
					 are going to defeat terrorism, and I meant that. Where do legislative
					 strategies fit into this picture? We need new and more focused tools to allow
					 the justice system to fight terrorism. We are not dealing here with ordinary
					 criminals. We need to build a new legal framework that will disable terrorist
					 networks and prevent them from developing the capability of financing, planning
					 and carrying out their attacks on society and, by extension, on
					 democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed anti-terrorism act that we are debating
					 today implements the international convention on the suppression of terrorism
					 and the international convention on the suppression of terrorist bombings.
					 These are important measures in keeping with our international obligations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New criminal code offences are created for
					 participating in, facilitating or carrying out terrorist activities. Procedures
					 are established for the seizure, the restraint and the forfeiture of property
					 belonging to terrorist groups. We mean it when we say it. That is the point. We
					 are getting tough because we need to. We need to act accordingly because that
					 is what Canada needs to do to defend the precious system that we
					 have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 also proposes criminal code provisions to
					 establish, by establishment and by regulation, a list of terrorist entities.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure will allow identification of entities that
					 are clearly involved or associated with terrorist activities. The notion of
					 listing terrorist organizations has its precedent in the United Nations and,
					 indeed, Canada's United Nations Act already adopts lists of terrorists and
					 terrorist organizations identified by the United Nations last year, including
					 those of Osama bin Laden. The point is that we have the precedent and we are
					 acting accordingly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go into this listing procedure a little more
					 if I may, because this measure is one of the most important elements of the
					 bill. I urge all members of the House as well as the members of the justice
					 committee to examine this measure closely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placing of any organization or purpose on the list
					 of terrorist groups is a very elaborate procedure, as it should be. Section
					 83.05 of the criminal code as proposed in Bill C-36 provides that the ultimate
					 decision to add a name to the list is made by the governor in council. There
					 must be “reasonable grounds” to do so, to believe that the entity, a group, a
					 person or whatever, either “has carried out, attempted to carry out,
					 participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity” or has acted “on behalf
					 of, at the direction of or in association with” such an entity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the clear focus of this procedure is on
					 establishing that the group or individual has been engaged in terrorism. This
					 is how it should be, because this clarifies in a way that is consistent with
					 what I believe to be the values of Canada and consistent with the values of the
					 great charter of rights and freedoms that we in this country enjoy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize too that additional safeguards are
					 built into this process. Before the governor in council makes a decision the
					 solicitor general must first be satisfied, again on reasonable grounds, that
					 there is such terrorist activity occurring. Furthermore, a group that wishes to
					 challenge its presence on the list may apply to the solicitor general to have
					 its name removed. If the solicitor general does not remove the name, the group
					 can apply to a judge for a review of that decision. Mechanisms are also
					 established to address cases of mistaken identity. In any event, the solicitor
					 general must review the list every two years in order to recommend that a
					 listed entity remain on the list or in fact be removed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted also that the bill also contains a
					 detailed definition of terrorist activity and a specific offence related to
					 participating in, facilitating, harbouring and instructing terrorist activity.
					 Again, I urge my colleagues to look closely at the details of this definition
					 since it is at the very heart of what the bill does. Expressed another way,
					 Bill C-36 is premised on a clear focus on terrorist crimes and it breaks new
					 ground in Canadian law in its willingness to embrace a distinct set of
					 definitions. It is important, therefore, that we find consensus on these very
					 important concepts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrorist activity as described in proposed section
					 83.01 includes acts that would amount to an offence under one of the
					 international anti-terrorist conventions to which Canada is committed, but it
					 is also defined as “an act or omission” inside or outside Canada that is
					 committed “in whole or in part, for a political, religious or ideological
					 purpose, objective or cause”. It is evident that having such a religious or
					 ideological purpose should not in itself be an offence. It is only when this
					 purpose is linked with an intention to intimidate the public or a segment of
					 the public with regard to its security and is also linked to an intention to
					 cause death or serious bodily harm by the use of violence that it becomes a
					 terrorist activity. There are also other factors that come into play, including
					 an intention to endanger a person's life or to cause substantial property
					 damage with serious harm resulting to a person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to return to my original
					 question: What is the role of our laws in fighting terrorism and increasing our
					 sense of security from terrorists? I suggest that the law, or more precisely
					 the rule of law, is an important reference point for Canadians in assessing
					 what needs to be done to protect our society from those who indeed do not
					 respect the law or civilized values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Bill C-36, the bill we are
					 debating today, is an effective measure that should be looked at closely and in
					 fact will be looked at closely at the justice committee. There may or may not
					 be amendments based on what the members think and the witnesses say, but when
					 it comes down to it, I hope we will act as one, as the Parliament of Canada, in
					 a way consistent with the values not only of the charter of rights and freedoms
					 but the values of all Canadians.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, on September 11 the world changed, but
					 after observing the actions of the government last month I am wondering whether
					 Liberals have changed enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I as a Canadian support an aggressive campaign to
					 combat terrorism in Canada and abroad, as a parliamentarian I have grave
					 concerns. I have grave concerns, first about what is in this bill, second about
					 what is not in this bill, and third about the government's track record in
					 violating the rights and freedoms of law abiding citizens. I will spend the
					 rest of my time explaining these three points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern is that this terrorism bill shifts the
					 public, the media and parliament's focus to increasing the government's
					 legislative powers rather than to the more pressing problem of lack of
					 resources committed to fighting terrorism and government's misplaced
					 priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday on national television Mr. Reid Morden, the
					 former head of CSIS, stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> I think that CSIS has sufficient
						  powers under the CSIS act to do its job now if it has the resources to do it.
						  That's always been the problem with both CSIS and the RCMP. They have lots of
						  powers. They certainly don't have enough trained bodies.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know where they can get more resources and I know
					 where they can get more people to help them do the job. I will
					 explain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While parliament is focused on the legality and the
					 appropriateness of this anti-terrorism legislation, there is a real danger that
					 we are missing the real priority, which is that the RCMP, CSIS and our Canadian
					 forces need more staff, more training and more equipment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence that the government still has not
					 realized what the real public safety priorities are. Here are a couple of
					 glaring examples which I will explain. These are examples of misplaced
					 priorities. Last week the RCMP participated in a roadblock in Alberta, checking
					 hunters for firearm licences. Duck hunters are not a threat to public safety;
					 terrorists are. Also, three weeks ago six RCMP officers raided an office of the
					 Responsible Firearms Owners Coalition of B.C. for putting up signs during last
					 November's election, allegedly in contravention of the Elections
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musical ride has been redeployed to security of the
					 nation so surely these highly trained RCMP officers in Alberta and B.C. should
					 be redeployed as well, from their fight against duck hunters to the fight
					 against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent data available through access to
					 information shows that the government has 1,800 staff, a lot of RCMP officers,
					 working on a totally useless gun registry instead of fighting the war against
					 terrorism. The government has already spent over half a billion dollars to
					 register tens of millions of legally owned guns and to license millions of
					 totally innocent firearms owners instead of redirecting these human and
					 financial resources to the fight against a real threat, terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not secure our borders? Why not do the things that
					 the people of this country want to be priorities? Let us put our money where we
					 will get the most bang for our buck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the justice minister gave this assurance to
					 the national media. She stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our legislation is fair in that we
						  are not unwittingly and unintentionally, perhaps, involving those who are
						  completely innocent either as individuals or organizations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunters in Alberta who had their property seized by
					 RCMP officers last week were completely innocent individuals until this
					 government failed to issue licences to tens of thousands of gun owners who had
					 applied for them. They tried to comply with the law and could not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible firearms owners of B.C. association was
					 also a completely innocent organization until the government passed a gag law
					 prohibiting free speech during an election campaign. This is the same gag law
					 that is now being challenged in the courts while we are spending RCMP resources
					 going after these people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to examine the government's public assurances
					 as closely as we do its legislation. I have had a lot of experience here in the
					 last eight years and I speak from that. We have to examine the government's
					 track record on other pieces of legislation it has passed before we accept its
					 public assurances as a legal commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Bar Association, the Criminal Lawyers'
					 Association of Ontario and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association have
					 already raised concerns about what is in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil libertarians say the bill could erode
					 democracy and cite the following provisions. First, it would permit the arrest
					 of individuals without warrant if it is believed that would prevent terrorist
					 activity; second, it would compel people to provide information related to
					 terrorism to an investigating judge without charges being laid or a crime
					 having been committed; third, it would reduce safeguards on obtaining and
					 extending warrants for wiretaps; fourth, it would make it illegal to facilitate
					 terrorist activity; and fifth, there would be the unprecedented creation of
					 judicial investigatory hearings.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even criticized the definition of terrorist
					 activity itself. An article quoted Alan Borovoy of the Canadian Civil Liberties
					 Association, who said that in the past Nelson Mandela and the African National
					 Congress would have been terrorists under the definition, while today the Kurds
					 of Iraq would likely qualify in their battle against Saddam Hussein's
					 repression. He stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I am hard-pressed to appreciate why
						  all this has been considered necessary because I'm very aware of the
						  considerable power that already exists.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that some of the relaxed rules for police
					 surveillance are simply “a gratuitous undermining of safeguards” that will do
					 nothing to apprehend terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are serious concerns because, as I said before,
					 the government has established a track record of violating rights and freedoms
					 of law abiding citizens while in the pursuit of political priorities rather
					 than public safety priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, just six weeks ago the privacy
					 commissioner of Canada issued a report entitled “Review of the Personal
					 Information Handling Practices of the Canadian Firearms Program”. I made some
					 startling discoveries in this 81 page report. On pages 4 and 7 he reported that
					 the justice minister had ignored the privacy commissioner's suggestions for
					 years. On pages 4 and 5 the privacy commissioner says that the firearms
					 registry ranges from a significant intrusion on privacy to highly intrusive. On
					 pages 5 and 20 he reports that the justice minister has not implemented a
					 promise made to parliament way back in 1997. On page 7 he reports that the
					 justice minister has ignored two recommendations made by parliamentary
					 committee. On page 10 he reports that the justice minister cannot provide a
					 single point of accountability, as she promised. On page 19 the privacy
					 commissioner disagrees with the justice minister's claim that all private and
					 personal information is protected. On pages 20 and 21 he goes on to say that
					 citizens may have to file up to five requests to access their personal
					 information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pages 23 to 29 the privacy commissioner found that:
					 the RCMP keeps a firearms interest police database on 3.5 million Canadians a
					 secret from them; the RCMP is violating the Privacy Act with operations of the
					 police information retrieval system; the RCMP firearms interest police database
					 exceeds authority granted in section 5 of the Firearms Act; and the firearms
					 interest police database on 3.5 million Canadians is full of unsubstantiated,
					 derogatory information, unproven charges or allegations and hearsay, and even
					 contains information on witnesses and victims. We must remember that this is a
					 database authorized in 1995 by parliament with the passage of Bill C-68. This
					 was the database that was only supposed to contain information on potentially
					 dangerous individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite all these examples to highlight the fact that we
					 need to examine the legislation before us today. The justice minister and the
					 government clearly have not kept their promises to safeguard the privacy rights
					 of law abiding citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is my point? Laws passed without enough thought by
					 the House and laws poorly implemented by government bureaucrats can result in
					 the violation of privacy rights of law abiding citizens. This is why we have
					 every right to be skeptical of the assurances the minister is giving us today
					 about this piece of legislation. We must remember that the previous piece of
					 legislation I cited was rammed through parliament using time allocation, ending
					 all debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In violation of our citizens' privacy rights, Bill C-68
					 also violated the rights of millions of law abiding citizens, trampling on
					 fundamental property rights, placing in jeopardy our charter of rights to be
					 secure against unreasonable search and seizure, eliminating our right to remain
					 silent, reversing the onus of proof and thereby eliminating our rights to be
					 presumed innocent until proven guilty, infringing on the treaty rights of
					 aboriginal people, and intruding unnecessarily into the exclusive
					 constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces over property and civil
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with what I said at the beginning of my
					 speech. I have grave concerns about some of the things that are not in the
					 bill. The government has not created a national sky marshal service for
					 domestic passenger flights. That does not make sense. The government has not
					 created a comprehensive national border protection service that would include
					 ports police.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not reinstated the death penalty for

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not strengthened our deportation
					 laws. The government has not provided safeguards in this legislation that would
					 allow individuals and organizations unjustly caught by this legislation. It has
					 not strengthened property rights. It has not included legislative commitments
					 to provide the resources necessary to the RCMP, CSIS and defence. It has not

					 no--</p>

					 Centre, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it pleases me to be able to speak to
					 Bill C-36. I want to congratulate the Minister of Justice and her team who put
					 together such a comprehensive piece of legislation to deal with the terrorist
					 threat here in Canada. It is a most impressive bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 finds the delicate balance of protecting our
					 charter rights and our civil liberties, indeed protecting the essence of a
					 democratic society, while ensuring greater security for our country and
					 ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have before us is a strong response and one
					 that effectively deals with the increased threats of terrorism within our
					 borders. The full implementation of the bill will go a long way to see that
					 terrorist operations are shut down within Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new bill, we will be able to strike at the
					 roots of terrorism. Bill C-36 would permit a court to order the removal of any
					 hate propaganda from any public place or computer. This is a valuable tool in
					 restricting messages which may incite others to commit violent acts based on
					 any hate on another group of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police agencies would have great ability to monitor the
					 communications of terrorist factions and would be no longer constrained by the
					 last hope clause and by the previous 60 day limitation on wiretap. They have
					 been removed so we will be better protected from planned acts of
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also have the ability to cripple these
					 terrorist organizations financially with the amendment to the Proceeds of Crime
					 (Money Laundering) Act and the enactment of the charities registrations act.
					 Preventing terrorists from accessing funds prevents them from committing acts
					 of terror. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist acts are also being added to the criminal
					 code. Collecting funds for terrorists, knowingly harbouring terrorists,
					 participating in terrorist activities and instructing others to commit
					 terrorist activities are soon all to be added to the criminal code as offences.
					 These are serious crimes and they will carry serious penalties, up to life in
					 prison. These sentences would ensure that those involved are incarcerated for a
					 long period of time, no longer part of the loop of terrorist organizations to
					 which they belong and hopefully it will no longer exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though overall I find the bill to be a formidable
					 response to a challenging situation, I do have some matters that I hope the
					 committee will address and provide guidance. These relate to the preventative
					 arrest clauses of the bill. I am certain that the implementation of the
					 preventative arrests will be an important tool for police officers to have in
					 putting a halt to terrorist activities, and for that I am glad that these
					 provisions are included in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned of the possibility of its implementation
					 in the situation where no terrorism is planned. I am aware that the bill
					 defines what is terrorist activity and what is a legitimate protest. However,
					 as we have seen before, it is possible for a protest to escalate and suddenly
					 once a peaceful gathering becomes filled with violence, all the result of the
					 actions of a few individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I cannot stand here and say that violent protests
					 are desirable or should be encouraged, I fear that the measures within the bill
					 could run over and unwittingly implement themselves at one of these
					 protests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that a protest, violent or otherwise,
					 is a terrorist activity. I worry for the innocent people of which there are
					 many within these protest groups. As I have stated it is a very small group
					 that incite violence. However, it seems that all members of the larger group,
					 in which the smaller one dwells, face the potential of suffering merely because
					 they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new issue for Canada and it is one that
					 will not go away. Because this is the case, we must ensure that the charter
					 rights of the individuals who are no more than bystanders to the melee that is
					 taking place beside them are protected. They should not see their democratic
					 rights disappear because of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be vigilant to ensure that there are no
					 provisions for them to be automatically arrested and detained for a minimum of
					 24 hours merely as preventative measures. There is nothing to prevent for the
					 vast majority of the people. They are a peaceful lot who only wish to make
					 their views known to others.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases where, as one mother said to me,
					 they are among the best and the brightest. They have chosen to show up in
					 support of a cause, not to incite violent or criminal acts and certainly none
					 of them have terrorism on their mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to see the provisions of the bill used
					 wrongly in a protest situation or the police easily exploit them. Even with the
					 provision that the attorney general needs to approve of a preventative arrest,
					 one hopes that no police officer can inappropriately circumvent this and seek
					 the approval of the attorney general after an arrest is made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that at any time they can be taken into custody
					 by a police officer merely on the suspicion that they could involve themselves
					 in a terrorist act is frightening many people. The bill would ensure legal
					 protection for these people to go out and protest by themselves or with others.
					 It is our responsibility to ensure that procedures are in place so that they do
					 not risk a situation where they lose that right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that the committee will examine closely
					 the amendment to section 83 of the criminal code. I have full confidence in its
					 ability and I trust it will remove any remaining doubt concerning the
					 definition of terrorist activity that may exist in relation to the protesting
					 being swept in with this definition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time will perhaps be the truest test of what will
					 happen with Bill C-36, and I am very pleased that the opportunity exists three
					 years after royal assent to review the bill and its impact on society. I share
					 some of the concerns expressed by others that the committee may see fit to
					 implement a sunset clause on some of the provisions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I am still an active member of the House
					 when the time comes so that I can look back on the three years that Bill C-36
					 would have been in existence. I also hope that the Department of Justice and
					 the committee takes not only a proactive role in recording the uses of these
					 laws, but perhaps even considers a required reporting procedure for law
					 enforcement officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With requirements such as these, we would be accurately
					 able to see what impact these laws have on Canada and that they were not abused
					 in any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I sought election to this office for the first
					 time in the fall of 2000, I could never have anticipated the awesome
					 responsibility that I would find myself in as part of this body: the
					 responsibility of balancing security and freedom and the responsibility of
					 ensuring that our children continue to live in a free and democratic society
					 that provides opportunities for all of its citizens.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy to join my opposition coalition
					 colleagues in supporting the motion, but regrettably the Prime Minister and his
					 fellow Liberal MP's voted against it, so the motion was defeated 199 to 70.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see once again that, despite the best efforts of
					 opposition MP's and our own security agencies, the government is refusing to
					 change domestic policies according to the response that is required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's assertion that responsibility for
					 the interdiction of terrorists entering the United States from Canada is that
					 of U.S. border officials, merely illustrates his failure to recognize the
					 responsibility of preventing such individuals from entering Canada in the first
					 place. The border with our American neighbours involves the crossing of 500,000
					 people a day and over a billion dollars in trade on a daily basis. Effecting
					 our border, impeding the flow of goods and services and people across the
					 border will obviously be detrimental to the economies of both our countries.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighter border control does not address the underlying
					 security risks associated with the loopholes in Canada's immigration and
					 refugee system that are being exploited. That is not to suggest that the
					 problem is with Canada's willingness to accept genuine refugees and immigrants,
					 rather it is a legitimate and longstanding concern that the system itself fails
					 to guard against those who abuse the loopholes in our immigration laws and use
					 our country as a base for illegal activity, including terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have deliberately merged these two
					 separate issues thereby preventing security interests from becoming effectively
					 dealt with because reasoned debate is supplanted by specious accusations of
					 racism. I would like to illustrate a couple of examples for the benefit of the
					 House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 4 In the House of Commons, in a question to
					 the immigration minister in which an opposition member asked if the minister
					 would commit unequivocally to working with Ontario and any other province that
					 came forward to pick up the slack in the deportation of people illegally in
					 Canada, her response was to accuse the member of equating refugees with
					 criminals. She stated “It is simply wrong to broad-brush all of those who are
					 in Canada who have deportation orders”. That is the technique.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example took place on October 1 when an
					 opposition member stated “We know there have been terrorists living among us.
					 We know that they get here illegally through our refugee system”. The member
					 then asked what specific steps the Prime Minister could tell us about that he
					 had taken to protect Canadians and indirectly to protect our
					 neighbours.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the minister was that not all refugee
					 claimants are criminals and that the member was simply
					 fearmongering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a final example, the immigration minister's first
					 comments following the terrorist attack was to criticize anyone who would point
					 out the loopholes in our immigration refugee system that was being exploited by
					 terrorists by characterizing them as being “anti-immigrant and anti-everybody
					 rhetoric”, when in fact it is the minister engaging in rhetoric.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, elected members of parliament and our
					 country's own security agencies have highlighted how the system has failed.
					 Opposition MPs have been demanding since 1993 that loopholes in the legislation
					 governing entry into Canada be closed. I would like to quote from a 1996
					 Canadian Security Intelligence Service report which stated the following:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report further stated:</p>

						  dissemination; intimidating Canadian citizens in émigré communities; providing
						  safe haven for terrorists; arranging transit to and from other countries; and

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is from a 1996 report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern I see with the legislation is that it has
					 the potential, because some aspects of it are targeting our common border with
					 the United States, to sacrifice the free flow of trade between our two
					 countries instead of addressing the issues that would prevent terrorists from
					 reaching Canadian soil in the first place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in this light, the government's efforts continue
					 to be geared toward after the fact measures rather than being proactive in
					 combating the terrorist threat from abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday of this week the opposition coalition put the
					 following motion before the House of Commons. It stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						  condemnation of the terrorist attacks against our NATO ally, the United States

						  freedom and democracy in the international military coalition against

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shamefully, in an act of outright political cowardice,

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when this country should be united in its

					 play politics with the issue by undermining our country's contribution to the
					 international military effort. By voting against the motion, the NDP has proven
					 its irrelevance and once again relegated itself to the fringe of Canadian
					 politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also point out that 80% of Canadians
					 support the international coalition to fight terrorism. One is either against

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I too would like to express my total
					 support for Bill C-36 and the fight against terrorism. I would also like to
					 take a moment to congratulate our Prime Minister for going to Halifax to bid
					 farewell to our soldiers. I hope when everything is said and done they will all
					 come back safe and sound to their families and loved ones. I also hope they
					 will come here one day so we can honour them in the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last couple of days we have had many
					 discussions. During one of the discussions a colleague from this side of the
					 House mentioned the fact that any time we have a demonstration that turns
					 violent it is a terrorist act. Someone else from the other side mentioned that
					 it is not a terrorist act but rather a free expression of will.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, I do not think we can come up
					 with a scientific definition of what the word terrorism means. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give an example. In the 1950s Nelson Mandela,
					 the leader of the African National Congress, was a terrorist for the white
					 supremacist government in South Africa. I am glad to say that he was here a
					 couple of years ago and will be here again to receive an honorary citizenship
					 for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To re-emphasize the point I made earlier, there is no
					 scientific definition for the word terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having said that, there is no justification
					 whatsoever for anyone to engage in terrorist acts, especially the ones that
					 happened on September 11 which killed over 5,000 innocent people working in
					 their offices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus my next few minutes not on the bill
					 alone. I would like to say that to fight terrorism is like having a chair. It
					 needs four legs to have balance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister of Justice is doing a fantastic
					 job on the legal end of it. However what is missing in our fight against
					 terrorism here, and especially in the United States, is the intelligence aspect
					 of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Middle East is a hotbed of
					 international problems. In the early 1950s attempts were made in Iran to
					 overthrow the shah. The CIA was involved. It brought back the shah but it
					 failed to protect its interests in the Middle East in 1979 when the shah was
					 thrown out by Ayatollah Khomeini. I think we have regretted that from that time
					 onward to this day because we were not able to predict what was going to happen
					 following the shah's fall . Then we had the Iran-Iraq war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then had the Lebanese civil war in 1983 where 241
					 U.S. marines were bombed by terrorist acts. Again, the Americans were not able
					 to get the intelligence required to defend themselves or prevent these
					 terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 1980s the U.S.S.R. fell. It was the biggest
					 empire in the world. Everybody was afraid. It was a powerful nation for over
					 1,000 years but nobody knew it was crumbling from within.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIA and the FBI have a $28 billion budget. If they
					 could not figure out what was happening in the Soviet Union for the last 50
					 years, then I am really concerned about what will happen in the next 50
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened on September 11 was, I think, an
					 intelligence failure. The U.S. knew full well that the same place had been
					 bombed by terrorists 10 years ago. Obviously they failed, and I am glad, but
					 they should have failed this time around too. The U.S. knew this thing was
					 coming up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In history there are many situations that could have
					 been prevented if we only had good intelligence. We have failed to have
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bombing of a U.S. navy ship in the south Yemen Sea
					 was due to an intelligence failure. The African embassy bombing two years was
					 also due to an intelligence failure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had many warnings that our intelligence system was
					 failing us but we never took the time to review the status of our western
					 intelligence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few weeks there were quite a few
					 documentaries on CBC telling us about the failures of our intelligence system,
					 the American intelligence system and the whole western intelligence system to
					 prevent the attack that took place on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may say so, I think this discussion should focus
					 on improving our intelligence system so we can prevent further
					 attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To describe what is happening now, I would describe it
					 as a snake. The snake's head is in Nigeria.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may recall three or four years ago that the
					 foreign affairs committee had a delegation of Algerian parliamentarians here on
					 an exchange program. The people in that country had a coup d'état against the
					 democratically elected government. It was in the news, on TV and in newspapers
					 over the last couple of years. Individuals were concerned that Muslim
					 fundamentalists were taking power from the democratically elected government.
					 From that time on things have changed. All disguised fundamentalists have now
					 congregated in Afghanistan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotbed of this conflict is of course the Middle
					 East. One does not have to say anything more when they say Middle East because
					 everyone knows what has been happening there over the last 50 years, and more
					 intensely over the last year or so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that by bombing Afghanistan only part of the
					 problem has been solved, not the whole problem. We have to go to the root of
					 the problem. No matter how many laws we pass in this place, there will not be a
					 final solution to terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, rule number one is
					 intelligence. Rule number two is more intelligence. Rule number three is even
					 more intelligence to fight terrorism.</p>

					 and Highland Valleys, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, there are obvious basic philosophical
					 differences between the Liberal Party and the Canadian Alliance. The Liberals
					 tend to be reactive, not proactive. The legislation in front of us today should
					 not have been handled and developed as emergency legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance and the Reform before it have
					 been calling on the government to recognize the shortfalls and the
					 shortsightedness in the funding of military, police and protective services for
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, this is a case where we have to pull
					 together for Canada. I will support Bill C-36, but I will point out some of the
					 things that I believe are flawed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance put forward a motion on September
					 17 which called for the naming of all known international terrorist
					 organizations operating in Canada. We asked for a complete ban on fundraising
					 activities in support of terrorism and provisions for the seizure of assets
					 belonging to terrorists or terrorist organizations. We asked for the immediate
					 ratification of the international convention for the suppression of the
					 financing of terrorism and for the creation of specific definitions of crimes
					 for engaging in terrorist training activities in Canada or inciting terrorist
					 activities abroad from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked for the prompt extradition of foreign
					 nationals charged with acts of terrorism even if the charges were capital
					 offences. We asked for the detention and deportation to their country of origin
					 of any people illegally in Canada or failed refugee claimants who were linked
					 to terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation in front of us, which I will support,
					 addresses some of those issues. I do believe, however, that we have room for
					 improvement. The legislation does nothing to remedy the current extradition
					 situation resulting from the Burns and Rafay decision made by the Supreme Court
					 of Canada. Since this decision Canada has become a safe haven for criminals.
					 That is beyond denying. It has been happening for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It allows for consecutive sentences for some terrorist
					 related crimes. Life sentences, however, are exempted. This creates a 5,000 for
					 one price on terrorism. A person is allowed to kill 5,000 people and pay the
					 same penalty as if only one life was taken. That is unjust and unfair, and it
					 needs to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation does nothing to guarantee reliable and
					 long term funding for frontline people who are working against the war on
					 terrorism. It will be ineffective unless those frontline people are given
					 guaranteed resources to enforce the provisions. That means it must be addressed
					 through a budget and it must become a priority of the entire House, not just
					 the Canadian Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation will raise civil liberty concerns. The
					 increased stability of our police and security agencies to pry into the
					 personal lives of Canadians will set off alarms from civil liberty agencies and
					 groups. Preventive arrests in investigative hearings will surely be challenged
					 by the charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it is necessary for us to take these steps
					 at this point in time, but I would like to see us take a very long and sober
					 look at putting in place a measure that would allow us to look at it again in
					 the near future. The minister attempted to give the House her word that things
					 would go well and that this would be reviewed. She said that we should not
					 worry about minor details. These are not minor details; they are very major
					 details.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members who wonder why I have a lack of trust I
					 will point to a few pieces of legislation. The Income Tax Act was a temporary
					 measure put in place many years ago. It was to fund the war effort and then
					 disappear. Not only has it not disappeared. It has increasingly taken more and
					 more money out of the pockets of everyday Canadians. That is one reason I am
					 not trusting at this point in time and I want to see something
					 stronger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had the very strong election promise from the
					 Liberal government to do away with the GST and it was ignored entirely after
					 the election.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that under this piece of legislation one
					 would be forced to testify against oneself. In the case of terrorism I am fully
					 supportive of that. One should be forced to testify and to give answers to
					 questions asked by our personnel. However there is not a case in point where
					 there is a timeline when this would elapse or when we would have an opportunity
					 to bring it back. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want the legislation in front of us, which I
					 will support, to turn into something like the Income Tax Act or any other piece
					 of legislation that has never come back before the House and has lived a long
					 life with no sign of its demise or end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Access to Information Act are
					 troubling. It would appear that the Liberals are using this critical time as an
					 opportunity to implement restrictions on access to government information by
					 Canadians. I hope that is untrue but that is the way I view it at this time.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of parliament trying to access information
					 through the current channels is next to impossible. It takes forever. I have
					 tried to access information for my constituents. They wonder why as an MP I
					 have to jump more barriers than are necessary to get information. It is
					 something that is very important and that we need to address.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation does not name any specific terrorist
					 groups operating in Canada. This information is readily available from CSIS and
					 the RCMP. When those questions were asked we were told that for reasons of
					 security the information could not be disclosed in the House. That is a very
					 difficult explanation to swallow. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed the government has made most of its
					 announcements regarding terrorism at press conferences rather than at meetings
					 with all members of the House. There are 301 members who were elected to the
					 House to represent the people of Canada. We should not leave the decisions to a
					 small handful of 12 who sit in cabinet. It is unfair and undemocratic. It is a
					 practice that must stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written codes of practice on the seizure and retention
					 of property and silent video recordings are required. Interviews of detainees
					 by police must be audio recorded in accordance with the code of practice.
					 Canadian legislation has no such safeguards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 170 page document has been a great deal to absorb
					 in a short period of time. It has been very difficult to absorb. It is not what
					 I would recommend as nightly reading. I have relied on my colleague from
					 Provencher for advice, discretion and the ability to answer questions that I am
					 unable to answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make certain this is not another case where
					 we do not get an opportunity to openly debate legislation. We must have a say
					 in how this happens. We must listen to the voices of the people whom we
					 represent. The people in my constituency of Kamloops, Thompson and Highland
					 Valleys have e-mailed, written and telephoned me. Their concerns are wide
					 ranging but the biggest concern is the secrecy behind how all this was put
					 together. I have tried to explain parts of the act to them but it is difficult
					 for me to do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to be more open. We need a better
					 understanding of what is in front of us and for once the House needs to act as
					 a team. We are all on the same team. We are looking to protect Canadians, our
					 homeland and our neighbours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act limits the power to grant bail to certain
					 higher court judges, thus limiting instances in which bail would be given.
					 Canadian legislation does not close the loophole. American legislation places
					 extensive stress on deportation provisions. We are not doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will support the legislation. I give the government
					 points for trying its best to put things together, but I urge it to listen
					 carefully to what members on both sides of the House have to say and to put
					 together something that benefits all of Canada.</p>

					 charter would have countenanced such an encroachment on the fundamental rights
					 and freedoms of Canadians. However that was then and this is now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching television last night I was struck by the
					 eagerness of some Canadians to trade their rights and freedoms for security. It
					 was both surprising and disheartening to me to hear caller after caller be
					 prepared to give the government and parliament a blank cheque. It was also
					 disheartening to hear Canadians make wild and outrageous links between
					 immigrants, refugees and security. When people are afraid they say things that
					 they would never otherwise say. They think things that they would never
					 otherwise think, and they do things that they would never otherwise do.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a test of our nation that has a reputation
					 for stability and tolerance to deal with these fears. Otherwise the terrorists
					 win. They win because neighbours turn on neighbours. Instead of reaching out we
					 turn inward. We walk away from our rights for which previous generations have
					 fought and died. The challenge is not to let terrorism win and to break this
					 cycle of victimization where victims in turn victimize. I am hopeful that the
					 justice committee will carefully scrutinize the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to look at one section of the bill that
					 deals with the listing of terrorists. At the risk of simplifying, a group is a
					 terrorist group because we say it is a terrorist group. The director of CSIS
					 would prepare a list of terrorist groups. He would hand it to the solicitor
					 general who in turn would share it with his cabinet colleagues. The cabinet
					 would gazette an organization and it is now a terrorist
					 organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I am telescoping clause 85, but it is not
					 that much fancier than that process. I appreciate the solicitor general must
					 have reasonable grounds, but what are reasonable grounds? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are reasonable grounds that which is beyond a
					 reasonable doubt, as one would have in a criminal court of law? Are reasonable
					 grounds evidence that is on the balance of probabilities such as one would have
					 in a civil setting? Will evidence that would be otherwise inadmissible be
					 accepted as evidence? Will we be operating on speculation, rumour, gossip,
					 hearsay and ambiguities?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter, as I see it, is that
					 reasonable grounds would be whatever the CSIS director thinks are reasonable
					 grounds. May I remind members what was unthinkable prior to September 11 will
					 become reasonable grounds after September 11. God forbid that there should be
					 any other incident, because what we think are reasonable grounds today will be
					 further diluted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or will the reasonable grounds be whatever the CIA or
					 the British intelligence service MI5 tells us are reasonable grounds? Will we
					 merely photocopy the lists of other intelligence services and hope that they
					 did a thorough job? What independent analysis will we apply to reasonable
					 grounds to determine whether in fact these lists have some basis in
					 law?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite but true that intelligence gathering is far
					 from precise. It relies on all kinds of sources, some of which clearly are not
					 reliable, some of which leave a lot to conjecture, in order to conclude that an
					 organization, an entity or a person is a terrorist. This is not a science; some
					 would even say it is not an art.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am perfectly prepared to concede that the top 10
					 organizations the solicitor general puts forward for his cabinet colleagues
					 will be fairly easy to identify. Even in this room there will be virtual
					 unanimity among colleagues that the top 10 would in fact be terrorist
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable people might argue quite vigorously among
					 themselves about the next 10 organizations that are on the list. There may well
					 be honestly held differences in views as to which should or should not be on
					 the list. And what about the 10 after that? There may well be wild variations
					 of opinion, but because the director of CSIS says there are reasonable grounds
					 and the solicitor general believes there are reasonable grounds, then they are
					 terrorist organizations and they will be gazetted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are labelled, what are they going to do? The 10
					 top will not care. I do not expect that Mr. bin Laden is going to be overly
					 fussed about being labelled a terrorist in Canada. The next 10 may be upset and
					 they may or may not do something. The last group however may be very upset. Its
					 members may feel that their rights to carry on an activity which they perceive
					 to be either charitable or political has been infringed and there may be some
					 basis for their concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does provide for some form of redress. The
					 solicitor general must notify the entity within 60 days of being gazetted. As I
					 said, it is not likely that Mr. bin Laden's group is going to be overly upset,
					 nor is the PLO or the Hamas or any of those other fine and noble organizations
					 which we read about in the newspaper. But there are going to be groups that are
					 upset and the likelihood is that by the labelling and gazetting, 98% of the
					 damage will have already been done. They cannot get back their reputation once
					 they have lost it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 60 day notice, a judge will convene a
					 hearing. The judge will read the real evidence and the judge will hear the real
					 evidence from a representative of the crown. Neither he nor the solicitor
					 general has to tell them about the evidence. They only have to give a summary
					 of the evidence. By the time the judge decides that the group should not have
					 been gazetted, it will be all over for that entity. The organization will be in
					 ruins, its reputation destroyed and its members despised by their
					 neighbours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that there are needs for confidentiality.
					 These are extraordinary times and people do feel insecure, but once something
					 like this happens, we can never get it back.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I say with hesitation that I will be
					 supporting Bill C-36. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to go back in history a little to the period
					 1993 to 1995. When I first came to the House, I said then what I say today,
					 that the foremost responsibility of any government is the safety and well-being
					 of its legal law-abiding citizens. Today I listen to some of the talk on both
					 sides of the House. I can well remember standing in the House and warning about
					 the flaws in our immigration policy, the flaws in our refugee system and how it
					 had to be tightened up. I can well remember being called a racist. I can well
					 remember being called a bigot. I certainly can well remember being called a
					 fearmonger for stating exactly what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member asks what has changed now. A Liberal member
					 still has the audacity and stupidity to ask that question. It is more rhetoric
					 from a jackass, pure and simple. September 11 changed the minds of those on
					 that side of the House too yet we still hear the same thing from them. It is
					 unbelievable. They will say anything to try and change what they never
					 addressed in the first place. They were well warned, not only by us but by
					 their organizations. CSIS warned them. The RCMP warned them. We read from the
					 reports and they still never accepted it. They laughed them off. It was a joke.
					 Well it is no longer a joke.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I hear the talk, the worry and the concern about
					 human rights. It is a legitimate concern but is it concern about human rights
					 or should it be about human lives? I for one would sooner have the RCMP
					 rounding up and detaining suspected terrorists than rounding up and taking the
					 families of victims of terrorists to the morgues. I think the families,
					 relatives and friends of the people who died on September 11 would have the
					 same feelings. We do not even have to ask. That is the feeling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I have concerns? We know about Assam Raheem. We
					 have stood in the House and asked the questions about Raheem. The minister
					 stood and said that they knew about it, that they worked hand in hand with the
					 American intelligence services and police forces to capture this man, that the
					 Canadian government was well aware this man came into Canada with a false
					 French passport. They say they were following his activities, tracking him and
					 helping the RCMP so they must have known this man was building a bomb in the
					 city of Vancouver. The minister was watching him. That is what was said in the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know then that he also loaded this unstable bomb
					 into the trunk of a car, drove past some of our schools and hospitals, drove
					 past the public and drove onto one of our ferries that was loaded with people.
					 He was allowed to transport the bomb down to the States. The minister knew what
					 he was doing. Again they are just trying to cover their mistakes. If they did
					 know about this and allowed a terrorist to build a bomb in the city of
					 Vancouver and transport it on our highway system, they should be held
					 accountable. That is why I have concerns.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have grave concerns about what they will do with Bill
					 C-36. When it goes to committee will some of the recommendations and concerns
					 put forward not only by this party but by other parties in the House be heard?
					 Will the government finally listen and implement them? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerns we are addressing here are not our
					 individual concerns. They are the concerns of our constituents. In my
					 constituency a great number of people who voted for me and who are members in
					 our party are first and second generation immigrants. They left their countries
					 because of the terrorist acts that go on there. They come to us with their
					 problems and the threats they receive from some of these organizations. Yet
					 when we bring them up in the House, the government turns a deaf ear. It tries
					 to label us. I find that disgusting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say we should all work together on this and I
					 agree. But some of us have long memories. Some of us well remember what was
					 said to us when we brought these issues before the House. Some of us well
					 remember what was said during the election campaign. I remember what the
					 minister of immigration said. Has there ever been an apology? No.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear concerns now that we cannot harmonize with the
					 Americans because we are likely to lose part of our identity, that the
					 Americans would want to control our immigration if we were to harmonize with
					 them. I hear concerns not only from the government side but from other members
					 in the House. I want to remind people that the United States of America was
					 built on immigration, just as our country was. Legal law-abiding immigrants
					 came to Canada but they also went to the United States and made that a great
					 nation, the same way they helped to make Canada a great nation. I find those
					 questions very distasteful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must remember what the great country of France
					 sent to the United States of America: the Statue of Liberty. There are words on
					 the Statue of Liberty that welcome all immigrants to that country. We welcome
					 immigrants too and proudly so. But does that mean we should not have concerns?
					 Does that mean we should not tighten up the system? It does not. We have been
					 reminded of that in an extreme way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we will work with the government. However no one
					 should think for one minute that the memory of some of the things that were
					 said is ever going to go away, things that were said about individual members
					 on this side of the House and also about our party. This is not the time. For
					 the right of law-abiding citizens of this country it is time we did the right
					 thing. We cannot hesitate. We have to get rid of that idea. If members think
					 bin Laden is the only terrorist in the world, I have news for them. There are a
					 lot more out there who are just as dangerous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time we started to crack down. It is time for the
					 public to demand the House to have an open and honest debate on capital
					 punishment with regard to some of these issues. It is time to have a debate on
					 deportation issues. We still do not deport people from Canada for murders they
					 committed in another country. I do not understand that. We want other countries
					 to respect our laws, why should we not respect theirs?</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to support Bill C-36
					 this evening. I add my voice to the many voices from all sides and corners of
					 the House that have spoken of the importance of the bill which is meant to
					 address incredibly foundational issues touching our democracy at this
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk a bit about the Canadian response, the
					 challenge of facing terror in a democracy, the measured response the bill
					 presents and the areas of review we will be entering into in the House and in
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian response to the evil of September 11 has
					 been widespread and has unified us as a country although we have heard
					 different expressions of how we should respond. I and my constituents in
					 Vancouver Quadra join all Canadians in expressing our horror and deep felt
					 sympathy for the families of the victims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response, starting with the some 30,000 passengers
					 diverted from American flights to Canada on September 11, has been
					 extraordinary. That has been recognized across the United States and around the
					 world. Canadians did not know at the time whether the planes harboured
					 terrorists, had bombs on board or were a threat to Canada but we willingly
					 opened our skies and airports to take those people in. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 14, 100,000 Canadians met on Parliament
					 Hill to express their deep concern and sadness over the evil event. Within a
					 day of the horror of September 11, ministers across a whole range of
					 departments were working to add new resources and expedite and tighten up
					 security measures to deal with the new reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House we have had more than 60 hours of debate
					 on various aspects of the terror and our response to it. In all the debate
					 there has been a common cause: to ensure we reach a proper balance in our
					 democracy between security and freedom in the face of this type of terror. That
					 is the challenge in front of us. It is a challenge Bill C-36 tries to
					 address.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance is a delicate one. There can be no
					 democracy without security. There can be no freedom without security. If we
					 have only security we are imprisoned. There can be no security unless we have
					 freedom, otherwise we have anarchy. This delicate balance must respect the
					 reality of the times, and the times have changed for us all as the reality of
					 September 11 has struck home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the section 1 limits of the Canadian Charter of
					 Rights and Freedoms that we must turn our attention to in Bill C-36. Our rights
					 and freedoms are subject to “such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be
					 demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society”. We must always keep
					 that limitation in mind as we measure our response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is complementary to a whole range of other
					 initiatives and pieces of legislation. It would complement and add to the
					 criminal code which covers the whole range of offences a terrorist might
					 commit. However it specifically focuses on terrorism. It would supplement and
					 build on the initiatives set out in Bill C-24, the organized crime legislation
					 passed by the House in the spring. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 would add breadth, strength and definition to
					 the provisions of the United Nations Act which allows us by regulation to
					 implement United Nations security council resolutions. It would also build on
					 the Immigration Act and give more definition to the provisions of Bill C-11 on
					 immigration.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of our international responsibilities and our
					 responsibilities to our neighbours in the United States, Bill C-36 would allow
					 us to ratify and implement the last two international conventions on terrorism:
					 the international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and the
					 international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing. This would
					 bring us into the position of having ratified and implemented all 12 UN
					 conventions on terrorism. That is immensely important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that Bill C-36 would build on the
					 hate propaganda provisions of the criminal code. It would make hate propaganda
					 a crime and allow it to be deleted from public Internet sites.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 would build on the money laundering and
					 proceeds of crime legislation we have in place to deal with criminal
					 organizations. This legislation deals mainly with enterprise crime but could
					 clearly be focused on terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is a measured response and an immensely
					 important part of the democratic exercise we are involved in. Its balance is
					 shown by a whole range of ministerial responsibilities. We would need the
					 permission of the attorney general before initiating the investigative
					 hearings, the preventive arrest provisions or the Canada Evidence Act
					 certification which would allow the CSE to intercept communications which are
					 targeted at foreign sources but enter Canadian airwaves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listing provision would need the recommendation of
					 the solicitor general and the approval of cabinet. It would need to be reviewed
					 every two years and could be challenged by the courts in judicial
					 review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, judicial oversight is woven into the whole
					 bill. Investigative hearings reviewing the listing and preventive arrest
					 provisions within 24 hours of being brought before a judge would provide
					 effective judicial oversight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important, the legislation comes out of the
					 collective wisdom of the House as expressed over the last 30 days. There are
					 issues that are still open for serious debate, and the Prime Minister and
					 Minister of Justice have indicated their intention and desire that the Standing
					 Committee on Justice and Human Rights review these concerns in detail and
					 provide further advice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will touch in particular on the important new
					 provisions regarding preventive arrest, investigative hearings, the whole
					 process of listing and delisting, parliamentary review, and the definition of
					 terror. This is the first time terror has been defined and it is an immensely
					 important centerpiece of the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested in the House that some of the
					 provisions, particularly the new ones, be made sunset clauses. The Standing
					 Committee on Justice and Human Rights will be considering ways in which the
					 legislation can be properly tracked over the next short period of time to
					 consider whether it is achieving its objective, whether there are unintended
					 consequences or whether there should be amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident in supporting Bill C-36 that it responds
					 to the common objective and common cause of every member of the House: to deal
					 with the horror and evil of terrorism in our democracy in a way that finds the
					 proper balance between security and freedom.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, since September 11, all governments on
					 this planet have been faced with a problem that is, if not entirely new, of a
					 scope never before known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All countries are today faced with new terrorist
					 threats, which are creating something akin to panic in the population at large.
					 Anthrax and other types of alerts are keeping emergency services constantly in
					 response mode. Without wishing to be a prophet of doom, I feel we are far from
					 seeing the end of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger we face--over and above the attacks or, in
					 certain cases, the supposed attacks--is the gradual paralysis of the economy,
					 of democratic institutions, and of the way we live within society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All heads of state without exception--at least all
					 those we have heard from--are calling upon us daily to continue to live our
					 lives as normally as possible, as otherwise the terrorists will have
					 accomplished their objective. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our governments have, as far as they are able, tried to
					 react so as to reassure their population. We are told this over and over. We
					 are told that all steps have been taken to ensure public safety. Nevertheless,
					 people everywhere are showing how insecure they are feeling. They are still
					 extremely fearful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada
					 has just introduced Bill C-36, which would, as its title indicates, amend the
					 criminal code, the Official Secrets Act, the Canada Evidence Act, the Proceeds
					 of Crime (Money Laundering) Act and other acts. This is known by the short
					 title of the anti-terrorism act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with this bill in principle. We agree that
					 terrorism must be fought against and also that we have to equip ourselves with
					 the means to do so, and consequently must amend legislation so that we can do a
					 better job of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We humbly submit, however, that we need to avoid
					 falling into the trap that lies before us, that is to act too hastily, to pass
					 new legislation which would far exceed its objective and would open the door to
					 all manner of abuses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periods such as the current one can easily lead to
					 excesses. Canada's recent history is not exempt from such abuse. Remember what
					 happened during the second world war. Some serious abuse took place in the past
					 in spite of the fact that we lived in a democracy. Citizens were stripped of
					 their rights, even though they had not committed any crime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the current situation, we want to
					 maintain our fundamental rights. We want to remain free. We do not want our
					 democracy to be tarnished again by abuse. We must be cautious and take the time
					 necessary to examine all the repercussions that could result from the passage
					 of Bill C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11 terrorist attacks and the continuing
					 threats at present have reached an extraordinary level and created an
					 extraordinary context. Bill C-36 must therefore be an extraordinary piece of
					 legislation to deal with an extraordinary situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the terrorist threat diminish, several of the
					 measures being considered through Bill C-36 would become unacceptable and the
					 balance between security and freedom would have to be readjusted.</p>


	<A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, this is always a fragile balance. We
					 must not forget that. This is why the Bloc Quebecois is asking the government
					 to include a sunset clause whereby certain provisions of the bill would no
					 longer be in effect after three years, unless of course the House decided
					 otherwise at that time and the need to extend such provisions was demonstrated.
					 We are also asking that this act be reviewed on a yearly basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects of Bill C-36, the
					 anti-terrorism act, that raise concerns. It seems to us that the definition of
					 a terrorist act goes too far. It is much too broad and could lead to abuse
					 against groups or individuals who have no connection with terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a very good example of this in the House today
					 when it was suggested that certain groups of protesters at the Quebec summit be
					 deemed to have committed terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would enable the attorney general to withhold
					 information by not applying the Access to Information Act, this without an
					 evaluation by the privacy commissioner and without a judicial
					 review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the attorney general, or Minister of
					 Justice, is giving herself the authority to withhold information from the
					 public, to remove elements of information, this without any consultation with
					 the information commissioner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another element which appears to carry some risk and
					 which deserves to be studied further is that the Minister of National Defence
					 could intercept international communications simply by making a written request
					 to the Communications Security Establishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the Minister of National Defence could
					 claim the power to intercept international communications between two groups,
					 individuals or businesses simply by asking the Communications Security
					 Establishment in writing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other questions could be raised and some of
					 them already have been raised by the media. Doubts have arisen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully the bill will be carefully examined before
					 being passed. As elected representatives, it is our duty to ensure that the
					 bill attains the objective for which it was created. As elected
					 representatives, it is our duty to ensure that the bill does not go too far and
					 violate the freedoms of the citizens who elected us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks, I also wanted to remind members that the
					 best way to fight terrorism is by preventing it at the source. As a democracy
					 and as a society, we must ask ourselves what the real issues are and try to
					 come up with satisfactory solutions to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by fighting poverty and misery, as we have
					 repeatedly said, that we will best succeed in changing things. It is by
					 educating and teaching that we will best be able to fight blindness and loosen
					 the grip that dictators have on poorly educated populations. It is by sharing
					 knowledge and resources that we will best succeed in creating conditions that
					 will prevent terrorist groups from springing up. It is also, and most
					 importantly, by restoring assistance to developing countries that we can best
					 intervene. It is a long term process that we must undertake
					 immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military strikes are not enough to eradicate terrorism.
					 Nor is tough legislation. These are short term measures. What is needed is a
					 new world order where human beings are held in greater value.</p>

					 (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we have been hearing
					 speaker after speaker constantly fearmongering. They are trying to associate
					 refugees with terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent a riding which is the most ethnically
					 diverse riding in Canada. One of the communities that is situated in my riding
					 is the Canadian Arab Federation. I would like members to examine the positive
					 things they are doing, like daycare, assistance to new immigrants and enriching
					 our Canadian heritage. They are feeling the heat at this point. There are those
					 who want to associate the Arabs with terrorists. Comments such as a person is
					 an Arab terrorist or a person is a Palestinian terrorist have been brought to
					 my attention. This is not acceptable, not welcomed and should be fought and
					 eradicated by all of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians of Arab descent are very sensitive to this
					 issue as well as to the Palestinian issue. It is time to take the initiative
					 with the Palestinian issue. The issue is one that has been in the forefront for
					 many decades. We need to address the Palestinian issue, not only with talks but
					 with peaceful and just solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just sent our men and women off to war. God be with
					 them and return them home safe. The legislation before us is very important. I
					 am asking all colleagues to fully support it and examine it closely. I am also
					 asking all colleagues to support the conversation on Palestine, and I know our
					 Prime Minister, being the oldest statesmen, will take the lead in
					 this.</p>

					 </b>

	moved that Bill C-269, an act to amend the
					 Criminal Code and the Firearms Act (exemption of long guns from
					 registration), be read the second time and referred to a
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to have an
					 opportunity to maintain a very strong commitment I made to the constituents of
					 my riding of Fundy--Royal and, I might add, to an issue that resonates very
					 much throughout rural Canada with regard to a piece of legislation introduced
					 by the government that may be very noble in intent in terms of deterring the
					 criminal use of firearms, but which has become one of the largest fiscal
					 boondoggles we have had in Canadian history. The bill I am referring to is
					 commonly known throughout the country as Bill C-68.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what we are advocating. We all categorically
					 agree that any modern society needs to have provisions in place with respect to
					 the handling of firearms so that individuals who acquire them are properly
					 trained in their use. We need to have provisions in place whereby firearms are
					 stored under lock and key in a place separate from the ammunition. The
					 ammunition should be in one compartment and the firearm itself in another one
					 to avoid any kind of accidental harm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be familiar with the fact that all of the
					 provisions I have outlined were in what was termed to be one of the most
					 progressive pieces of firearm legislation in the industrialized world, that is,
					 this country's legislation formerly known as Bill C-17, introduced by the
					 Progressive Conservative government. It never had a chance to be measured as to
					 the degree of success it could actually entail. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill I have put forward does this. All the safe
					 handling provisions, all the acquisition certificates that Bill C-68 and its
					 predecessor Bill C-17 had and all the issues from a safety perspective are
					 still in place, with the exception that it does not call for the registration
					 of long guns such as rifles and shotguns which are utilized throughout Canada
					 by deer hunters, duck hunters and farmers. We know that registering long guns
					 belonging to deer hunters, duck hunters and farmers will not deter the criminal
					 use of firearms. In fact, I might add that it is an arbitrary tax on those
					 individuals. What we want to do is deter the criminal use of firearms.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a surgical strike on Bill C-68, keeping the
					 good elements contained in it but extracting the most divisive element. Those
					 weapons or firearms that are not restricted or prohibited, essentially long
					 guns such as shotguns and rifles which are used by deer hunters, duck hunters
					 and farmers, are the only firearms that do not need to be registered in a
					 mandatory fashion. That is it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our modern society in this great nation hand guns
					 have been registered since the 1930s. We should never touch that issue. However
					 what I am talking about is--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b> Uncle Henry's
					 rifle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Herron:</b> The hon. member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough refers to Uncle Henry's rifle. I am not sure he
					 actually does have an Uncle Henry, but these shotguns and rifles are
					 essentially tools that a farmer may use for the protection of his livestock and
					 are kept under lock and key.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party has always resisted the long gun registry
					 because it simply does not work and it targets the wrong group. This bill is
					 what we would rather have. We know that the minister of justice of the day said
					 that the cost of implementing the registry would be at most a mere $85 million.
					 The member for Edmonton North has fought for this legislation tooth and nail
					 since she became a member of parliament. </p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just say that it was a noble intent, it was the
					 right thing to do. We disagree with it. Even if it were, we now know the price
					 tag is well above $400 million. We know that there are very prudent estimates
					 that when this thing is finally settled it will cost over $800 million to
					 actually implement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I want to make is we could use those
					 dollars toward a truly safer street agenda, including more money for the RCMP
					 for overtime, for personnel and for new technologies to fight cyber crime. In
					 the context of the world events which have taken place since September 11,
					 there is the very real issue of putting those added resources toward augmenting
					 the budget of the RCMP or even CSIS to help them fight biker gangs and
					 terrorist cells, as opposed to arbitrarily taxing deer hunters, duck hunters
					 and farmers. It just makes a lot of sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am arguing our position from a purely economic
					 perspective in this regard. Even if it was a noble intent, we now know that not
					 only was it misguided and ill-advised but it has become one of the most
					 comprehensive and expensive boondoggles that the federal government has ever
					 had throughout Canadian history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to use this private member's bill,
					 although it is non-votable, to help educate the public to the fact that any
					 reasonable parliamentarian is not against gun control or having more stringent
					 provisions to deter accidental harm from firearms. We want to ensure that we
					 have a mandatory additional penalty in place for any criminal act committed
					 with the use of a firearm. These are the kind of things that the public wants
					 us to do. They want us to deter the criminal use of firearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to make our streets safer, why do we not use
					 that $800 million? We still have about $400 million that we can save to achieve
					 a truly safer street agenda. That is why I moved Bill C-269. I made a
					 commitment to the constituents in my riding of Fundy--Royal that at the very
					 least I would do my best to keep the issue alive. That is what I am trying to
					 do with respect to this issue. Maybe that says something to accountability.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member from Cypress Hills--Grasslands has
					 been steadfast in his opposition against this arbitrary registry. I applaud him
					 for his efforts. This is an issue that transcends many party lines. It really
					 is a split on rural Canada versus urban Canada. However even urban Canadians
					 are now saying that when they fought this back in the 1997 election, they
					 thought it was the right thing to do. Now that the price tag is $400 million
					 and it might even get to as high as $800 million, they are saying that perhaps
					 we were right back in 1997, that it was a bad idea and that we were
					 concentrating on the wrong element of society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us target our energies toward criminals. Give the
					 RCMP and our law enforcement officers a tool kit to fight crime. We should take
					 the issue and weigh it on one hand, then on the other. Are we concerned with
					 terrorist cells and having the resources from a security perspective with
					 respect to the RCMP to actually flush those folks out? Are we concerned about
					 organized crime? Instead of taxing deer hunters, duck hunters and farmers, why
					 do we not give the tool kits to the RCMP to fight terrorist cells and biker
					 gangs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that long guns principally are not the weapons
					 of crime in an urban context. Therefore, we are really targeting the wrong
					 group.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a noble intent, but all of the good that we
					 are trying to get out of Bill C-269, I can advocate was already in place with
					 respect to Bill C-17. That would have been a better way to go as opposed to
					 using this useless, cumbersome long gun registry. There are a lot of
					 superlatives being added by my friends and colleagues who join me in their
					 opposition to Bill C-68 and in support of my private member's bill, Bill
					 C-269.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not even a cash cow for the government. It is so
					 bureaucratic and so expensive that it is not even paying for itself. Any other
					 reasonable government would have actually cut its losses long ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members to reflect on this particular issue
					 and then, as time goes by, find some way to keep the good and the noble intent
					 that might have been in place in Bill C-68 and ditch the long gun registry,
					 which, at its worst, is an attack on rural attack and clearly is an attack on
					 the legitimate long gun owners of rifles, rifles that are used by deer hunters,
					 duck hunters and farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank my colleagues for their encouragement

	<A NAME="Int-57650"></A><a HREF="#Int-57654"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-57647"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Stephen Owen (Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-269, an act to
					 amend part III of the criminal code and the Firearms Act, introduced by the
					 hon. member for Fundy Royal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's proposed amendments to the Firearms Act
					 would exempt all non-restricted rifles and shotguns from registration. The
					 requirements to register restricted and prohibited firearms would remain
					 unchanged, as we have heard. The proposed amendments to part III of the
					 criminal code would exempt the non-restricted rifles and shotguns from offence
					 provisions that deal with possession of a firearm without a registration
					 certificate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in Bill C-269 are inconsistent
					 with the goals and aims of the Firearms Act. This act is a very important
					 public safety initiative. It requires the licensing of firearm owners in Canada
					 and the registration of firearms in Canada by the end of 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's proposed amendments would negate the most
					 innovative part of the registration phase of the Canadian firearms program,
					 which is very important to the public safety of Canadians. The requirement to
					 register prohibited and restricted firearms has been in force for decades. It
					 is the registration of non-restricted rifles and shotguns that the Firearms
					 Act, passed in 1995, initiated that is its most innovative feature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice cannot support the changes to
					 the legislation that would challenge this contribution to public safety. She
					 cannot condone amendments that would reduce in any way individual
					 responsibility and accountability among firearms owners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rifles and shotguns are the most numerous and easily
					 acquired types of firearms in Canada. They are also the types of firearms most
					 often recovered from crime scenes. Over 40% of women killed by their husbands
					 are shot. Most of these women, 78%, are shot with legally owned firearms,
					 usually rifles and shotguns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration links owners to their firearms. This
					 accountability for registered firearms also increases the likelihood of
					 compliance with safe storage and handling practices. It encourages owners to be
					 more careful when they loan firearms and to tell police when firearms are
					 stolen. Excluding rifles and shotguns from registration would remove the vast
					 majority of guns in Canada from this increased accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration of non-restricted rifles and shotguns
					 provides police with a new tool to investigate and prosecute firearm related
					 crime involving firearms. Registration will assist in deterring illegal sales
					 of firearms in Canada as all firearms are registered to new owners at the point
					 of sale. Registered firearms cannot easily be given or sold to an unlicensed
					 individual as they can be traced back to the original owner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration is also an important link in the process
					 of keeping firearms from people who pose a threat to public safety. The
					 transfer of ownership of a firearm initiates a background check of the person
					 buying a gun, whether it be a pistol, rifle or shotgun.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration is also important to curbing illicit trade
					 and smuggling in firearms. Registration also allows firearms to be traced and
					 tracing can reveal the paths and sources that smugglers use. Such information
					 is essential to finding and stopping the illegal flow of firearms into and out
					 of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has important obligations in the area of
					 countering firearm trafficking and preventing firearms from going into the
					 black market. In fact this summer Canada joined several countries in signing a
					 firearms protocol toward that end, at a UN small arm's conference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firearms Act is essential to public safety and the
					 registration of rifles and shotguns is a major part of the Canadian firearms
					 program. The Firearms Act, including its registration component, is supported
					 by more than 350 public health, domestic violence, police and community
					 organizations and numerous polls done over the past years show it has the
					 support of more than 70% of the Canadian public. The law enforcement community
					 supports the firearms program as a valuable tool in reducing the number of
					 crimes involving firearms and assisting police in investigating and solving
					 crimes involving firearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firearms owners will see benefits too. Stolen firearms
					 that are registered can be returned to their lawful owners. Registered firearms
					 of sentimental or antique value can be more easily passed on through
					 inheritance and registration papers are proof for use in insurance purposes.
					 The firearms program is a success in terms of public safety.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons the Minister of Justice does not

					 and the Firearms Act.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-57654"></A><a HREF="#Int-57657"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-57650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have quite a bit to say and I will go
					 through my points quite quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compliment the hon. member for Fundy
					 Royal for bringing the bill forward. While it does not meet our party's policy
					 to repeal and replace Bill C-68, it is a step in the right direction.
					 Consequently, our party supports the hon. member's bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If even one argument given by the Liberals in the
					 speech that was just delivered before mine were true we might support it, but
					 not one of those arguments is valid or working.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the gun registry is likely the most costly and
					 useless part of Bill C-68, it is hardly the most objectionable. Bill C-68
					 trampled fundamental property rights. Bill C-68 breached the privacy rights of
					 at least 3.5 million Canadians without their knowledge. Bill C-68 placed in
					 jeopardy our charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search and
					 seizure. Bill C-68 eliminated our right to remain silent. Bill C-68 reversed
					 the onus of proof, thereby eliminating our rights to be presumed innocent until
					 proven guilty. It infringes on the treaty rights of aboriginal people. It
					 intrudes unnecessarily into the exclusive constitutional jurisdiction of the
					 provinces over property and civil rights, health, safety and
					 education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are just a few of the more objectionable contents
					 of Bill C-68 and the reasons why the whole thing should be scrapped and why we
					 need to sit down with the provinces and responsible firearms' owners and design
					 a system of gun control that will be effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 29 the privacy commissioner reported a fact
					 that should have embarrassed the government. The media should have jumped on it
					 but they did not. Most provinces and territories have opted out of the
					 administration of the firearms program than have opted in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 11 of his report the privacy commissioner
					 stated, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There are 6 opt-in provinces that
						  administer the Firearms Program themselves and 7 opt-out provinces and
						  territories where the Federal Government administers the Program.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the idea of co-operative federalism under
					 this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new B.C. government has expressed its distaste for
					 the gun registry and just last week I heard rumours that it will seriously
					 consider opting out of the administration of the gun registry component of Bill
					 C-68.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If B.C. goes there would be eight provinces and
					 territories that already have opted out. They are trying to send a message to
					 the federal government. Here is quote to show why it must be replaced and
					 repealed in its entirety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 13, 1995, the then leader of the Reform Party
					 stated, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I therefore submit in conclusion that
						  Bill C-68, if passed into law, will not be a good law. It will be a bad law, a
						  blight on the legislative record of the government, a law that fails the three
						  great tests of constitutionality, of effectiveness and of democratic consent of
						  the governed. What should be the fate of a bad law? It should be repealed,
						  which is precisely what a Reform government will do when it eventually replaces
						  this government.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years later, with more than half a billion dollars
					 wasted and a bloated bureaucracy of 1,800 people, I can say that Bill C-68
					 still fails the three tests of constitutionality, of effectiveness and of
					 democratic consent of the government. I would like to give, as quickly as
					 possible, 10 reasons why we should repeal it right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it has already cost at least one life. The
					 Liberals defend their soon to be billion dollar boondoggle by saying that if
					 the gun registry saves one life it will be worth it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 15, 2000, a man in Nain, Newfoundland, who was
					 prohibited from owning a firearm, went to the RCMP, picked up the rifle they
					 had been storing for him and has been charged with killing a 15 year old boy.
					 The aboriginal exemptions and adaptations in Bill C-68 likely forced the RCMP
					 to give the man his murder weapon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Bill C-68 costs are at least six times higher
					 than promised. According to access to information requests, Bill C-68 has cost
					 more than $500 million and is not even fully implemented yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 the justice minister promised it would only
					 cost $85 million. The Liberals have resorted to using cabinet secrecy to hide
					 the gun registry budgets and economic impact reports from the public, and I
					 still cannot get that information.</p>


	<A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Bill C-68 is opposed by the majority of
					 provinces and territories. In 1995 the Liberals rammed Bill C-68 through
					 parliament and down the throats of the provinces. In February 2000 six
					 provinces and two territories challenged the constitutionality of the
					 legislation in the supreme court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Bill C-68 has increased black market gun sales.
					 The justice minister's own group on firearms warned her that Bill C-68 created
					 so much red tape trying to regulate legal gun sales that black market gun sales
					 were on the increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Bill C-68 is opposed by frontline police
					 officers. Every survey ever taken by the police shows that between 76% and 91%
					 of frontline police officers oppose Bill C-68. According to police sources Bill
					 C-68 alienates honest citizens and diminishes respect for the law. In March the
					 president of the Canadian Police Association stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It bothers me that the public would
						  not support me in my line of duty. We've never been at odds with the public
						  before. This issue has done this.</small></td>
</tr>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constable John Gayder wrote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In fact, the Firearms Act violates
						  every one of Peel's Principles of policing</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the gun registry is riddled with errors. The
					 Liberals have so badly bungled the implementation of the bill that
					 registration, licensing errors and non-compliance by millions of responsible
					 firearms owners render the data in the gun registry unreliable and useless to
					 police. Aboriginal people are publicly defying the licensing and registration
					 system. The government admits that 320,000 gun owners failed to apply for a
					 firearms licence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCMP Superintendent Mike Buisson, director of firearms,
					 advised his staff that 90% of registration applications have errors. Despite
					 this fact daily production quotas have been tripled. Verifiers have been laid
					 off and staff directed to ignore the errors on registration applications. The
					 firearms registry is the biggest garbage collection system in the
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, Bill C-68 has taken police off the street. In
					 April a briefing note to the Minister of Justice reported that there were over
					 1,800 employees associated with the firearms program. This included about 400
					 employees in RCMP operations in Ottawa. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report to the minister did not include the hundreds
					 of firearms officers working for provincial, regional and municipal police
					 forces. On September 21, 1995, Ontario Solicitor General Bob Runciman told the
					 Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After September 11, should we not be paying attention
					 to where we should be putting our public safety law enforcement
					 officers?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighth, Bill C-68 has diverted resources from real
					 policing priorities. More than half a billion dollars wasted so far on this
					 fatally flawed gun registry scheme could have been used for more important
					 police priorities. The police wanted a sex offender registry or a DNA databank
					 for all criminals. One of the Canadian police association's slogans was
					 “Register criminals before firearms”. Is the government listening? No, it is
					 not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninth, Bill C-68 proved that registration does lead to
					 confiscation. I will not go into the details, but it has happened. On November
					 15, 1997, the Montreal <i>Gazette</i> quoted the Deputy Prime Minister as
					 saying: </p>

<td><small>This could be the start of a global
						  movement that would spur development of an instrument to ban firearms worldwide
						  similar to our land mines initiative.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting a new law to replace Bill C-68 the Liberal
					 government must understand that it is impossible to make anyone safer by laying
					 a piece of paper beside a gun. What should we do? We should be positive and
					 replace Bill C-68 with legislation based on fundamental principles. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should crack down on criminals who use weapons, not
					 responsible firearms owners. It should be easy to understand, administer and
					 enforce the system. It should be cost effective and reduce the criminal use of
					 firearms. </p>

					 taxpayers to share the cost because everyone benefits from improved public
					 safety. It should be able to pass a public safety test administered by the

					 the fundamental rights of all individuals, especially property

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we will not have an
					 opportunity to extend the debate. I want to compliment the member for Cypress
					 Hills--Grasslands who has been steadfast in his work on this particular file.
					 For the most part, I completely concur with his comments. I applaud his
					 commitment to his own constituents on this particular issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member pointed out the very real fact that 6
					 out of 10 provinces, representing well over 80% of the population, whose
					 provincial governments for the most part will have to pay for a lot of the
					 implementation of that ill-advised act, opposed the Liberal long gun
					 registry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, even in rural Canada, that taxing deer
					 hunters, duck hunters and farmers does not make any sense. We should be
					 focusing our energies on mandatory penalties for those individuals who commit
					 crimes using a firearm. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that the benchmark of any law should be
					 whether it is effective at obtaining its objectives, which is to deter the
					 criminal use of firearms, and whether it is cost effective. We know in point of
					 fact that it is not effective in deterring the criminal use of firearms. We
					 also now know that something that was supposed to cost only $85 million will
					 probably cost at least $800 million once it is fully implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this modern era, since September 11, why do we not
					 use those additional resources to ensure the security and perimeter of this
					 country in terms of the appropriate border officials from a customs perspective
					 and the ports police? Those issues should be addressed as well. Let us give
					 that money to the RCMP for new technology to fight cyber crime or the
					 subversive elements that exist internationally. We could give the money to CSIS
					 to augment its budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us give more money to the RCMP to fight organized
					 crime as opposed to taxing rural Canadians who are owners of long guns and
					 shotguns. These rifles are owned by our neighbours. They are the people who
					 would comply with the law. The biker gangs will not be running out to the
					 kiosks in malls to register their long guns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very impressed with the comment made by the
					 member for Cypress Hills--Grasslands with respect to the massive increase in
					 black market sales that has taken place with respect to firearms. That was
					 essentially what we were very much trying to resist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a modern society everybody knows that we need to
					 have stringent regulations with respect to firearms to prevent accidental harm
					 to individuals. We need to ensure that we have rules in place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we should maintain the mandatory registry for
					 handguns. That has been in place since the 1930s. However, it is not about
					 handguns and it is not about Uzis, for which there may be debate in the states,
					 it is about long guns, ones that are used by everyday hunters and everyday
					 farmers who live throughout this great country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would move to seek unanimous consent for this private
					 member's bill to be votable so hon. members could have a chance to vote on

					 (Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, BQ):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2001, I put a question to
					 the Minister of Human Resources Development in the House—it was the
					 parliamentary secretary who replied—about Air Canada employees, who were going
					 through a very difficult time financially as a result of the events of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked her at that time whether the government was
					 prepared to take special action in order to reduce the impact of the massive
					 layoffs resulting from the crisis caused by the acts of terrorism, which was
					 affecting the airlines in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, there have been meetings but no results. We
					 are still awaiting a response. Air Canada employees are calling for a program
					 of assistance for older workers, to provide those who have the most experience
					 but are prepared to retire with a program to bridge the gap between the time
					 they leave their job and the time they start to receive old age or other
					 pension benefits. This would allow younger employees to keep their jobs and
					 would be a very desirable approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is expected that 750 people will show
					 up tomorrow to demand that the federal government act accordingly and take
					 appropriate steps.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a blatant example of the fact that, since
					 September 11, in terms of activities in support of the economic downturn, the
					 federal government's position is probably the weakest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the security issue, the government
					 introduced anti-terrorism legislation, and several ministers appeared before
					 the various committees, but in terms of social support, in connection with the
					 layoffs, we are having a harder time convincing the government that special
					 measures are indeed necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the area of tourism, the government of
					 Quebec recently unveiled an advertising campaign to encourage tourists to start
					 flying again, to come and visit Quebec, to enjoy, as they always have, our
					 quality of life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen nothing similar from the federal
					 government, especially not for those affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel agencies made representations to us. The
					 minister's office had to be contacted. Support on this issue is significant,
					 but ad hoc interventions are always required before any openness is shown at
					 the department, so that those hit by the massive layoffs resulting from the
					 events of September 11 can benefit from what ought to come naturally, that is
					 an open attitude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the parliamentary secretary to confirm
					 today that, indeed, there will be openness in resolving the matter of the Air
					 Canada employees and that they will be allowed to have a program to help older
					 employees who may wish to voluntarily leave the company do so under reasonable
					 circumstances, so that younger workers may keep their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a legitimate request. Several weeks
					 have passed since the events of September 11, and we are awaiting a positive
					 response from the government very soon.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt the employees of Air
					 Canada have faced difficult, if not extremely difficult, days and weeks. There
					 is no doubt that all employees in air transportation will be profoundly
					 affected by the announced layoffs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just read in today's paper of other possible
					 layoffs, especially in the Montreal area. Our government knows very well that,
					 where jobs are involved, it is already difficult enough to deal with the
					 precariousness of some of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure my colleague opposite that we
					 are doing everything in our power to help the employees affected and their
					 company, in this time of uncertainty and great difficulty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Air Canada employees? The Minister of
					 Human Resources Development has expressed this same message of concern about
					 employees who have been laid off and those who may be very soon to the
					 representatives of Air Canada, when she met them at the beginning of the
					 month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is important to look at the chronology of
					 what the department, and the minister in particular, have done. She again made
					 herself perfectly clear on this at another subsequent meeting with
					 representatives of the department and of Air Canada at which programs available
					 from HRDC to help their employees were discussed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job share program is precisely one of the measures
					 HRDC has proposed to Air Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked by a number of people just what this
					 job sharing is all about. It is a very interesting program, one that does not
					 necessarily suit all companies, but which could be put in place in the case of
					 Air Canada, for example, or any other company that meets the program criteria.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to help employers forced to take
					 austerity measures, and this means that layoffs may be avoided.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this result be achieved? The work week is
					 shortened, and wages are reduced accordingly. HRDC lets the workers draw EI
					 benefits for the days they do not work, which helps compensate for the
					 reduction in wages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in participating workplaces, employees receive
					 partial salaries but also draw employment insurance benefits. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main advantage of this program is what it has to
					 offer employees. Not only does it help lessen the difficulties surrounding
					 layoff, but it also helps workers retain their skills and continue to make
					 profitable use of them in their work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step between the employers and the department
					 was a meeting between departmental and Air Canada representatives. So far,
					 discussions have mainly focused on job sharing as a means of reducing the
					 number of layoffs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the ball is in the airlines' and unions' court, as
					 they have to look at the mechanisms of application they would like to see put
					 in place in connection with the job sharing agreements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident at this time that good will and
					 flexibility will make it possible for us to support one or more job sharing
					 agreements in the airline industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the government to act. The time for studies and

					 has been a lot of talk about shared jobs. Indeed, this is an interesting
					 program. But why not also have a program to assist older employees, as people
					 are calling for? In other words, some flexibility reflecting the makeup of the
					 workforce of this company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the government going to decide to take action, to
					 send definite signals and to initiate the changes sought by workers and
					 justified by the state of the economy at the moment?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what those who are going to demonstrate
					 on Parliament Hill tomorrow are thinking, but I sincerely wonder how aware they

					 find a solution with the department.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell the member that we expect to receive a
					 request to approve work sharing from Air Canada shortly and that, when we do,
					 we will pass it along to a team, within the department which was put together
					 for that purpose and which will proceed as quickly as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasize—and I say this to the member—that the
					 employment insurance program is there to help Air Canada employees. The
					 department will work with Air Canada, as it has already begun to do. We have

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, since the tragic events of September 11 we
					 in the federal New Democratic Party have condemned in the strongest possible
					 terms as crimes against humanity the terrorist attacks of September 11. We call
					 for the perpetrators to be brought to justice before an international tribunal
					 to be established by the United Nations Security Council and approved by the UN
					 General Assembly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been clear in opposing the federal
					 government's decision to commit Canadian military support to the U.S. led
					 military action, particularly given that the U.S. has indicated that it may be
					 prepared to expand its attacks to other countries beyond
					 Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also supported calls to work in the longer term
					 to eradicate the conditions from which despair, violence, hatred and discord
					 arise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also urged the federal government to lead all
					 Canadians in fighting against the rising tide of intolerance and racism in the
					 aftermath of September 11, particularly directed at Muslims and Arab Canadians.
					 That is the focus of my remarks in the House tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the most ethnically mixed and
					 multicultural nations in the world. My own riding of Vancouver East, which I am
					 very proud to represent, is one of the most diverse in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can all be proud that the very meaning of
					 Canada is about diversity and respecting differences, we must also come to
					 terms with the fact that nearly 275,000 Canadians were victims of hate crimes
					 last year according to Statistics Canada. Sadly since September 11 the number
					 of racist incidents in Canada has been on the rise. We have heard of them as
					 they have been reported in the media. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cold Lake, Alberta, Canadian born Muslims got phone
					 calls telling them that all Arabs should be killed. In Oakville, Ontario five
					 students were assaulted for being Arabs. In Ottawa a young Arab teen was beaten
					 unconscious by two other teenagers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only begin to imagine the human pain and
					 suffering that this causes, particularly for young people who are trying to
					 come to terms with what is going on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that according to the police in Ottawa
					 there has been a doubling of racist incidents reported in our national capital
					 since the attack on the World Trade Center Other cities are also reporting a
					 significant increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP have called on the federal government to
					 take urgent action to fight racism and discrimination. We have urged the
					 federal government to adopt an action plan that would include public discussion
					 and education and clear enforcement of the criminal code sections concerning
					 racism. We have called on the government to appoint a task force to monitor the
					 reported incidents of racism and to monitor police investigations and
					 prosecutions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also call on the Liberal government to reaffirm
					 Canadian values and support for multiculturalism that was introduced as
					 Canadian policy in 1971 by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Back in
					 1971 the New Democratic Party welcomed that commitment. Our leader of the day,
					 the Hon. David Lewis, clearly stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The diversity of cultures across
						  (Canada) is a source of our greatness as a people...in every society a minority

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to heed the words of Mr. Lewis today. We need

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly all members of the government and the hon.

					 and discrimination in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister indicated in his reply to the
					 hon. member's question, he has consistently condemned hate motivated threats
					 and acts on virtually every occasion on which he has commented on the aftermath

					 fact that the Criminal Code of Canada contains provisions which can and should
					 be used to address the problem of hate motivated crime. Sections 318 and 319 of
					 the code provide the offences of advocating or promoting genocide or public
					 incitement of hatred against an identifiable group. These measures have been
					 used effectively in prosecuting hate motivated crimes in the case of Keegstra
					 and others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 parliament passed what the Supreme Court of
					 Canada called the most significant reform of the law of sentencing in Canadian
					 history. One of the key elements of those reforms was the inclusion in the
					 criminal code of a statement of the purpose and principles of sentencing.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the principles in the criminal code is found
					 subsection 718.2(<i>a</i>)(i), which states that “evidence that the offence was
					 motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin,
					 language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual
					 orientation or any other similar factor” shall be deemed to be an aggravating
					 circumstance in sentencing. This means that if the court finds that the offence
					 was motivated by hate based on one of these grounds, the sentence should be
					 increased to reflect society's condemnation of that fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A threat, or in the case that the hon. member cited, an
					 assault against one member of a religious group can be designed to have an
					 impact on all members of that group by creating an environment of fear and
					 intimidation among them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change to the law appears to be having an impact
					 on sentencing patterns. The leading case on the interpretation of subsection
					 718.2(<i>a</i>)(i) comes from the hon. member's province and mine. In Regina v
					 Miloszewski, five men, all self-proclaimed racists, who kicked and beat a Sikh
					 man to death in the parking lot of a temple in Surrey pleaded guilty to
					 manslaughter. The lengthy sentences imposed showed that this subsection had a
					 significant influence on the sentencing judge. Judge Stewart said the
					 subsection was “a direction to sentencing judges to give substantial weight to
					 this aggravating factor as the section now reflects the will of Canadians as
					 expressed by parliament”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week another hate crime was dealt with in a
					 New Brunswick court. A 19-year-old man was convicted of placing a cross on the
					 lawn of a black family and lighting it on fire. He was found guilty of willful
					 promotion of hatred and sentenced to four months in jail. He was also placed on
					 three years probation, the maximum permitted by the code, and ordered to
					 undergo sensitivity therapy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases such as these show that we have the tools in our
					 law to respond sternly to hate based crime.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the comments of the
					 hon. member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Prime Minister and in fact all leaders
					 and my own leader presented a motion for the unanimous approval of the House
					 condemning the increase in racism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disappointing that the government has not been
					 forthcoming or specific in terms of what it now intends to do when it is
					 clearly visible to us that certain groups, members of the Muslim community,
					 Canadian Arabs in particular, are being targeted as a result of the aftermath
					 of September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I again urge the government to be committed to a
					 specific action plan that focuses on broad education. For example, the $500,000
					 that is in the budget now is already committed. We need to be doing additional
					 work in this area and setting up a special task force to monitor these report
					 crimes. I would ask the member to respond to that specifically.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member's
					 suggestions. I think all of us in the House support the condemnation of hate
					 motivated crimes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many provinces have hate crimes units. British Columbia
					 has one which looks into such matters through the province's prosecution
					 services and police forces. Canada's multiculturalism programs must give these
					 issues the special attention they are due.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this week the Minister of Justice tabled in the
					 House the government's package of anti-terrorism measures. Included in Bill
					 C-36 is an amendment that would create a new criminal offence of mischief to
					 religious buildings or property which is “motivated by bias, prejudice or hate
					 based on religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures, in addition to the provisions I have
					 mentioned and the multiculturalism policies of Canada, can be focused on the
					 concerns the hon. member has raised.</p>
