In years gone by, this was not so.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, Donna Giberson, legally blind and suffering from epilepsy and physical disabilities, struggled with her studies and eventually quit school in the seventh grade.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at the age of 62, Ms. Giberson has re-entered the seventh grade in hopes of obtaining her high school diploma.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Giberson lives in Lakeville, New Brunswick, and studies by correspondence. She spends eight hours a day, six days a week, studying with the aid of a high resolution magnifying glass.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hard work is paying off.  She recently achieved marks of 100% on two tests and she will finish the seventh grade in  the very near future. From there, it is on to the eighth grade and so on, until she receives her high school diploma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna Giberson's story is an inspiration to all those who believe that learning is a lifelong experience.  She has made her church, her community and her member of Parliament very proud.</p>

Infrastructure is crumbling and maintenance is suffering.  Park  employees are doing their very best with the little they have but the problems are only mounting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we have heard about parks from the government is that it  wants more of them, but it  is failing to care for the ones it has.  More money is needed in the upcoming budget to maintain and improve the parks' crumbling infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question should be asked: Why is Parks Canada's budget being used to maintain interprovincial truck routes, like the Yellowhead Highway?  If the federal government expects Parks Canada to continue to maintain the Yellowhead Highway out of its operating budget, it should increase Parks Canada's budget accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I had the opportunity to take part in the induction of our national anthem, <i>O Canada</i>, into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, <i>O Canada</i> was officially proclaimed our national anthem, but even then it is   a song with a history.  It had been composed 100 years earlier, in 1880, by Calixa Lavallée, with lyrics by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier.  The song caught on, gained popularity  and several English versions were produced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1908, Robert Stanley Weir wrote the version on which today's anthem is based.  The stirring melody and patriotic lyrics in both official languages still resound with all Canadians who, “with glowing hearts...stand on guard” for this great country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend the Songwriters Hall of Fame for its recognition of our national anthem, <i>O Canada</i>.</p>

The bonspiel is a testament to determination and self-sufficiency, proving that blind and visually impaired Canadians are equally active in their communities, equipped with many abilities, not disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish all the curlers, in particular the team from my constituency of Kelowna, a great week of competition and thank them for their efforts in raising awareness of the challenges facing the blind and visually impaired.

Robert Thibault (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I not only stand corrected, but I stand before the House to present Bill C-12, as amended and reported by committee. As members may recall, Bill C-36 was the first attempt to modernize one of Canada's oldest pieces of legislation, the Quarantine Act. This bill was introduced in the last parliamentary session on May 12, 2004, but died on the order paper when the election was called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 8 of 2004, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-12 into the House of Commons, the newly proposed Quarantine Act, an act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases arriving into Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quarantine Act is an essential tool to prevent communicable diseases from entering the country, spreading throughout the population, and from spreading outside of our borders. That is why these amendments to the act, which have not been significantly modernized since 1872, are a priority at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the clause by clause review, members of the Standing Committee on Health made significant contributions toward strengthening the bill. During witness testimony, committee members listened to the issues raised by external stakeholders and put forward amendments to reflect their ideas or concerns. Common themes emerged throughout this process and in the spirit of collaboration, resolution was achieved, meeting the expectations of all parties. This comprehensive bill reflects the efforts and commitment of dedicated members and responds to the modern challenges of public health in the 21st century. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, report stage provides the House with an opportunity to further refine Bill C-12. In response to this legislative review process, the Government of Canada has taken the liberty to introduce report stage amendments to the bill. These amendments are minor and technical in nature, but critical in terms of producing an optimal piece of legislation to protect the health and safety of Canadians. They will add clarity to the bill and remedy drafting oversights largely due to the accelerated pace of this examination process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of collaboration, it is my wish that House members demonstrate ongoing support for the work and contribution made toward strengthening the bill on behalf of the Standing Committee on Health.</p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1115612"></A><a HREF="#Int-1115642"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1115593"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the bill.  We have been through the bill clause by clause, and  it is an important bill to support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of concerns.  We need to be very proactive around dealing with things like the SARS crisis, and perhaps the bird flu.  We need to be very conscious about developing regulations around this.  We have seen that it can be an  incredibly  slow and tedious process.  Therefore, it is critical that we get off the mark on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of screening officers is a major concern.  It appears that we will be forcing customs officers to take on another role, that of medical professional.  This would be on  top of their present duties, including enforcing the Customs Act, looking for potential terrorists and stopping material that could harm our flora and fauna.  It is too much to expect one group to enforce that many rules effectively.  We need close consultation with our colleagues at   customs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Nursing Association pointed out that the emerging diseases often have unique symptoms.  Screening officers  will have to be continually trained and supported to ensure they know what to watch for.  A bad cough  is not only the sign of a potential epidemic.  The bill does not explain how this system  would  be supported over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One lesson we learned from the SARS epidemic was the lack of coordination and official communication responsibilities during the crisis.  Again, the Canadian Nursing Association recommends that the chief public health officer and the Public Health Agency of Canada should have a critical role in any epidemic or suspected epidemic.  They were not included in the bill because enabling legislation to create that position and organization is still being written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the government to act quickly on the legislation. Everyone who spoke to the committee emphasized how important it was to have a clear authority.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1115642"></A><a HREF="#Int-1115762"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1115612"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Bloc Québécois on Bill C-12 to update the Quarantine Act.  Since this act dates back to the 19th century, the proposed amendments will modernize it and make it workable and more in line with today's various epidemiological contexts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois supports the principles behind the bill, and raised a number of questions in committee.  We need to realize first the ways epidemics spread in the 18th and 19th centuries are completely different the way they spread today.  People were far less mobile, and if they did travel it was mainly by train.  Nowadays, the major vectors in the transmission of epidemics include means of transportation such as aircraft.  Certain provisions of the act will require all carriers to report any illness or death occurring on board before they arrive in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand that the Quarantine Act has nothing to do with control mechanisms within the country.  Those are the responsibility of the various public health agencies.  Its purpose is rather to focus on the transmission of epidemics at the various Canadian entry and exit points. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its present form, the bill requires travellers who have a communicable disease, or who have been in close proximity to a person who has a communicable disease, to present themselves to a screening officer or quarantine officer, so that a number of controls can be performed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that, throughout its proceedings, the Standing Committee on Health was concerned that the travellers who will be checked by a screening officer or a quarantine officer should have various forms of recourse available to them. For example, a number of committee members proposed amendments that were adopted to ensure that the controls performed by quarantine officers are carried out within a reasonable period of time. We felt that this period should be less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Quarantine Act gives to the Minister of Health the power to establish quarantine zones.  We may think that these quarantine zones will be created primarily in airport facilities, but they will not necessarily be limited to these areas. If the Bloc Québécois has one regret, this is it. Even though we worked in relative harmony in committee, and even though the Bloc Québécois supports the objectives of this legislation, we would have liked the bill to clearly state that a quarantine zone and perimeter cannot be established without the approval of  the health authorities involved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the very specific example of the Dorval Airport. If, among a group of travellers arriving from Sri Lanka—I am giving this example to illustrate my point—a source of infection is identified, in this specific case, we would have liked the quarantine zone to be established only with the approval of the Quebec health and social services department. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Bloc Québécois proposed amendments which, unfortunately, were not adopted by the committee and, consequently, by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had many debates in committee, including on SARS. Although it is particularly relevant to Toronto and Ontario, the committee members asked specific questions. It is true that this bill will enable the minister to make regulations concerning a number of very important definitions and  questions.</p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered whether it would be relevant to be able to offer compensation to people held in a quarantine zone and possibly prevented from returning to their work or families for 24, 48 or 72 hours. We wondered if it might not be a good idea to compensate those people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is not easy to set a standard. Some  colleagues mentioned the average industrial wage. I think the minister should look into the question again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in quarantine does involve some restriction of personal freedom and possibly being deprived of the right to work. However, the amendment on this was not adopted by the committee. I believe the chair did not want to agree to this kind of amendment in case it would commit public funds and thus require a royal recommendation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also looked at the responsibility of the operators of facilities, for example, an airport where quarantine has been declared. Obviously, an emergency is involved. The parliamentary secretary reminded us in committee that the Quarantine Act has not been used in the past 100 years. It is not therefore a everyday measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to the extent that the Quarantine Act is invoked, what responsibility should this government and Parliament assign to those running such facilities? In fact, they will have to give up their space, their equipment and collaborate with the government as is to be expected in socio-health crises. Personally, I must say that I agree with the idea of granting some type of compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fear, among others, of airline representatives. It must be recognized that often the airlines and their staff are the ones coming into contact with the passengers arriving at their facilities. Airports could be induced to give up part of their facilities. We are comfortable with the idea that there would be some compensation for this.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision in the bill, a schedule that cabinet will be able to review. This schedule lists a number of diseases that could result in quarantine. Some of the ones identified are viral. Others were added to the list based on changes in medicine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, we made sure, if it ever became necessary to add a disease or infection to the list in Schedule I of the bill, that the conditions were in place to allow this to be done quite quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore believe this is an exceptional bill in that it  should be used in unusual situations. The aim of this bill is to make the Quarantine Act even more effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will support this bill and the main amendments included in the notice paper . I believe that all the members did a good job in committee. In fact, we clearly understand that such a bill was essential in a world where germs and diseases can assume proportions that, today, require our vigilance as citizens and as parliamentarians.</p><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-12 is an important piece of legislation. It  deals with  individuals who may be carrying a communicable disease, travellers who are arriving  by airplane or ship. It also deals with   conveyances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not really dealt with the Quarantine Act since 1872.  This is the first time we have looked at it since that period of time, which  was certainly long before air travel.  We can imagine  some of the changes that have  transpired in our country since that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-12 is very important. The alarms went  off with the spread of SARS in our country.  When SARS first came into the nation we really did not know what it was.  Canada was the nation that actually alerted the world to the threat of SARS.  There was no name for it at the time; we really did not know what we were looking at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting now when we see what actually transpired.  We were very quick to realize  that we are only a plane ride away from any communicable disease that perhaps is ravaging the world at any particular time.  It is very important that we have a piece of legislation that can  protect the nation from an onslaught of this type of  disease.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are  other diseases such as the avian flu.  We understand it began in poultry.  I was at the agriculture committee yesterday. We had a review of the avian flu in birds which  devastated the province of British Columbia. The World Health Organization is  very concerned about the avian flu. It has now mutated. Dozens of deaths  have occurred due to the avian flu in southeast Asia.  We understand the potential of a global threat and perhaps a pandemic  coming from a mutation of this one disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of SARS and in light of  the advent of the onslaught of this disease around the world, it is very important that we look at this legislation.  It was very important back when SARS hit, yet the government tabled the bill shortly before it decided to call  an election.  It was more important to play politics than it was to protect the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party believes that the number one thing  a government can provide for its citizens is protection.  That did not seem to be a priority back then, but it is a priority now. I am pleased that the health committee was able to seriously look at the legislation, review it, update it and offer some necessary  changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was good cooperation in the committee.  I  compliment the parliamentary secretary for his cooperative work on  our concerns.  The committee was able to achieve many amendments to this piece of legislation prior to report stage.  From that aspect I think we are quite pleased with some of the things  contained in Bill C-12. I am quite concerned with a couple of amendments that were deemed  out of order.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in clause 6 the bill talks about compensation for airports.  I believe that after royal assent six airports  will have to provide space for  use by a quarantine officer.  The airports will be obligated to provide not only the space but also all the fixtures to go along with it,  such  as heating and electricity, free of charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the government would put this kind of an onus on the airport authorities across the country.  At one time the airports were federally run and controlled but now that is not the case.  The airports are controlled by airport authorities.  The airport authorities are paying a significant amount of money into the federal coffers.  It is actually a tax upon our airport system and there is a real debate in the country as to whether that is fair.  It puts our airlines at a considerable disadvantage to other airlines and airports around the world.</p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that last year alone the airport authorities paid  $235 million in rent for those facilities.  As part of that rent they are providing services  to the Canada Border Services Agency, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, Transport Canada, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority and the RCMP. That is part of the  arrangement that is included in the package.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now six airports will be  called upon to provide extra space.  They will have   cough that up without being able to recoup the cost. We all know there is only one way to recoup  the cost and that is to raise the price of airline tickets. We are quite concerned about that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quarantine Act is used very seldom, and rightfully so.  It should be used very seldom.  It  removes a tremendous amount of rights and privileges that citizens of this country have.  When the act is applied and those rights are removed, they are being removed    for a greater good, which is the safety of the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the act  should be applied very seldom, but when applied it should be applied very aggressively. The Quarantine Act will only work as long as it is complied with.  It is very important that be the way we proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment we put forward addressed the issue of a hotel being  quarantined and everyone  setting up shop in it. The hotel owner  would not be compensated under this piece of legislation.  In fact, the legislation indicates that  it may or may not be compensated.  It is purely at the discretion of the minister. We think that is a power  we could have addressed in the regulations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will certainly be  looking at the regulations when they come forward. We want   to make sure there is as  strong  an indication as possible   that the “may” will be more than just a suggestion and that it will  compel the government of the day to be fair with its citizens. We do not believe that any one individual should be on the hook for protecting the nation.  When  an individual protects the nation, the nation should also protect the individual.  That becomes a principle of fairness which  we believe the legislation should reflect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite disappointed that a few minutes ago the Speaker ruled these amendments inadmissible. We were not allowed to present them in committee.  We wanted to present them at report stage.  We think they are valid and would be accepted by individual members of the House.  The parliamentary secretary and I have talked about this and he actually agrees with me.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the department that had difficulty with the wording. It did not want its hands to be tied behind a “may”.  We felt that  the wording should be “shall compensate in accordance with the regulations” and have those details worked out in the regulations. I am quite disappointed, but we will look at the regulations when they come forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the security of citizens is   paramount. We in   the House and the federal government can undertake to look after our citizens and keep them safe. The avian flu and SARS are,  and will continue to be, serious threats.  Perhaps the largest threat is yet to come.  Hopefully we have learned some lessons over   the last couple of years as we have dealt with some of the issues that have impacted our country and the world and we will be prepared for what is perhaps coming down the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is very timely.  It is  very important.  We have worked collectively as a committee to provide the best legislation possible for the citizens of Canada.  I am a little disappointed that some of the amendments have been deemed out of order, but I  support the legislation.  We will do everything we can to make sure the regulations are appropriate and in the best interests of the people of Canada.</p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1115919"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117270"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1115762"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rising to speak to Bill C-31 and continue the intervention that I started on Monday. In giving a bit of the history around the bill at that time, I mentioned the fact that in 1982 Canada's Trade Commissioner Service was integrated into what was then called the Department of External Affairs.  It took about 15 years for that integration to actually be effective.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1990s that  integration succeeded after both Conservative and Liberal administrations had some difficulty with the integration. That is why we were surprised when we saw Bill C-31 being presented.  After integration having finally succeeded after a 15 year period, we are now wrenching apart those two ministries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned at the time that a number of comments, questions and concerns had been raised in the community by people who understand vividly the importance of having an integration of international trade and other aspects of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote for the record from a number of interventions that have taken place and thus make sure that we as parliamentarians are all aware of legitimate concerns that have been raised about the bill and about the direction in which the government is going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous speakers, as I did in my previous intervention in the House, have underlined the fact that we are now undergoing a review of the very structure of foreign affairs in this government.  At the same time that we are undergoing this review, the government has already decided to wrench apart the two ministries and make one international trade and the other foreign affairs.  It makes no sense that while the review is going on these two important functions would be wrenched apart.  As previous speakers have mentioned, it also makes no sense to have international trade separated from important issues such as human rights, properly the focus of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote what Bill Clarke, former ambassador to the Baltic Republics and Brazil   said    about this in <i>Diplomat and International Canada</i> in the January-February 2005 issue.   As the federal government celebrated the one year anniversary of the announcement that the portfolios of foreign affairs and international trade would be split and henceforth go in two different directions, Bill Clarke said that “no one seems to know who made the decision--nor do they know why”.  He   said, “Many observers are wondering why”, adding that it is “questionable whether a good, open discussion was held”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Clarke is one of the most distinguished diplomats in the Canadian diplomatic corps.  He raises very legitimate concerns about the direction in which the government was going, about the why of splitting these two ministries in half, and about whether or not there were any legitimate and appropriate consultations.  He raises very legitimate concerns about this entire process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to quote for the record  remarks that were made by the president of the Retired Heads of Mission Association, a group of distinguished ex-diplomats, people who have been heads of missions and understand the function of foreign affairs and the function of international trade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association is composed of about 270 former Canadian ambassadors, high commissioners and consuls general.  They are deeply concerned about the future of the Canadian foreign service.  In the letter of December 8 that I will be quoting from, which was sent to the chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the association's distinguished former ambassadors, high commissioners and consuls general said the following:</p>
<p>

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Recently, we have had to come reluctantly to the conclusion that our Foreign Service is being gradually dismantled.  One clear manifestation of this happening is the recent decision to split the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).  As former diplomats and officials of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Commerce, Immigration and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), our members have personally experienced difficulties of integrating coherently these two crucial sectors of Canada's foreign policy.  Thus, we believe that the decision to partition DFAIT is unfortunate and a step backwards.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go on to mention other concerns about the foreign service and they say that unless these developments are reversed Canada will lose an essential tool of government.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we can see that concerns have been raised very widely about this particular approach, with people asking why the decision on splitting up these two ministries was made at this time when an ongoing review of foreign affairs is taking place. Why is it happening without broad consultation with people who understand the issue, who understand the essential linkage and integration between international trade and foreign policy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Retired Heads of Mission Association also mentioned in a previous letter that the separation of international trade from foreign affairs is another example of a measure which can only weaken the foreign service and make its management more incoherent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An observer would wonder why the government is proceeding at this time.  As previously quoted and as speakers have mentioned, it does not make sense at this time to proceed with this particular measure.  To many observers who understand the situation, it does not make sense that this division, separation or partition is taking place between these two functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very important to underline that there is an incoherence, both when it comes to foreign policy and even more so when it comes to the direction that  international trade has taken.  We saw just this very morning some of the comments made by the Minister of International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read just brief excerpts of some of the headlines from newspapers across the country.   From <i>The Telegram</i> in St. John's, Newfoundland:  “No tears; Liberals won't complain if business sends more Canadian jobs overseas”.  From the <i>Windsor Star</i>:  “Job export is good: Minister”.  From the <i>Edmonton Sun</i>: “Job losses to offshore labour fine: trade minister”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the country, including such areas as here in Ottawa where the headline read  “Grits Urge Biz to Offshore Jobs”, we have seen Canadians waking up to the fact that the international trade minister, and in fact the international trade component of our national government, is now encouraging businesses to do this.  The Minister of International Trade was quoted as saying that “businesses should feel free to send work offshore to wherever it can be done most cheaply, to help boost their bottom lines”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have from the Minister of International Trade very clear direction that it is time to off-load jobs, that it is open season on Canadian workers and that jobs can be exported offshore.  Just last week in the House, we saw the member for Timmins—James Bay raise  the crucial question of the offshore manufacturing of our proudest national symbol, our Canadian flag lapel pins, which were actually being made offshore, thus off-loading Canadian jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very proud that the hon. member for Timmins—James Bay raised that issue because this is increasingly the case.  We have an international trade minister who is encouraging businesses to send jobs elsewhere.  We have seen, as we did yesterday, debates in the House about the textile and clothing industry where there was a loss of 40,000 jobs.  With softwood, we saw the loss of 20,000 jobs.  In industry after industry we are seeing good jobs being exported, and as the Statistics Canada report from a couple of weeks ago clearly mentioned, the jobs replacing them are becoming more and more temporary or part time without pension benefits. For newer workers, those jobs are paying less and less in wages.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bizarre and inappropriate attempt to split up these two ministries, in this bizarre and inappropriate attempt of the trade minister to tell businesses to send their work offshore, to export those jobs and in this incoherence, this bizarre indecision and dithering of the government perhaps a pattern emerges.  That pattern is:  what is irresponsible is what is put forward; what is incoherent becomes government policy.  It does not make sense for the main streets across the country who after   12 years of living with a Liberal government have more  debt per individual family and less    on their paycheque.  In real terms, for most Canadian workers, their salary has slipped 60¢ an hour   over the past 10 years.  There are fewer   social programs and   fewer hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, this incoherence, this inappropriate decision and proposal will meet with opposition from this caucus.  We will be voting  against the bill.</p>

It was very nice of her. The matter is very clear to us. This division does not make any sense because foreign policy and the overall administration of foreign affairs are currently being reviewed. That does not make sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, since there has been no consultation with those more familiar with the community, it is clear that we are opposed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of international trade, the minister says that it is great, that it is fun, that it is appropriate to create jobs outside Canada. Clearly, there is a lack of consistency on the part of this government  in its international trade policies and in its administration per se. We have seen this in several areas, including at the Treasury Board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are regulations which are supposed to prevent the squandering of public money. Still, it is allowed to go on, and we have cited  several instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government ran a $9 billion surplus, the number of children living in poverty and of homeless families in Canada still grew.  Government policies lack consistency. Bill C-31 provides  another example of the government's inability to improve the quality of life of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As critic for my party, I oppose this bill, as does the NDP caucus. Debating this bill while foreign affairs is undergoing a review makes no sense. It also makes no sense for the  minister to say that it is good to create international trade jobs outside Canada. It is very clear that there is a problem there, and it has to be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, we are opposed to the bill. </p><A NAME="Int-1116382"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116401"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116317"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciated the member's speech because it is along the same lines as the  Bloc Québécois's position.  I would like to hear his impressions of the contribution potential of the NGOs as far as international cooperation and solidarity are concerned, after this administrative split. We already have considerable difficulties having our social and environmental concerns, or those relating to democracy, heard with the present structure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a department for foreign affairs and another for international trade, does he think that NGOs would have better access to the minister?</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1116401"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116465"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116382"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Julian: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Joliette for his question.  There is a definite problem with the present structure.  In my opinion, however, things would be even worse if changes were made or these two departments were divided, which is precisely what the bill is about. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that NGOs do not seem to get any hearing from the government, even if they do ask for help, and that is a pity.  WIth a minority government, however, there is more chance of getting our opinions across, but the reality is that when human rights and the environment are on the agenda, not only in Canada but elsewhere, both international trade and foreign policy are involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have two different departments going in two different directions.   WIth such a division, it would be even harder for the NGOs to make themselves heard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues relating to human rights, the environment and social development involve aspects that are extremely important and ought to be looked at as a whole as far as foreign policy is concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, and this is something that ought to make all members here and all Canadians feel ashamed: yesterday 29,000 children died from disease, starvation and the lack of safe drinking water.  Today, another 29,000 will die, as will that same number again tomorrow. This is a huge problem, and Canadians have a duty to set things in motion to improve this situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it will be harder to do this if there are two different departments going into two different directions. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1116465"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116528"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116401"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to be seen as taking exception to my hon. colleague, but I have to raise a question about his belief that the bill signifies a lack of coherence in government policy. I would suggest that it shows an extreme sense of coherence.  The one thing I have seen from the government is it knows exactly where it is going in terms of international trade.  It knows exactly where it is going with human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week we realized that with the Canadian flag. It is the symbol in  which the government wraps itself every time members of the honourable opposition, mostly from the west, stand up to question the corruption.  We understand now that the government sees the flag as though it were a symbol from the wallymart.  If it can do it cheaper anywhere else, if it can bring in the cheapest deal, that is good for its so-called consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Beth Phinney:</b> That was outsourcing. We did not know that was going to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Charlie Angus:</b> The hon. member said they did not know that would happen.  I was under the impression that the Liberals were very aware that it happened.  A number of Liberals have talked to me about the fact that they have been outsourcing numerous symbols of Canada because they can do it cheaper.  This brings me to the fundamental question I would like to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this fall, we asked the government for assurances that when it allowed the sale of Noranda and Falconbridge to go ahead to the Chinese government, it would have a plan to ensure that certain fundamental benchmarks were addressed in terms of human rights and that certain fundamental benchmarks were in place to protect the copper mining communities, of which my region is one. Across Canada we have communities that are dependent on these resources.  We could not get a straight answer from the government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is becoming very clear to me now that if we divide human rights into one department and  trade into another department, it becomes very impossible for us to get a straight answer from the government.  It makes it easier for the government to continue to say that it loves human rights, children, little dogs and ice cream, but it cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member think this is a lack of coherence or is  it part of a much larger industrial strategy being pursued by the government, which is to take as many Canadian jobs as it can and outsource them to El Salvador, China,or wherever it can find the bottom of the barrel?</p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1116528"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116547"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116465"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Julian: </b>Mr. Speaker, the member for Timmins--James Bay is absolutely right. There is a direction and that direction is south and offshore. The direction is loss of jobs. The direction is not respecting human rights and not pushing or having any sort of evaluation of foreign purchase of Canadian companies. We have seen 11,000 companies in Canada absorbed over the past 15 years, and they have been absorbed without any debate, without any sort of verification of whether it is in the interest of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sellout of Canada.  He is absolutely right. There seems to be a direction, the selling out of jobs, the selling out of our resources, the selling out of our companies, and this has to stop. We will continue to raise these issues in the House.</p>

Mark Eyking (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade (Emerging Markets), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is great to stand here today and defend the bill.  I am pleased to rise and support Bill C-31, an act to establish the Department of International Trade at second reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I proudly support the Prime Minister's decision to create International Trade Canada.  Therefore, I support with enthusiasm the legislation introduced in December by the Minister of International Trade to formally establish the department in Canadian law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will enable Canada to succeed in our global economy.  Canada's economic well-being is dependent upon this external sector.  One in four jobs is connected in some way to international trade, and the export of goods and services is equivalent to 38% of our GDP in our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's innovative capacity and its productivity is driven by our capacity, not only to open new markets and keep them open, but to access capital, technology and skills on the global platform.  Investment flows are a critical element of our efforts in this respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very nature of international commerce has shifted radically.  Transactions occur in light speed.  Business plans and business deals are developed less and less by and between single firms, and more and more through rapidly through partnerships, alliances and networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production is organized through global supply chains, with research, manufacturing and distribution spread across many jurisdictions.  Canada is part of this environment.  Our task is challenging.  Canadians are confronted with a far more complex business environment, one of opportunity, but a great deal of change and vulnerability as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is how does government integrate policies and programs to help the business sector succeed in this environment?  How do we sustain the kind of success that grows our economy at home and that complements and reinforces our more specific objectives in sustaining the social progress and  in strengthening the development in these regions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important, indeed critical dimension of this setting is the emergence of newly powerful economies.  Until recently, many of these economic powers were developing countries at the margins of industrialization.  Now they are growing at high rates year after year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often speak of these newly powerful economies in terms of China, India and Brazil.  Clearly, these economies are formidable players in global growth, trade and finance.  They are no longer simply sources of low cost labour and sites for the assembly of low value added goods.  They are centres of growing industrial sophistication and a force in the global knowledge and the service economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These economies typically feature rapid urbanization and technological change, enormous energy and infrastructure pressures and rising middle classes with ever greater purchasing power.  Together these economies, with their global reach, increasingly frame the competitive challenge here at home.  They also raise the scope of opportunity for Canadians, the potential to create wealth for our own and for our future generations.  We are a trading nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China alone has grown an average of 9% a year for the last decade and is already the world's fourth largest trader and the second largest investment destination.  China, India and Brazil have also become significant forces in international institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not alone.  Other regions, such as central and eastern Europe, southeast Asia and South America, are becoming more powerful.  Countries such as those  I recently visited in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, with the hon. member for Calgary East, are advancing rapidly and presenting both Canada and our competitors with remarkable opportunities in oil and gas technology and services, in engineering and construction and in education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, such as Korea and Mexico, while hardly what we would call emerging markets, are deeply integrated within regions of expanding opportunity which success reflects a regional reality.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe our businesses can succeed and they have been succeeding.  However,  whether it is in the high tech field,  in the manufacturing sector or in the service industries, or whether it is  in energy and resources or in agriculture and fisheries, Canadians must operate in a complex global setting. This environment demands hard work and  much homework.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires government to assemble a full range of trade promotion and intelligence, policy and investment tools, each tailored to specific issues capable of being adapted and applied to specific business challenges and organized for rapid deployment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will require resources.  Government resources must be adequate to meet the challenge of intense international competition. In our view, they are best deployed  at the front line  in those markets or regions that are driving global economic growth. There is a lot of competition out there for that global economic growth.  If we do not step up to the plate, somebody else will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success in the 21st century global economy requires integrated approaches, with solutions spanning from financial arrangements, to technology partnering and skills transfer, to an ability to source inputs at competitive prices. It challenges businesses above all, but it also challenges we as   a government  to offer services and policy support that adds value to these dynamic environments. We cannot be successful in this new setting by just selling things from one country to another.  It is not that simple.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have acquired a world class trade commissioner service, bringing many skills and an astounding range of business expertise and country expertise to the table.  We are developing state-of-the-art client service tools, both electronically and person-to-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, as ever more complex business partnerships emerge, we will be developing capacity to advise on sources of the best possible legal and business advice.  Intelligence, as I suggested, is critical.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort business makes, and we support, requires real time, accurate market intelligence covering not only export sales leads but on potential investment and knowledge of  partners.  We have   seen this on our recent trip to China, with over 280 businesses and institutions, how those tools come into effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For emerging markets with this blend of opportunity and risk, we need a well-crafted and targeted set of promotional and policy instruments.  With investment so critical to positioning, we need agreements to protect our investment abroad. We need to be able to offer the best advice possible in ensuring intellectual property is safeguarded. We need to overcome regulatory constraints that impair our ability to compete effectively in trade or investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some markets, our efforts to tap expanded travel and tourism will benefit from expanded air service accords and perhaps by looking at visa rules and procedures, and by working with all levels of government on issues of critical infrastructure. It is a multi-faceted approach from all different departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this diversity of requirements that we face and the integrated solutions that businesses need that makes this new Department of International Trade so valuable in present times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a department that would handle not only trade policy and trade promotion, but also investment, science and technology and integrated service delivery to Canadian businesses through regional offices across this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond trade disputes and trade negotiations, and beyond trade promotion, the new department would incorporate a vigorous investment function by expanding  marketing of Canada abroad and reinforcing the capacity of communities in Canada to attract and retain investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the department will complement efforts at home to build a 21st  century economy and to act on the international dimension of innovation.  It will work to build knowledge partnerships that work to build productivity at home while showcasing Canadian excellence abroad. </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These regional offices will ensure opportunities are learned about and expertise is brought to bear in communities across this country. When we travelled on our last couple of missions, we had companies and institutions from every province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, through the legislation, we would be in a position to lead and coordinate the entire federal government in matters of international commerce. We would speak for Canada internationally on all trade matters and we would work to build a coherent, whole Canada approach through international commerce engaging all levels of government, the business community and other stakeholders outside both government and business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly in reference to emerging markets, I would note that one of our unique Canadian advantages is the cross-cultural skills of our communities right across this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the fears of some, the legislation neither precludes nor impairs coordinated approaches in the international sphere. During my recent trip to the Middle East, I saw exceptionally talented and dedicated people  from all programs at our embassies in the region.  They are all working well together for a common purpose. We saw them in Qatar and in the United Arab Emirates. We saw them in Yemen and we also saw them in Syria, and other posts that we travelled to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the new department is now uniquely positioned to work closely, not only with other international departments, but also, with gathering credibility, with our economic policy departments. This is not something new. This is happening in other countries.  France and other   European countries have separated their trade from foreign affairs. The United States is in its own silo; it does its own thing. It has a direct link to the White House. That is how important trade is for trading countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way the legislation would offer the Government of Canada and the people of Canada a chance to construct a valuable bridge between the pursuit of our goals at home and the opportunities beyond our borders. Domestic prosperity, from the perspective of the fisherman in P.E.I., the farmer out west, a manufacturing or engineering firm or a high tech startup, is reliant on international trade and investment, both to sustain and to grow in the future. When we were in China, we saw many deals signed. We even saw the Wheat Board sign a deal to sell grains to China. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all hon. members in the House on all sides to support Bill C-31, and ensure it receives speedy passage.</p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1116851"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116872"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116563"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I have travelled with the parliamentary secretary on two trade missions and what he just said was fine.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today his subject is Bill C-31 and he completely missed the point. He completely ignored the questions that have been raised in the House. Why is there a  need to break up these two departments, the Departments of Foreign Affairs and International Trade? He did not answer this question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there a deeper analysis done to determine if it would be in the longer term interest of Canada if this department was by itself? He did not answer that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his Prime Minister came into power, he said there would be a foreign policy review. How come a decision was made before this foreign policy came about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the questions and everybody is wondering if he will now leave his nice, flowery words, and get on with the business and answer these questions.</p><A NAME="Int-1116872"></A><a HREF="#Int-1116894"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116851"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is a well travelled person.  He has seen it in other countries and knows the competition we have.  Whether it is competition from Australia or France, when we are dealing with these emerging markets or others, we need our trade department to stand on its own.  We need to give it the wings to fly. That does not mean that we cannot have a whole government approach, where we work with CIDA, Foreign Affairs, and maybe with National Defence, on how we deal with regions. We can work in silos, but we can work together. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This century is going to be a lot different than the last one. China is emerging and we have to adapt to it.  The United States will be a main player for our trade.  With these emerging markets and global trends, we must be prepared as a government.  We must be able to work with the business community to create policies and make things happen.</p>

However, there are questions to be asked on another aspect: we will be more competitive, but at what price?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decade ago, a number of our Canadian firms set up  in Mexico. With the approval of the Mexican government, they created what are called the maquiladoras. I believe there are also some in the Yucatan. Maquiladoras are free economic zones—areas where businesses can locate without paying duties or income taxes. On the premise that they get people working, governments leave them alone to do business. The maquiladoras we are familiar with are primarily around Ciudad Juarez on the Mexico-Texas border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mexican maquiladoras now employ over 2 million workers. These people come from all over northern Mexico,  Central America and South America. They work for $1 or $2 a day. There are Canadian firms—I know; I have seen them; I took pictures of them—located there, which have received assistance from the Government of Canada. At present the two departments, international trade and foreign affairs, are together. People are already being exploited without any attention being paid. Their working conditions are being negotiated downwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the Canadian government has not ratified the   Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It has not ratified the second  Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Right.  It has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. It has not ratified the American Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen, then, in a world where international trade is on one side and human rights on the other? I would like the parliamentary secretary to explain to me how we are promoting the best interests of human beings through competition.</p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Mark Eyking: </b>Mr. Speaker, we are facing a new challenge this century when it comes to trade and how our companies will adapt to it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bring up the issue of human rights   with other governments when we attend bilateral meetings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we have to look at how our companies will adapt and how they will do in other regions.  I used Husky Equipment as an example.     Its head office is in Ontario and it has four plants worldwide.  We visited its plant in Shanghai, which is one of the most modern factories.   The company treats its employees properly and has been example for  the whole region on  how to treat workers  and how to give them benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also in Yemen where we visited Nexen,   a company also located in the hon. member's riding of Calgary East. This company is making money and it  is  also impressing upon these countries   workers' rights.  It is being a  good corporate citizen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot sit here and hope the world will be a better place.  We have to get out there and do business.  We can also show foreign countries the practices we have here in Canada, whether it is with respect to human rights, workers' rights  or working with the community.</p><A NAME="Int-1116994"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117034"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116953"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the hon. member's comments  and I am still trying to find my way through the buzz words.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue here is not trade.  The issue here is assuring Canadians that the government has a bottom line when it comes to fundamental issues, and that this is not a  race to the bottom.  Helping Canadian companies overseas is not the issue and  is not what we are talking about here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a company is good in business it brands itself.  That is a fundamental in business.  We just need to look at Burger King.  When it was a small company  it came up with the phrase “Home of the Whopper”.  I know a lot of people think that is the phrase of the Liberal Party, but it is actually  the trademark of Burger King.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we had the Canadian lapel pins that were branded “made in China”,   the  Liberals were perfectly proud of that until somebody found out and it then became a sense of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member a simple question which we asked earlier in the House but did not get any answer to.   Air Canada, which  is a symbol of this country,  is a private company that  has survived on millions of dollars worth of grants.  It has just shut down jobs in Canada for maintenance and mechanical work and has shipped those jobs down south to El Salvador.  From my history lessons in school,  El Salvador was the land of death squads where Jesuits were murdered at the  university.  It has an horrific  human rights record.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are willing to brand ourselves and be proud of our trade, how would the hon. members feel about Air Canada having a slogan stating “Air Canada, maintained and brought to you by the sweat shops of El Salvador?”  Is that what we are talking about?</p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117034"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117053"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1116994"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we do have communities that are going through challenges.  His community is doing well with this global economy.  The resource industry is doing well.  It is not going to be easy because there will be ups and downs but we  have to adjust to this new economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is that going to happen?  Canada is a trading nation.  One in four jobs here relies on trade.  We have to do business with the rest of the world.  Yes, we do have to watch human rights and we do have to watch the deals we make, but at  the end of the day the  member's riding will benefit from this global economy. His riding will benefit from the division of this  department and be more proactive in regions where his products will be sold worldwide.</p><A NAME="Int-1117053"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117241"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117034"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to  speak to  Bill C-31, which would create  a department called International Trade Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the  critic for my party for emerging markets. The parliamentary secretary just gave an eloquent speech on how emerging markets are important for Canada. I have absolutely no bone to pick on   why emerging markets are important for Canada. As he said, Canada is a trading nation.  Over 40% of our GDP is based on trade. Over 80% of our  trade is with our southern neighbours but we are looking at new   and emerging markets offering us opportunities that we need to grab. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However what we are talking about is Bill C-31, a bill that  would divide one department into two departments.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade would be split into two departments. On that aspect we do have some concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Newmarket--Aurora, our trade critic for the Conservative Party, spoke very eloquently to this bill some time back and  expressed the concerns   the Conservative Party has with this approach. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the trade critic involved here for a couple of years and being on the foreign affairs committee, let me   go back and give my observations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's international relationships are  run by two departments: the Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, which takes care  of the aid aspect; and  the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade was joined together by the former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau  because he thought there would be a cohesive policy from Canada that would take Canadian strategic interests into account when dealing with foreign issues, which at that given time was thought to be the right approach to take.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  I now know for a fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs was following the same thinking and the same approach in reference to CIDA and it  wanted to take over CIDA.   From the time when I was an international trade and development critic I know  the mandarins in Foreign Affairs felt that if CIDA were brought under their umbrella they could again move into a more cohesive approach dealing with foreign aid, human rights issues and all these things, and make policies in Foreign Affairs that would reflect  Canadian values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However over a period of time the government resisted CIDA going under this umbrella for the simple reason that it was using CIDA as  a department which it  could  “buy influence” overseas in countries where it went to work for Canada, and most important, we have records showing that CIDA was used  as an agency that  rewarded Liberal businesses very well.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been around the world and I have seen CIDA. CIDA officials are different from Foreign Affairs officials and trade officials. CIDA officials do not coordinate their efforts with others. CIDA marches to its own tune as does  Foreign Affairs and yet we say that we have a  cohesive strategy   and that we work together for the interests of Canada. That is not true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of China. CIDA is still today giving foreign aid to China when the parliamentary secretary just stood up in the House and said how good China was doing, 8% annually.  If China is doing so well,   why is CIDA giving it money? It did the same thing for India. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is no cohesive policy out there when it comes to international relations. We now  have the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. What we are wondering is why and how   the Prime Minister of Canada decided that he needed to break these two departments and make them separate. We do not know. Nobody knows. He just  decided to do it, despite the fact that this was a functioning department.   What is the benefit? What is the cost analysis? Has anyone done it?</p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does CIDA fit into this picture?   We now have CIDA and the new  departments of trade and  foreign affairs.  How will  they  coordinate  one policy for foreign affairs? The Prime Minister said there would  be a foreign policy review.  One would think that the government would do a foreign policy review first before coming to this kind of a conclusion, but, no,  that did not take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether  the foreign policy review will come or what will happen.  Decisions have been made without, what we think, is a proper analysis of whether it is in the best interest of Canada's foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Conservative Party believe   we should send this  bill   to the foreign affairs committee where it can be studied properly and  recommendations can be made as to whether this is the right approach in which to go in the long term interests of Canada.  That should be a logical, common sense decision but it seems to be lost on the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the parliamentary secretary making speeches about emerging markets but what we are talking about is whether this the right approach to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   envision    going overseas where  we have these three officers, the ambassador from foreign affairs, the CIDA individual and the trade individual,   sitting in  separate  rooms and going about their separate turf wars.  Meanwhile, where would Canada's  foreign policy be on  the issues of interest to  Canadians?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen?  Will we be  coming  back here and saying  that  we made a mistake and that we should bring it back?    This is a very important decision and it  is not one  to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to know whether  this is the right approach to take.   We do not know and therefore  we will not be  supporting  the bill.  We want the bill to go to the foreign affairs committee where it can do a thorough analysis of what this  is all about.</p><A NAME="Int-1117241"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117273"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117053"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments and words about the need to study this proposition from the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if, as part of that analysis, the member would consider the factor of acquisitions in Canada and the screen that we obviously need to put acquisitions through with respect to human rights in these emerging markets that he mentions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have some sort of forum in Canada so that  when a country like   China, or any of the other countries on the list of not the best representatives of international policy and diplomacy, tries  to acquire Canadian companies, of which  11,000 have been acquired over the last number of years, we know its record on    human rights?   In this case, when  we have a government buying   one of our greatest mining companies, should human rights  not  be a factor in the decision around the  acquisition of that company?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Liberal government's advisement there clearly  is no way to deny an acquisition of a Canadian firm.  The door is simply open and the countries can pick and choose.  The government clearly accepts every application that comes through.  There have been no rejections in 11,000.  Would human rights be one of the criteria that the hon. member would encourage to help these emerging markets into the new century?</p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117273"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117303"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117241"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai: </b>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to advise you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Macleod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member's question is precisely what I was talking about and why I raised  the  question about whether this was the right approach to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human rights is one of those values that Canadians want to see in our foreign policy.  Human rights is a very strong value that Canadians are looking for in our foreign policy.  That will only come if we have a concentrated policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we could have    now, if the government breaks up these departments,   is the new department of international trade deciding  that trade is all together separate from human rights.  It  may go in the direction of only following trade and saying that trade and human rights are not linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Canadian value and Canadians are concerned about human rights.  Canadians would like human rights to be up in the forefront as does my party.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the member's question, human rights is one of our concerns as well, which is why we are saying that we will not support the bill until it goes to the committee where these issues can be  brought forward and   addressed, and where we can  hear what departmental officials and  the government have to says about this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have right now is the government's unilateral policy out there.  It  has decided this is the way it is going to go without any other questions being answered as were asked by the hon. member.</p><A NAME="Int-1117303"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117317"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117273"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I will pick up on the comments made by the member for Skeena on that issue, but first I will make a comment before I ask a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been around this honourable House for well over a decade. We know very well that companies in other countries have come to Canada to invest, acquire, merge, or whatever.  We know very well that there are provisions to make sure that investment does not jeopardize, impede or hurt us here in Canada. Unfortunately, or fortunately, we live in a global economy and these things happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague spoke so eloquently  on this issue. There are trouble spots in some countries with child labour, labour laws being abused, human rights abuses and whatnot.  Being aware from what we know and read that something like that exists in particular countries, is it wise to stay away, avoid the issue and turn a blind eye, or does it make sense that we do the best we can to engage with the countries?  Knowing the  wonderful society we have built here, we can build on that by being there and showing  others that there is  a better way to perform in society.</p><A NAME="Int-1117317"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117337"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117303"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai: </b>Mr. Speaker, the word is “engaged”.  Yes, we should engage. We cannot isolate them.  We are pushing up the human rights abuses from what we see when we isolate countries. I agree with him that we should engage the countries. The issue is how to do it.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most effective way to engage the countries when talking about child labour and all those other issues?  The best way  from my perspective is to tell them that if they do not change their laws, if they do not meet the ILO requirements and if they do not meet the international treaties that have been signed, then  we will have a concern about dealing with them. We cannot just stick our heads in the sand and think nothing is going on around the world.   I agree with the member, but which is the right way to engage the countries to get the best results?</p><A NAME="Int-1117337"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117496"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117317"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ted Menzies (Macleod, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from Calgary East is very passionate about this issue, as are many of us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognize the concerns that we have with the bill.   I will be putting my support behind the bill simply because we need some answers and the only way  we appear to  get answers from the government is by  asking witnesses to appear before our committees. We have some tremendously important questions that need answers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental question in my mind is why we moved forward to divide the department and then decided we were going to finally have an international policy review.  What is the policy review going to tell us?  What if it tells us that we should not have divided the department, that it is not for the good of the country to have done this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a rather long history of working with the trade department.  I made some good friends in that department. In my former life I represented agrifood exporters and producers across the country.  I was president of the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance which represents 90% of the country's agrifood exports, not just products from the farm but products that have had value added to them.  Canada is an export dependent country. We can never forget that.  It is fundamental to our future and the businesses that fuel our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked  with the trade department and also with  foreign affairs.  In my past life I have had a very good working relationship with the people in the trade department and the people in foreign affairs.  I sense some very grave concerns within the Pearson building.  I have spoken with good people who work hard for this country.  They have been doing dual duty.  They have been working for trade and   foreign affairs. There are   also those who have been working for CIDA. They   all fit under this umbrella group.  Later we will get into the funding questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people are very frustrated with the situation.  They too  are asking, “Who made this decision?  Why were we, as participants in this, not asked our opinion?”  How many Canadian businesses were actually consulted on this decision before it was made?  Was it simply made, as we have heard on many occasions, to create another ministry?  That is the question  I would like to ask  the ministers when they appear before the standing committee. If we do not approve the bill in principle and move it forward to the committee stage, we may never hear those answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see something in writing from the businesses that might have actually requested this. I would suggest  there probably are not too many businesses that requested this to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months I have been in consulates in a number of different  places: Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo; Brazil; and Santiago, Chile.  I heard the same concerns from the good people in the dual roles in these consulates. They   did not know if they had a future and did not know what that future might be. They were concerned about the role they were going to be able to play.</p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people have worked supporting trade and foreign affairs and indeed they have  roles within CIDA. They have worked well. It was very obvious they were concerned about their futures. I would be most interested when this bill gets to committee stage to bring some of those people to committee, provided they have  whistleblower protection so they can actually make some serious comments about their futures and how their departments have worked in the past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say  this may not be a good thing for business, but let us sit down and look at it. Let us sit down and question all of the people who are involved. Let us find out the fundamental reason that  this is being  done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  1982  when the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade was formed,  industry was part of it. We decided at that time to take industry out of it. In the back of my mind I am still questioning whether or not that was a good thing, because industry still is a big part of trade. We have too many departments and, pardon me for suggesting this, maybe we have too many ministries too. We wonder about all of the different ministers travelling around the world making  conflicting statements that do not seem to put forward the agenda that is needed  to make this country work better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the splitting of  the  department, it would be very interesting to see the international policy review, if in fact we ever do see it. I am becoming   skeptical as to whether  we will actually  see this in my lifetime, or shall I say in my career here in the House. I believe it was promised in November and there does not seem to be  too much indication that it will be  coming anytime soon. In fact we are hearing that it has been delayed once more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion is that this is  a   housekeeping bill. It is far beyond a housekeeping bill. It is very critical that this  type of discussion take place. It is critical for the future of businesses in this country. I also want to find out if it   is  simply a bill  to divide the two departments to create  more jobs for Liberals. I want to find out why there has not been  the public consultation that is  needed to determine  whether or not this is the right way to go. We have some very serious questions and huge concerns about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have other concerns not only about CIDA's role, but also about CIDA's funding. We are very concerned about the reaction to the tsunami. Hopefully this will be addressed in the international policy review process. Certainly we needed to support those people in that disaster as strongly as we could, but we are still uncertain where that money is coming from. Is it coming from the Department of National Defence? Is there money coming from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade through CIDA that is going back to replenish the funds that we have taken out of defence? We have some very serious questions along those lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague on the other side of the House, my opponent, spoke about some of the contracts that were negotiated. There is one which  I would like to mention once again. He and I have had this discussion. He was very excited about the fact that the Canadian Wheat Board had signed a contract during the last visit to China. </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the hon. member that my terminology of a contract is there has to be a price and a delivery period involved.   My understanding is that is not the case. It is  more like a memorandum of understanding.  The most exciting news  I could deliver to my constituents is that we have sold some wheat.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell them that at this time.</p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

These two bills must, of course, be examined together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an aberrant measure, because it lacks transparency. In fact, it was undertaken in an undemocratic fashion and in secret. Moreover, it is an attempt to present parliamentarians with a fait accompli, that is the splitting of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into two entities, namely Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also retrograde legislation in every respect, and I will get back to this later on. It is totally illogical. Indeed, it will be harmful to Canada's political and economic interests and, consequently, to Quebec's political and economic interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, hon. members will realize that, faced with a bill or a measure that is not transparent, undemocratic, illogical, retrograde and harmful, the Bloc Québécois will assume its responsibilities and vote against Bill C-31  and Bill C-32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the lack of transparency. On December 12, 2003, the governor in council quietly—if not secretly—issued an order pursuant to the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. That order split the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into two entities, as I mentioned earlier, namely Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the government did not draw attention to this decision. In fact, the process to split the department into two entities had begun. It was only on November 29, 2004, that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade was informed of this new reality, when the Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared before it. So, this process was undertaken without consultations and without making   use of the existing parliamentary structures, particularly the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs, who testified before the committee, was unable to explain where this decision came from and what was the logic behind it. It brings to mind Jeffrey Simpson's article in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, which asked Hercule Poirot, the Agatha Christie character, to help Ottawa to identify the author of this idea. This idea is, as I mentioned, extremely detrimental to foreign affairs and international trade. Unfortunately, no one has been able to identify the father or perhaps the mother—I do not want to be guilty of sexism—of this idea. It is sometimes said that bad ideas are orphans. In this case, it is true. We still have not been able to identify the person responsible for the idea the Prime Minister has used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister had stated in the House—and it is quite interesting to quote him, “—that there are always consultations. The government has always maintained communication with the major exporters associations and stakeholders in other economic sectors”. A little later he said, “This time, having discussed this matter with various people, the Prime Minister decided otherwise”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These quotes are interesting, because we are being told that there were consultations. It is a bit strange that the order was issued on the very day the Prime Minister took his oath of office. We are not used to the Liberal government being so fast and efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members remember the people whose land was expropriated for Mirabel and Parliament's decision to help them. To date, no answer has been given, other than by the Minister of Transport, who said that the government would not follow up on Parliament's decision. Since 2000, the unemployed have been waiting for an answer, after the repeated promises of Liberal ministers and the Prime Minister during the leaders debate. This reform still has not been implemented. We hope that, in the budget, there will finally be answers. We have been waiting for nearly five years now, and the unemployed are waiting for a reform worthy of the name employment insurance. Again today, I mentioned in the House that, after the House of Commons decided yesterday to adopt a Bloc Québécois motion to substantially improve assistance to the clothing and textile industry to save the thousands of jobs in these two manufacturing sectors, there still has been no reaction from the  government, except to say that it will take action as a result of this decision.</p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is a dead calm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not start talking about aerospace, where I could list numerous issues we have been discussing for years, and the government has been studying for years and on which no decisions have been forthcoming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly enough, the very day he was sworn in, the Prime Minister announced the plan to divide the departments.  There must have been some discussion, but it must have been at lightning speed.  We know very well that his mind was made up.  Where did the idea come from?  I am unfortunately not trained in psychology, and it is psychology more than logic that is involved here, so I cannot say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister speaks of consultations.  Whom did he consult?  The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade was not in the loop, except through the rumours and  leaks from Foreign Affairs and International Trade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the various groups—with whom my colleague   for international affairs and myself are in constant contact—whether concerned with economics or international cooperation, no one there heard anything about this before they were asked about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So probably a few people, bosom buddies of the Prime Minister,  were involved in the consultation.  What is interesting is that, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, even those people advised the PM against this illogical division. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind you of what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said: “The Prime Minister decided otherwise”.  So even people close to the PM told him that this would not fly, for all manner of reasons, ones I do not have time to go into this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, it was a done deal.  It is a mystery where the idea to do this came from.  Perhaps someone like Hercule Poirot  could come up with the answer, but the Minister of Foreign Affairs certainly will not.  We have already tried that route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision is therefore not transparent or democratic, and as the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel has said, it is all a kind of who-dunnit.  So much for the first aspect, the lack of transparency, of consultation, so much for the slighting of Parliament and its institutions, the totally anti-democratic nature of this undertaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for the retrograde aspect of the decision. I would like to share with all the hon. members an excerpt from a letter from the Retired Heads of Mission Association.  I would like to read more of it.  These former ambassadors, high commissioners and consuls wrote to the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on December 8, 2004, so the letter is fairly recent. The first paragraph says it all:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> Our Association, which is composed of approximately 270 former Canadian Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Consuls General, is deeply concerned about the future of the Canadian Foreign Service.  Recently, we have had to come reluctantly to the conclusion that our Foreign Service is being gradually dismantled.  One clear manifestation of this happening is the recent decision to split the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).  As former diplomats and officials of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Commerce, Immigration and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), our members have personally experienced the difficulties of integrating coherently these two crucial sectors of Canada's foreign policy.  Thus, we believe that the decision to partition DFAIT is unfortunate and a step backwards. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why backwards? Because it runs counter to 30 years of efforts  to integrate Canada's foreign policy with its trade policy and to make the latter an instrument for promoting its foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That decision was not made overnight. It goes back to 1971. In the Trudeau era, it was decided to integrate all support staff in the missions abroad, who had until then been scattered among various departments, and to bring them all within the external affairs department.  For example, the people from Immigration who dealt with refugees abroad were brought into the department. The functions of CIDA were also brought in at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened 10 years later is extremely important. The trade commissioners, who were then in the Department of  Industry, Trade and Commerce, were taken into External Affairs.  It is clear that there was administrative logic, consistency in personnel management, in order to ensure greater effectiveness of foreign policy, international trade, international assistance, and refugee policy.</p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a concern in terms of  financial effectiveness with being able to maintain a synergy among the various missions, while ensuring that ambassadors fulfil  diplomatic, economic as well as human rights functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1971 and 1982, it was decided to concentrate all these functions under the Department of External Affairs. This trend was never reversed by any subsequent government, be it Conservative or Liberal. Even during Mr. Chrétien's term of office, the importance of finding together  under one  roof all   of Canada's international functions was never questioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there is a problem. It is not to say that, at Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, all was perfect.   But the real source of the problems experienced by that department had nothing to do with the concentration of all these functions within a single department run by a minister of state and two associate ministers, one for international trade and one for   international assistance, but rather with the drastic cuts made in the 1980s. These cuts started under the Conservatives and continued after the Liberals took office. In fact, the current Prime Minister was the   one mainly responsible for these cuts, when he was the finance minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a number of international functions and missions—extremely important for a country that claims to be democratic and to want to play a role on the international scene, particularly with respect to international assistance, where major cuts have been made—and the Canadian presence in diplomatic missions for immigration and refugee processing were dropped. In these areas, because of lack of funding, the department has been unable to  exercise all its responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not an administrative problem, but rather a financial one. The solution to the problems experienced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade would have been to reinvest the resources necessary to assume our various responsibilities in diplomacy, international trade, international assistance and refugee processing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing the department into two separate departments is not only a step backward in terms of the strong trend of the past 30 years, but no solution, because no funding will be reallocated. At least, there is no indication from the government that there will be. This decision is therefore taking us back more than 30 years, beyond the 1970s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, the decision is illogical on every level. As for human resource management, it is certainly not by creating two administrative entities that we will have more efficient and more coherent management of our human resources on a diplomatic level. We are eliminating this vital interaction between foreign policy and trade policy, the latter serving as a tool for the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way I will be convinced, speaking of coordination—this is mentioned in both bills—that this problem will be resolved. Coordination of economic relations is very clearly being taken away from the Department of Foreign Affairs and being given to the Department of International Trade. It is stated in subclause 7(2) of Bill C-32, which eliminates the coordination of economic and international relations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what type of globalization Canada will defend. On one hand, we will have a Department of Foreign Affairs making a series of grand statements and great promises, internationally. On the other hand, we will have a Department of International Trade concerned only with developing Canada's international trade and seeking foreign investment in order to encourage investors to come to Canada and promoting Canadian investors in these countries.</p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will the Minister of International Trade say when NGOs or civil society ask his department, or Export Development Canada, whether they took into account major Canadian values, whether democratic rights are respected when Export Development Canada  supports a project and whether the department ensures that the working conditions of people hired in other countries are consistent with International Labour Organization conventions? He will say it is not part of his mandate and that he deals with international trade. He will say to go see the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will say he understands, but he has no control over international economic relations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These NGOs—who already have a hard time being heard in terms of international cooperation and solidarity—and most of civil society will no longer have any outlet for their concerns. This is extremely detrimental, because there will no longer be the necessary pressure on government, on Parliament, to ensure that Canada does more than talk and that it truly works for  globalization that serves the people rather than large multinational companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that this plan is not in any way advancing what those opposite  often refer to as the great Canadian values.  It will be harmful to the development of democracy.  It will prevent Canadian civil society and Quebec civil society from doing the necessary lobbying.  Thus the bill is extremely harmful to the political and economic interests of Quebec and Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is non-transparent, backward, and illogical.  I have gone into some of the aspects, but even on the economic level it makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian ambassadors are currently evaluated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of International Trade.  From now on, it will be by the MInister of Foreign Affairs only.  So the whole economic policy  aspect is an extremely important element of our foreign affairs policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister went to Japan, he spoke about mad cow disease and about the Japanese having closed their border to us.  That is trade-related.  He spoke about the forthcoming G-8 summit on climate change.  That is a matter of international trade and foreign affairs as well.  We cannot carve it up as if it were some sort of sausage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we will find ourselves in a situation where business people will no longer enjoy the support of the entire diplomatic apparatus, and they are very concerned about that. I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with them, and they feel that ambassadors will no longer be evaluated. This is indeed the case as regards their performance  from a trade policy perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, this legislation does not make any sense. Moreover—and this was pointed out by a number of participants, including some Liberals—what is the point of splitting the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, when we are told that, in a few weeks, the Department of Foreign Affairs will propose new directions for our foreign policy? This is truly putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at the end of the process, we had said “Yes, perhaps we will be better served by splitting the department”, I would not be more in agreement, but at least we could say that there is a logic underlying the process. But here the government is making an administrative decision and then it will review the main  focuses  of our foreign policy. This obviously lacks any logic; the government is way out in left field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by quoting a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who said in <i>The Globe and Mail</i>—as hon. members can see, I do read English  newspapers—“If it works, why try to fix it?” It is exactly the same with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. It works. We should invest more money in this department, but there is no need to repair it by splitting it in two.</p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117659"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117663"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117496"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

He said that the fundamental issue was that this splitting would have a negative impact on our policy. I find this interesting, since the Bloc Québécois is a party that wants to split the country. Perhaps he is an expert in splitting and dividing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. member agree, like other members, that since the department's merger in 1981, there may have been times when  this merger was justified, and times when it was not ?

The bill is quite simple. The beginning of the bill provides certain definitional changes that are necessary for purposes of clarification, but the real essence of the bill is a small paragraph in bold at the very end, which states:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the spirit of cooperation on moving bills forward to committee will be extended to this very important initiative.  I think Canadians deserve to know that the politicians they elect take issues seriously, especially when those issues hit them right in the pocketbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of pharmaceutical products has been on the rise in recent years. The current regulatory regime puts an upward push on prices, which results in average Canadians not only paying more through their benefit plans or at the pharmacy counter, but also through their tax dollars that support our public, universal health care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going too far, I want to talk about what this bill is not about.  The bill is not about reducing patent protection for innovative pharmaceutical companies.  The bill is also not about taking sides in the ongoing war of words and actions between brand name and generic pharmaceutical industries and producers in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is about making sure that the pharmaceutical industry is treated like all other industries before the law. That is what will benefit Canadians most. Currently there are loopholes, which means that both industries can use a variety of tactics which keep lower cost generic drugs off the market longer than the patent period and encourage litigation and waste of money and time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of legal machinations that are employed as a result of these regulations is sickening because of the money that is wasted, money  that could be better spent on development and innovation, on getting generic versions to the market, and lastly, on getting people the medications they need to treat their illnesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring fair competition is an important public policy of this country.  However, our drug regulation regime fosters anti-competitive behaviour. The end result is that Canadians suffer en masse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs are the fastest rising cost component in our health care system.  I believe that we all have a duty in this Parliament to try to address this in the larger context of improving the affordability of our public medicare system. In fact, I believe it is part of saving it in order  to ensure that we pass on this national treasure and heritage to our children and our children's children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers pay more for their drugs than they should have to, particularly for some of the drugs most needed by Canadians.  When drug monopolies are extended past the 20 year patent period, consumers, patients, governments and our health care system pay more for drugs, because generic drugs are priced on average 40% to 55% lower for the same brand version of a drug. It has been estimated that the various legal techniques used have cost close to $1.5 billion since the regulations came into effect just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other Canadian industry has similar regulations.  This is isolated and alone and exceptional, so how does this happen?  Why has the Liberal government allowed $1.5 billion of Canadians' money to go into the pockets of the mostly multinational pharmaceutical companies?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens because the regulations, known as the patented medicine notice of compliance regulations,  or PM(NOC) regulations, allow it. Even though they legally are abusive and generally damaging, these regulations have been in place in their existing form for over seven years. To date the government has not changed those regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the regulations was and continues to be to develop a balance between the competing interests of the brand and generic industries.  Unfortunately, they have the ability to do the exact opposite. Successive Liberal and Conservative governments have chosen to sweep this important public policy issue under the carpet and also keep Parliament in the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give members a little bit of history.  The regulations we are talking about now are relatively new in a Canadian context.  They took their first form in 1993 with Bill C-91 and have been the subject of several regulatory changes since that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Canadian government saw a key role for itself in limiting market monopolies in pharmaceutical products.  Compulsory licensing was used, which meant that a generic could compete with the lower priced versions. In 1985, a federal commission of inquiry known as the Eastman commission, set up by Trudeau's government, concluded that: the use of compulsory licensing had saved hundreds of millions of dollars, no adverse impact on the research of the pharmaceutical industry happened, and nor were the decisions of multinational drug companies regarding investment in research and development affected by this regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with pressure from the U.S. around the 1988 and the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA in 1994, Bill C-22 and Bill C-91 radically altered the way Canada deals with pharmaceutical patents. The 17 year patent protection became 20 years. Products, not just processes, could be patented, and compulsory licensing was completely removed with Bill C-91.</p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federal commission of inquiry today would likely find the opposite of the 1985 findings to be true.  The radical shift in government policy, largely the result of pressure from the United States in negotiating free trade deals, has undermined the possibility for our government to retain some element of real control over pharmaceutical prices to ensure Canadians have access to affordable pharmaceuticals at the pharmacy counter and in our public health care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do the regulations do?  The easiest way to describe the regulations from a consumer's perspective is that through a variety of legal techniques which  even the government itself has tried to stop but has failed in the courts, brand companies are able, if they choose, to delay generic drugs entering  the market.  How does this happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals would like us to believe it is a very complicated system that is best left to the bureaucrats.  I would say  it is only complicated if we believe that the bureaucrats are the best people situated to make decisions on behalf of the country.  The truth of the matter is that the industry that regularly ranks first among all Canadian industries in terms of profitability, whose main operation is to repackage drugs that are actually researched, developed and manufactured in other countries, continues to get its cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations got off to a very bad start in the dying days of the Mulroney government when Bill C-91 was rammed through Parliament when the PM(NOC) regulations were instituted without any public consultation through the normal gazetting period.  All of the changes since have been regulatory. This  means that the representatives of the people in the House had no opportunity to debate them in a binding way.  As a result, generic manufacturers have been kept off the market in a couple of different ways through what is known as evergreening and automatic injunctions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic injunctions allow brand companies to allege patent infringement when a generic applies for a notice of allegation.  This process in and of itself would be relatively harmless if the real problem of determining what kinds of patents are allowed to be listed on  the patent register were clear, but they are not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brand name can list many different patents for the same product by claiming different uses, patenting different forms, such as  capsules or tablets, changing the name of the drug, or in the past, the name of the drug company.  There  sometimes are  numerous patents that can hold up a generic from entering the market. In addition, the courts have interpreted that the regulations allow brands to list all of these multiple patents even though in one case the judge reported that it was “opposite to logic”.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the generics eventually win in 75% of these cases, they are on average kept off the markets between 15 and 21 months when the automatic stay is applied for.  However, when we look at  a few blockbuster drugs, we can see that when it is more profitable, brands have been able to maintain their monopoly for up to four years on average by applying for automatic injunctions on  patents that it is  fairly obvious have been strategically registered to maintain their monopoly and maximize profits, at the expense of consumers and our drug industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rewarding an innovative manufacturer with strong patent protection such a bad thing?  No it is not, but that is not what we have with the PM(NOC) regulations.  Instead we have a system that continues to add virtual patent extensions without accompanying results in research and development or domestic manufacturing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that not all brand companies employ such abusive tactics and are not actually in keeping with good business principles and the spirit of the regulations.   The problem, however, is that it does not stop all those and a certain amount of patent infringements or claims have delayed generic versions in some of the worst situations costing hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, the primary independent policy tool available to Canadians to examine how brand companies operate, reported that of 103 patents added to the patent register, only 16 were new active substances.  Patents are being registered for  uses not approved  by Health Canada, for new coatings, and changes to active ingredients.  This is not innovation; this is just delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brand companies promised us innovation when the PM(NOC) regulations were first introduced. They continue to maintain that they are the only way to allow them to do innovative R and D in this country.  Even with the favourable regulations today, which  the brands actually do support, they have been failing to meet the commitment they made to Canadians of a ratio of 10% R and D to sales for the last three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 brand spending on research and development fell to its lowest level since 1989.  Spending on basic research continues to be the smallest portion of R and D. In 2003 it actually fell by over 9%.  Over half of the R and D spending was on clinical trials. Meanwhile they spend tons of money and an exorbitant amount of resources on marketing and advertising to people.</p><A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a 2003 study by Research   Infosource  a generic company  placed high, ranking at number 13 of Canada's top 100 corporate R and D spenders.  This is the first time a generic company has ranked higher than a brand company. This  clearly indicates  it is not  just the brand companies that can make exclusive claims to R and D expenditures as a justification for the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president and COO of that  highly ranked generic company made a presentation at the June 2003 industry committee hearings. That person in favour of a review, in favour of eliminating the automatic injunctions and the need for stronger regulations to prevent evergreening and argued that more R and D would happen on the generic  side if the situation resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should automatic injunctions and evergreening concern us here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug prices are the fastest rising component of our health care system.  The average price of a drug produced by a brand company increased by 75% in the decade between 1993 and 2003.  In the same time period generic drug prices only increased by 42%.  Generic drugs are part of the solution to keeping drug prices under control. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system and  the regime needs to change. Recently there have been many calls from a variety of  sources  not only for a review of the regulations but also to make sure that   regulations allow for accelerated access to non-patented drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make a real effort to improve this situation. Those who can least afford it are suffering the most because of the abusive strategies that are legally used under the PM(NOC) regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, benefit plan workers, benefit plans themselves, employers and all levels of government that purchase pharmaceutical products for delivering public health care are hurt the most under the current regulatory regime.  In fact, it often leads to labour disputes because benefit packages are one of the most contentious issues among organized workforces and their employers. Generic companies  which  may be  prevented from entering markets and thus are losing potential revenue at least have  an opportunity to sue for damages when they are put off in the market, but the Canadian public does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand drug companies can be investigated by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board  and if they are found to be selling at excessive prices, they are asked if they will voluntarily pay back the money.  This is called a voluntary compliance undertaking, known as VCU.  There is, however, no mechanism for this money to be reimbursed to consumers, drug benefit plans, or even provincial governments.  All   the money simply goes back into the Liberals' general coffers.  There is not even a guarantee that the money will be spent on health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumers at the most vulnerable state   overpay for drugs; the companies pay that money back and it goes to the government, not back to them.  That is unconscionable and it should be corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PM(NOC) regulations are above and beyond what we is required  in terms of patent protection for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public policy objectives must be more important than pressure from multinational companies.  Any changes to the regulations must address the most important public policy objective when it comes to pharmaceuticals: making sure that Canadians and our publicly funded  health care system  have access to affordable drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last September the Liberals promised to work with the provinces.  The first ministers  task force on developing a pharmaceutical strategy has as one of its nine key components to accelerate access to non-patented drugs. In order for that to happen the PM(NOC) regulations in their current form have to be eliminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some independent sources  have reviewed this issue over the last several years. One of the more interesting ones came from stock analyst Hemant Shah from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shows the demonstrated awareness of Wall Street on what the practices of the industry have been through these regulations to maximize their profits at the expense of people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health and welfare of Canadian citizens,  and with an aging population, the requirement of access to drugs and medicines to treat their illnesses is a paramount issue  not only for  our generation but also for the future of Canada and saving its medicare system.  Let us stop the abuse and make sure that we innovate and do not litigate.</p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117759"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117762"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117732"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for sponsoring the bill.  As he knows, many of us have worked a lot of overtime to put this issue in its proper perspective and come up  with a regime that would at least constructively deal with regulations which, by all accounts, have not been very favourable to either innovation or  to the welfare of consumers in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the hon. member for Windsor West and my colleague, the hon. member for Edmonton--Leduc were helpful in terms of our experience. This is a very  important issue for the parliamentary secretary as well. He has seized upon the issue and will  be introducing, hopefully in the next few months, a formal understanding of what the regulations will look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that the current regulations are draconian.  I wonder if the member could  give an illustration   how costly the current regime, without amendments, will be to Canadian consumers, particularly as it relates to our balance of trade.</p><A NAME="Int-1117762"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117767"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117759"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse: </b>Mr. Speaker, the member for Pickering--Scarborough East pioneered this issue long before I came to Parliament.  He made sure it was at the table in the industry committee when I arrived in 2002.  That was the first time this issue  had a serious review.  It did not reach  the floor of the House of Commons for a vote, but it at least made it to that stage and  I congratulate the member for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give the member a couple of examples of the cost to Canadians.  The  anti-depressant drug called Paxil had nine patents on it.  The original 20 year patent was due  in 1999.  The drug did not get on the market until 2003 because of  evergreening.  There was a delay of 1,442 days which cost Canadians $114 million alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another drug known as Losec was due to enter the market in 1999 but it took until 2004.  There are still some outstanding issues regarding this drug.  This one particular drug had a loss of  $443 million.  This is money that is lost to our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing we need to recognize is  that Canada is an export country.  Almost all our manufacturing and our industries are in surplus situations.  We have  a surplus in the United States.  This is one of the few industries where we have  a massive trade deficit.   The industry itself no longer calls itself a manufacturer because it does mostly packaging.</p><A NAME="Int-1117767"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117762"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I note that my colleague is recommending that we eliminate the NOC regulations, but he is not recommending that we eliminate the early working provisions. According to the  Industry Canada officials who presented at committee, early working provisions and the NOC regulations are flip sides of the same coin. My colleague obviously disagrees with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member explain to Canadians what are the early working provisions? Why does he not see them as flip slides of the same coin? Why is he recommending eliminating the NOC regulations but leaving in the early working provisions which certainly favour the generic industry in Canada?</p><A NAME="Int-1117773"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117779"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117767"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse: </b>Mr. Speaker, the early working provisions allow generic drugs to be manufactured and tested and put on the market after the 20 year period. I have not put that  in the bill because I wanted to sharpen the debate on this issue.  I am certainly open to amendments if that is the balance that is required. If my bill receives support and gets to committee, I  would encourage that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the bill get to committee. If it does not,  we are telling the government that it is okay for this to be done through regulations and that parliamentarians have no business whatsoever in the debate on this issue.  This is the opportunity.  One member of the Bloc Québécois has a bill which addresses part of these issues too.  We are open to amendments. Early working provisions could be part of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the issues also relate to additional costs.   We are certainly open to discussing that issue as well.</p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117779"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117781"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

George Bush is a progressive in this field because only one automatic stay of injunction is allowed in the U.S., so the Americans have addressed this. We know the influence of the industry in the United States, but at the same time, there was enough recognition of the problem and this leaves Canada alone in the world with such a regime.</p><A NAME="Int-1117793"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117799"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117781"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for Windsor West for bringing the issue forward and colleagues who have spoken in the House who are very concerned about the balance that we are trying to create in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a unique balance in public interest. When we look at the implications of intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry, the government must maintain a delicate balance between two important and competing policy objectives. On the one hand, we must encourage advancements in medicine by providing effective patent protection for new drugs on all fronts, and on the other hand, we must ensure that versions of drugs are able to move forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-274, introduced by the member for Windsor West, seeks to disrupt this balance by repealing the patented medicines notice of compliance regulations. The regulations together with the early working exemption under the Patent Act are two pillars of the government's balanced drug patent policy. The early working exception allows generic companies to use a patent drug for the purpose of seeking approval to market a generic version of a brand name drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, the conduct of this would constitute patent infringement, but the early working exception allows a generic drug company to compete with Canada's health regulatory and approval process while the equivalent brand name drug is still under patent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is then possible for a brand name drug company to be in a position to enter the market as soon as possible after patent expiry. The generic pharmaceutical industry estimates that early working can accelerate the market entry of its products in Canada by three to five years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While early working is intended to promote the timely market entry of generic drugs, the regulations are necessary to ensure that this exception to the patent infringement is not abused by generic companies who are seeking early product approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent protection is an important incentive in encouraging investment and promoting research and development of new and better medical therapies. The regulations provide incentives by ensuring that brand name drugs enjoy secure, stable, uninterrupted periods of market exclusivity prior to the eventual and irreversible arrival of generic competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed, the bill would seriously undermine Canada's balanced drug patent policy by effectively stripping brand name drug companies of the most effective patent enforcement mechanism that presently exists at their disposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repealing the regulations would prompt the brand name pharmaceutical industry to withdraw its considerable R and D investments from Canada with a corresponding loss in research-intensive employment here. It would also compromise Canada's access to the latest medical therapies as brand name drug companies would no longer have any incentive to seek the Canadian market promptly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry Canada and Health Canada are aware of the concerns of the member for Windsor West regarding the regulations and his reasons for advancing Bill C-274. In recent years representatives of the generic pharmaceutical industry have been increasingly vocal in allegations that brand name companies are abusing the regulations to unfairly delay generic competition, a practice they refer to as evergreening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government remains convinced however, that regulations are a vital part of this industry and Canada's balanced drug patent policy is important. Generic drug companies continue to challenge brand name patents early and often. And so, without the protection of regulations, infringing generic drugs could enter the market soon after the innovator and well before the expiry of the original product's patent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, the government recognizes that there have been instances of behaviour compliance by the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have therefore developed a package of regulatory amendments intended to restore the original balanced policy intent behind the regulations. </p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, which were pre-published in the <i>Canada Gazette</i> Part I, on December 12, 2004 will facilitate the market entry of generic versions of brand name drugs immediately following expiry of relevant patents as the bill originally intended, while at the same time allowing brand name companies to duly promote improvements to the original form of the drug that are genuinely accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed, this package of amendments would approve Canada's competitiveness as an investment location and would establish more predictable and stable rules relating to the intellectual property of pharmaceuticals.  It is my hope that the member for Windsor West will support these amendments and, in so doing, support Canada's efforts to ensure that we continue to have a balanced drug patent policy regime that will continue to be the leading choice of investment for our pharmaceutical industry.</p><A NAME="Int-1117799"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117808"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117793"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I too want to commend my colleague from Windsor West for bringing this issue forward. I know it is an issue very near and dear to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak to Bill C-274, an act to amend the Patent Act. This bill would seek to repeal the notice of compliance regulations and reduce the extent of patent protection. It was actually a former Conservative government that introduced these regulations in the first place that this bill seeks to amend.  The Conservative Party today continues to believe that the intent of a pharmaceutical policy should be to achieve a balance that encourages the development of new drugs and treatments for Canadians, and at the same time provide those drugs to Canadians at an affordable price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is that the Conservative Party supports regulations that respect property rights and encourages research and development into new drugs by brand name companies. At the same time we support regulations that allow generic manufacturers to offer similar medicines at a lower price after a reasonable period of time. We also support the existing system now where the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board regulates the prices of brand name drugs here in Canada, which actually does not happen with the generics, and that is an important point we should make here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to identify two types of pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is important, especially for viewers watching this, to be aware of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is what is called the brand name or the research-based pharmaceutical company like Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Merck Frosst, et cetera. These companies do the basic research and create drugs from scratch. These drugs are certainly expensive to research and develop, and they are one side of the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of manufacturer is the generic manufacturer. In Canada, basically the two largest are Apotex and Novopharm. The generic companies copy a brand name drug after its patent expires, although as the question I asked the member earlier indicates, through the early working provisions they actually research that so that they are able to go to market as soon as the 20 year patent expires. It is important to note though that they copy certain drugs. The generic industry copies the drugs which are generally the most lucrative, and that obviously makes economic sense to them, but they do not copy all the drugs, especially the ones that do not in fact raise a lot of revenues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As written, Bill C-274 in our view would seriously harm the brand name pharmaceutical industry in Canada by removing all the protection regulations currently provided to the brand name companies. The stated objective of the bill is to exclude drugs from the scope of the regulation-making power provided for in subsection 55.2(4) of the Patent Act, while making other amendments to reduce the extent of patent protection for medicines. The bill would achieve its objective in part through appeals in the notice of compliance regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the bill would ignore our obligation under the TRIPS agreement, under these multilateral agreements, to provide 20-year patent protection for brand name pharmaceutical companies. The fact is that no other country treats pharmaceutical patent issues the same way it treats patents for cars, telescopes or other industries. For example, and I know the member in his speech mentioned this, the pharmaceutical industry does have patent rules that are particular for that industry, but that is the same as in other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that if a generic manufacturer ignored a patent and put its product on the market before the patent had expired, it would take years for a brand name pharmaceutical company to go through the regular court system and a full infringement action. If the brand name won, it would likely never gain back the market it lost to the generic company because that is how quickly people would switch because of  difference in price. It would take more time to recoup damage costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that if this bill were passed companies like Merck Frosst and GlaxoSmithKline would likely remove themselves as much as possible from Canada. I know some people do not see this as a concern. Speaking personally as a member from Edmonton, I know that these companies invest a lot into R and D of infectious diseases, for instance, Dr. Lorne Tyrrell, the former dean of medicine at the U of A, is researching into hepatitis B and hepatitis C at the U of A. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the companies that are investing the money into trying to research and create new drugs to lengthen or to certainly improve human life. Canada's brand name industry spends roughly $1 billion on R and D. It hires extremely well educated Canadians, most obviously with post-secondary degrees, and it produces some truly amazing drugs such as the asthma drug Singulair in Montreal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1840)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that there are problems with litigation on certain drugs which have multiple patents.  I support efforts to reduce the litigation, at which I know the government is currently looking.  I support the member for Windsor West in making an effort to bring those regulatory changes open, whether it is before a committee or before the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we want to seek to preserve that balance. It is important on the patent issue to make this known. In the hearings we have had, both Health Canada and Industry Canada  pointed out that most drugs had either one or two patents. It is the big, blockbuster drugs like Paxil or Losec that have eight patents, which is the big cause of most of the litigation between the generic and the brand names in Canada. That is an important point to make. In our view the bill shifts the balance away from that precious balance to entirely in favour of the generic manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view the generation and development of new scientific knowledge is pivotal to the growth and the prosperity of the Canadian economy. The Conservative Party would like to see the brand name manufacturers invest more money in R and D. We have asked them to do that and we will push them to do that, and to hire even more well-educated Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill were passed, it would have quite the opposite effect on the industry, and it would have a negative effect on the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand fully that the pharmaceutical industry is litigious, but even as former industry ministers from the government side have pointed out, will this ever stop? I think the changes in the regulations that the government is looking at now will certainly reduce that.  The fact is with the amount of money around the industry, it is likely to be litigious long into the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain some of the issues relating to patents and how the automatic injunction and early working provisions work. Normally a patent is exclusive. A patent cannot be broken before it expires. However, the notice of compliance regulations allows generics to copy and conduct clinical trials of drugs still under patent as part of a system called “early working”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use plain English and to use a specific example, before its 20 year patent expires, the generics can create a copy of the asthma drug, Singulair, for mass production. They can conduct their human trials on the copy and they can get Health Canada to review and approve their copy before the original patent on Singulair, which is owned by Merck Frosst, has expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that once this copy has been approved, the generics do not want to wait until the patent expires, especially if it  is a blockbuster drug  like the ones I mentioned, the anti-depressant Paxil or the ulcer drug Losec.  Generics, according to the testimony from Health Canada, challenge patents to get on the market earlier. They will take the brand name companies to court and argue that the patent does not apply to their specific copy of the drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members before me mentioned, the Standing Committee on Industry in June 2003 conducted hearings on this matter. We asked Industry Canada if it was common for generics to attempt to break brand name patents before the patent has expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote the question my colleague from Yellowhead asked at the time of Industry officials, “Have the generics challenged the 20 years? Have they tried to put a product on [the market] before the 20 year period [has expired]?”  The resounding answer from officials was yes. To quote them, “Yes, I'm not aware of a drug where they haven't”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake, early working provides the generic companies with a distinct competitive advantage over the patent holders and over other countries where early working does not exist, such as the United States. Thus, there is a counterbalancing measure in the notice of compliance regulations which is called an automatic injunction. It is also known as linkage regulations by the brands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a generic wants to copy a brand name drug, it must inform the brand. The brand has 45 days to advise the generic company as to whether or not the brand believes the generic is infringing on its patent rights. If the patent holder agrees that patent has expired, then the generic is given permission to go to market. This happens repeatedly once the patent is not contested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the brand believes their patent would be infringed by the introduction of a generic product, the brand is granted an automatic injunction. The brand goes to the federal court and is granted 24 months for the case to proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generics call this practice evergreening. Their argument is that the brand gets its 20 years plus the 24 months, so at least 22 years. However, what this fails to disclose is the fact that the generics can actually introduce in year 17, 18 or 19 and the 24 month period can actually be within the 20 year patent. If the generic tries to get on the market in the 20th year of the patent and the brand is granted an automatic injunction, in that case it  extends the life of the patent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in this party do not support the bill because we believe it upsets the balance between the research companies and the generic companies.</p><A NAME="T1845"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1845)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

First, a historical overview is important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that Canada wanted a system that would allow for an industry researching new medicines, based in large part on a model adopted by Brian Mulroney's Conservative government. An agreement was reached with the research industry. As a result, if the government assured it stable conditions over a number of years, the industry would, in return, commit to investing in research. In fact, both parties kept their commitment, which allowed the establishment of a very sound research industry, particularly in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the federal government's conditions, the Quebec government implemented proposals and ways to protect such medicines. Today, we see the numerous and significant spin-offs of this. In the greater Montreal area, many people are making a good living from this industry, thanks to generous salaries. This phenomenon has also spread to the Quebec City region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the bill before the House proposes to set aside what we call the  linkage regulations, which corresponds to the compromise developed to create a balance between research companies developing new products, which have to invest significant funds to do so, and the generic companies copying drugs, which want to ensure their availability to the most people possible.   The balance that we have tried to create is extremely fragile. In fact, for quite some time, each party, both the generic drug manufacturers and the manufacturers of new drugs resulting from indepth research, has been trying to ensure that the conditions regulating this sector are to its advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been sitting on the Standing Committee on Industry, Sciences and Technology for two or three years, and my predecessors in the Bloc Québécois did so for 10 years. The fact of the matter is that we have always been confronted with the same reality. Whenever we are listening to the arguments by  one side or the other, we find some parts acceptable and some questionable.   Ultimately, one constant emerges: what is most detrimental to research and development is the desire for constant change. This has adverse consequences. In the drug manufacturing industry, competition can be seen not only between research companies, but also within the companies, according to  the country where they are established. For example, in Canada,  when the regulatory environment is changed,    the head office in the United States or Europe stands to benefit if we make regular changes and let it be known that these changes will be detrimental to these research companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case to some extent with the bill before us. It reflects the vision of the member who introduced it, which is that, whether  the drugs are research-based or generic,   tough competition among drug manufacturers should be encouraged in order to maintain prices at a minimum. But the bill overlooks an important consequence: this would very significantly disrupt the current job structure in the industry. I find it difficult to believe that this is an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that this debate be a public one. The public has to be aware of the consequences of the choices made by governments. In this sense, it would be interesting if all angles of dealing with the issue could be presented in this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we in the Bloc Québécois obviously  cannot support such an approach, as it   would have too great a negative impact on the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  we look at how drug pricing works in Canada, there are other solutions which have to be considered as well, to determine their relevance. The fact should also     be taken into account that, at present, the Department of Industry, in cooperation  with the Department of Health, is conducting consultations on a proposed amendment to the  linkage regulations. These consultations are continuing until February 24.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard from the generic companies to the effect that they will reject the proposed amendments as drafted. It is possible that when the consultations and negotiations are over, by February 24 or a few days later, we will be able to reach a compromise solution. That is what I want. For the moment, that is where these companies stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the research-based companies, we do not yet know their official position. The proposed amendments to the linkage regulations may be acceptable to young companies just beginning to develop products.</p><A NAME="T1850"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1850)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they may not appeal to the older companies that have well-established products. The inverse may also be true. The analysis is not yet complete on that side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it must be said that many of the realities of  pharmaceutical manufacturing do change over time. Thus, 25 years ago pharmaceuticals did not have the mission they have today, of prevention and insurance. For example, the cost of a drug to lower blood cholesterol rates, which the patient has to pay for, may seem significant, but the cost for society is much less than if it had to pay for surgery. There are financial costs and also human costs related to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it must be studied very thoroughly and very carefully. At present, I am leaning much more in favour of a approach that would try to ensure that the consultation being carried out by the departments of industry and health is done properly and done transparently enough that, in the end, if we do eventually amend the linkage regulations in a way that is acceptable to both parties, we will be resolving an  important issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, however,   that doing away with the linkage regulations today would solve anything.  I am sure that there would be a great deal of opposition in this House against it.  It would be worthwhile seeking the opinion of international experts who would not have to issue opinions on drug quality per se, but only on the economic impact of such a decision.  This would enable us to see immediately that this was inappropriate for the economy of Quebec and of Canada in general. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much being put into creating research structures for training academics, who must have opportunities available to them in the end. It would not be to the advantage of the people of Quebec and of Canada  to become nothing more than consumers of the most economical drugs.  We also need people who produce drugs, not just experimental  drugs,  but also generic drugs under reasonable conditions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The linkage regulations have been through so much over the past 10 years that now we have identified the gaps and areas that need work. I do not think it is necessary to start from scratch. Instead we could see whether the government's proposed amendments are acceptable or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most concrete example, albeit very complicated, that I can give is that during the creation of a new drug by a company, the generic company can ask for permission to reproduce the drug and the research company that created the drug can ask for an injunction. Under the current act and regulations, there can even be multiple injunctions, which means the generic product will never enter the market. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a way to refine this so as to reach a solution that limits the number of injunctions that can be made. There will be a mechanism that will help continue to create jobs, which is what we want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this bill will not be passed by the House. It was tabled with many good intentions regarding the impact on the availability of cheaper drugs. However, when we look at all the data, the economic repercussions and the quality of the drugs, we realize that we have to make sure that this is handled properly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that other problems have surfaced because of online pharmacies. We realize that some prices of generic drugs in Canada are much higher than they should be while prices of drugs and research products are controlled on the market. We realize there are also implications for the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, I think the route proposed in the bill is not appropriate.</p><A NAME="T1855"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1855)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to foster growth and create high quality, well paying jobs, the government has set, as one of its core priorities, the building of a 21st century economy. In furtherance of this, the government must continue its work to support sound marketplace framework laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair, efficient and competitive marketplace, combined with an effective regulatory framework, creates a business environment that is supportive of innovation, investment and economic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To foster an efficient and competitive marketplace in the pharmaceutical sector, it is necessary that the government's drug patent laws strike an appropriate balance between encouraging pharmaceutical investment and innovation by providing effective patent protection for innovative medical therapies while, at the same time, facilitating the earliest possible entry of non-infringing, lower cost generic pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patented medicines, notice of compliance) regulations, or the PMNOC regulations, and the “early working exception” under the Patent Act are both integral to the maintenance of this balance, a  balance Bill C-274 will  most certainly undermine, if passed, given that it calls for the outright repeal of the PMNOC regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pharmaceutical industry, the early working exception allows generic drug manufacturers to use a patented innovative drug for the purpose of seeking approval to market a competing version of that drug.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, conduct of this kind would constitute patent infringement but an exception has been made so that the generic drug companies can compete with Health Canada's regulatory approval process while the equivalent innovative drug is still under patent. This is done so the generic can be in a position to enter the market as soon as possible after the patent expiry. This ensures that the patentees do not enjoy a de facto monopoly beyond the life of the patent by virtue of the time it takes for a generic drug company to complete Health Canada's regulatory review process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While early working is intended to promote the timely market entry of generic drugs, the PMNOC regulations are necessary to ensure that this exception to patent infringement is not used improperly by generic drug companies that  might seek to sell their products during the term of the competitor's patent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent protection is an important incentive in encouraging investment and promoting research and development and giving the difficulties traditionally associated with protecting  pharmaceutical patent rights by way of conventional infringement litigation, and the PMNOC regulations are intended to operate as a potent patent enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the regulations and the early working exception work in concert to maintain a balance in Canada's drug patent policy.  It is important that neither instrument be considered in isolation as the intended policy can only be achieved when the two operate in a balanced fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the government's drug patent policy appears to be achieving its objectives of encouraging investment and fostering competition.  Since the introduction of the early working and the PMNOC regulations in 1993, total R and D spending in Canada by innovative companies has more than doubled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over that same period, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board reports that manufacturers' prices of patented drugs in Canada have followed a consistent pattern of decline or near negligible increases and the price of patented drugs in Canada has gone from being 23% higher than the medium international price to 5% below the median and 40% lower than the price in the United States.  In fact, the price of patented drugs in Canada has risen by less than the consumer price index in almost every year since 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these positive outcomes, the PMNOC regulations remain a contentious policy instrument.  In recent years, representatives of the generic pharmaceutical industry have become increasingly vocal in their allegations that brand name companies are abusing  the regulations to unfairly delay generic competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry Canada, with the assistance of Health Canada, has completed a comprehensive assessment of these allegations and found that while the fundamentals of the regime are sound, there have been instances of behaviour complained of by the generic industry involving some top selling drugs. </p><A NAME="T1900"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1900)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the behaviour in question is exceptional, it has been facilitated by a number of recent court decisions and could potentially grow in the years to come. To prevent this occurrence, a package of regulatory amendments has been developed and will restore the original balanced policy intent underlying the early working exception and the PMNOC regulations. These amendments were re-published in the <i>Canada Gazette</i>, part I, on December 11, 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repealing the PMNOC regulations would be an extreme measure which would completely undermine the government's attempt to maintain its balanced drug patent policy.  It would allow generic manufacturers to continue to use the early working exception  while stripping pharmaceutical manufacturers of the most effective patent enforcement mechanism at their disposal. This would tip the policy balance between intellectual property protection and the generic entry wholly in favour of the generic industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-274 would also have a number of negative consequences for Canadians.  In the absence of strong and effective patent protection, innovator companies would drastically curtail their domestic R and D, which would result in a corresponding loss in research intensive employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians' access  to the latest medical therapies may also be compromised as innovator companies would be less inclined, absent effective patent protection, to bring their latest products to the Canadian market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that the member for Windsor West will instead support the government's recently proposed amendments to the PMNOC regulations and, in so doing, support this government's effort to foster a fair and competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products.</p><A NAME="Int-1117828"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117899"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117814"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, first  I wish to congratulate the member for Windsor West for bringing the  bill forward.  It is an important element for the House to discuss. I would urge all members to consider voting in favour of the bill  and getting it to a committee where  we can have a transparent and open discussion about the impact of the current legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of people have spoken about the government proposals. We have  a number of difficulties with them.  In part, the discussion on many of the proposals that have come forward has occurred behind the scenes.  There has not been an open and very public dialogue about the impact of these particular regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some fear  that these regulations are stop gap at the very best and that they would not address some of the current abuses that are in place. It took seven years to get these changes into place but   there is no mandatory review and no real guarantee that they will work this time. The government thought the regulations were going to work last time and they clearly have not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CGPA has done some very quick estimates of the cost of increased data protection.  Had these current proposals been in place over the last five years, it would have added  a further $600 million to prescription costs in Canada.  That is just at a minimum.  Those kinds of numbers contribute to what we are talking about in terms of the spiralling drug costs in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is hurt the most by these drug costs?  We are in a climate where we are putting profits before people.  Drug therapy costs are second only to hospital expenditures and they are slightly larger than expenditures on doctors.  There is no indication that these drug costs will    change any time soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial governments are demanding changes as their drug benefit plan costs increase at about 14% annually.  With an aging population it is very difficult to see how these drug costs would go down substantially over the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian taxpayers are paying twice in our current system.  They not only pay for our public, universal health care system, but they are also paying again at the pharmacy counter.  These kinds of doubling up of costs for Canadians cannot go on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulations have multiple impacts.  One impact that they have is on the drug benefit plans.  Green Shield Canada's analysis of drug claim costs from 1997 to 2001 indicated that maximizing generic use was important in controlling costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Shield also indicated before the industry committee in 2003 that because of the rising cost of drugs they were being forced to change their standards of coverage and by doing so they were having to delist eligible drugs, increase co-payments and increase deductibles, which were  having a direct impact on its  patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also impacts on employers and employees.  Unions negotiate health benefits to fill gaps left by our health care system.  Many unions have vocally asked for a public pharmacare as there is increasing conflict at the bargaining table over the costs of health plans, particularly drug plans.</p><A NAME="T1905"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1905)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117899"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117828"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

This matter has been discussed previously in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Christmas the Deputy Prime Minister indicated to the House that this program was an enormous success, particularly the ADR component of the program, and that the costs which had been incurred up to that point  were simply costs that related to the ramping up process so that the government could carry on with the settlement of ADR claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, nothing of the sort has happened.  At this point the government has expended approximately $125 million on this process and has resolved something in the neighbourhood of 50 ADR cases.  In effect, if one analyzes the numbers it is very clear that four-fifths of every $1  that has  been spent on this program has been spent on bureaucracy, experts, lawyers and the like, with only 20¢ on the $1 ever finding its way through to the victims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AFN studied this and put a recommendation before the government but it judged the ADR program, the process, to be a complete failure.  It says that  it is motivated by the tort claim considerations of the government but, most important, it says that at the current rate it will take 53 years and cost $2.3 billion in bureaucratic, legal and expert costs alone to resolve these claims.  That does not even take into consideration the cost  of the settlements themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time the number of claims that  have been submitted to the government under its program are quite meagre compared to the total pool of available claimants.  I have been  told that something in the neighbourhood of 1,227 cases have been submitted to the government in this dispute resolution process.  In fact, there is a known pool of 85,975 live-in residential school survivors who have available claims against the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the entire mismanagement of the program is complicated by the class action lawsuits that  have been commenced, one by the name of Cloud, which has now been certified in the Ontario Divisional Court, and a second one by the name of Baxter,  which is on the verge of certification.  All of this spells enormous liability consequences for the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the minister tell this House how   the government intends to deal with this?  It is very clear that the ADR program is not working and  that it is a dismal failure with $125 million to $135 million having  been spent at this point with 50 cases resolved.  That is beyond pathetic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government intending to do about this?  There has been a redress scheme in Ireland called the residential institutions redress act of 2002.    I am not necessarily saying that I would agree with everything in that legislative scheme, but it is certainly understandable.  Could the minister tell the House why we have not followed an approach like that?  Why is there so much mystery, confusion and bureaucracy surrounding the process that is being followed by the government?</p><A NAME="T1910"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1910"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1910)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117843"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117847"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to the member for Calgary Centre-North about his question pertaining to the residential school claims program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to one of his questions, he probably knows that the government has appealed the Cloud decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague is aware, the government launched the alternative dispute resolution process in November 2003 as a fast, safe and effective option to resolve complex and sensitive abuse claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underpinning of the ADR process is to resolve the majority of claims within seven years at a cost of $1.7 billion, with $1 billion of that money going directly to former students.  In addition, claimants have access to counselling and commemoration.  To date, over 1,000 former students have applied to the ADR process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agreed to support the Assembly of First Nations to prepare a report that would recommend ways to make the ADR process more acceptable to former students.  This demonstrates our willingness and openness to listen to the advice of key stakeholders and ensure a healthy policy debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ADR process was only designed as an accelerated way to review and compensate for claims of physical and sexual abuse and wrongful confinement.  The Assembly of First Nations review seeks a much broader scope.  The Assembly of First Nations has recommended compensation for each of the 87,000 former students.  This is on top of compensation for claims of physical and sexual abuse.  We need to take a careful look at the costing of the Assembly of First Nations proposal to establish how there could be savings as stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are legally required to respond to any claim related to Indian residential schools and now face about 11,300 such outstanding claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the hon. member is not suggesting that the government pay all the claims without verifying them, since the government has an obligation to Canadians to ensure that all claims of abuse are validated before compensation is awarded.  There is often a marked departure between what is claimed and what gets accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes time and money to verify the allegations and properly assess the impact of the abuse.  This is a very large expenditure and is part of government's due diligence to taxpayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add that there is a rigorous competitive bidding and selection process to award research contracts.  Historical research firms are selected via MERX, the national electronic bidding system.  For the hon. member to suggest anything different is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the government designed the ADR process to give former students a choice in how best  to resolve their residential school claims.  We are offering a timely, supportive and humane approach to resolving claims.</p><A NAME="T1915"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1915"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1915)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117847"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117843"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice: </b>Madam Speaker, just to follow up with a supplementary question for my friend, I note that the number of cases which have been brought before the government under the ADR process is very small compared to the total number of cases.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the figures which my friend has put before the House today, less than 2% of the pool of cases which the government is facing have been brought forward in this ADR process. That raises the question: why has the government invested $150 million in that process?  If the objective was to expend $1.7 billion within seven years and settle the majority of the cases which could be settled quickly, it is very clear at this point, two years into the program, that this is a complete failure and that it is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is not working for the victims. Newspapers in this country are replete with stories of residential school victims who feel they are being re-victimized by the process. There are indications that some of the victims are facing claims where their monetary award is $1,000 and yet $80,000 to $100,000 has been spent on proving the case in the manner my friend describes.  That is not acceptable.  What does the government intend to do about it?</p><A NAME="Int-1117850"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117858"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117847"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

The ADR process will resolve the majority of claims within seven years, which will result in savings to Canadians in the long run.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former immigration minister claimed she helped an exotic dancer on compassionate grounds. The minister's chief of staff also held inappropriate meetings with the owners of strip clubs to discuss work permits of dancers. Questions in the House of Commons also highlighted the number of public employees who were attending to the minister during the campaign. Then there was also a mix-up about a campaign contribution receipt. All came together to demonstrate the unethical politicization of immigration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to hear how the new minister has changed things. Ending the practice of importing exotic dancers by temporary permit was a right move, but in the past not once did we hear any Liberal immigration or human resources minister voice a public objection. Only with public embarrassment did the Liberals act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real problem is that we have a department that is very poorly run. First, its design is far too complicated. Second, the immigration ministry cannot properly communicate with its clients. The overall operations are inward and self-serving  rather than client service oriented. Many employees appear to be operating in mere survival mode, with poor law and regulations to guide them and poor personnel leadership and bad supervision within the workplace. No one seems to be up to date with their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discretionary decision points are being administered in an inconsistent and sometimes cruel manner that reminds one of past Liberal Party racism and the hurtful quotas and blacklists. The horror of the products of the system can be seen in the kinds of cases that get to the federal courts of Canada. Could anyone imagine a bureaucracy producing such bad results as what is regularly listed on the court docket?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This record is all against the backdrop of a political level which is out of touch with its workers, which continues to make unreasonable public pronouncements about targets, and which is without commensurate resources to deliver the mandate in a compassionate and professional manner. The problem has been unethical leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous minister made a commitment to me when she was first appointed. She claimed that as a backbencher from the Toronto area she was very aware of how the dysfunctional department had made MPs' offices extensions of the immigration department. She said she was also aware of the fraud going on within some foreign missions. She said she was going to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems we keep changing ministers, but the problems do not change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To top things off, the system has been unable to protect victims from being deported into danger zones. The pre-removal risk assessment system does not work. Just a few weeks ago, I placed the case of a young lady on the previous minister's desk with a pleading  note. In spite of that, the young lady was deported and now, just like I warned, she has been arrested and brutalized. It is another stark reminder that the Liberals cannot manage the public trust. If harm comes to this lady, I will hold the minister directly responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deep concern is that this government is not capable of solving the serious problems of the department. The cover-ups do not change the reality on the ground. Yet the minister is supposed to be accountable. In view of such poor results, one can understand why I asked my particular questions, and we can only hope that there will be, with the new minister, a meaningful change process and a huge commitment to clean up--</p><A NAME="T1920"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1920"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1920)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117862"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117858"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I would like to answer the member's questions, but I just want to deal with a couple of things.  I think there was a lot of rhetoric in the question; it was sort of in danger of a lot of heat and very little light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to shed some light on it because I think there has been a tendency to ask questions of Ministers of Citizenship and Immigration with rhetoric, knowing full well that in many instances many ministers of this House cannot answer those questions because they are bound, especially in the cases of immigration and other areas, by the Privacy Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot divulge why on the surface what seems to be a case that is not worthy of humanitarian and compassionate grounds really is, because they cannot give that data and that information without full consent of the client.  The ministers are bound by not being able to give the right answers or to explain the situation properly. That leads to this kind of rhetoric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we need to talk about is that  there were some statements made here which I really do want to respond to.  One of them  was that   the hon. member basically said that many employees appear to be operating in survival mode with poor law and regulations to guide them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to remind the hon. member, who has been a member of Parliament for as long as I have, that in fact these employees work under an act, an act of Parliament decided on by this Parliament.  It was amended as recently as 2002 in this House, with debate, as an act of Parliament. People in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration  do not suddenly work with nothing; they have a clear set of laws and a clear set of guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us to the fact that the member talks about the problems he has in his riding.  He is not alone.  Every single one of us knows that we have problems in our ridings  and every single one of us also knows that there have been times when members of the opposition and everyone else have brought cases to a minister of immigration, who has dealt with them, looked at the facts, realized something needed to be done and got humanitarian and compassionate grounds for those clients. This has not been done only for government or only for Liberals.  It has been done for many members across the floor. We know this, so the question is, let us deal with the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact one:  we bring in about 245,000 immigrants a year.  For 80% who come in, it is easy. They move in, they build their lives, they begin to contribute to Canadian society, and we never   talk about  them, because the ones we see are the complex cases .  To suggest that there is a silver bullet and that a minister can suddenly come in and fix things in one fell swoop is    not telling the facts as they really are and  not even understanding the  complexity of the issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with human lives.  We are dealing with people who live in countries, depending on whether they are refugees or not, and who have no papers. I recall that across this House this particular member's party has often accused us of bringing in people without due process, without digging   deep and looking for all their papers and all their backgrounds.  In many instances those papers and backgrounds are hard to come by.  That extends the process.  The process can take a long time in certain cases.   We see the difficult and complex cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that our current minister and this government are very clear that we need to make the system work better.  It is a changing and evolving situation that we live in with regard to immigration in our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would love for this hon. member and others to come forward to help us resolve this problem and not throw cheap shots across the floor at us, because it is a complex issue.  It is not a simplistic problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us deal with IRPA.  Let us look at these things.  We have worked in the House in 2004 and obviously situations have made it such that we are still having problems.  Let us work on the process.  It is not going to be fixed tomorrow, with the best of intentions.  It will take time for some of these things to change because we are dealing with fluid situations and many different countries.</p><A NAME="T1925"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1925"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1925)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1117866"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117869"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Forseth: </b>Madam Speaker,  in summary, immigration must serve the country, not the Liberal Party.  We tried to effect appropriate amendments to the bill when it came through a couple of years ago.  Also, it was framework legislation, which had a lot of regulation to attach to it.  So far, from what we can see, it is an administrative disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the last election some Liberal candidates said, “Vote for me and I will deliver the special permits”.  The previous immigration minister is reported to have  made the very same assertions in the last election.  Some Liberal candidates certainly made the point.  They tied public service administration decisions to who got elected.    I challenge the minister to ensure that this never happens again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need more study and analysis.  We need a minister who has both the personal character and the stature in cabinet to get the job done, a minister who can get the resources needed to clean up this mess, a mess which we can see is a weeping sore from coast to coast in this country.</p><A NAME="Int-1117869"></A><a HREF="#Int-1117872"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1117866"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Hedy Fry: </b>Madam Speaker, I would not respond to the innuendo and hearsay that seems to characterize all the questions we get.  Let us deal with the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, 20% of cases are complex and are not resolved in as expeditious a manner as we could. We sometimes have look at them and find out whether they require special intervention. The current Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has said very clearly, and this is our government's priority, that he has a six point plan of action to speed up the process, to change some of the processes where they do not work and to deal with them, but to do it in a manner in which we set some very clear ways to look at this.  We have an evaluation. We continue to evolve the system to meet the changing needs of the clients who come into the system. Let us work together. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has said very clearly that he has a six point plan. We want to hear what members across the hall have to say. We want to hear what Canadians have to say. Let us take the complex questions and get some complex solutions to serve them in a flexible, transparent and compassionate manner.</p>

At that time, his answer was:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small> —we are moving ahead on a strategy and we will announce the strategy once we have completed discussions and negotiations...  We are moving forward with an aerospace strategy, and we will do it in a timely manner.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still waiting for a strategy to be announced. All we have heard since was that, at least, an offer had been made by the government to find a solution to help Bombardier so that it could build its new aircraft. At least, in that respect, the Minister of Industry took action following the questions we had put.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this happened also after the Minister of Transport, who is the minister responsible for Quebec, made some sort of false statement in January, when he said that an offer had been made on January 13, even though that was not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important now is ensuring that the government will reach an agreement with Bombardier. The project must go forward, while respecting the current distribution of jobs in Canada, with approximately 55% in Quebec. We must ensure that we do not lose this project to New Mexico, for example, because the federal government acted too slowly. I hope that the necessary efforts will be made, today, to make up for lost time and ultimately produce results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, I asked a question confirming that, last fall, Bombardier had been offered a $1.5 billion loan guarantee so it could build jets for Air Canada. Four months later, the letter of credit agreement is unconfirmed, uncertified and not applicable. Bombardier itself has to assume the cost of additional credit because of this. So this is a bad example of the reality in which we are living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the government spokesperson reassure me that we are going to reach a solution quickly and that the thousands of jobs at stake are going to be saved? We have developed an aerospace industry, especially in Quebec, but elsewhere in Canada as well, which deserves our support, and which deserves assistance for research and development.  We also need an approach that complements the efforts of the Quebec government and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the employees in the Toronto area have said  they do not want to renegotiate their contract with Bombardier, is that not a compelling reason for us to have an announcement as soon as possible? Such an announcement is necessary so that  Bombardier's board can decide to construct its new aircraft and so that we can benefit from the economic spinoffs, which would be good to have.</p><A NAME="T1930"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1930"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1930)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, the Canadian aerospace industry makes a significant contribution to the overall Canadian economy, with some 700 aerospace and defence firms across the country.  It employs more than 75,000 people.  Sales in 2003 exceeded $20 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerospace is much more than just one Canadian traditional industry. It is one of Canada's leading advanced technology exporters.  The sector invested approximately $1 billion on research and development in 2003.  Aerospace is the second largest investor in R and D in Canada and the fourth in Canada's top 20 industrial R and D performers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years markets have been slow and competition is tight.  Aerospace products require substantial investments and have long development periods. These realities are placing tough demands and new pressures on the aerospace sector. The government is quite conscious of the new pressures and wishes of the aerospace industry.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Speech from the Throne we made it very clear that aerospace is a key industry and a priority for the government.  The government has committed itself to developing a national strategy to help the sector strengthen its technology leadership and position itself for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national aerospace strategy could provide the broad context within which the company could consider individual funding decisions. This broad context would include considerations such as the changing international business climate, the economic impact and fiscal implications of support, skills development, trade policy and individual investments that fit the overall direction of Canada's aerospace sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Industry is moving quickly to develop this strategy.  He is collaborating with the industry stakeholders and provincial counterparts.  An initial strategic framework will be completed within the next few weeks to provide the context for pressing decisions. This initial framework would then pave the way for developing a long term, comprehensive strategic action plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing a national aerospace strategy, we will build on impressive achievements to date and on government programs, such as sales financing from Export Development Canada and research and development support such as that available from Technology Partnerships Canada. The partnerships, which have been forged between industry and government, have produced good results for companies and Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bombardier's success with its family of regional jets is a case in point.  There are many other examples in which a risk sharing investment by the government has resulted in new aerospace business for firms in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Bombardier, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, the government also recognizes that the company is one of aerospace's top anchors.  Bombardier's aerospace division is Canada's largest aerospace firm with sales of $11 billion, more than 50% of Canada's overall space output. The company employs 13,000 workers in its facilities in Montreal, Toronto and North Bay and relies on an extensive supplier network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that Bombardier is currently considering a next generation aircraft, the CSeries, and we are doing everything we can to recognize timetables that Bombardier would require to move this project forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government recognizes how important this aerospace industry is to Quebec and to all other Canadians.  We are working very hard to develop a national aerospace strategy and will work hard to ensure the growth and prosperity continues.</p><A NAME="T1935"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1935)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This is obvious. However, last fall, the federal government, based on the minister's replies, was supposed to release a study on its policy. It is now February and the hon. member is talking about a policy paper, a background paper that is being prepared through a consultation process. I hope this document is available as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's offer is a major factor in the decision by Bombardier's board of directors. However, the more general framework under which these investments will be made for the  “C” series  aircraft  is also important. This is also true for all other investments, for small and medium size businesses in the aerospace industry, and for other sectors such as helicopter production, for example, and related industries. It is urgent that this policy be known. It is urgent that this consultation process be completed and that we get a clear message, as we did for example in the 1980s regarding the development of patent drugs, which generated an economic boom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get assurances that the government will release its study and, more importantly, that it will make an interesting offer to Bombardier, so that this issue can be settled as quickly as possible?</p>

Jerry Pickard: </b>Madam Speaker, the prospect of Bombardier CSeries has created a great deal of interest in Canada. The government recognizes the importance of this program and is developing a national aerospace strategy that will provide context  within which we can make decisions. We would like Bombardier to assemble the CSeries in Canada and are continuing to discuss areas of possible collaboration with our provincial counterparts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I am sure the member would agree on focusing only on Bombardier gives a very limited view to aerospace industry. While Bombardier is important, we have other strong, competitive companies that are key players in this aerospace sector. These companies are also embarking on new research and development projects for their companies and competition in the future. Our national aerospace strategy will reflect this strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerospace is a key industrial priority for the Government of Canada. We are developing a new national aerospace strategy to ensure continued growth and prosperity. We are interested in Bombardier and the entire aerospace industry.</p>
