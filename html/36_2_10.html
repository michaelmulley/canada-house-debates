<A NAME="LINK10">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government has failed to defend the interests of Canadian 
farmers from the unfair subsidies and unfair trading practices by 
foreign countries and its Agriculture Income Disaster Assistance 
(AIDA) program is a catastrophe since Canadian farmers are 
continuing to face record low incomes, especially in the 
provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan where the combined 
realized net income is 98% below the five-year average and, 
accordingly, the government should immediately ensure that 
emergency compensation is delivered to farmers that have not been 
served by AIDA and launch an international campaign against 
foreign subsidies, provide tax relief, lower input costs, reduce 
user fees, and address the inadequacies of the farm safety net 
programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. At 
the outset of today's debate on the Reform motion dealing with 
the agricultural crisis in Canada I would like to notify the 
House that all members of the official opposition will be 
splitting their time today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion is seconded 
by the Leader of the Opposition.  This debate should not have 
even had to occur today because at the start of this session on 
October 12, after the prorogation of parliament, the Reform Party 
had asked for an emergency debate on the issue of farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm income issue has reached a crisis proportion in the 
past year to year and a half and has been identified as such 
through committee hearings, by farmers themselves and by 
Statistics Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today sets out both short term and long term problems 
that have arisen.  Certainly one of the long term problems that 
is identified in the motion deals with the practices of our 
competitors, namely the United States and the European Union. The 
program the government designed to address the farm income crisis 
was called the agriculture income disaster assistance program.  I 
will be dealing with that a little later in my speech this 
morning.  As an aside, I believe I indicated I will be splitting 
my time with the member for Calgary Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with this income crisis Reform knew as early as 
September 1998 that the farm situation in western Canada, in 
particular, and the cash crop people in Ontario were hitting a 
financial crunch which they were no longer able to handle totally 
on their own.  As a result, the advisory committee on safety net 
programs was called to examine this issue.  Reform put forward a 
motion to the Standing Committee on Agriculture to hold hearings 
with regard to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What came out of that was a solid recommendation to the 
agriculture minister as to the seriousness of this crisis and a 
suggested solution, which was a program of domestic support based 
on individual farm income situations.  On receiving the 
recommendations from the safety net committee, which included all 
the different farm organizations across the country, the 
government took the program called AIDA and made it fit the 
amount of money on which the agriculture minister was able to get 
a commitment from cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the crisis was real, that the statistics were 
there from Statistics Canada, did not seem to matter.  It was a 
situation where the government made the program fit the budget as 
opposed to taking care of the income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that we had a situation where there was a natural 
disaster of flooding in southwest Manitoba and southeast 
Saskatchewan which certainly compounded the major problems in 
those provinces.   We will see from the Stats Canada statistics 
that compounding will make for a negative realized net income in 
Saskatchewan and a drastically lowered realized net income in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another statistic of great concern also comes from Statistics 
Canada.  Total cash receipts for farms in Canada will be flat 
right through until the year 2003.  When we look at whether or 
not the government has to do more for farmers in Canada to retain 
a viable agriculture sector, we see that the government has to do 
more in the area of domestic support than what it is doing at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program was simply a two year program designed to 
provide funding for Canadian agriculture producers to cushion an 
extreme income reduction beyond their control.  The government 
and the agriculture minister totally missed the point, missed the 
real crisis in farm income.  The real crisis is that for many 
years now through the 1990s net farm incomes have been dropping 
due to the fact that commodity prices have been extremely low. 
This is mostly affecting commodities that are exported to other 
countries around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that input costs are rising dramatically.  The cost 
of a pickup, for instance, which most farmers require, is between 
$30,000 and $41,000 for a decent half tonne.  How can farmers 
continue to survive on commodity prices that are only designed to 
buy a $10,000 pickup?  That is just one little example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at what the people who administer the AIDA program 
are saying in the media.  The managing director said that despite 
all of the negative talk about the program not working cheques 
are flowing to producers.  He said that he thinks the message is 
out there and that payments are going to the rural communities. 
Part of the problem is in getting our urban cousins, city 
dwellers, to understand and support agriculture.  In essence, 
they are doing a spin doctor routine by telling Canadians that 
money is flowing, cash is flowing and that farmers are all right, 
when in reality there are tens of thousands of farmers who are 
not receiving any money.  A relatively small amount of farmers 
are receiving money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of this crisis are being reflected in the 
communities, in families and at the social level.  In Manitoba 
even the United Church has seen fit to try to do something for 
farmers by way of financial assistance and by bringing this 
crisis to the forefront.  That has not happened since the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government got us into this mess and it has failed 
in its efforts to fix it.  That is why we had to force this 
debate today.  The Reform Party has put forward many solutions 
for the government to consider because it has failed to bring 
forward a suitable long term program to fight this income crisis 
and it is now in the position of having to come up with some 
immediate domestic support to get cash into farmers' hands before 
the end of October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister promised in December 1998 that he would 
have cash in the hands of farmers by spring.  That did not happen 
and that is a condemnation of this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to compliment the member for Selkirk—Interlake 
for his presentation on the ongoing crisis in our agricultural 
sector and I urge him to persevere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time in five months that the official 
opposition has tried to raise both the consciousness of the House 
and, more importantly, the consciousness of the government with 
respect to the seriousness of the income crisis facing our 
farmers, a crisis further compounded by flooding earlier this 
spring in certain parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are frankly at our wit's end as to what more can be done to 
get the Prime Minister to personally address this issue and to 
get the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to acknowledge the 
inadequacy of his efforts thus far, but for the sake of our 
constituents and Canadian farmers everywhere we will try again 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we will lay before the House the mounting evidence 
that Canadian farmers continue to face record low incomes due to 
factors beyond their control.  We have already done so once 
before in this session during our replies to the Speech from the 
Throne, a speech in which the government completely failed to 
even acknowledge the problem.  If only one fact could be cited, 
which should be sufficient evidence in itself to prompt the 
government to greater action, it is the fact cited in the motion 
that combined realized net income for farmers in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan is down 98% from the previous five year average.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In human terms this means a lot more than the loss of income. 
It means tears and heartache.  It means the churning of stomachs, 
worry and despair for thousands of farm families.  It means a 
loss of the ability of those families to provide for themselves 
and their children.  It means the loss of hope, which is the 
worst loss on the farm, a loss of confidence in the future and a 
desperate feeling of people not knowing where to turn.  For some 
it has already meant the loss of the farm itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we appeal to the government.  If the government will 
not be moved by the statistics and the hard facts concerning the 
disastrous drop in farm income, surely it must be moved, and 
moved to do something more, by the human tragedy that surrounds 
those facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the government appears to be that it has done 
all that it can or can be expected to do.  This position we 
categorically reject.  We urge the House to reject it by 
supporting this motion.  Instead of pursuing its current policy, 
we therefore urge the government to do the following six things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we ask that it acknowledge that its ill-conceived, ad hoc 
AIDA program is a failure.  It should be reformed or replaced so 
that it actually delivers payments to farmers in combination with 
provincial contributions in the order of the $25 to $50 per acre 
promised in the press releases and the public statements of the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we ask that it present to the House an immediate plan to 
provide tax relief to Canadians, including agricultural producers 
and farm families.  This plan should include reductions in taxes 
on agricultural inputs such as fuel and fertilizer and it should 
include reductions in user fees such as those collected through 
the Canadian Grain Commission and the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in order to find the money to meet the cost of providing 
any additional emergency assistance, the government should make a 
formal and urgent request to the Standing Committee on Finance to 
do precisely that, to find the money; not by increasing total 
taxes or borrowing or returning to deficit financing, but by 
readjusting the government's current spending priorities.  This 
is precisely what any family or business facing an emergency 
situation would have to do.  It would have to take funds from 
other areas to address the emergency requirements.  This is what 
the government and this parliament should be learning to do, 
whether it is to cope with the spending requirements of an 
agricultural emergency or to cope with the government's $5 
billion pay equity bungle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, in order to address the longer term dimensions of the 
problem and to ensure that there is a long term future for 
agricultural producers, the government should present a plan to 
the House to redress the inadequacies of its current farm safety 
net programs, in particular crop insurance and the net income 
stabilization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the NDP we do not advocate a return to the protectionist 
or dependency creating subsidies of the past.  Such measures 
would not survive challenges under either the NAFTA or the WTO 
and proposing them only raises false hopes that will be dashed 
later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do advocate is reforming crop insurance to include 
disaster insurance so that programs like AIDA do not have to be 
invented on an ad hoc basis after the fact every time there is a 
major climatic disaster like a flood or a drought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We advocate an expanded NISA-type program that will really do 
the job, a single trade distortion adjustment program, a single 
agricultural income insurance program that compensates 
agricultural producers for income injury suffered as a result of 
somebody else's subsidies in violation of the spirit and letter 
of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea was first raised in this House by Elwin Hermanson, our 
former agricultural critic and now the leader of the official 
opposition in Saskatchewan.  He is a respected agricultural 
leader who has just received an overwhelming mandate to represent 
the farming and rural communities of that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we demand the immediate formation of an emergency team 
Canada mission to Europe and Washington, led by the Prime 
Minister but including the Minister for International Trade, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and other provincial officials.  Their mission would be 
to make the case as it has never been made before that European 
and American subsidies, contrary to both the spirit and the 
letter of free international trade in agricultural products, are 
killing our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one further proposal for the agricultural minister which 
we insist he convey to the Prime Minister and that is that the 
Prime Minister himself participate in this debate. 
The Prime Minister has consistently absented himself from every 
major discussion of this issue in the House since he became Prime 
Minister six years ago.  This is inexcusable in a country where 
agriculture is one of the major primary industries and where 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians are dependent on agriculture 
for their livelihood.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that the Prime Minister does not know the 
difference between wheat and toadflax, but surely the agriculture 
minister could brief him before he came down, because the Prime 
Minister's continued indifference to this issue is an insult to 
farmers everywhere in this country, particularly in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister really cares about this issue, why does he 
not come down here and say so, and present to the House not the 
usual fluff and chaff, but a plan incorporating the emergency 
measures and agricultural reforms which this motion urges upon 
the government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in a major speech of October 13 the member for Calgary 
Southwest berated the government for not having a good policy or 
an aggressive policy with respect to tax cuts and debt reduction. 
While I have great sympathy for helping not only western farmers 
but farmers in my riding, particularly the pig farmers who have 
recently suffered considerably from low prices, he now proposes 
and is advocating increased spending for crop and disaster relief 
for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the context of his remarks about debt reduction and tax 
cuts, can he put a figure on what he thinks the government should 
be spending on farmers who are in difficulty?  Is it $1 billion? 
Is it $2 billion?  Is it $3 billion?  Is it $4 billion?  Can he 
be specific in terms of the money that he would spend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
paying attention to my speeches, but if he had paid a little 
closer attention he would have had the answer to what he is 
driving at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should wait until we see the further updated 
presentations from Saskatchewan and Manitoba later this week with 
respect to the figure.  Whether the figure is $1 billion or $1.5 
billion, this is what we should do to meet that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should try to meet it within the existing government 
spending envelope.  We are simply going to have to learn to do 
that.  If there is an emergency let us readjust our spending and 
tell the Standing Committee on Finance to do that.  We have some 
ideas as to where to get that money.  We would be interested to 
see if anybody else in the House does as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I said in my reply to the throne speech that one of the 
answers was to cut taxes.  That is still part of our solution. 
Why not cut taxes, including taxes on agricultural inputs?  That 
can be done without increasing the deficit or the spending 
requirements of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing which answers the member's question is, if the 
House had listened to Hermanson when he was here, as early as 
1995 he proposed the reform of the NISA and the setting up of a 
single trade distortion adjustment mechanism.  If that had been 
done the amount of money in the NISA accounts today to deal with 
emergencies would be significantly higher than they are.  We 
would be in a much better situation to address this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is to listen when reforms are proposed by the 
official opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very intently to the member's speech.  As someone who 
has farmed for about eight years, I can understand some of the 
concerns and issues that are going through our farm community 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that the finance department and the finance 
committee should find the money.  If I recall, it was his party 
that proposed something like a $600 million reduction in spending 
for the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food in one of its 
budget proposals.  We left that money in that envelope for 
financing, yet the member's party would have withdrawn it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he talked about taking the NISA program and expanding it 
so that we protect farmers from all kinds of trade distortions 
that are occurring all over the world.  I agree with him.  It is 
a big problem that our farm community is facing today.  I know 
that the member also believes in equality.  I hear him saying it 
time and time again.  Is he also going to protect every other 
business interest in this country from trade distortions all over 
the world using government programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are two responses 
to that question.  First, the point about Reform advocating a 
reduction in agricultural spending several years ago is correct. 
However, we also proposed these other measures, which more than 
compensated for that from the farmers' standpoint and which would 
protect distortion adjustment mechanisms.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the member does have this great background in 
agriculture, which I am sure he does, he will understand that 
there is more protectionism today in the agricultural sector than 
there is in many of the other sectors that are subject to free 
trade.  That has been the case ever since free trade has been 
talked about.  It has been the big problem in Europe.  The big 
problem is getting subsidies down in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the trade distortion adjustment program is particularly 
relevant is in the agricultural sector.  That is why we advocate 
it.  There are other measures in both the WTO and NAFTA to deal 
with other trade distortions.  In agriculture, those measures are 
inadequate as is demonstrated by the situation our farmers are in 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
make a few comments on the issue that is before the House and the 
motion that is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the financial difficulty facing many 
Canadian farmers this year is of great concern to all of us:  to 
myself, to the members of the government, to the agriculture and 
food community and indeed, to all Canadians.  I know very well 
how difficult the times are for a number of Canadian farmers 
every year, but in particular, this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I do not want to lose sight of the larger 
picture, not diminishing the problems, as I say, that a number of 
producers have.  I want to remind all hon. members that the 
fundamentals of the agriculture and food sector remain on the 
whole very positive.  On a national basis, farm income is only 
slightly below the five year average.  I remind the House that is 
on a national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the safety net programs that we have in place, the 
cattle industry is prospering, supply management sectors are 
sound and, in spite of price instability, our hog sector 
continues to claim an ever increasing share of North American 
production, laying the groundwork for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, investments in the agriculture sector are up and 
food exports are increasing, in particular those of processed 
food products so that we get the value added and the jobs here in 
Canada.  That is certainly an important area of growth for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, some commodities in some regions are in 
trouble.  These farmers are dealing with an extended period of 
low commodity prices but not extended to the extent that some of 
the members opposite are trying to make us listen to.  We know 
that the prices of commodities in 1996-97 were some of the 
highest prices that we have had in the industry for a number of 
decades. The situation, however, has been aggravated by turmoil 
in the financial markets around the world, prolonged by the 
increasing use of subsidies in the United States and the European 
Union and made worse this spring in some areas by excessive 
moisture or, in other areas, by drought in certain parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that farmers have not been left to face these 
challenges alone.  We have been working with them and the 
provincial governments to develop both short term and long term 
solutions.  I remind everyone that agriculture is a joint 
responsibility of both the provincial and the federal governments 
as so declared in our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by making some comments on the short term 
solutions.  Agriculture income disaster assistance, or AIDA, is 
putting $1.5 billion into the hands of Canadian farmers in need 
over a two year period.  So far 16,000 farmers across the country 
have received money from AIDA.  Over $220 million has been 
distributed.  It is averaging just a little less than $15,000 per 
producer.  Applications are continuing to be processed and 
cheques are being mailed out even as we speak today.  Over half 
of these cheques have gone to farmers in the hardest hit 
provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers continue to receive support from other safety net 
programs as well.  This spring changes were made to the crop 
insurance program to put money into the hands of farmers in 
southwestern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan when 
excessive moisture prevented them from seeding.  In addition, we 
worked with the province of Saskatchewan to give those producers 
access to up to $50 per acre for unseeded crop land this year and 
in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of changes were also introduced to NISA, the result of 
which was more money for more farmers and faster.  Twenty-four 
thousand farmers have already taken advantage of these changes. 
As a result, they have been able to get more than $260 million 
out of their net income stabilization account. 
That is what the program is there for.  It is a contribution from 
the federal and provincial governments and individual producers. 
The account will be available for producers to draw on in the 
down years when it is needed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone that another 80,000 farmers have triggered the 
opportunity to take money from their NISA accounts.  There is 
another $900 million in those accounts which they can withdraw 
right now if they need to.  These programs and the adjustments we 
have made to them are closing the gap between farmers' current 
incomes and their five year averages. Our safety net system is 
helping farmers to stabilize their incomes in the middle range 
between the higher and lower income years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that our farm income protection system is 
perfect.  There will never be a system that is all things to all 
people under every condition, every day of the year and every 
year.  What I am saying is that we do have a solid foundation in 
place and, together with all the players, we are working very 
hard to build on that foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already made changes to AIDA to keep money flowing to 
producers between now and the end of the tax year.  Further 
changes are also being considered, including coverage of some of 
the negative margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to meet with colleagues in cabinet, in caucus, in the 
provinces and with farmers themselves.  I can assure the hon. 
members that the government is looking at a variety of options to 
give more resources and support to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the short term measures I have talked about, I am 
also working on long term solutions.  Together with our partners 
we are rebuilding, renewing and revitalizing our farm income 
protection system.  The system must encourage farmers to make 
production decisions based on market conditions.  It must be 
national in scope and available to farmers across the country 
regardless of region or commodity produced.  It must respect 
Canada's obligations under the international trade agreements.  A 
safety net structure that invites countervail or other trade 
problems will only do harm not good.  It must not encourage 
overproduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers are committed to responsible stewardship of 
their land and water.  The challenge is to fashion these guiding 
principles into a framework that is acceptable to 10 provincial 
governments while maintaining a cost sharing arrangement of 60% 
federal money and 40% provincial money.  I do not think I have to 
explain how difficult a task that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial premiers and their agriculture ministers recognize 
how critical this matter is to the Canadian primary producers.  I 
will continue to count on their goodwill and diligence to develop 
a solution that is in the best interest of farmers across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to work and meet frequently with the national safety 
nets advisory committee.  Safety nets are only one part of the 
solution.  Stronger international trade rules are another part. 
Canada cannot afford to match the huge injections of cash to 
farmers that take place in the United States and the European 
Union.  The reality is that our pockets are just not that deep. 
In the final analysis it is probably not even smart to try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher subsidies only serve to drive commodity prices down 
further, encouraging overproduction and hurting farmers not only 
in Canada but everywhere in the world.  I have made that point 
forcefully to my counterparts in the European Union, to my 
counterpart Secretary Dan Glickman in the United States, at the 
Cairns group meeting in August and at the Quint meeting in 
September.  I will continue to make that point because that is 
where the discussions take place, at the WTO and those types of 
forums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plan to continue working to shore up support at the WTO 
negotiating table.  Meanwhile, the government is working in other 
ways as well to provide support to the industry and the tools 
farmers need to adapt, diversify and compete in a rapidly 
changing global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, we reaffirmed our commitment to 
research and trade development, two major building blocks of the 
future, particularly in the agriculture and agri-food sector.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also in the process of reforming the western grain 
handling and transportation system to ensure that farmers have a 
competitive, efficient system to get their goods to port and from 
there to markets around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely committed to working with farmers and provincial 
governments to build a highly competitive, increasingly diverse 
agriculture and food sector in the country.  We are doing that 
through the short term and long term measures which I have 
outlined today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the constructive comments from members in the 
industry and members of the House.  As much as we would like to 
have an ideal situation, there are always limited resources.  Our 
challenge is to target those limited resources as fairly as we 
can to those who need the support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the agriculture minister began his remarks by saying 
that the situation is not too bad.  I would remind him that was 
the theme of R.B. Bennett's speeches in the House a long time 
ago.  He might reflect on what happened to R.B. Bennett. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get real in this discussion.  We appreciate the 
minister's presence here.  Could he give straight answers to the 
following questions?  We made six proposals for fixing the 
situation.  Could he tell us whether he supports:  replacing or 
reforming AIDA; providing tax relief now; asking finance to 
readjust the budget priorities; reforming crop insurance to 
include disaster insurance; expanding NISA for the long term; 
and, leading an emergency trade mission to Europe and the United 
States and getting the Prime Minister engaged? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the agriculture minister support those specific proposals 
for dealing with the situation, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have already been 
flexible and have made changes to AIDA.  We are not finished yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point was tax relief.  The government has given $16.5 
billion in tax relief in the last two budgets.  Farmers have 
benefited from that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear in the budget.  Before last year's budget 
there was a $900 million contribution made by the government 
toward the situation and along with the provincial government's 
contribution that comes to $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding NISA, we made changes to NISA this summer that lowered 
the triggers.  We made another $121 million available to 
producers and, if everyone had listened, I said in my speech that 
we were looking at that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding trade, I outlined the only approach that can be made. 
When we talk about trade, it is not just between two countries. 
It is in the form of WTO and we have a strong approach to that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister of agriculture shows a fairly rosy picture but I do 
know that he recognizes it is not quite that rosy in western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about the 14,000 to 15,000 people who have been 
approved for AIDA.  For each one that has been approved there is 
one who has been declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister of agriculture would please tell the 
House if those people who have been declined are simply on their 
own and should not expect any further assistance from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, there are extraordinary circumstances with respect to 
some areas that have been dealt another blow of natural disaster. 
The AIDA program is not sufficient for those particularly 
extraordinary circumstances.  Will the minister tell the House if 
there are going to be additional programs for natural disasters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the applications that 
have come in have not all triggered a payment.  I would put to 
the hon. member that there is never a situation when 100 per cent 
of the applications for anything, whether it be this type of 
program or any type of program, have been accepted. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have put criteria in place so that all farmers no matter where 
they live in Canada receive assistance, if they trigger those 
criteria. As I said, unfortunately the program cannot be all 
things to all people at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have a role to play as well. Recently one of the 
provinces came forward with more support for its producers. 
Other provinces can do so if they wish and we would welcome those 
discussions with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Mr. Speaker, I would like you to ask the House for 
unanimous consent to have the minister stay just a few minutes 
longer so there can be more than the 10 minutes of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake has asked for the unanimous consent of the 
House to extend the time provided for questions and comments of 
the minister of agriculture by five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, quite 
frankly it is not surprising that the Liberals would not want to 
keep the minister here. Obviously he does not have the answer to 
the agricultural problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what responsible government would abandon its 
farmers by cutting subsidies by unnecessarily high amounts before 
ensuring that they would be on a level playing field with other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the Liberals took 
over as the government, this country took in $120 billion a year 
and spent $162 billion a year.  If we were going to sustain any 
kind of support whether it be in the agriculture industry or any 
other sector, we could no longer continue on a course of 
bankruptcy as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made some tough decisions.  Support programs were removed. 
The hon. member wants to forget that there was $1.6 billion in 
capital money which was put in as a replacement of some programs 
in western Canada.  Adjustment programs of hundreds of millions 
of dollars were put in to assist the industry to adjust.  There 
is $600 million a year contribution by the federal government in 
the safety nets. In the last two years there has been another 
$900 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would all like to have more. Our challenge is to do as much 
as we can with the resources that are available. We will continue 
to look at that and try to find other appropriate ways to assist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to the 
next speaker I want to clarify a couple of items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have done in the past, during the time provided for 
questions and comments if there seems to be a number of members 
who wish to ask a question, I will identify at least three 
initially if there is a five minute period so people will know 
whether or not they are going to be called. If that is the case, 
then it is obvious that questions and comments will have to be 
kept at around 60 seconds.  We have done it that way for the last 
year or so.  We will continue to do it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to clarify that in this first round it was one 30 
minute slot to the official opposition, it being a supply day 
motion, and then 10 minutes with a five minute question and 
comment for each of the recognized parties.  I was in error in 
saying that the hon. member was splitting his time.  It was 10 
minutes to start with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, three things 
are clear from this motion: the failure of the government's 
agriculture income disaster assistance program; the need to set 
up an emergency program immediately to come to the aid of 
farmers, and the matter of the unfair subsidies paid by foreign 
countries to their farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our remarks will focus on these three points.  The first is the 
government's failure with its AIDA program.  The government has 
no compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal income security program is a fiasco that ignores the 
reality faced by the farmers. 
The present situation in agriculture is proof that the AIDA 
program does not work and cannot guarantee farmers a decent 
standard of living.  The government cannot simply wash its 
hands.  It is responsible for the situation and is contributing 
to maintaining this farm income crisis situation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem, but not the only one, arises from the fact the 
AIDA program, as designed today, is denying the benefits to a 
number of producers that it was originally intended to provide. 
As it is currently designed, AIDA program will not distribute 
the $900 million in federal government funds set aside for 
farmers in the coming years.  It will not enable the government 
to keep its promises of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA therefore does not meet the needs of farmers.  The problems 
posed by AIDA are many and prove that the federal government 
really does not know farmers.  In its design, AIDA does not take 
account of the situation farmers are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are agriculture producers with a negative cost-price ratio 
being penalized?  Why does the program set a ceiling on what a 
farmer can receive, and the method by which the ceiling is 
calculated means that the ceiling is lowered when the farmer is 
experiencing a crisis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister not made a commitment to producers to spend 
all of the announced $900 million?  Why has the minister not 
made an exception in his assistance program to include the sheep 
producers who experienced heavy losses in the 1997 scrapie 
crisis and were ineligible for the $600 per capita compensation? 
Why has he not made that effort, given that it would have cost 
only about $1.5 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flaws in the program are the fault of the government and 
will contribute to keeping farmers in a precarious situation. 
The rule on negative margins will seriously affect farmers who 
are in such situations this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the sharp drop in commodity prices this past year, 
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates that there will 
be 10,000 farms with negative margins.  Is the federal 
government prepared to change its principles and to give 
consideration to these otherwise viable operations deserving of 
assistance?  Is the government prepared to accept responsibility 
for the eventual disappearance of farm businesses because of the 
flaws in AIDA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation notwithstanding, the federal government is doing 
nothing, thus giving proof of its lack of compassion.  Why has 
it not followed the recommendations of its advisory committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec a revenue stabilization program has been in place for 
some twenty years.  It is a three-way program, with the federal 
government contributing one-third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is currently satisfied with the AIDA 
arrangement, because the province continues to manage its own 
program and the moneys received were used to lower participants' 
contributions. The same goes for those who do not have access to 
the stabilization program, but who benefit from NISA because, 
again, they are subsidized by the province and the program is 
managed by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the need to take action to save farmers. 
Farmers are going through the worst crisis since the thirties. 
In Quebec, low prices for pork, down 34% from last year, have 
had a direct impact on farmers' income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this situation, the government must continue to help 
the agricultural sector, particularly since it has the means to 
do so, while also complying with international agreements. 
However, if this government finally decides to act, the measures 
will have to be comprehensive because the agricultural issue 
concerns the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, the net farm income went from $4 
billion in 1989 down to $2 billion in 1998. In Quebec, the net 
farm income dropped by $10 million over that same nine year 
period. Based on estimates, Quebec's total net farm income will 
be $526 million, that is a 26% drop over the average income for 
the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is subsidies made to the agricultural sector in 
foreign countries. Ottawa is more virtuous than necessary. 
According to Bob Friesen of the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, Ottawa went too far in that “Canada reduced 
subsidies beyond what was expected of it. Ottawa could do a lot 
more for farmers without violating trade agreements”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each dollar received by Canadian farmers, their American and 
European competitors receive $2.5 dollars, and this does not 
include the $8.6 billion that they just received in assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the OECD estimated that total support through 
agricultural policies amounted to $140 U.S. per capita in 
Canada, compared to $363 in the United States and $381 in 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the argument invoked by the Minister of 
Agriculture about the constraints imposed by the WTO is not 
valid. 
Let us not forget that, under the 1995 GATT agreement, the 
signatories pledged to reduce their farm subsidies by 15%.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has rightly noted that the federal government has 
constantly been saying it had to cut subsidies to farmers due to 
the trade agreements that are in place.  The minister's answer 
this morning and the fact that the government has cut subsidies 
up to 60% when it only had to cut to 20% indicate it has really 
been using one excuse or the other, whatever suits that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that the government has abandoned 
farmers in an effort to meet a budget line and that it has been 
using the excuse of the trade agreements? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree completely, because the 
government still had some leeway, particularly in a time of 
crisis.  If the agricultural sector were in its prime, then 
would be the time to go all virtuous, and take the hard line 
adopted in Cairns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But with the sector now in crisis throughout the country, I 
think the government could have taken the maximum leeway allowed 
under the WTO rules.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the Bloc members have looked at the realized 
net income for Quebec.  They would then understand that the 
situation there is not nearly as serious as it is in other parts 
of the country.  The realized net income there has not dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is twofold.  First, does the 
hon. member recognize that AIDA does not address the real problem 
in the farm income crisis?  The real problem is the long number 
of years where the income has been so low that when AIDA pays out 
it pays out only a very small amount, a few thousand dollars that 
does nothing to help the crisis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to answer the 
member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec producers' net income from farming has indeed dropped 
less than that of producers in western Canada.  There are 
several reasons for this, one being that our income support 
program has been stable for 25 years.  Instead of fluctuating 
with the federal subsidy, Quebec takes what the federal 
government offers under the tripartite agreement and maintains 
the stability of our program.  This is a big help.  Quebec 
therefore plays a greater role than the other provinces in 
supporting its farmers.  When there is a crisis, we pay our 
farmers and then we collect from Ottawa, which the other 
provinces do not do.  They do the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If AIDA is not meeting farmers' needs, I think everyone who 
spoke this morning has shown why. 
Just applying is a nightmare requiring farmers to pay an 
accountant $1,000 to fill out the forms.  Right from the word 
go, there is a problem 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to lead off on this important topic today on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record will show that our caucus as been in the forefront of 
this issue.  We have discharged our obligation as an opposition 
party by bringing the crisis in agriculture to the floor of the 
House of Commons on numerous occasions.  We also brought it to 
the standing committee on agriculture and to meetings with farm 
organizations, particularly on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus does not have any difficulty or major disagreement 
with the resolution before us today.  Our disagreement is with 
the party that has moved this motion because we believe strongly 
that the crisis in agriculture, especially on the prairies, has 
been accelerated by the rise of the Reform Party in western 
Canada and the eager acceptance by the government opposite of 
some of its half-baked ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members may not like it, but consider their farm policy 
resolution back in Saskatoon in 1991.  They stated that their 
party's policy was not guided by the interests of producers but 
by the “demand of consumers for secure supplies of food at the 
lowest competitive prices”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was nothing short of a declaration of war on the family 
farm.  Shilling for this cheap food policy led to predictions at 
the time that up to one half of the farmers in western Canada 
could be wiped out.  Well, guess what?  According to an Angus 
Reid poll a couple of months ago 46% of western farmers are 
seriously thinking about packing it in if their current 
demoralizing financial situation continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mass exodus of farmers should be music to the ears of Reform 
members.  After all, it was their leader who said in Truro, Nova 
Scotia, in 1992 “The brute truth is that the prairie provinces 
cannot support the number of farmers they have been supporting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brute truth was corroborated in 1995 by Reform's lead 
agricultural critic, the member for Kindersley—Lloydminster. 
The official opposition leader said a few minutes ago that we 
should listen to Hermanson.  Let me quote Mr. Hermanson who said 
in March 1995: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not complaining about the cuts in support to agriculture.  I 
will say it again, so that it is clear to the House.  I am not 
complaining about the cuts in support to agriculture.  Probably 
Reform would have done some of the cutting differently, and I 
think better. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By “better” the former member undoubtedly meant deeper.  When 
the Liberal government heard the Reform Party's agricultural 
proposal to shift from government supported to an industry shaped 
by market forces it put on its happy face and moved as quickly as 
possible to accommodate those recommendations.  It did so by 
taking a meat axe to government programs relating to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of the matter are that all signatories to the 1993 
GATT Uruguay round agreed to lower domestic support payments by 
20% over five years.  The government thought it had a better 
idea: why not eliminate it by 60%.  Why not accommodate Reform 
and cut much deeper?  It was a win-win situation for the 
government and accordingly it hacked and slashed support payments 
with a vengeance.  Instead of simply agreeing to abide by the 20% 
GATT rule in reducing domestic support payments the government, 
as I mentioned, has happily reduced it by 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact of these cuts?  Today, on every dollar of 
wheat sold the Canadian farmer receives a grand total of nine 
cents in subsidies.  We must contrast that with the 38 cents 
received by the American wheat grower or the 56 cents in 
subsidies awarded to the European grower.  It is an 
unconscionable disparity that explains why our farmers are at a 
huge disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address some remarks to the minister of agriculture. 
The minister told delegates to the united grain growers 
convention 11 months ago that he was fully aware that as bad as 
1998 had been on the prairies in Manitoba and Saskatchewan the 
outlook for 1999 was even worse.  More important, he pledged to 
do something about it and that something became known as AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA does not seem to be working very well in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan.  It seems to be working not too badly in British 
Columbia or Alberta.  There are statistics on that.  It certainly 
seems to be working reasonably well in southwestern Ontario where 
we hear that cheques are in the magnitude of $65,000 or $70,000. 
In Manitoba, and it is important to note that less than half the 
producers are even qualifying for anything, the average cheque is 
about $14,000.  In Saskatchewan it is even less, as the member is 
noting.  It is $11,128.00. Again more than half the farmers that 
are applying under AIDA are not receiving anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it could be agreed that it takes a particular form of 
genius to predict accurately the provinces most at risk for an 
upcoming year and then design an assistance program which 
actually extends more help to the farmers in neighbouring 
provinces than the farmers that actually need it.  It is like 
calling for emergency highway assistance after seeing a two 
vehicle accident.  Police and ambulance arrive to provide 
assistance to the people who saw the crash while the victims of 
the crash remain trapped inside with no one paying them any 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are in the middle of the world series it is worth 
saying that prairie farmers are paraphrasing what Babe Ruth said 
about another program, that AIDA is not worth a cup of warm spit 
on the prairies.  That is exactly what farmers wanted to tell the 
agriculture minister to his face last July in Prince Albert. 
They wanted him to step out of the shadow of the Marlborough 
Hotel on July 6 and speak so that everyone could hear him, so 
that there could be a genuine dialogue between farmers and their 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amazed on that occasion that the minister failed to 
recognize that farmers see the minister of agriculture as their 
minister.  They wanted to talk to their minister and tell him 
their frustrations about the complicated AIDA forms, the 
exclusion of negative margins, the inclusion of NISA and off farm 
income, the low commodity prices and high input costs.  In short, 
these farmers wanted to tell their minister about the state of 
agriculture as they live it on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of understanding their desire to be heard and to engage 
in any kind of meaningful dialogue with their minister, the 
minister of agriculture came across that afternoon as petulant 
and uncaring to the several hundred farmers in attendance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers were not interested that day in the minister's six 
second sound bite.  They wanted to talk to him directly.  They 
wanted to tell him in their words what was wrong with AIDA from 
their point of view and what was needed to correct it.  They 
wanted desperately to tell him that they need an effective, long 
term, viable safety net program to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support that on this side of the House as well.  Farmers know 
that for them to be competitive Canada must provide them with 
levels of domestic support comparable to those provided by our 
trading competitors.  The minister denied prairie farmers that 
opportunity on that occasion and in their disappointment and 
frustration some of them reacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of how poorly AIDA is working on the prairies some 
people say scrap it, get rid of it.  Our caucus does not agree 
with scrapping the AIDA program.  We say again that it seems to 
be working elsewhere.  Therefore it can be made to work in 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However for AIDA to work on the prairies the reference period 
must be extended to five years or more.  The three year reference 
period is simply too short.  A longer period would provide a much 
more accurate picture as to what is actually happening to net 
farm income, especially for grains and oilseed producers.  In 
addition to a long reference period, negative margins must be 
factored in to the AIDA calculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, two days ago the Minister of National Defence in 
Ottawa, in speaking to an audience of current and former 
peacekeepers, said that the failure to act in the face of misery 
and hurt when one has the means to correct it is wrong.  I pass 
that message on to the minister of agriculture and indeed the 
entire government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows there is unprecedented hurt and stress in 
rural Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  That stress extends beyond the 
farmgate.  It includes grocery and hardware stores, gasoline and 
implement dealers.  Without immediate action the hurt will become 
unsustainable and unprecedented numbers of farmers and others 
will simply walk away, devastating our rural way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These injustices must be corrected immediately.  On behalf of 
the caucus I urge the government, through the minister of 
agriculture, to make the changes to AIDA that are so desperately 
needed.  With the changes outlined here prairie farmers can 
continue to do what they do as well as anyone in the world, and 
their sons and daughters can follow in their footsteps with some 
assurance that with hard work and a bit of luck they too can 
expect a reasonable living standard.  That is what our farm 
families are seeking and I implore the government to act now 
before it is too late.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, much of what my hon. colleague from Palliser has said 
and has said very well is true but I do want to correct his 
opening remarks.  Coming from the same province as I do, there 
are three basic questions I want to put to him just for the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, could he comment on the fact that the NDP government in 
Saskatchewan took a real beating at the rural polls in the 
September election?   Second, what government was it in 
Saskatchewan that stole some $450 million from the farmers GRIP 
program?  Third, would he like to explain why the property tax on 
farmland has increased some 300% in NDP Saskatchewan? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, there was a modest 
downturn of rural support in Saskatchewan last September.  No 
provinces have GRIP any longer.  It simply was far too expensive 
a program not just for Saskatchewan but for a number of other 
provinces as well.  Taxes on farms need to be addressed by all 
three levels: provincial, federal and municipal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently when the minister of agriculture spoke.  He said that 
not all programs were perfect and that some people from time to 
time may fall through the cracks.  We also recognize, according 
to Statistics Canada, that net farm income dropped in 1996-97 by 
55% and is projected to drop by another 35% in 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would my hon. colleague expect the minister of agriculture 
to say to farmers from the Annapolis Valley who for the past 
three years have experienced drought conditions and cannot 
qualify under the AIDA program or any other program, or to those 
farmers who in the last few years came into the farming business 
and are unable to benefit from this program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was beyond their control.  It was something that 
happened to them. It was not something they mismanaged.  It was 
just something that happened.  What would my hon. colleague 
expect the minister of agriculture to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of the member for West Nova.  Part of the problem he is 
addressing about the Annapolis Valley would be resolved if there 
were an extension on the three year period for AIDA to which I 
referred in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have gone through a tough patch and had no crop.  Under 
AIDA they cannot put down a negative margin.  They can only put 
down a zero.  If they have lost $20,000 or $30,000 in a crop year 
they cannot include it at the moment under the AIDA application. 
Extending that out to five or seven years would give a better 
picture and get a truer value of the extent of the loss farmers 
and producers are suffering. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to one or two 
observations made by the hon. member for Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks a few minutes ago he indicated, and one could 
perhaps infer it from what he said, that very little AIDA money 
is flowing into his home province of Saskatchewan.  In the 
interest of accuracy we should share with the member the latest 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of October 20, five days ago, a total of $72,149,506 has been 
paid out to farmers in the member's province of Saskatchewan. 
That is from a total number of claims paid of 6,865.  With 
Saskatchewan having so many cereal grain farmers and cereal grain 
farmers being so impacted by low commodity prices it is 
understandable that the largest amount of money would be going 
into the member's home province.  Almost half of the AIDA money 
paid out has gone to Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to share that information with the member as I am quite 
sure he would want farmers to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, $72 million is a 
significant amount of money, but I would respond to the member 
for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia by reminding him that the 
Government of Saskatchewan has put $140 million in and of itself 
into the AIDA program.  The member is telling us that $72 million 
of the AIDA program was paid back, not a terribly significant or 
compelling number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not tell us from the data he has how many people 
in Saskatchewan do not qualify for AIDA. 
As I said in my speech, from the figures I have seen, less than 
half of the producers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba are qualifying 
for any kind of payment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to stand and speak to this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the assessment made by my colleague from the NDP on 
the motion put forward by the Reform Party.  We also do not 
disagree with the issues put forward in the Reform motion. 
However, I suspect it must be difficult for the Reform members to 
keep turning those 180 degree turns all the time and making 
changes to positions that they had taken previously and putting 
forward resolutions such as we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that if the Reformers really felt that it 
was an issue of great importance, then perhaps it could have been 
a votable motion as opposed to simply a non-votable supply day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are obviously some issues that the Reform Party, needless 
to say, has not been terribly forthcoming with respect to its 
position on assistance to agriculture.  As a matter of fact a 
number of Reform members have indicated quite emphatically that 
tax relief and reduced subsidies are the only ways we should be 
going in industry.  I could quote a number of members who suggest 
that the Reform Party does not really believe in support and 
spending through ad hoc programs to the agriculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a debate with me on national TV, the member who put forward 
the motion suggested quite clearly that hog farmers should take a 
lesson from cattle producers and stop whining.  That does not 
speak very well to the belief that agriculture is in desperate 
turmoil and needs some assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to talk about a couple of issues, the first one being 
AIDA.  The member from Charleswood has indicated that the 
provincial governments are doing a wonderful job but that the 
federal government is not doing its job.  The federal government 
takes credit for $1.5 billion which has been allocated to the 
AIDA program and farm relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like you to advise me.  I think the member put my 
name to certain quotes pertaining to this issue.  If so, could 
the hon. member tell me exactly what they were? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That would be a 
question of debate.  Provided that another member is not in some 
way casting unparliamentary aspersion on another member, it is 
not the role of the Chair to get involved in such questions.  The 
hon. member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would 
like, it happened on November 30.  I have the transcript from CBC 
television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Winnipeg, who suggested that a wonderful job has 
been done by the federal government with respect to dollars 
allocated to this particular farm crisis, had indicated that over 
$200 million has already been distributed.  However, remember 
that the minister of agriculture continually stands in the House 
and says that $1.5 billion has been allocated to the AIDA and 
farm disaster programs that we are now suffering.  Two hundred 
million dollars being distributed to this date, October 25, is a 
far cry from the $1.5 billion he continues to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the AIDA numbers.  Saskatchewan and Manitoba have 
in fact received a goodly share of the $200 million that has been 
distributed thus far, but for every one application that has been 
approved there is one application that has been denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister of agriculture earlier this morning if he 
believes that the people who have been denied do not require any 
assistance throughout the farm disaster.  His answer was 
“absolutely not”.  He said that not everyone was going to 
qualify and not everyone was going to get assistance from the 
$1.5 billion.  To date, only $200 million has been allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba and Saskatchewan right now there are people who are 
in desperate straits. They do not qualify for AIDA.  For what 
reason?  It is because the AIDA program has criteria attached to 
it which will never allow them to qualify for disaster assistance 
or AIDA assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of those inefficiencies or deficiencies 
within the AIDA program.  Negative margins was mentioned.  When 
we first talked about this as the PC Party of Canada, we had a 
program set out that dealt with 70% of the farm income.  We would 
also like to see negative margins covered.  When the program was 
put into place negative margins were not covered.  A substantial 
number of applicants need cashflow in order to put their crops in 
next year but they have been disqualified because negative 
margins are not allowed in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A five year averaging of margins was not allowed.  A three year 
averaging of margins was accepted by the government, a criteria 
that disqualified a number of people.  Seventy per cent of 
nothing is nothing but that does not mean the producer or farmer 
does not need cash in order to continue the operation.  A five 
year averaging would have been much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for the 
AIDA program.  It is so complicated that in some cases it 
dissuades people from even applying.  Beyond that, once a person 
gets an application into the AIDA bureaucracy, there is a whole 
different set of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, where the federal 
government administers the program, almost one out of every two 
applicants gets disqualified?  There are verifiers and the rules 
change every day.  We can talk to five different verifiers or 
auditors and five different answers will come forward.  That is 
not only frustrating for an applicant who has put in an 
application, but it is also to the point where other applicants 
will not even apply.  Rules are changed on a daily basis.  We 
need some consistency within the program to make it fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue not dealt with in the existing AIDA program is 
that of year ends, a simple little bureaucratic nightmare.  For a 
corporate farmer with a year end that falls outside of the 
calendar year end, the AIDA program is unfortunately backdated to 
a 1997-98 program as opposed to a 1998-99 program.  We recognize 
that the 1999 crop year is going to have some serious 
ramifications on the farm economy.  With corporate year ends, 
which have not yet been resolved, some corporate farmers may not 
have any option or opportunity to take advantage of AIDA in 1999. 
That is an absolute travesty because those particular producers 
as well as all producers need a 1999 support system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the distinct displeasure of representing an area that has 
more than simply a commodity crisis going on right now.  We have 
a natural disaster.  Millions of acres of land could not be 
seeded in the spring because of too much water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture has tried to make the AIDA program 
everything for everybody.  This is an extraordinary circumstance 
that has to be dealt with by extraordinary support from the 
federal government.  It has not been forthcoming.  Those 
producers in the area who do not have any crops and who do not 
comply with the AIDA criteria will not be farming in the next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak with some authority.  When our party was in power prior 
to 1993, we came forward with some very strong programs.  We 
implemented the NISA program which people throughout the House 
are now taking credit for.  We came up with the GRIP program 
which is still in effect in Alberta and in Ontario and is doing 
quite well for the producers in those areas.  However, it was the 
Liberal government in 1995 that decided to take a little short 
term gain for a long term pain.  It got rid of the GRIP program. 
If it were in place today we would not be standing in the House 
trying to demand additional support services from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the late eighties and early nineties the Progressive 
Conservative Party put hundreds of millions of dollars in support 
to farm communities and farmers with respect to drought 
assistance and commodity assistance.  The federal government can 
take some lessons from what happened prior to 1993, and I wish it 
would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party talks simply of tax relief and getting rid of 
subsidies. 
That is very laudable.  It should happen and it will happen, but 
it will not happen between now and next spring when farmers will 
need and demand some assistance to get their crops in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Reform Party for bringing forward the motion. 
However, it has always stood in the House and said “If you can't 
stand on your own, then you had better get out of the way”.  Our 
party says “If you can't stand on your own in this particular 
situation, we should be there as a part of the government to say 
that here are the services and support that is necessary to keep 
you going until the next crop year”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if I understand the member correctly, he is saying we 
should loosen the criteria and give as much money as possible to 
all the farmers who say they have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was precisely the mistake made by the government when it 
attempted to help the east coast fishermen who were affected by 
the cod moratorium.  A lot of the $1.5 billion that went to the 
maritimes did not reach the people who actually needed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely criteria have to be established and there has to be a 
bureaucracy that looks at how the money is spent on a program 
like this.  If the member really has complaints about the AIDA 
program, surely he has a responsibility to be specific in his 
complaints rather than just suggesting we add more money to the 
pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
obviously not listening.  I never asked for more money to be 
added to the pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested that the $1.5 billion, that has continued to be used 
as the number distributed to agriculture, should be distributed. 
The number now stands at $200 million for 1998.  The reason the 
minister of agriculture is tinkering with the program now is 
because he is embarrassed.  The criteria that were put into place 
in that program were so restrictive that it never had the 
opportunity of putting the money out that was necessary to get 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government should be embarrassed that $1.5 billion 
is available and only $200 million has gone out to desperate 
farmers who need it.  When the government changes the criteria to 
reasonable criteria then the full $1.5 billion can be distributed 
to the people who really need it, not one out of every two 
applications being denied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will bring forward some factual 
information in reply to my hon. friend from Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he left the impression with some listeners and viewers 
that the GRIP in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan was 
taken away against their wishes.  I remind the member for 
Brandon—Souris that GRIP was abandoned because those two 
provinces did not want GRIP.  They felt that the premiums were 
too high and the federal government agreed to it.  The province 
of Ontario wanted to continue with GRIP and does so today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris finds the AIDA program wanting 
and would like to see it improved.  Again he would like to leave 
the impression that it is the sole responsibility of the federal 
government.  I would remind the member for Brandon—Souris that 
this is not just a one government program.  The provinces are 
involved as well. The federal government pays 60% of AIDA.  The 
provinces pay 40%.  The provinces agreed to the criteria involved 
in AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Brandon—Souris supported the former Filmon 
government which agreed to AIDA.  The Romanow government, which 
still exists by a thread, agreed to the criteria of AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to bring these things into perspective so that the 
people out there, many of whom are not farmers and are living in 
cities, understand the true facts about AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe there is some 
foreshadowing there with respect to the Filmon government and the 
NDP government.  The federal government also agreed to the AIDA 
and perhaps it may well be a former federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the issues brought up by the member for 
Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia.  First, the GRIP was put into 
place and it was and is a good program in those provinces that 
still continue with it; FIDP in Alberta and the MRI program in 
Ontario. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was to the government's detriment that GRIP was taken away in 
1995.  Had the government had vision, it could have seen that the 
commodity prices are very cyclical in the farming economy.  One 
government and a provincial government suggested they did not 
want to have it for the opportunity of saving money, as the 
federal government did when it took away its contribution to the 
GRIP. Perhaps it should have seen down the road that this program 
was going to be necessary in 1999, 2000 or 2001, instead of 
getting rid of it.  It was short term gain for long term pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the provincial government, yes, Manitoba did give $50 an 
acre for unseeded acreage. That came totally at the expense of 
the provincial government.  The federal government has still not 
made its commitment to that $50 per acre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we are debating this motion today.  I 
congratulate the member for Selkirk—Interlake for bringing it 
forward.  The country's agricultural crisis is not being 
addressed properly.  It needs to be discussed and debated. The 
issues need to be brought forward for all Canadians to consider. 
It is a simple fact that the agricultural industry in Canada is 
in crisis.  There was no indication in the throne speech from the 
Prime Minister that he was going to adjust programs to handle 
this, which has necessitated this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate this today, family farms are being repossessed. 
Families are being torn from the land they have worked for 
generations. Families are losing a way of life that is unique to 
Canada and to their heritage.  Their fathers and grandfathers 
sweated and worked hard for years to develop a way of life. Not 
only do they lose their farms and their jobs, they lose their 
homes, their heritage, possibly their pride and their 
self-esteem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the hard work that went into their farms, things 
outside their realm are affecting what they do.  No matter how 
hard they work and no matter how sharp they are in their 
marketing decisions, the fact remains that they cannot sell their 
product for enough to pay the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Situations have come into the farm communities over which the 
farmers have had no control.  Our farmers now need some help. 
They need help to compete against the monopolistic wheat board. 
They need help against European subsidies that drive up 
production and drive down prices.  They need help against U.S. 
protectionism and subsidies that distort the marketplace.  They 
need help against the natural disasters that have devastated the 
prairies in this and previous years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need help to combat the attacks by people who know 
nothing about farm life and rural life.  Environmentalists have 
come forward without any thought of what they are doing to our 
agricultural people, with unfounded allegations that are going to 
tremendously affect farm life. Farmers need help to fight the 
input costs that have been driven up, the input costs and taxes 
that have been created by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government they have to turn to for help is the same 
government that has put them in this position. It is a catch 22 
situation.  Most of their problems have been created by the 
people they are forced to go to as a last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers would sooner keep everything inside than say that they 
need help.  They would not ask for help unless it was very badly 
needed.  They have to go to the government that has its hands in 
their pockets right up to the elbow.  We are here to find help 
from one of the sources that is creating the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The east coast fishery is in turmoil.  As mentioned earlier by a 
government member, the TAGS program on the east coast did not do 
what it was supposed to do.  We can look at the dairy and hog 
industry in Quebec, or the diverse crops and farming in Ontario. 
The prairies have been devastated by low commodities.  We can 
look at the B.C. forest and fishing industries, or the dairy 
industry in the Fraser Valley.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing people do not want to hear is “Hi, I am a 
Liberal.  I am from the Liberal government and I am here to help 
you”.  That sends shock waves and fear through the hearts of all 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has come to a crossroads when it comes to 
agriculture.  As a country, as a government and as a people we 
have to decide if we are going to put the measures in place to 
preserve a way of life that has helped to build such a great 
nation.  We have to decide if the family farm and the family farm 
way of life is worth preserving and we have to decide now because 
if we do not, it is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a crisis such as this one since the Great 
Depression.  I did not live through that, having been born after 
it, but I listened to my folks talk about it. Terrible stress and 
duress was put on families and the things that happened then, we 
do not need again.  We need to do things quickly. The problem is 
many faceted in the agriculture industry.  We need to react 
quickly and respond immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have programs in place that will give some long term 
stability to the industry.  We need to look at all costs. 
Commodity prices are down and revenues are low, but let us look 
at the other side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put a program in place that obviously is not 
working.  It seems to be reluctant to move further. It is trying 
to match the amount of dollars it took out of the budget to suit 
the program instead of looking at the damage being done and then 
having the program match that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government that will stand up for farmers and a way of 
life that Canadians are proud of.  We need a government that will 
go to bat for its people and not create bureaucratic nightmares 
that do not get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has come up with a plan. Our job is to 
point out the shortcomings of the government but also to bring 
forward plans and ideas that will help to solve the situation. 
Five key areas need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is a short term solution.  We have to find some 
solutions immediately.  The AIDA program is not working.  It 
needs to be replaced or reformed.  The hurt in the agricultural 
community is not being addressed by the size of this program.  We 
have to look at all angles.  Some of the provinces have come up 
with ideas. The federal government should look at what is going 
on in Alberta and what has been developed for the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need medium and long term solutions.  Every time we get 
in a crisis we try to develop a program to handle it.  Let us 
develop that program when we are in good times to carry us 
through the bad times so that farmers do not have to come on 
bended knee to the government for help.  Let us get something in 
place that will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some changes are needed to the safety net programs. The three 
year average currently used in AIDA needs to be extended.  We 
have heard that from other members.  Negative margins need to be 
considered in the program.  The application process needs to be 
simplified.  For every farmer that is receiving aid, one is being 
rejected for various reasons.  Are those people who are being 
rejected disappearing or is their hurt gone? No, they are still 
there and need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crop insurance programs need to be put in place that would 
address those situations as they arise. The premiums must be 
affordable so that farmers can get in early and they are there to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need free and fair trade abroad.  We have done a good job in 
reducing subsidies but other countries we deal with have not. For 
instance, European subsidies on wheat production are 7.7 times 
higher than Canada's. U.S. subsidies are 4.5 times higher than 
Canada's.  We have to address that situation.  We need a 
government that will put a team together to say to the Europeans 
and the Americans that something has to be done about reducing 
the subsidies to bring up the commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade laws must be modified.  There is a situation very close to 
my home where groundless anti-dumping complaints have been lodged 
by the United States.  We have to change the rules.  We have to 
go to the bargaining table and stand up for our producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues and I had the opportunity to meet with 
some northern state U.S. senators over the last year. 
We need to open up that dialogue.  It became quite obvious 
through these talks that we need to know more about each other 
and we need to educate them on what we are doing in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must actively promote value added processing.  We 
should not sell a grain that has not been processed.  We should 
not be selling our other products unless we can add value.  We 
have to put some emphasis on that as that would bring relief to 
the prairies and add value to the products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to open up the marketing choices that 
farmers have.  They should not be restricted.  There should not 
be a monopoly.  They should be able to make the choices they want 
to make in order to improve their bottom line. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, regarding the criteria for something like the AIDA 
program, there are two choices.  We can either make the criteria 
very stiff in order to prevent people from abusing it, or we can 
make it looser so that people who should not take advantage of it 
can do so. Another alternative is to add money to the AIDA 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What scenario does the member think the government should 
follow?  Should it loosen the rules and thereby have people abuse 
the program, or should it put more money into the program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that way of thinking about 
the situation is the problem.  Let us listen on Thursday and 
Friday when the premiers and the delegations are here from 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Let us hear what they think needs to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assume that if restrictive regulations are not in place that 
eliminate half of the people from applying and that to reduce the 
regulations will cause abuse, is wrong.  People are genuinely 
hurting.  We have to make this program available to them.  To 
approve one application and then to reject the next one for 
whatever reason is not the answer.  To assume abuse is the wrong 
way to go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us find out from the representatives of the farming 
community exactly what needs to be done.  Let us follow their 
lead.  They are the ones that do know. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I found 
the debate rather interesting, in particular the address 
presented by the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to expand a little further on the AIDA 
program and the distinction of the hon. member opposite regarding 
there being only two options.  I wonder if my colleague could 
address that question in another way and simply suggest to the 
hon. member that perhaps there are not only those two 
distinctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the biggest problems with the AIDA issue is not 
that it does not work because it is not a good program, but it 
does not work because nobody understands it.  The government does 
not understand it.  The bureaucrats do not understand it.  The 
farmers do not understand it. Certain accountants, when they are 
given all the papers to complete, will charge $500 or $600 to 
present the application only to discover that the farmer does not 
qualify or only gets $45. Could the hon. member comment on that 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Kelowna for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the opportunity once in a while to meet with farmers in 
the morning for a coffee in a local truck stop.  There are 
dryland grain farmers, sugar beet growers, cattle producers, 
cattle feeders and people with a small land base that get into 
custom farming.  It is a wide range of folks. Of those who 
completely understand the AIDA program there is not one that does 
not feel confident that it can help them out.  They know they are 
going to have to go to an accountant. They know they are going to 
have another $500 or $600 bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplifying the process would go a long way toward relieving 
their concerns.  Simplifying the process does not require one 
more dollar, it just requires some common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to participate in this debate for one 
basic reason and that is that the constituency which I represent 
was perhaps the worst hit constituency across Canada last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks will dwell on people.  Everyone has done an adequate 
job of talking about the reasons, but I want to talk about the 
people, the people who I serve and the people across Canada, who 
through no fault of their own cannot extract one cent for the 
help that is needed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people that I represent are proud prairie people, people who 
have been betrayed, people of the land.  They are people who are 
fourth and fifth generation farmers.  They are young farmers, 
young farm families, many of whom I know personally.  They will 
tell me, as will some of the older people, that the situation 
they are looking at right now is even more severe than it was in 
the depths of the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get very emotional when I talk about these people.  Make no 
mistake about it, these people have been betrayed.  They have 
been betrayed by this government.  They have been betrayed by 
their provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the flood came two years ago to Manitoba the people that I 
represent rushed to help not only because of their location, many 
of them took equipment to help. Two years later there is more 
land under water in my constituency.  A hundred times more land 
did not get seeded.  While my constituents agreed with immediate 
help for the Red River flood, they are still waiting for some 
help from this government.  Is it any wonder they feel betrayed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My same constituents were happy to see the immediate influx of 
cash during the devastating ice storm.  But there they sit with 
frozen grain in the field this fall.  They filled out AIDA forms, 
which is like buying a $500 lottery ticket, and they lost because 
they have received nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being betrayed because of the stubborn insistence of 
this government which says that the current programs are meeting 
the farmers' needs.  They are not.  The government should open up 
its ears to the provincial delegation that is coming down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad part is that many of these young people are telling me 
that they are being politically punished simply because they do 
not support a government, provincial or federal, which really has 
no keen interest in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are feeling betrayed as well by the fact that they lost 
$400 million out of the provincial GRIP program.  Boy, that would 
come in handy right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are feeling betrayed because the property tax on their 
agricultural land is sky high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are feeling betrayed because the grain companies, which they 
really believed would be there when they needed them, are not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the greatest betrayal of all, they were told if they 
would just settle for the Crow rate removal, get rid of it, the 
government would pay them out.  All they got was one year's free 
freight.  That is all.  That is not the end.  This government 
told them in no uncertain terms that if they would accept the 
Crow, then they would not be fighting these big subsidy wars. 
The House knows the rest of the story.  It is little wonder that 
I get emotional when I talk about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every night last summer, if a phone call was not 
picked up by my offices, I tried to make contact with that 
constituent.  This House is dealing with a human tragedy which I 
witnessed for all but three days during last summer. 
People ask if anyone is listening.

get any financial consideration.  Obviously many people agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not looking for a handout.  They hate that term. 
They are not looking for a subsidy.  Farmers are simply pleading 
with the government that they need some survival funds right now. 
That is what they are asking for.  GRIP has turned them down.  If 
farmers lost money for three years, GRIP does nothing.  Farmers 
need assistance.

faith”.  Because the government's AIDA program was not designed 
for the area which I represent, it has broken faith.  The 
government can correct that.  It can correct that this Thursday. 
It can be corrected by making an agreement with the group coming 
here to put an end to what otherwise would be the blackest 
chapter in the history of agriculture in my constituency.  The 
future is in our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention three phone calls that I received.  This will 
give members some idea of the extent of the suffering out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young farmer's wife phoned me in August.  She was 32 years of 
age and had one child who was starting school.  She wanted to 
know if I could help.  This family had spent $500 filling out an 
AIDA form.  They were told that they would get a little bit.  Two 
weeks later they were told that their application would be 
reviewed.  Eventually this family may get something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this phone call was over, this young lady broke down. 
She was in tears.  She wept bitterly.  The power bill would soon 
be due.  The phone was about to be cut off.  This lady's final 
words were that they had never asked for help before from anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government to listen.  The programs which have been 
created have been misconstrued and misstated.  The minister of 
agriculture said that individuals would receive $50 an acre for 
flooded land.  Nobody received $50 an acre; not anywhere near it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phone call I received was an even sadder case.  This 
call came from a lady who was phoning from the bedside of her 
husband.  She had spent the entire summer trying to get a bed in 
the hospital.  Her husband is dying of cancer.  The government 
had told this lady that they would get a small amount.  All I 
could do was write to the government and beg on this couple's 
behalf.  I want members to note her last words.  She too broke 
down and said that their only son would probably never survive 
the agriculture crisis long enough to keep the land which was his 
great-grandfather's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is as great a crisis as that which has ever happened.  Yet, 
we are still trying to make some political points from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last phone call I received was very personal.  It came from 
a young couple who are living on the same farm as my wife and I 
lived on.  This young fellow bent my ear for 50 minutes. 
He basically said that he had learned not to trust any 
government.  That is a sad case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents and those across the prairies, we 
are not asking, we are begging that on Thursday the government 
meet with the provincial people and say, yes, that it can indeed 
look after those people who do not qualify because of some stupid 
form.  They hate that form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the human tragedy.  Let us stop the bleeding.  It 
is in the hands of the government.  Hundreds of farm families 
need to be listened to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member two very specific 
questions.  The first is, given that the AIDA program and other 
compensation programs are 60:40, should the provinces be required 
to pay their share? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second, related question is, when this visit comes on 
Thursday, what happens if the federal government cannot get 
agreement with the provinces to reform AIDA in the manner that 
the hon. member suggests is necessary?  Should the federal 
government then act unilaterally to reform it if it cannot get 
the agreement of the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question.  I 
believe that both the federal and the provincial governments 
believe that it should be zero for qualification and not a 
negative.  That has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the government does not get the agreement of the 
provinces, then this must happen.  If this human suffering is 
going to be stopped, this bleeding that I referred to, then it 
will fall on the government's shoulders to say, yes, it can make 
those improvements to AIDA that will fill the needs at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that they are going to be asking for $1 billion. 
The most disappointing thing I heard came from the only Liberal 
member from Saskatchewan, who I thought had passed away because 
we had not heard from him.  He said that we do not have enough 
jingle jangle down here.  That is nonsense.  If this human story 
is turned over to everyone in the government, my guess is that 
the farmers will get help.  However, if it is turned over just to 
cabinet, I am afraid this may rest on its hands.  I hope I am 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to help and I think the hon. member would agree with 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
would the member for Souris—Moose Mountain please tell me if it 
is Reform policy to issue $1 billion in subsidies to farmers in 
Saskatchewan?  If so, how would he see that being distributed 
fairly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris calling the AIDA program a subsidy?  Is he calling 
the crop insurance program a subsidy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I said was that there is room within existing programs to 
sharpen them up to stop the human bleeding.  That is what we are 
asking for.  Quite frankly, if the government needs some help I 
can tell it how to help the hundreds of people who I know 
personally.  Do not call it a subsidy.  We are not calling it a 
subsidy.  If the government wants to call it a subsidy, fine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat the question of my 
hon. friend from Brandon—Souris.  Is it the Reform Party's 
policy to ask for an additional $1 billion for farmers in the 
province of Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that if the answer to the question is yes, 
this is a demand from a party that just a couple of years ago 
wanted to take about $1.5 billion out of agriculture.  Which is 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
hon. member should happen to refer to that.  If he wants to know 
Reform policy I can give it to him straight out.  We are there 
when help is needed.  He should not ever let anyone fool him that 
we will not be there to help on a fair and equitable scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the question by the hon. member.  We are saying 
that if the government were to get rid of many of its taxation 
policies it would not have to worry about programs like this one. 
It would not have to tell over half the farmers in Saskatchewan 
that they would not get a cent.  Reform policy is to look after 
everybody fairly, not just so that a few get money and the others 
do not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let the record show that the previous 
speaker from Brandon—Souris did not answer the question.  It 
does not come as a great surprise to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the distinguished member for 
Waterloo—Wellington.  I am very pleased to take part in this 
important debate.  I wish to bring another perspective to the 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers produce some of the safest, highest quality and 
most affordable food in the world, but having the best product at 
the best price does not do a lot of good unless there is an 
efficient, cost effective way to get product to the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the government's grain handling and transportation 
reform is all about.  It is the issue I will speak to today. This 
is an important issue for the bottom lines of western farmers. It 
is also an important issue for the thousands of Canadians whose 
livelihoods depend on a robust farm economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I talk about the ongoing consultations and the decisions 
that lie ahead I would like to give some sense of the history of 
this very complex issue.  The difficulty of transporting grain 
across vast expanses of land to deliver it to port for export is 
an issue that is multifaceted and that has prompted endless 
discussion.  The severe backlog of grain shipments and ships 
waiting in the port of Vancouver during the winter of 1996-97, 
particularly in February of that year, hurt producers in the 
pocketbook.  As a result the government's resolve to tackle the 
problem hardened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that winter, extreme weather conditions and railway 
infrastructure problems caused disruptions that affected every 
part of the grain transportation system.  The then agriculture 
minister convened a meeting in Calgary to which he invited all 
participants in the system: railways, grain companies, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Grain Commission and the car 
allocation policy group.  They turned their efforts to finding 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All agreed that it was time to concentrate on building a grain 
transportation system in which there would be more accountability 
and reliability, where there would be rewards for those who 
overperform, penalties for those who underperform and a system 
with incentives built into it to make sure grain gets to where it 
is supposed to be and on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1997 the Minister of Transport, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board again convened a meeting of all stakeholders 
to develop strategies to ensure grain moves efficiently 
throughout the crop year and to further discuss industry calls 
for an early review of the grain handling and transportation 
system rather than wait for the 1999 statutory review under the 
Canada Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several months later in December the Minister of Transport 
announced that Mr. Justice Willard Estey was to head a major 
review of the grain handling and transportation system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His mandate was to come up with recommendations for, first, a 
responsive, efficient, customer oriented logistics system that 
would enhance the competitiveness of producers, shippers, 
carriers and ports; second, a system where all stakeholders 
including producers would share in the rewards of productivity 
improvements and would also share in the appropriate direct 
consequences for activities that detract from system performance; 
and, third, a system with well defined accountability for all 
elements of the grain logistics system to encourage high 
performance levels by each participant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Estey consulted with industry stakeholders in the early 
part of the year and provided a preliminary report at the end of 
April 1998.  His final report delivered at the end of last year 
contained 15 recommendations.  These recommendations constituted 
a blueprint for a less regulated, more accountable and 
competitive grain handling and transportation system 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees with Justice Estey's vision that the 
western grain handling and transportation system should be made 
more efficient, more accountable and beneficial to farmers.  We 
want it to move to a more contract based, commercially oriented 
environment with appropriate safeguards for all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Estey set out key principles to be followed in solving 
grain transportation issues but there was still work to be done 
to put the operational details in place.  To achieve this the 
Minister of Transport appointed Arthur Kroeger, a former deputy 
minister of transport, to involve western stakeholders in 
developing those operational details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of this past summer Mr. Kroeger held extensive 
consultations among grain industry stakeholders on 12 of the 15 
recommendations included in the Estey report.  He headed a 
steering committee which set up three working groups that 
concentrated on rates, revenues, commercial relations, 
competition and safeguards.  Mr. Kroeger was asked to provide 
recommendations on any issue that was not agreed upon by the 
stakeholders during the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he delivered his report to the government last month he 
indicated in a letter to the Minister of Transport that there was 
still a dispute over the issue of eliminating regulated grain 
freight rates and replacing them with a cap on revenue for each 
railway.  The point of a revenue cap is to provide a safeguard to 
ensure that producers are not paying too much to transport their 
grain and that as savings are achieved throughout the 
transportation system farmers get to benefit as much as anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main dispute was the starting point for a revenue cap, which 
Mr. Kroeger recommended should be set at 12% below the 1998 
level.  This would be a reduction of $3.73 per tonne or a total 
of $112 million below the 1998 level based on a total grain 
volume of 30 million tonnes.  This means that shippers of grain 
would benefit to the tune of $112 million in the year 2000.  I 
assure the House that many farmers are holding for greater 
savings than those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report Mr. Justice Estey recognized the mutual dependence 
between the railways and grain producers, and I quote what he 
said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the efficiency and economic health of the rail system is of 
prime importance, ranking next in importance to the economic 
well-being of farmers.  The railway and the farmers cannot do 
without each other.  Mutual survival dictates that efficiencies 
and economies must be shared between the two. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more.  The prosperity of our producers depends 
on it.  Mr. Kroeger also recommended that the federal government 
assess the results of these reductions at the end of a five year 
period.  If at the end of that period the results were found to 
be unsatisfactory we would have other options open to us such as 
developing further measures to increase competition.  In the 
meantime, however, the revenue cap would provide safeguards 
against excessive rate increases to grain producers during the 
trial period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the issues in the report and Mr. Kroeger's letter will be 
very carefully studied before we move to any consideration of new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the important role that grain handling and 
transport play in the costs and incomes of farmers and in the 
strength of the rural and agricultural economy of the west.  I am 
confident, though, that through changes to the grain 
transportation system Canada's grain sector will become more 
competitive, which can only help western Canadian grain 
producers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly thank the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia for identifying for his government a potential 
$112 million saving to farmers on grain transportation.  Today's 
debate is exactly about how to get more money into the hands of 
farmers, particularly those who are especially suffering in the 
area of export commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to making grain transportation more of a commercial 
contract based system, would the member consider advocating to 
his government the reduction of the four cent federal excise tax 
on fuel and lowering user fees, especially in the case of the 
Canadian Grain Commission, or not increasing those fees to cover 
its deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, to help farm incomes greatly he could advocate a 
voluntary Canadian Wheat Board so that farmers who want to form a 
co-op, which in essence is what the Canadian Wheat Board is, 
specific to their products, in this case durum wheat, could add 
further value and the value added money would stay with farmers 
producing durum wheat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he comment on those ideas and indicate whether he would 
support them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether I 
can remember all those questions.  I remind my hon. friend from 
Manitoba that the input costs or the fees charged by the grain 
commission have been frozen.  I recognize the financial 
difficulties of farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and elsewhere. 
If those fees continue to be frozen for an indefinite period I 
would certainly support it and recommend it to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love advice from the Reform Party on a voluntary wheat board. 
The fact of the matter is that the producers the Reform claims to 
support are in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board.  I remind the 
member for Selkirk—Interlake that we changed the governance of 
the wheat board.  It now has 15 members, 10 of whom are elected 
by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is dominated by producers who speak for 
farmers.  If the Canadian Wheat Board wants to make changes with 
respect to marketing, whether it has to do with co-ops or anybody 
else, God bless them.  Let it go ahead.  It is the producers' 
board.  We in Ottawa should not be telling them otherwise.  Get a 
grip. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia has indicated 
that he and the government recognize that the last couple of 
years have been really hard on farmers for a variety of reasons, 
rail costs being one of them.  A solution for rail costs is not 
in place as yet.  Farmers will not benefit immediately from that 
at this crucial point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government recognizes the last couple of years of 
hardship, why would it set up a program that does not take in 
five to seven years but takes in only the two years of great 
hardship?  Why set up a program that will not meet the needs of 
farmers out there?  From my perspective it sounds a lot like EI 
where we have it out there but some 40% of the people cannot 
access it.  That is what the government has done to farmers as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not too sure whether 
the member for Churchill expressed her question clearly, or maybe 
I misunderstood it.  If she is referring to the reference period, 
the reference period has to do with the past three years. I know 
there have been considerations about looking at a different kind 
of reference period called the Olympic model.  Things are being 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA has been modified to some extent from the time when it was 
brought in last Christmas.  I would not be surprised that in aid 
of improving it and streamlining it there will be some other 
changes.

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I take the opportunity to enter this debate to provide some of 
the details on the government's response to this very serious 
financial situation facing Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly about this issue for two reasons.  First, 
in my riding of Waterloo—Wellington approximately 30% to 35% of 
the wealth generated is as a result of agriculture and 
agribusiness.  Second, I still live on the family farm and 
therefore have firsthand experience about what it is like in this 
kind of situation.  It is very important that we detail it in an 
effective and progressive manner and that is precisely what we 
are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While overall the agriculture and food sector is strong and 
makes a significant contribution to the Canadian economy, the 
government knows very well that the past year has not been an 
easy time for many of our producers and farmers.  As the hon. 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food explained recently, 
Canadian farmers encountered problems last fall when the prices 
in the Asian economy hit North America. That situation was 
compounded by declining commodity prices, a low Canadian dollar 
and unusually difficult situations that occurred, especially the 
flood and drought conditions in certain areas of the country. All 
these things combined to make for a serious impact on the income 
of many producers, particularly those in grain, oilseeds and hog 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that situation the government moved to the aid of 
Canadian farmers by introducing the agriculture income disaster 
assistance program, AIDA.  Funded 60% by the federal government 
and 40% by the provinces, AIDA is providing $1.5 billion over two 
years to those farmers in need. That funding is in addition to 
the $1 billion the federal and provincial governments contribute 
each year to the safety net programs, including crop insurance 
and the net income stabilization account which cushion farmers 
during difficult times, and those programs which invest in 
marketing research and other initiatives which serve to 
strengthen the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working closely with farm organizations and farmers themselves, 
the federal and provincial governments designed AIDA to be a 
national program which would be as inclusive as possible, open to 
all farmers in all commodity areas in every region of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA uses an individual producer's revenue and expense 
information from tax returns to calculate payments.  The 
applicant's gross margin, that is, the allowable revenues from 
all commodities minus allowable expenses, is compared with the 
average from the three previous years to determine the amount of 
assistance available through AIDA. The farmer is entitled to a 
payment that brings his or her income up to 70% of the previous 
three year average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA was also designed so that governments could offer 
assistance to new or beginning farmers.  That is crucial because 
we need to help our young people in this regard.  Special 
procedures were put in place so that producers who had just 
started were able to apply for the program even though they may 
not have had the historical information necessary for the 
calculations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA has proven successful in helping Canadian farmers to 
withstand the current crisis.  The numbers speak for themselves. 
Up to October 20, over 54,000 applications had been received. 
More than $220 million is now in the hands of more than 16,000 
farmers across the country, with average payments amounting to 
about $14,000 per producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is perhaps the province most affected by this 
crisis.  I was in Saskatchewan this past summer and saw firsthand 
the kinds of situations the farmers are facing.  More than 6,800 
farmers in that province have been paid over $72 million. In 
Ontario where the provincial government is administering the 
program, more than $61 million has gone out to 4,200 producers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impressive number of applications means that Canadian 
farmers will use most, if not all, of the $600 million available 
to deal with reduced incomes in 1998.  This money will ensure 
that farm incomes for 1998 are brought close to the previous five 
year averages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a move to ensure cash continues to flow to those farmers in 
need, the government has also made advance payments available 
from AIDA 1999.  This allows farmers to get 60% of their 
estimated entitlement without having to wait to file their income 
forms next February.  A total of $900 million in funding is 
available in 1999, the second year of the AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In provinces where the Government of Canada is delivering the 
AIDA program, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Nova 
Scotia, application forms for 1999 have been available since the 
beginning of September.  I encourage all of those who need money 
soon to submit an application as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in the opposition who want the government to 
throw out this successful program and replace it with an acreage 
payment.  Some on the prairies are demanding up to $80 per acre. 
The Government of Canada has not and will not implement such a 
program for three very good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, acreage payments would go to all the producers regardless 
of need.  This would not be fair to those who have suffered from 
some of the worst declining market conditions for a long time. 
Again the AIDA program is targeted at those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if we were to cover all land, an $80 per acre payment 
would cost up to $5.2 billion in Saskatchewan alone.  To be fair, 
the payment would not just be offered to Saskatchewan producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, any ad hoc programming that is not disaster based and 
that does not treat all farmers equitably would violate our 
international trade obligations.  If we were to implement this 
type of program we would be subject to countervail activity from 
our major trading partners, especially from the United States. 
The government cannot act irresponsibly in this regard and it 
will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA is trade friendly because it treats all farmers in 
financial need equitably regardless of what commodity they grow 
or what province they live in.  However the Government of Canada 
realizes that AIDA is not working for everyone.  We realize that 
some producers have had several back to back years of low income, 
primarily due to repeated drought or flooding conditions.  It is 
for this reason that the minister's national safety nets advisory 
committee was asked to recommend changes for the second year of 
the program.  That advisory committee incidentally is made up of 
representatives from all the major farm commodity groups. The 
government is now considering its recommendations and will 
proceed accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to Canadian farmers, as 
well we should be and as we are.  We are working to improve 
conditions for producers on many fronts including in the upcoming 
World Trade Organization talks where we will put forward a strong 
position which represents the broad trade interests of the entire 
agriculture and food sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to support farmers with effective and flexible 
safety nets. Dialogue continues with the provinces and farm 
groups on options for the long term renewal of a safety net 
package and a permanent disaster program.  We will continue as we 
should to push for changes on the international front to level 
the playing field so that our farmers can compete on the same 
footing as their American and European counterparts. World Trade 
Organization talks in Seattle in December will be a major 
stepping stone toward our goal of subsidy elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to invest in research and development so that 
the industry will be further strengthened by adopting new 
technologies which enhance food production and help the industry 
to develop new products and technologies that allow new uses to 
be made of existing products. In addition we will continue to 
support diversification in an effort to foster self-reliance and 
improved competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of our efforts will result in a strengthened agri-food 
sector and a strong and vital rural Canada.  That is what all of 
us on the government side are working toward.  We think it is 
important.  We understand the importance of rural Canada to this 
great country of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to hear my colleagues from the other side boast about 
leadership and vision.  My constituents in West Nova, 
particularly those in farming and even those in the fishery fail 
to see where that vision and leadership is. We look at the Speech 
from the Throne.  There is no leadership, no vision, nothing 
about fishing and farming.  My constituents tell me that the AIDA 
disaster program is exactly that, a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers would not have to ask for help if this government showed 
leadership and direction.  That is not a question.  I will leave 
it as a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the member 
opposite for the question.  He speaks of vision, leadership and 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I point out to him that in 1997 the New Democratic Party 
had a shopping list of $17.6 billion in additional spending?  How 
much of that was geared toward subsidy for agriculture?  How much 
was geared to help our farmers?  A measly $11 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine 
that they would now support leadership and direction when they 
had absolutely nothing to say about agriculture and the supports 
necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are to be debating the farm income crisis and 
not slamming each other around, party against party.  We are all 
supposed to be doing what we can for the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got one little hint of a positive comment from the member. He 
was talking of diversification in agriculture.  Certainly that is 
one of the areas in which farm incomes can be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Canadian Wheat Board, the member must be 
reminded that the wheat board only operates under the confines of 
federal legislation that restricts farmers from selling wheat and 
barley on export except through the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in the case of prairie pasta producers, farmers were able to 
increase their incomes selling durum wheat by value adding it 
into a pasta type product, would the member support having a 
voluntary wheat board?  It would allow growers of various crops 
to value add to their crops in conjunction and in co-operation 
with fellow farmers of the same attitude.  Would he support a 
voluntary wheat board to promote this diversification in western 
agriculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side have strongly supported the Canadian 
Wheat Board over the years and will continue to do so in a very 
effective and strong fashion.  Recently the kinds of changes that 
we have implemented support the Government of Canada's position 
in this all important area, fully understanding how important 
that wheat board is to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to understand from the Reform Party where exactly its 
principles are and what is left of them when it comes to 
agriculture.  I was astounded to listen to the Leader of the 
Opposition, or more to the point not to listen to the Leader of 
the Opposition through the whole last session of parliament.  How 
many questions were asked in this House by the Leader of the 
Opposition with respect to agriculture?  The answer is one. 
Imagine, of all the questions that could have been asked, only 
one measly question was asked about agriculture.  The Reform 
Party really has to get its act together with respect to this all 
important area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised that the very person who is moving this motion 
today, the member for Selkirk—Interlake, was quoted not so long 
ago as showing compassion for our pork producers when the bottom 
fell out of the market.  He told the CBC program <I>Politics</I> 
on November 30, 1998 that cattlemen do not go crying for aid 
every time the price of cattle goes down and neither should the hog 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the compassion?  Where is their sense of what is right

through it every time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind the hon. member opposite that the official 
opposition asked dozens of questions but the government answered 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise to speak to the motion which is before 
the House.  I would like to thank my colleagues who have spoken 
today for their dedication to and hard work on the farm crisis 
which exists in this country.  It is because of their commitment 
that the farm crisis issue is before the House today.  If it was 
left up to the government this issue would not see the light of 
day in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are constantly reminded of the government's supposed 
commitment to our farmers.  Yet, we continue to wait for the 
government to act in any meaningful way.  I listened, as did all 
members of the House, to the government's Speech from the Throne, 
advertising to all its agenda going into the new millennium. 
There was a very brief mention of the upcoming WTO negotiations 
and the importance of those negotiations to the future of the 
agricultural sector in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the Minister for International 
Trade in his reply to the throne speech for any new initiatives 
from the government that would deal effectively and immediately 
with the farm crisis that exists in our country.  The minister 
talked a great deal about the need for Canada to open up to the 
world and that Canada is more open to trade than any other 
leading industrialized country.  The minister talked of a rules 
based system and how Canada is one of the most active advocates 
and promoters of a rule based international trading system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke of a system that would guarantee a level 
playing field which would give Canadian businesses in all sectors 
easier access to the world market.  He said that the humanization 
of globalization was the government's objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of culture, the role of artists in our society and the 
importance of cultural diversity were all mentioned as priorities 
of the government by the Minister for International Trade.  I 
waited and waited for the minister to mention where our farmers 
fit into the future equation of the government.  I heard no 
mention of the crisis on our farms in either the throne speech or 
the trade minister's reply.  I am truly saddened that the 
minister has chosen to ignore the needs of our farm communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not taken long for the new Minister for International 
Trade to tell Canadians what his true priorities are.  Just last 
week the minister proudly announced the government's commitment 
to a global agreement which would protect Canada's cultural 
industries.  Where is the government's commitment to protect 
Canada's farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the official opposition's dissenting report on Canada's 
position in the upcoming WTO negotiations it urged the government 
to make agriculture the number one priority and noted that tariff 
and subsidy reductions are crucial to the future success of our 
farms.  Why is the government not working toward a global 
agreement to eliminate agricultural subsidies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Prime Minister to use his influence with the 
U.S.A. to eliminate its destructive agricultural subsidies.  The 
Prime Minister came to the aid of our defence and aerospace 
industries in a recent trade dispute threatening our favoured 
nation status in bidding for defence contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I called for prime ministerial intervention on this issue months 
ago when it looked like the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister for International Trade could not get the job done. 
To his credit the Prime Minister did intervene and he did prevent 
what could have been a disastrous situation for our defence and 
aerospace industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The plight of our farmers demands that the Prime Minister 
intervene in the same manner for the elimination of the export 
enhancement program and similar export subsidization programs 
that directly impact Canada's ability to compete in global 
agricultural markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the European Union heavily subsidizes its 
agricultural sector and has been opposed to any talks on 
liberalizing its aggressive export subsidization policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term, if there is ever to be a fair rule in place 
for agriculture, it can only come from ensuring that agriculture 
is a priority in the upcoming WTO negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about the importance of the Seattle round. 
However, the government must adopt a clear position on this issue 
and demand maximum market access for all countries, including 
major tariff reductions for everyone and significant subsidy 
reductions by all major players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until now we have not seen the political will necessary from 
the government to act aggressively in these negotiations.  The 
Minister for International Trade is off to Geneva this week for 
talks with the European Union on the WTO position.  Agriculture 
must be his first priority in these talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has called on the government to 
immediately launch a team Canada mission to Europe; a delegation 
that would include the Prime Minister, the Minister for 
International Trade, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food; a team Canada mission 
dedicated to making a powerful argument to the Europeans that it 
is in the best interests of Europe that subsidies be removed.  We 
must appeal to them that subsidies go against the very principle 
of free trade that the European Union seems to espouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two weeks alone there have been three decisions that 
have forced Canada to expand and open its markets.  We all know 
of the auto pact decision.  The WTO in effect said that the auto 
pact discriminated against foreign automakers because only the 
big three were able to import cars into Canada duty free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO also ruled that Canada has been unfairly subsidizing its 
milk products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a mixed decision, the U.S.A. department of commerce cleared 
our beef producers of being unfairly subsidized, yet refused to 
eliminate tariffs on Canadian cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries are using mechanisms available to them to open 
our markets to their producers and to protect their industries. 
Why then is our government not acting in a similar fashion to 
protect our agricultural industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government continues to react in a passive manner and 
refuses to act aggressively in protecting and promoting the 
interests of Canada in the global marketplace.  If the government 
is committed to free trade, as suggested in both the throne 
speech and the reply by the Minister for International Trade, 
that means more than simply knocking down our subsidies and trade 
barriers here at home.  It means aggressively knocking down trade 
barriers that exist in countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers are calling for the government to develop lasting 
solutions to the agricultural crisis.  The usual do nothing 
approach advocated by the government is simply not good enough 
any more.  The government cannot continue to be broadsided by 
decisions like the auto pact.  Until this government acts our 
farmers will continue to operate at a disadvantage 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wrap up my comments today by saying that the 
government's inability to deal with foreign subsidies is killing 
our farmers.  Why is the government refusing to deal with this 
issue?  It is more concerned with protecting our culture and 
appeasing the Maude Barlows of this world than it is in fighting 
for the future of our Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the new international trade minister's 
priorities lie elsewhere.  I question whether the government's 
position on agriculture going into the WTO negotiations has any 
real teeth at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly disgraceful that the farmers of this country are 
paying the ultimate price for a government that does not have the 
stomach or the political will to participate forcefully in 
today's global market.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the agriculture minister said, agriculture is a joint 
federal-provincial responsibility under the constitution.  The 
Reform Party has always championed the issue that the federal 
government should stay out of areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
“Get out of the provinces' faces” has been the Reform Party 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some figures here.  In the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 
support payments by the federal government to Saskatchewan alone 
were $779 million, and to Manitoba, $258 million.  That is two 
and a half times more than the provinces put in during that same 
period.  What the Reform Party is saying right here and now is 
that it wants more federal intervention and more federal money 
for the provinces.  I would like to know how the Reform Party 
reconciles that with its policy of the provinces first, the 
federal government second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
the hon. member that it was the federal government which cut 
transfer payments for health care and education to the provinces, 
forcing them into a financial crisis in which they could not 
address this issue.  Nevertheless, Alberta has just given $100 
million to its farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is, what is the federal government doing about 
it?  The issue is that the higher subsidies of the European Union 
and the U.S.A. are killing farmers in this country.  That is what 
we are asking the government to address at the forthcoming WTO 
negotiations in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard is the weak statement that, yes, we will talk 
about it.  We would like to know exactly what is the position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really think we should shed a tear for 
truth.  The hon. member from Alberta is suggesting that we have 
been indifferent to killer subsidies imposed by the European 
Union and the U.S.A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. member that in the past year the 
government has hosted and led an unprecedented number of meetings 
with all of the agricultural and agri-food stakeholders on what 
their input should be with regard to coming to a Canadian 
position on the WTO negotiations.  All of the industrial 
stakeholders were very impressed with the kind of program which 
the minister of agriculture put together in the past year to come 
to a determination of what our country should say at the WTO 
negotiations beginning in Seattle next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate we should have more facts and a little more truth 
so that people can understand what this debate is all about. 
Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the usual Liberal 
rhetoric.  The government can have as many meetings as it wants, 
but it has produced zero.  Nothing has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is asking the Prime Minister to lead a 
high level delegation to Europe to explain the damage which the 
subsidies are causing to their industries as well as ours, as 
well to free trade.  That is what the opposition is calling for. 
Maybe the hon. member could advise his government to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
really enthralled with my hon. colleague's comments.  He was very 
astute and very much to the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that has really been accomplished by the Liberal 
government to help our farmers build into the secondary 
processing industry?  There is so much value added that could be 
done by our farmers.  What help have they been given? Instead, 
the government has reduced the ability of farmers to have the 
money to do the things they want to do.  It has increased the 
costs for services rendered.  It has increased their taxes 
instead of cutting taxes.  All of these things go against farmers 
being independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would speak to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
farming prices today have been rising.  That is because of the 
government's high taxation policy.  As well, it has not addressed 
the issues.  It is a do nothing approach again.  It takes a slow 
approach.  Nothing happens.  If something does happen, then the 
government wakes up to the fact that something has happened.  It 
is the usual do nothing approach which has resulted in the farm 
crisis we have in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak on the issue of the farm income crisis in 
Canada.  I am proud to say that the Reform Party is sponsoring 
the debate today because we know how critical the issue is to 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians.  It is about time we debated 
the issue in the House of Commons, and it is time the government 
started paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reiterate something my leader said today.  He said that 
we would like to see the Prime Minister take a personal interest 
in this issue.  It is an extraordinarily important issue but we 
never see him anywhere on it.  He can attend the opening of a 
plant somewhere that may contribute a few million dollars to the 
economy but when it comes to agriculture, which has a 
multibillion dollar impact on the economy, he is absolutely 
nowhere to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of things.  I want to first address 
an issue the agriculture minister raised when he spoke earlier 
today.  He said that on average things on the farm are pretty 
good.  As my leader has said on more than one occasion “if your 
hair is on fire and your feet are in a block of ice, on average 
you are doing okay, but it really does not go to the issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that thousands of farmers are going broke today and 
the government has no plan.  It does the easiest thing it can. It 
says that it will put together some kind of a program, and even 
though it will be deeply flawed and will not help at least half 
of the people out there, it can at least say that it is doing 
something.  It has completely failed to deal with the issues that 
are a little more difficult to deal with.  It in fact retreats 
and runs away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with two issues:  European subsidies and taxes. 
I will talk a little about the subsidy issue.  We have seen the 
Prime Minister make extraordinary trips around the country for 
all kinds of things that he should not be doing.  His time should 
be more valuable than that.  We have seen him go on trade 
missions for the photo opportunities so he could stand there and 
sign agreements that were put in place months or years before. He 
just has to get there, get on the bicycle and ride along the 
Great Wall of China for the photo op.  That is what he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be leading trade delegations to Europe.  He should be 
using Canada's privileged place in the world to demand some kind 
of agreement on the issue of subsidies.  What do we get?  We get 
him running around the world as he pursues the photo 
opportunities.  It is an absolute disgrace that he is not 
engaging in a serious way in the debate today given how much is 
at stake and given that half the country, especially western 
Canada, is in a very difficult position right now.  It is 
absolutely disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague argued a few minutes ago, as did my leader earlier 
today and in his response to the throne speech, that the 
government should put together a super committee of cabinet 
consisting of the Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the 
foreign affairs minister and the trade minister to give this the 
priority it should get.  That is a common sense approach 
considering that Canada is a trading nation.  We do depend to a 
large degree on the trade we do with the rest of the world.  We 
have a small domestic population of 30 million people and we 
depend on trade for about 40% of our economy.  We must do a 
better job of dealing with trade issues.  Canada could be doing 
more about the irritants and barriers to trade that are out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of tariffs on beef is one barrier that affects my 
riding.  We have pleaded with the agriculture minister to make 
some very small changes that would allow more American beef to 
come into Canada.  In the spirit of goodwill, we would, as a quid 
pro quo, then expect the Americans to not pursue the complaint 
they have against Canada.  As a result, we would save millions 
upon millions of dollars in tariffs that are being charged 
against live Canadian beef going into the United States. 
What do we get?  We get stonewalling from the government and all 
kinds of reasons why it cannot move quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I distinctly remember that when a law was struck down by the 
courts respecting the wheat board, the cabinet moved within two 
hours to change the law.  However, it cannot change in a few 
months some regulations respecting the import of American beef. 
It is time it quit pretending.  It should take the issue 
seriously because we need it addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about taxes.  We stand in the House 
day after day saying we need to have lower taxes.  The government 
says that it is working on it and it is getting there.  The 
provinces are taking the issue so seriously today that they are 
seeking a meeting with the government because bond raters in New 
York and other places around the world are so concerned about the 
government's high tax and high debt policies that our economy is 
suffering as a result.  We have higher borrowing costs and a much 
weaker dollar because the government cannot get its act together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are arguing that a common sense way to help farmers would be 
to lower taxes.  Every year the farm population spends millions 
of dollars on fuel costs and fuel is 50% tax.  Every year, 
whether or not crops are good or bad, they have to spend a lot on 
fuel because that is what they do.  They have to put the crop in 
the ground.  The government could help immediately by beginning 
to lower the taxes on fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there have been some tough years for farmers in the 
last few years, when they do have a good year they spend an 
outrageous amount of money on income taxes.  Over a 40 year 
period on the farm, I argue that the government takes hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in extra taxes from farmers.  That is 
shameful.  It should be lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe they have high subsidies and high taxes.  In Canada we 
could subsidize every taxpayer by cutting taxes.  We could give 
our people a huge competitive advantage by lowering taxes but the 
government refuses to act.  It continues to spend more and more 
every year and we never do get the tax relief that would help 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the taxes that are embedded in the cost of fertilizer 
and chemicals amounting to billions of dollars over the course of 
a farmer's lifetime spread out amongst all farmers.  We are 
saying that the government should start to reduce taxes so that 
those input costs go down.  If it did, farmers in Canada would 
have a fighting chance, but with this government in place it 
seems like it does not care.  It is falling on deaf ears.  This 
is such an obvious way to help not just farmers but everyone that 
I cannot understand why it does not move to do it immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see instead that taxes are going up.  On January 1 we will 
see a big CPP tax hike and a personal income tax hike because of 
bracket creep.  We will see the small business exemption eroded 
again because of bracket creep.  We will see the $500,000 capital 
gains exemption eroded because of bracket creep, which affects 
farmers. The government is raising taxes when we are already the 
highest taxed country of all of our major trading partners, one 
of the highest taxed in the world and they are still going up. 
That does not help farmers.  That does not help anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must put the effort into ensuring that Canada's 
trade interests are protected.  It is not doing it today.  In 
fact, the Americans and the Europeans are eating our lunch while 
the Prime Minister effectively holidays around the world. It also 
has to start to lower taxes for the sake of everyone. It is the 
fair and compassionate thing to do.

Speaker, I certainly have thought about the comments made by my 
colleague across the way.  He makes it sound as though Canada's 
agricultural sector is really going down the tubes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to him that annual exports in agriculture have 
risen from $13 billion to $22 billion over the last five years, 
the term of the government.  That seems to be quite an increase 
in the amount of production and quite a success story for a major 
section of the economy in agriculture.

guess that was more in the form of a statement.  Does the hon. 
member have a rebuttal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I heard was the 
member denying that there is a problem for so many farmers today. 
Many farmers are going bankrupt.  I wonder if he understands what 
that means on a personal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to represent a rural riding.  Many of the people who 
phone me are completely desperate because of the low commodity 
prices, thanks to European subsidies which my hon. friend failed 
to address, and because they are facing such high input costs, in 
part because of taxes, they simply cannot make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend did not address whether or not those exports he 
referred to meant more profit going into the pockets of farmers. 
Well, of course, the answer is no.  There may be lots of exports 
going out, but if they cannot be done in a way that leaves people 
profitable, how does that benefit farmers?  My friend over there 
is denying reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again the Reform Party continues to confuse people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member continues to say that the government should lower 
taxes and that lowering taxes is the answer to the farm problem. 
At the same time, his leader says that we need a comprehensive 
subsidy to protect our farmers from distorting trade practices 
around the world.  What he is saying is to spend more money on 
subsidies and, by the way, reduce the taxes.  Now let us be 
serious.  The member cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is very 
serious.  We want to see the government re-prioritize its 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government giving billions of dollars in subsidies to 
profitable big businesses every year?  I wonder if my hon. friend 
would answer that.  Companies that are making profits of $200 
million a year are still getting subsidized by the government. 
We are arguing that should not be happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that there should be a trade distortion adjustment 
program put in place that protects farmers from the hurt caused 
by unfair foreign subsidies.  We believe that it should be 
financed to a large degree by farmers.  I do not think anybody 
argues with that.  We want to see a long term program put in 
place that is GATT green and that protects farmers in the long 
run and not this ad hoc, trade distorting approach that the 
government is currently engaged in that ultimately helps one in 
two farmers.  The farmers who do get some help sometimes are 
getting $8 cheques from the government after spending $500 to do 
the accounting for these stupid programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Vaudreuil, the president of the CSD, in Quebec, feels that 
reducing the number of hours worked is a noble principle as far 
as health and safety are concerned.  He is, however, worried 
about its effects on the income of the 900 trucker-owners in his 
association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the rates remain the same, the independent truckers will 
simply be earning less.  This is less of an issue for the 
thousand or so unionized drivers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to settle the income issue, a consultation committee 
must be struck to bring together representatives of industry and 
of the various levels of government.  According to Mr. Légaré of 
the independent trucker association l'Association des 
camionneurs artisans du Québec, the solution in Quebec depends 
on truckers' right to unionize or on the creation of a trade 
association to represent them.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>APEC INQUIRY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has repeatedly denied any personal 
responsibility in the security arrangements for the APEC 
conference.  “I was not personally involved” was his story both 
inside the House and outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in documents obtained by the RCMP Public Complaints 
Commission, Superintendent Wayne May is quoted as saying, “Right 
now the Prime Minister of our country is directly involved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to get a straight answer from the 
government.  Whose story is true?  The Prime Minister's story or 
the one that is now coming out of the APEC inquiry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister gave his position earlier today in 
the scrum just outside the House.  I want to add that the 
commission is being carried out by a very distinguished former 
judge.  It is up to him to run the inquiry, look at all the 
evidence in context and reach his conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, if he is serious about the work of the 
commission, will let the commission do its work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberals have answered a thousand times before to 
let the commission do its work.  The commission has done its work 
and it has produced a story which is a complete contradiction of 
what the Prime Minister has said and what he has said in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is so determined to stick to his claims of 
innocence, will he repeat his story under oath in front of the 
APEC inquiry in Vancouver? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the premise of our hon. friend's question is not valid. 
The commission has not ruled on these documents.  They have 
simply been entered into the record before the commission.  It is 
up to the commissioner to weigh them along with everything else 
before the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, and I will end on this point, it will be up to the 
commissioner, Mr. Justice Hughes, to decide how to manage the 
hearings of the commission.  It is not up to the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the security arrangements at the APEC conference were 
prejudiced by the Prime Minister's concern that Canadian students 
might embarrass some foreign dictator.  He was prepared to 
suspend the democratic rights of those students rather than 
embarrass a foreign despot.  His response when things turned ugly 
was a few pepper jokes and deny, deny, deny any responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask again.  How does the Prime Minister explain the 
discrepancy between his story and the story that is coming out of 
the APEC inquiry, if in fact he is telling the truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, Oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order. Colleagues, we are coming very close 
now so please, let us back off just a bit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think members of this House and Canadians will reject 
the sleazy innuendo in the hon. member's question. Furthermore, 
if the hon. member wants to be taken seriously, then his question 
should be based on truth rather than what he is trying to get 
across wrongly in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it turns out that the Prime Minister is not the only one being 
hung out to dry now that we know some of the facts.  His former 
operations director, Jean Carle, gave evidence that contradicts 
the facts that are now in the public domain.  It is not just the 
fact that the Prime Minister squashed Canadians' rights, it is 
the cover up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Jean Carle gave evidence repeating the Prime Minister's 
claim of innocence, was Jean Carle not telling the truth or was 
he just covering up for the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has stated his position inside and 
outside the House.  Mr. Carle has testified as a former member of 
the Prime Minister's staff, as have existing members.  All this 
is before the commission.  What the hon. member says are facts 
adverse to the position of the Prime Minister have not been found 
as such by the commissioner.  Let the commissioner do his work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the reality is that the Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. 
He has repeatedly stated that he was not involved in the APEC 
affair, that he was not involved with the RCMP, yet the 
transcripts of Superintendent Wayne May state the contrary. Is it 
the government's position that Wayne May is a liar? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all I know about the transcripts is what I read in a

the transcripts very carefully.  I do not think they support the 
unwarranted innuendo and insinuation in his question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Kyoto, in 1997, a number of countries, including Canada, made a 
commitment to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learn now that Canada, far from being a leader in this area, 
is adding to the problem and is at the bottom of the list of 
countries with a 13% increase in these emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond its fine speeches on the quality of life, is the 
government intending to take specific measures to achieve the 6% 
reduction objective and how does is it intend to do so? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yes, currently, members of the private sector and of 
various governments are looking together at ways Canada could 
act in order to achieve the level of 6% below that of 1990. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
would like to congratulate the minister, but we have been 
hearing this speech for a long time.  There has been no 6% 
reduction; there has been a 13% increase.  So we are 19% behind 
the objective sought.  This is a miserable performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What specific measures will he propose at the upcoming Bonn 
conference? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, growth in the Canadian economy has increased the level 
of CO2.  It is true we have had considerable economic growth, 
but at the same time, we are now working with the private sector 
to define and establish the best ways to achieve the 6% 
reduction below the 1990 level. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government's lax attitude toward greenhouse gases and its 
inability to make a commitment in the areas under its 
responsibility are yielding disastrous results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government admit that its negative performance in 
connection with greenhouse gases, the significant increase in 
CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, is directly linked to the 
government's spinelessness, to its lack of planning of any 
concrete measures to reduce industrial emissions in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker, the plan we established several years ago is in place. 
We will continue with what we have decided to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add that the period during which the Kyoto objectives 
would be in effect would be from 2008 to 2012.  There are a 
number of years left until then. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
government not understand that, because it caved in to Alberta 
quite simply to get some votes, Canada is in the process of 
gaining the worst reputation on the planet for the reduction of 
greenhouse gases. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the problem to which the hon. member refers is that 
of a rapidly expanding Canadian economy.  On this side of the 
House we take pride in the fact that our economy has performed 
very well.  There has been a great increase in the number of jobs 
in all provinces, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we do have to achieve those Kyoto targets.  We 
fully intend to.  That is why we are working together with the 
private sector and the provinces to make sure we do put ourselves 
on the path to achieve the Kyoto targets of minus 6% of 1990 
levels in the years 2008 to 2012.

<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the 
APEC inquiry today, Staff Sergeant Hugh Stewart takes the stand. 
The question is will Hughie also take the fall? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has not agreed to testify, but let me put the 
question that he would be required to answer if he did. Did the 
Prime Minister ever discuss with any RCMP official the subject of 
the APEC protesters?  If not, how is it that so many police 
officers seem to think he did? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has already dealt with that question 
as recently as this morning outside the House. Also, Sergeant 
Stewart has not testified as yet, at least I have not received 
any reports of his testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the hon. member and other opposition members 
want to have a parallel system of inquiry in the House.  Are they 
trying to undermine the APEC inquiry?  Why do they want to do 
that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians know who the real Sergeant Pepper is.  The reason that 
they know is that RCMP transcripts show the Prime Minister's 
hands all over the grinder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister refuses to answer to this House, will 
the real Sergeant Pepper come forward and volunteer to testify at 
the APEC inquiry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat, there is an inquiry under way headed by a 
distinguished former judge.  He is listening to evidence.  He is 
studying documents. I do not know why the hon. member wants to 
try to undermine his work.  Let the commissioner do his work. 
Why not support the commissioner? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, recent inquiry evidence has left Canadians wondering 
who is telling the truth about security at APEC.  Transcripts 
from Superintendent Wayne May clearly indicate that police 
removed student demonstrators on the Prime Minister's orders. May 
states that there were no security risks but political pressures 
were real. Conversely, the Prime Minister maintains that 
allegations of his involvement are based on no facts at all.  The 
facts are real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister continue his intransigent denials 
over the evidence of three senior RCMP officers who claim the 
interference came from the PMO? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I invite the hon. member to look at the article in the 
<I>National Post</I> which led to all this discussion. If he 
looked at the extracts quoted there from the transcripts in 
question, he might have a different conclusion than the one the 
hon. member alleges in an unwarranted way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if we wanted the Gray line, we would take the bus. 
The preprogrammed responses of the solicitor general and the 
Deputy Prime Minister are getting tired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the mounting evidence that points to direct political 
interference from the Prime Minister's Office and growing 
inconsistencies between him and the RCMP, will the Prime Minister 
himself request to testify at the APEC inquiry, or is he prepared 
to further undermine the confidence and credibility of our 
national police force to hide his own involvement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a matter for the commissioner to decide how the 
commission hearings are to be run.  Let us let the commissioner 
make these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of a bus, it is obvious that the wheels have come off 
the Conservative bus.  If that was not the case, they would not 
be asking these questions that have no relationship to the lives 
of Canadians. The Conservatives, like the other opposition parties, 
must feel we are doing a wonderful job when it comes to the 
economy, when it comes to interest rates, when it comes to 
lowering taxes. Otherwise they would ask questions about these 
matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr.  Speaker, the 
Prime Minister claims he did not directly contact the RCMP.  Yet 
his chief of staff and his chief of operations both visited on 
site to talk with the RCMP about security arrangements. In fact, 
the Prime Minister was scheduled to go along with them to discuss 
those security arrangements and only cancelled that meeting at 
the last moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout his career the Prime Minister has told Canadians that 
the buck stops with him.  Now that it has been proven that his 
senior staff were directly involved with security arrangements at 
APEC, would he have us believe that they were doing this all on 
their own, or is he just trying to pass that buck? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the senior members of the Prime Minister's staff in 
question have testified before the commission. They have answered 
questions fully and freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the hon. member refer to what they had to say.  I 
think if he looks at those answers in a dispassionate and 
open-minded way he will be satisfied with the answers.

The ministry of health sets the standards and the guidelines, the 
Canadian food inspection system monitors and enforces them and 
the ministry of health audits and monitors the work of the

between the ministries to ensure that the food provided to

the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was asked

also affected natural resource areas.  This was his response: 
“In my mind I think it does”.

solution to a very complex issue.  We are working very closely

there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an obligation to bring clarity to the 
Marshall decision.  The Indian affairs minister has refused to 
seek that clarity.  The Marshall decision is bringing significant 
problems to the management of all natural resource industries. 
Thousands of jobs are at stake and the government is turning a 
blind eye.

question posed by the member is very simple.  We in this place 
have had a number of court rulings on aboriginal rights defined 
for us in a very limited way.  It is now the role of governments 
to go to the table and negotiate with first nations what those 
rights would mean in a very modern context, and that is what we 
propose to do.

from Whitehorse.

out of their houses.  He said that he was not aware of a

respond to the comments of the government House leader of 
Thursday, October 21, 1999, concerning my question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the comments of the government House leader in arguing 
that this was not a question of privilege concerned the CSIS 
answer to Question No. 36 on Document No. 17.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government House leader had read further in my 
submission of documents.  If he had he would have seen document 
20 which shows that in responding to question 36, CSIS provided 
an inaccurate answer by not mentioning the 107 press releases, 
newspaper clippings, and radio and television transcripts as part 
of the material that CSIS forwarded to the plaintiff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At document 21, in responding to question 36, CSIS claims that 
videotapes were passed to the plaintiff in response to a request 
from him.  Yet in the plaintiff's own sworn testimony he stated 
“They were provided to me without my asking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At document 22, in responding to question 36, CSIS claims that 
it provided only one CSIS policy document to the plaintiff.  Yet 
in the very affidavit that CSIS was being cross-examined on it 
listed five separate policy documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this one answer CSIS has provided three separate inaccurate 
responses, yet the government House leader would have us accept 
this very same answer as the authority that CSIS did nothing 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of collection of information by investigative 
bodies, I would like to bring the following to the attention of 
the House.  Beauchesne's 6th edition, citation 98, states in 
part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have raised, as a matter of privilege, the question of 
police files being maintained on members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker refused to recognize these as questions of privilege 
unless the charge was specific and unless the dossier referred to 
the individual as a member of parliament rather than as an 
ordinary citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My circumstances are certainly specific.  Not only are we 
aware— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I would like to hear what the hon. 
member has to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not only are we aware that 
CSIS collected my press releases but also newspaper clippings, 
radio and television transcripts of my comments.  I have provided 
the House with a list of 107 such documents that CSIS collected. 
It is also clear that every one of those documents referred to me 
in my role as a member of parliament, not as an ordinary citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1971 in the House the then solicitor general mentioned that 
the RCMP held files on some members of parliament.  A question of 
privilege was raised by Ged Baldwin, the member for Peace River. 
Speaker Lamoureux ruled on April 20, 1971, as reported in 
<I>Hansard</I> at pages 5071-2, that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it would be imprudent of the Chair to project the question of 
police files beyond the circumstances or conditions raised by 
the...member and beyond the particular circumstances alluded to 
by the minister in his reply. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he went on to state that the matter was very serious 
and if any special circumstances were brought to the attention of 
the House and the Chair to the effect that members were in some 
way intimidated in their work or prevented from discharging their 
duties freely and without hindrance, there would be no hesitation 
in recognizing the matter as a breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contend that the circumstances in my case are exactly the type 
of special circumstances to which Speaker Lamoureux referred.  I 
remind the Chair that when that incident took place CSIS did not 
exist but was in fact the RCMP security service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus I suggest that there is precedent that the mere collection 
of information by the police or similar agency is sufficient to 
find a breach of privilege.  However in my case there is so much 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments the government House leader stated that the CSIS 
disclosure of information was not improper.  He made no reference 
to section 19 of the CSIS act which is found at document 9 and 
specifically prohibits unauthorized disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also failed to refer to section 3.7 of the chapter on conduct 
in the CSIS human resources policy manual, which is document 10 
and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees must not support or oppose any person, organization or 
product by using information obtained through their employment by 
the Service, except when authorized by the Director.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader did not even attempt to defend the 
CSIS abandonment of the non-partisan role of the public service 
by taking an active role in the preparation of a lawsuit against 
a member of parliament, including having its legal counsel 
provide the plaintiff and the plaintiff lawyer with advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor did he attempt to defend CSIS for its efforts to frustrate 
my ability to resolve the lawsuit by misusing its extraordinary 
authority to protect national security and by being twice 
sanctioned by the federal court for misconduct and deliberately 
misleading the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government House leader says I should take my 
complaint to the Security Intelligence Review Committee just like 
any other Canadian.  However in my role as a member of parliament 
I am not just like any other Canadian.  Members of this House and 
the House of Commons in Great Britain have for centuries 
recognized the need for members of the House to protect their 
rights and privileges if they are to carry out their duties in an 
effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Sauvé confirmed the need for such protection in 1983 
when she found that there was a prima facie question of privilege 
when a newspaper accused a member of a criminal offence.  The 
parallel to this case is that there was another avenue open to 
that member, namely the courts, and in my case the government 
House leader is suggesting that I have SIRC available to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her decision of March 22, 1983, as reported in <I>Hansard</I> 
at pages 24027-8, Speaker Sauvé found that the authorities and 
precedents agreed that even though a member can seek remedy in 
the courts “he cannot function effectively as a member while 
this slur upon his reputation remains”.  Since there is no way 
of knowing how long litigation would take, the member must be 
allowed to re-establish his reputation as speedily as possible by 
referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Privileges and 
Elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do indeed have the right to complain to SIRC, it is more 
important for myself, all my colleagues in the House and those 
who follow us that we make a clear statement in defence of our 
rights and privileges as members of parliament.  If we are to 
follow the advice of the government House leader then we are 
abrogating our responsibilities and abilities to protect our 
rights and privileges.  Thus there is absolutely no reason why we 
should feel compelled to defer the protection of our rights and 
privileges to an outside body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the defence of our rights and privileges can only be 
accomplished with your finding a prima facie case of privilege 
and/or contempt, Mr. Speaker, and I urge you to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member.  Now I will 
deliberate on all the facts that have been put before me and I 
will come back to the House.

taxed like all other Canadians and will feel the impact of any

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure of the answer 
to your question.  At the time of submitting the bill to be 
reinstated or to be submitted to the House, another member had 
taken the bill as it had been as his own.  As a result the 
private members' drafting office had to make some minor changes 
to make the bill somewhat different but effectively the same 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill prescribed the actual language of a health 
warning label.  In the bill that I could only table in the House 
I had to yield that it would be the minister who would designate 
the language in the bill. The essence or substance of the bill is 
that health warning labels be required on the containers of 
alcoholic beverages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the hon. member suggesting that 
another bill in the same form as his old bill has been introduced 
in the House already this session? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  The member submitted it 
to the private members' office and never has tabled it at first 
reading.  Therefore, because of the date and the timing, I was 
unable, or they refused to allow me, to have that bill because 
another member had put it in the morning before I did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps I could make a suggestion 
to the hon. member and to the House that would solve the problem, 
if there would be agreement. If the hon. member would seek 
unanimous consent to withdraw the bill he has just introduced 
now, he can always reintroduce it at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly with some consultations with the clerk, the bills could 
be compared and perhaps we could come up with an answer for him. 
Is it agreed, if the member is willing, that he withdraw the bill 
by consent, without prejudice of course to his right to 
reintroduce the bill another day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is only one bill and 
it is the bill that I have tabled.  The other bill exists but it 
has never been tabled in this place. If I withdraw it, then this 
bill does not exist on the order paper and I would be left in 
limbo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the House to reinstate a bill that was passed at 
second reading during the last parliament, had full public 
hearings and never had an opportunity to come back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The only alternative is to put the 
question to the House.  Is there unanimous consent to reinstate 
the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, for many months now I have been presenting petitions from 
the people of Peterborough who are concerned about cruelty to 
pets. This concern reached great heights this summer when a dog 
was dragged for one or two kilometres and was very badly hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had letters in which people have been asking for a great 
increase in the penalty for such crimes.  In particular, they 
point out that there is mounting evidence between animal abuse 
and domestic violence. They also point out that our statutes in 
this regard have not changed since 1892 and that they regard 
animals as property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call upon parliament to work toward 
swift and effective action that works to modernize Canada's law 
dealing with crimes against animals and that the penalties for 
such offences be made strict enough to act as a deterrent against 
such behaviour.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I think there was still a little time left for questions 
and comments after my speech but I am not certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member had about 
five minutes.  The best information I have, and I was not here, 
is that the hon. member's time had expired. Therefore, we will 
resume debate with the hon. member for Durham. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to participate in the debate on the motion brought forward by the 
member for Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent many years farming.  Although I cannot claim to be a 
full time farmer, I can certainly sympathize with a lot of our 
farm community, especially those in the west who are suffering 
significant economic hardship today.  I can remember receiving a 
cheque for a grain shipment and wondering why it was that the 
total amount of the cheque did not equal my fertilizer bill.  I 
can imagine that some farmers can take that one step further and 
wonder how they are going to feed and clothe their families based 
on such low income levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed a little about the shape and form of this debate in 
the House today.  I have listened to the members opposite who 
talked about all the things we should do as a government to solve 
this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the pork producers in Durham suffered through the low 
commodity prices for pork just last year.  They had severe 
economic hardship. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things were totally beyond their control, mainly due 
to a high cycle of productivity and the collapse of international 
prices for pork.  The government came forward and addressed the 
issue.  It listened to the concerns of farmers all over the 
country and implemented an AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that there are those who have concerns about the 
AIDA program.  I heard some members opposite talk about the 
problems of making application for these funds and the 
administrative process.  Quite frankly I am surprised by the 
opposition.  It has not taken into account the necessity for 
accountability in our framework.  By that I mean we chose a 
methodology of program delivery that required farmers to use 
their income tax returns in order to prove, to hypotheticate and 
to understand the nature of their income support levels.  I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Chatham—Kent—Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process became somewhat cumbersome.  A lot of people have 
concerns about it.  There is a time delay between cashflow 
problems and when the cheques arrive.  We know of the reverse 
situation where governments got into program delivery where they 
simply wrote cheques and told them later about whether one could 
prove the necessity for or need for the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs are disastrous in and among themselves.  The 
worst thing governments can get into is paying out moneys to 
people with income problems and turning around a year later and 
saying they overcontributed to the program and need the money 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members understand that there are idiosyncrasies about 
the program.  I am sure a lot of farmers are discouraged by the 
fact that they have to fill out these forms.  I have to admit 
that I am an accountant but I have never had to fill them out.  I 
understand their concern with my profession which makes money 
filling out these forms.  I share and sympathize with the 
problem.  It should not be that complicated.  Indeed I do not 
think it is that complicated.  Many of my constituents tell me 
that they complete these forms by themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened today to the Reform Party telling us two or three 
different points.  I cannot seem to reconcile the messages.  It 
was telling us that part of the solution was to form a regime 
that would protect farmers from the disparities of international 
subsidies and subsidy programs.  At the same time it was telling 
us that we should reduce taxes.  It did not take long to 
understand that these two policy choices were in direct conflict 
with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other businesses in the country are subjected to the 
disparities of international subsidies.  I only have to think of 
our aircraft industry, steel imports and many other industries 
with concerns about tariff and unfair subsidies in other 
countries.  It is not within our economic or physical ability to 
protect every interest in the country from distorting trade 
practices in other countries.  As a government and a people we 
could go to countries within the World Trade Organization and 
other forums to argue that we need fairer trade practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly enough, today the leader of the Reform Party and 
the member for Lethbridge, if I recall, talked on and on about 
how terrible it was that the Prime Minister would go on trade 
missions and not be in the House.  The way we deal with these 
trade distorting practices is to go and talk with people in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I was able to go to Taiwan.  At that time I was 
concerned about what I considered to be the unfair trade 
practices of the Taiwan government that favoured American imports 
of beef over those of Canada. 
We talked about how we could find some way to liberalize that 
regime and narrow it for the benefit of our farm community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other speakers have intervened in this issue, but the 
reality is that our exports of agricultural products are at an 
all time high.  Canadian farmers have been very successful at 
producing agricultural products efficiently and cheaply and at 
being able to export them into world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it takes a lot of brains to understand the way 
the world is going if we look at the Asian community.  Quite 
frankly the conclusion is that the world is going into an era 
where it will not be able to feed itself.  Certainly communities 
in Asia and others will not be able to feed themselves.  It is a 
good opportunity for our agricultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue today was about government concern in this regard. 
Strangely enough, suddenly the Reform Party is greatly concerned 
about agricultural issues.  My research tells me that the Leader 
of the Opposition in the last session of parliament never asked 
one question about agriculture and in this session he has only 
asked one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard members of the Reform Party today.  They are very 
concerned about the agricultural plight of the west, specifically 
Saskatchewan, yet the questions were on APEC, about the hurt 
feelings of a few people involved in the APEC inquiry.  Farmers, 
whether in Saskatchewan, Manitoba or Alberta, were the least 
thing on their mind when it came to question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today talking about some of the programs available 
to farmers.  The NISA program has been in place for many years. 
It is a tremendous program where taxpayers attempt to match 
contributions to the fund by farmers to allow them the ability to 
smooth out their income over peak years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the drastic downturn in commodity prices and some of 
the climatic conditions that have impacted on the production of 
agricultural products in the west this system is not adequate 
enough.  When we are designing income support programs we should 
find out where to put the safety net and how much we can afford 
to support the safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Situations occur, whether in agriculture or other industries, 
where there is oversupply and undersupply and a rationalization 
going on in the market.  Agricultural producers in my riding are 
not looking for free handouts.  They are not looking to the 
government to subsidize them, unlike what the Reform Party is 
seemingly suggesting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I went around my riding and asked the farming community 
whether it would would be happy with a program which protected 
them from all things in the world, which is what the Reform Party 
is proposing in the motion, my constituents would tell me no. 
They are big people.  They are very confident they can 
effectively run their farming operations.  Farmers want us to sit 
down at the trade tables to negotiate a reduction in 
international subsidies which gives Canadians the ability to 
compete in worldwide markets.  I suggest that is what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a World Trade Organization meeting coming up in Seattle 
next month.  The government is working very hard at the position 
it will put forward to reduce agricultural subsidies throughout 
the world.  The best we can do for Canadians is not create 
another regime of subsidies and support like the Reform Party 
would have us do but reduce the unfair practices of today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to be quite honest, I am absolutely astounded by the 
hon. member's comments.  He seemed to want to use his entire 10 
minutes of presentation to slam the Reform Party. 
I agree with one point the member made.  Farmers are not looking 
for a handout.  He is quite correct.  I think that is universal 
all across the land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that farmers do not have a level playing field. 
It is fine for the hon. member to talk about taking a strong 
position in the WTO and negotiating it, but what do farmers do in 
the meantime.  That is what the motion is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not the hon. member wants to get out of Ontario and 
face reality, the reality is that farmers are going broke while 
the government talks and designs a program with so much built-in 
accountability that it does not deliver any help to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member not wake up, smell the coffee and 
understand what is happening on farms in western Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me tell the hon. 
member a bit about reality.  First, the people of Ontario have 
gone through tough times in the past.  Second, we do not start 
equalizing tariffs by saying that we will increase ours.  That is 
not a negotiating tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any sense to say we want them to reduce their 
tariffs and the way we will get them to do it is to increase 
ours.  Quite frankly that is why we have had a long and heavy 
international regime of high tariff laws.  As we put up ours 
somebody else puts up theirs and by the time we are all through 
we are all worse off.  That is the plan of the Reform Party.  It 
is just a no-brainer.  It has not worked in the past and it will 
not work in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too am astounded the Liberals cannot see there is a 
real contradiction in what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite asks how we can subsidize everybody that 
deals in the international marketplace.  I think the member has a 
big blind spot.  Reduce the tax burden on all Canadians including 
farmers and the government will not have to subsidize farmers and 
other businesses.  Our high taxes built right into all the input 
costs like fuel, fertilizer, chemicals and capital expenditures 
can be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the member.  Would he not agree that a tax 
reduction would help increase the bottom line for all farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand what the 
hon. member is saying about taxes on input costs within the 
farming operation.  We all know that the biggest tax cost is 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Reform Party is telling me how irrelevant it 
really is.  We are talking about people who are losing their 
farms, not making any money and obviously experiencing huge 
losses, and the Reform Party is arguing that we should have 
income tax reductions.  It does not make any sense at all.  It is 
ludicrous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say.  It 
is my understanding that we are going into the WTO negotiations 
in a very different way this time and that in fact the government 
and various commodity groups have got together at least for the 
initial position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague care to comment on how he thinks that will 
affect the outcome of this round of negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member very 
much for his intelligent question.  Clearly trade agreements take 
some time to evolve.  The way we do that is through compromise 
and conciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role that the government has now taken, as the member 
suggests, to enter into a pre-consultation process to try to get 
some agreement on how it can move forward is the only intelligent 
way to deal with the distortion issues the Reform Party talks 
about.  Creating a regime of new tariff laws within Canada is not 
the way to create that conciliatory process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
could not agree more that tariffs are not the answer.  Certainly 
subsidies are not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member.  In areas other than Ontario 
agriculture we recognize that approximately 45% of western 
Canadian farmers may well not be able to farm next year.  Is the 
member suggesting that we simply negotiate the subsidies and the 
tariffs and not worry about those 45% of farmers who may not be 
able to make it into the next year.  If he does not believe that, 
what are the alternatives?

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his government's alternative, other than a very flawed 
AIDA program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks 
about a very flawed AIDA program, but the fact of the matter is 
that the government has ponied up and has put $900 million on the 
table.  As I understand it, of the applications that have been 
made for assistance, over 50% are from the province of 
Saskatchewan which has been the most hard hit by this time 
factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to be all things to all people?  Are we going to 
help every single farmer 100% of the time?  I do not think so. 
In my own riding people who have applied for the AIDA program 
complain that it does not do everything they would like it to do. 
However, I think when they sit back and think about how far we 
expect governments to reach into their wallets, all they are 
really doing is reaching into the wallets of other taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the level of support that we can afford in this country? 
The reality is that we cannot be all things to all people, but we 
can try to do the best we can with the resources we have and I 
think we have been very effective at doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really appreciate having the opportunity to debate 
this very important issue on farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is committed to a strong, healthy, viable 
agricultural sector.  Looking at the sector as whole it is 
exactly that, a strong, healthy and viable sector.  That may 
surprise some people because that is not what we have been 
hearing in the news lately.  One of the things I hope to do today 
is to give my colleagues and those who are listening a better 
understanding of this whole farm issue.  It is very complex.  It 
is not a simple issue, as many people have tried to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the sector is without challenges.  Some 
farmers in pockets throughout our country, in western Canada in 
particular, have had many problems to face this past year. 
Farming is affected by weather and the marketplace, and 
sometimes, as we have witnessed in the past year, both factors 
collide at one time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the farmers' bottom line has felt the impact of a 
whole range of circumstances coming together at one time.  The 
crisis in the Asian and Russian economies and the downturn in 
Latin America caused some markets to shrink.  Declining commodity 
prices and an overproduction of wheat in the world also had an 
impact.  We experienced at the same time difficult flood 
conditions in one region and drought in another.  Needless to 
say, the effect on income to farmers, particularly those in 
grains, oilseeds and hogs, was severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has responded to that 
situation and is continuing to work to put the tools in place to 
assist the producers, especially those who are most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of tools which were put in place by this 
government to help producers through difficult times, as the 
minister of agriculture has pointed out in his remarks.  However, 
often the challenges farmers face throughout the country are as 
diverse as the commodities they produce.  As the Minister of 
Finance said in his budget speech earlier this year, a government 
that pretends it can be everything to everybody is a government 
that in the end will do nothing for anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a government can do is create conditions for a productive 
and competitive agricultural sector as a whole.  That is what 
this government has done and that is what this government will 
continue to do.  While doomsayers would have us believe that 
there is a crisis in Canadian agriculture, overall and across 
this great nation the agricultural sector is strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall Canadian farmers are among the most productive and 
efficient in the world.  Farm production has been going up and so 
has farm net worth.  Overall farmers have adjusted to constantly 
changing international markets.  Their success is obvious when we 
look at our export numbers.  Agricultural exports have risen from 
$13 billion to $22 billion over the last five years and even with 
the economic challenges of this past year they will be up 
slightly from 1997, which was a record year.  Horticultural 
crops, special crops and red meat all had increases last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is most important to growth in this sector.  About half of 
the average farm gate income to Canadian farmers is the result of 
trade. 
That is why the government is working on the international front 
to bring order and stability to world markets and to provide 
better access to world markets.  Despite the commodity market 
challenges, the outlook for Canada's agriculture and agri-food 
sector is positive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our industry has also met the evolving demand for specialized 
processed products.  Our exports of value added products are 
surging.  In fact, they grew by almost 9% last year.  Processed 
goods means processing plants and jobs, jobs that add to the 
sustainability of our rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry itself has a lot of confidence in its own 
capabilities.  Already Canada has about 3.3% of the world's 
agri-food trade.  The Canadian Agri-Food Marketing Council, or 
CAMC, has set a goal to increase that to 4% by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CAMC, which is made up of agriculture and food representatives, 
has also set a target of increasing processed agricultural 
exports over and above bulk commodity exports.  By current 
indicators, there is no reason to think the goal will not be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our supply managed commodities are faring well.  Farm cash 
receipts for chicken, for example, went up about $250 million 
from 1995 to 1998 and were about $1.3 billion last year.  Egg 
receipts have increased slightly, while dairy receipts grew by 
$299 million to close to $4 billion for that same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, for many commodities that have been affected by 
weak prices there are signs of gradual improvement, with 
indications that prices have hit a cyclical bottom.  Red meat is 
doing extremely well and feedlot levels are at an all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst situation a farmer can experience is foreclosure.  It 
is the last thing anyone wants to see happen.  Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada provides a financial review to producers through 
the farm consultation service and, for a stay of proceedings, 
financial counselling and mediation through the farm debt 
mediation service.  These services have been extensively 
communicated to producers and creditors.  While there is some 
increased activity at this time under these programs, 
applications are not at a high rate across Canada.  Fortunately, 
we are not seeing thousands of producers experiencing financial 
difficulty, although there are reports which say that is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada knows how important the agriculture and 
agri-food sector is to Canadians in general.  The Canadian 
agriculture and food industry accounts for close to one-tenth of 
Canada's gross domestic product.  It employs 1.8 million people 
either directly or indirectly.  I would say that is a pretty 
solid business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an industry that is varied and offers many interesting 
careers for young people.  While we know the hard work of 
Canada's farmers helps to drive the entire economy, it is 
becoming more obvious that there is a wealth of other rewarding 
and worthwhile paths available to young people in this sector as 
well.  Graduates from Canada's agricultural colleges and 
universities have jobs lined up before they graduate and there 
are even signing bonuses for some who are graduating.  This is 
another sign of an industry that is strong and growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a worldwide reputation in agri-food products.  It is 
unsurpassed anywhere in terms of high quality and safety.  No 
matter where we go in the world, when people see a label with the 
red maple leaf, it is recognized for its quality, which is second 
to none.  We continue to build on that reputation with team 
Canada missions and exhibitions at international food shows and 
by attracting buyers and investors to Canadian industry as we 
will be doing when we host the North American Salon international 
de l'alimentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture and agri-food industry has gone through a great 
deal of change over the last decade and has proven over and over 
again that it can meet the challenges and tackle the 
opportunities presented to it as it moves forward in the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain areas of the overall sector that are facing 
difficult times and the federal government is providing those 
producers with the tools to overcome these difficulties.  Success 
is not a solo effort, nor is failure.  By working together, the 
industry and all levels of government, this industry will 
continue on a path of growth and success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the hon. member speak, I thought to myself that if I 
was looking for a career what I would do is go into agriculture 
and start farming.  It is the growth industry of Canada according 
to the hon. member.  Egg production is going up and the price is 
going up.  It is all the way down the line.  Red meat is better 
than it has ever been.  It is just a wonderful, rosy picture. 
How can the hon. member make statements like that when there is 
all kinds of evidence to the contrary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the people who are representing the farmers of 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta.  All of them said 
that these people are in trouble, and this gentleman has the 
audacity to tell us that they do not have a problem, that there 
is just a bit of a problem here and there in isolated little 
pockets.  We are not talking about isolated little pockets; we 
are talking about an industry that is in trouble in very many of 
its areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly what is the hon. member trying to tell us about 
agriculture?  Does he believe there is a problem, or does he 
believe there is not a problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out early in 
my comments, oftentimes there are disastrous issues that happen 
in pocketed areas of Canada.  I also mentioned the difficulties 
which western Canada is experiencing today.  There is no question 
that we have a sliding of price in the commodity market and there 
is no question that they have had difficult weather to deal with 
over the last year.  However, let us not say that a whole 
industry is in trouble because of one sector of that industry. 
What I am trying to say is that Canada's agricultural industry is 
steadily improving.  There are opportunities for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a tremendous number of dollars in 
agriculture and people are working very well.  As a matter of 
fact, it is difficult to find agricultural workers in my riding. 
We are looking for more and more workers all the time.  There is 
a strong element of agriculture in the country.  The unfortunate 
part is that colleagues across the way narrow their perspective 
to look at one very small issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not underplaying the fact that it is important to those 
people who are affected; I am underlining the fact that members 
opposite do not look at the entire picture.  They only look at a 
very narrow section of Canada.  They have not spoken of Ontario 
in the time they have been talking today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, through the AIDA program I think we have seen some 
very significant payouts to other parts of the country, excluding 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  I suppose that AIDA provides farmers 
in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada with some substantial 
subsidies, but we have a huge problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Chatham—Kent Essex may not know this, but 
in western Canada approximately 46% of our farmers are grain and 
oilseed farmers who may not be in business a year from now 
because of the policies of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member share with us the secret with respect to 
the AIDA program that pays such great amounts of money to farmers 
everywhere except in Saskatchewan and Manitoba?  Why is the AIDA 
program targeting and persecuting farmers in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba while helping farmers in other parts of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it should be 
stated here and now that those agreements which have been worked 
out with the federal government, the provincial governments and 
the producers are in place to help producers.  There is 
absolutely no question that it is not just the federal government 
which is part of the AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food in 
this House announced $900 million for the farm community.  As I 
understand the facts, another $600 million will come from the 
provinces.  As a result, $1.5 billion will go into agriculture 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, as one of my colleagues pointed out to me, that 
very close to half of that money will go to the western province 
of Saskatchewan.  The reality is, there are large payments and 
there is support going to western Canada.  There is no question, 
that is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people can say that what is being sent is not enough, 
and that is reality.  However, it is a fair amount of money if 
one stops to think about $1.5 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have an entire presentation that could probably take 
all afternoon if I really wanted to do justice to this issue. 
Unfortunately, I know you are not going to allow me that kind of 
time to address this issue that seems to be of such little 
importance to the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, sitting here and listening to the presentation by 
the hon. member for Chatham—Kent Essex who just spoke, one would 
think that there is no problem.  At the culmination of his 
presentation he had the audacity to say that there is just a 
little wee problem in one part of the country.  That little wee 
problem happens to be the breadbasket of Canada.  It happens to 
be the western prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says it is not an entire industry that is affected by 
these low commodity prices, just little pockets here and there, a 
little wee problem that the opposition seems to be narrowly 
focusing on to quote the hon. member, I cannot believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an entire industry.  Wake up over there. It 
is an entire industry called the grain industry.  It is all the 
commodities in the grain industry that are affected by these low 
prices because the government has not done its job in defending 
farmers at the WTO in the trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to be a farmer, unlike the hon. member who is sitting 
across the way laughing about this problem.  I am sure that is 
going to be comforting to farmers in western Canada.  Farm 
families that are faced with losing their farms right now would 
be comforted to hear him laughing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is many members in the parties on this side of the 
House used to be farmers.  I know there are a few on the other 
side as well and they should understand and empathize with this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure this fall of actually spending a couple of 
days in therapy.  I spent a couple of days running a combine and 
helping to harvest on my brother's farm in the Peace River 
country in British Columbia.  It was therapy from this unreal 
world that is Ottawa to get back to the farm and actually sit in 
a combine and do something productive for a few days, unlike what 
the government is always trying to do which is totally 
unproductive from the viewpoint of the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to run a truck for a day or two and haul 
grain for the elevators.  Farmers are usually very upbeat during 
harvest time.  They are very optimistic people.  Despite all that 
mother nature can throw at them, despite everything that is 
beyond their control, usually they are very upbeat especially at 
harvest time.  Harvest time is usually paycheque time after an 
entire year of energy, effort, blood, sweat and tears that goes 
into farming.  That is usually when farmers get some return for 
the fruits of their yearly labour, which is really a labour of 
love, a love of the land, but that return was not there this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government hold out? It holds out speeches like 
the one we just heard from the member for Chatham—Kent Essex 
that downgrade this whole issue and say that it is not a problem 
at all, that it is addressing the issue in the small pockets 
where it is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to be very small comfort to the farm families of 
western Canada who face losing their farms right now.  They are 
looking for some small ray of hope from their government in 
Ottawa, some ray of hope going into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this issue today, I want to interrupt my remarks 
to quote verbatim a couple of letters I have received from two 
farmers in the Peace River country.  One is from north Peace and 
one is from the south in my riding of Prince George—Peace River. 
The farming and agricultural area of the riding is split by the 
Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that harvest is done I wanted to drop you a line and let you 
know how things are.  This was our 11th harvest, we had decent 
wheat and canola and the barley yield was down a bit.  The 
problem, as you know, is the prices.  When we sat down this 
spring and made up our seeding plans, canola was at almost $9.00, 
now it is below $6; barley was up to $2.25 but it has dropped 
back to $1.65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of volatility makes it very difficult to make our 
cashflow work properly.  We end up living on our line of credit 
almost year round.  I know people say you should contract for the 
prices when they are high, but we had no harvest in 96 and 97 and 
the thought of having to make up the shortfall in contracts that 
a person could not deliver on as well as the blow of no harvest, 
keeps us from being too anxious to contract grain we have not 
grown yet. We do enough gambling just to get the crop in and out 
again! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, of course, are enrolled in all the safety net programs that 
are going and in the short term, Crop Insurance and WFIP have 
been helpful.  Crop Insurance has never quite been enough to pay 
the basic input costs on a complete loss.  The 60% ceiling is not 
making it, I think 75 or 80% would be closer to the mark.  As for 
WFIP, it worked well for us for the first year, but it is not 
designed to make up for price disasters, more for physical 
disasters.  Also it does not work if the disaster goes on for 
more than 2 years as the reference margins then get so low that 
you don't generate a claim.  We don't have enough cash to put 
more than our allowed minimum in NISA so it is taking a long time 
to build up enough of a cushion to have any kind of saving effect 
on a farm our size (1,600 acres). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, it is quite discouraging that we can be doing our 
job to the best of our ability and coming up with a good product, 
that we then have no control over the price that we get for that 
product.  All other businesses that I can think of have a profit 
margin built into their product that reflects the cost of 
producing that product and allows for some profit to build your 
business and to live a decent life on.  Why is this not the case 
in Farming?  We are hoping that since you've been in the 
business, you'll understand our concerns and be able to put them 
forward to the people who might be able to get things changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Peace River grain farmer I continue to be a survivor of 
Canada's cheap food policies.  Other farmers have not been so 
fortunate.  I feel that my energies are subsidizing my urban 
cousins as statistics show that Canadian consumers pay only 10% 
of their income on foodstuffs.  This is the lowest in the world. 
Citizens of other countries pay 15% up to 100% of their income to 
eat.  This means that Canadian farmers have given Canada the 
highest standard of living in the world.  How can I continue to 
compete with the American and European treasuries who are causing 
our unrealistically low grain prices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in June 1988 I sold barley for $3.00/bushel, while 
today the price is a paltry $1.71/bu.  We farmers have invested 
in new technologies and methods to be more efficient and to grow 
a quality safe food product for consumers.  For the past 10 
years, my yearly reward has either been a negative or minimal 
return.  There have been increased machinery costs—new combines 
now cost 1/4 million dollars.  Other inputs have also increased. 
Fertilizer and herbicides continue to increase.  Diesel fuel 
alone has increased 11 cents/litre since Jan/99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Directed proactive strategies are needed immediately to allow 
our vital food producers to survive.  If we can't receive higher 
prices then give us lower input costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am requesting that your party urge the Government to: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1)  Reduce or eliminate all indirect and direct taxes from all 
farm inputs, i.e., fuel, fertilizer, machinery, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2)  Provide tax incentives for farmers to invest in new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3)  Get tough at the WTO table.  Canadian farmers are losers in 
these power struggles.

</I></B></P><P align=left>5)  Eliminate or reduce the 19 year competition shelter that 
Pesticide companies use to artificially price pesticide products. 
A sheltered period of 3 years would give the companies 
sufficient time to recapture their costs and develop profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6)  Take international initiatives to ensure that international 
companies such as Monsanto are unable to obtain genetic patents 
in perpetuity on plant and animal life systems.  Remember that we 
are members of the Animal Kingdom.

primary food producers.

Speaker, I too resent the suggestion that it is only farmers in 
little pockets of the country that are in financial trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers who grow wheat in Ontario are allowed to export a 
portion of their product outside the Ontario wheat marketing 
board.  Would it not be beneficial for western Canadian farmers 
to export their wheat outside of the Canadian wheat marketing 
board in addition to voluntarily marketing through the wheat 
board if they so wish? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
Farmers are looking for some options or alternatives in addition 
to some short term help to get them through the present situation 
which has seen their incomes drop so drastically through no fault 
of their own.  That is certainly one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically enough, there are government policies in place in 
Canada that pit one area against another, and the way the 
Canadian Wheat Board operates in western Canada is one of them. I 
have had personal experience with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother and I operated a 3,000 acre grain farm in the Peace 
River country. For a few years we tried to market our own grain 
on the other side of the Rocky Mountains.  We used to truck the 
grain over there ourselves.  After doing some research, we found 
out there were small areas of British Columbia on the other side 
of the Rocky Mountains that were outside of the Canadian Wheat 
Board area which got to sell their wheat directly to milling 
companies. They had the advantage of the domestic price which was 
considerably higher than what the Canadian Wheat Board would pay. 
Yet if we tried to do that with our wheat and trucked it down at 
our own expense, it would be illegal and we could be fined and 
charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one area in which the government can look at making some 
changes.  We have certainly advocated that for some time.  Yet we 
see the government is unwilling to give farmers the tools they 
need to help themselves.  That is why it is ironic that the 
member for Chatham—Kent Essex was adamant in talking about 
giving the industry and producers the tools to do the job. In so 
many ways the government has proven to be reluctant to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak to this very important issue.  I am very 
disappointed in what I have heard so far from the members 
opposite.  I hope they will pay more attention to the debate and 
offer some useful input as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is very serious.  It is not something that 
affects a few people in the hinterland of western Canada. This 
affects most of the farmers and certainly all of the grain 
farmers in western Canada.  Hog farmers have gone through 
extremely difficult times.  I know it also affects farmers in the 
rest of Canada.  I cannot understand the attitude of the 
government when it comes to not treating this issue as a serious 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rent my farm out on a crop share basis. I understand very well 
what the markets are like.  I have my income to offset losses 
from my farm but a lot of other farmers do not have enough off 
farm income to offset their losses.  These losses have been 
ongoing. In some cases farmers have been feeling them for years, 
especially in cases where there has been flooding year after 
year, as the member from the Peace River country referred to, or 
in cases of drought as there has been in the area I am from. 
Farmers are not asking for handouts.  They are not looking for 
money from the government just because things are difficult. They 
are looking for fair treatment.  They want the government to take 
serious action to deal with the trade issues that are so 
dramatically depressing prices.

this issue, but what have they really done about it?  They say 
one thing and do quite another.  They really should be ashamed at 
the way they are looking at the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to stand here today and say that the Liberals 
are doing a good job but it simply is not true.  I also cannot 
see that they really care a lot about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about the situation right now so that 
the Liberals understand it.  We understand it well.  It is such 
serious situation that in Saskatchewan alone farmers will 
experience losses of $50 million this year.  That means there 
will be no profit.  They will not even have enough money to cover 
their year to year expenses, let alone make payments on the land. 
This will be the situation in many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is particularly serious in western Canada.  It 
less so in Ontario and in the rest of the country but I believe 
it is still serious.  The reason it is more serious in western 
Canada is that Ontario has the GRIP which is still in place and 
is much richer than it ever was in western Canada.  It was given 
special treatment from the start.  I do not say this by way of 
attacking Ontario farmers.  They have done their work and this is 
what they wanted.  They fought for it and were successful. 
However, the government seemed for some reason to give this to 
the farmers from Ontario where it would not give the same thing 
to farmers in western Canada.  It clearly viewed farmers from 
western Canada with less seriousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supply management, which is more prevalent in central Canada, 
fixes prices based on cost and for that reason farmers will not 
suffer as much in Ontario.  It is a serious situation that I 
recognize in Ontario and the rest of the country as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at the current situation, it is important to look 
at how the situation affects people.  It affects farm families. 
It affects small town business people who depend on what farmers 
earn to make a living themselves.  It affects people right across 
western Canada and stretches right into the major centres of 
western Canada:  Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and 
Winnipeg.  The impact is felt even in those larger centres.  We 
are not talking about a few people.  We are talking about a very 
serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to when I was a farm economist and worked for 
Alberta agriculture with farmers.  Through the 1980s, I worked 
with dozens and dozens of farmers who were going out of business, 
many going broke.  I sat down at dozens of kitchen tables with 
farm wives and husbands who were in tears and desperate.  Their 
children saw the tears in their eyes.  I thought that once we got 
through this situation it would never happen again.  Sadly, it is 
happening again as I speak and it is because there has not been 
the action that was required on the part of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  Looking at the short term, it put 
in place the AIDA program which farmers say is not going to work 
and the government has to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has raised taxes.  I heard a previous member say 
“Why are you talking about income tax? If you do not make any 
money you do not pay income tax”.  Where is his head?  There are 
taxes on everything these people buy.  It drives prices up. Taxes 
account for half or more of fuel costs. I cannot believe a member 
would say something like that when talking about the tax load. 
They just do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New user fees have more than doubled since the government has 
been in place.  The government dumped the freight subsidy, with 
little compensation.  Nothing was put in place to help deal with 
the situation. 
It has actually limited marketing options and has done nothing to 
reduce the red tape.  It has in fact increased it.  It is a 
shameful record.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Reform propose?  The House will know it is a top 
priority issue with Reform by the number of debates we have 
called for, the emergency debates we have called for, the supply 
days we have used to discuss the subject for a committee and all 
the other work that the Reform MPs have done.  I guess one would 
expect that from a party that has more than 20 members of 
parliament who either right now have direct connections with a 
farm or have owned farms and farmed in the past.  It is a serious 
issue with us but we do not see the same level of commitment to 
the issue from the member's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform is proposing is much more substantial than just 
talk.  Starting in 1990, I was a member of the first Reform 
agriculture task force, along with the current leader of the the 
new United Alternative in Saskatchewan.  We were among seven 
people who were committed to making things better for 
agriculture.  We called for the elimination of the Crow subsidy, 
but we called for part of the capitalized value of the Crow.  We 
were looking at maybe $3.5 to $4 billion, maybe half the 
capitalized value of the Crow, to be put into what we called a 
trade distortion adjustment program which would compensate 
farmers for damage done due to unfair trade in other countries 
around the world.  This is not talking about handouts, just fair 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called for a trade distortion adjustment program since 
coming here literally hundreds of times in the House and in 
committee.  We have explained what it is.  We have encouraged the 
government to put this in place but it is not going to happen. I 
have given up trying to pretend the government is ever going to 
fix the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had that program been put in place, farmers would not be in the 
situation they are currently in right now.  Liberals usually are 
good at stealing the concept and talking about good ideas. 
Unfortunately their flaw is that they do not implement the good 
ideas completely.  This was a good idea.  I wish to God that 
these people had taken that idea and implemented it.  I am sad 
today that they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as that program, which would have gone a long way to 
solving the problem, when Reform forms government, and I believe 
we will in the next election because the country needs us and 
more people are recognizing that, we will lower taxes and that 
will help farmers in a very real way.  We will lower or eliminate 
unfair user fees.  We are not against user fees as a whole but 
they should be fair and reasonable in the context of the services 
being provided.  We will open up options for western Canadian 
farmers and for farmers right across the country.  We will open 
up marketing options and make the wheat board a voluntary board. 
We will open up options in transportation.  We will make things 
better for farmers because I know the government is not going to.

across the way.  I have actually been listening to his rhetoric 
for the last six years and not much has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform stated in its 1998 <I>Blue Sheet-Principles & 
Policies of The Reform Party of Canada</I> that it was going to a 
phased reduction and elimination of all subsidies and support

</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers' budget of 1995 called for $640 million to be 
saved by downsizing the Departments of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Industry, Fisheries and Oceans, and Natural Resources.  It also 
called for a further reduction of $690 million to be saved by 
cutting other regional and sector specific funding through the 
Departments of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Environment and 
Industry.  It even asked for an additional $1 billion in savings 
by cutting 15% from the overhead cost of all departments in the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have to ask where the member is coming from.  I think 
he is talking through his hat.  We at least, on this side of the 
House, have taken a serious approach.  He is talking about 
renting his land out. I am an active farmer.  I happen to be in 
supply management, which is one of the things the hon. member 
says he wants to do away with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not expect I will 
ever get through to the member.  I have been trying for six 
years, as he says.  Quite frankly, he is not listening.  When we 
talk about reducing subsidies, we are talking about reducing the 
cost of the bureaucracy in Ottawa.  Everyone, including him, 
knows that the bureaucracy should be cut back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about tax reduction, so there is a trade off. 
When some of the subsidies are lowered there is tax reduction. 
That has not happened.  We are talking about opening up marketing 
options so there will be more money for commodities.  Instead, it 
continues to limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, the only way we will solve the problem is to 
eliminate the Liberals.  That sounds like an awful partisan 
statement, and maybe it is, but I am fed up with Liberals who 
either do not understand because they do not want to or 
deliberately make it look like they do not understand what we are 
proposing, as the member has just done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I heard an hon. member across the way say that this 
should be good.  We have of course all become accustomed to any 
time a Reformer stands up in the House, it is indeed quite good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was present in the Chamber this morning when the Minister for 
Agriculture and Agri-Food made his brief presentation and that 
certainly was not good.  It did not hold any hope for farmers in 
western Canada.  They were looking to their minister of 
agriculture going into what promises be one of the toughest 
winters on record and certainly the bleakest look ahead to 
Christmas for farm families in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member comment on some of the facts the minister of 
agriculture laid before the House during his short presentation. 
He talked about the $1.5 billion the government has put together. 
Of course even that is not totally accurate because the federal 
government has only put in $900 million, the rest is from the 
provinces.  He said that $220 million has been paid out so far, 
averaging a little less than $15,000 per farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the wealth of information the hon. member has, both as a 
farmer himself and as a farm economist in his past life before 
getting into politics, can the member tell us what that amount of 
money will do for farms such as it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the agriculture minister 
talks about his $1.5 billion.  That figure really means nothing 
to farmers.  The reality is that after more than a year since the 
minister promised quick action on the issue—and I remember him 
calling for quick action—only $72 million has been paid out in 
Saskatchewan, the province that was supposed to receive a bulk of 
the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister implies that it must be because farmers are not 
bright enough to apply for it or something.  He implies that if 
farmers applied for it they would get it.  He should give a 
little more credit to the farmers in western Canada.  If he would 
understand farmers at all in western Canada he would know that 
they are well-educated people.  They are very intelligent, hard 
working and they understand business.  The minister gives no 
indication that he understands any of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to take part in the debate.  While my 
colleagues are, quite rightly, addressing what the government is 
doing for farmers, I will speak about our commitment to the rural 
communities that are so much a part of our great agri-food sector 
and many other sectors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canada is the backbone of the country.  Rural Canada is 
home to about one in three Canadians.  It is the small towns, 
villages, outports and aboriginal communities that together form 
the backbone of the country.  Rural communities may depend on 
fishing, tourism, manufacturing or resource based industries for 
employment, but in many parts of Canada agriculture is the 
cornerstone of the rural economy of an area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the farm goes so go the implement dealer, the seed and 
fertilizer merchant, the co-op, indeed the whole town, and often 
right back to the steel mills.  Income earned on the farm ends up 
paying for the health, education, recreation and cultural 
services that healthy communities need.  When the farm sector is 
in financial difficulty the whole community suffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in a number of regions in Canada farm families are 
having financial problems.  Some of them are brought on by local 
droughts, floods and other climatic problems.  Other farm 
families are suffering because of the depressed prices caused by 
international trade issues.  Individual farmers have no control 
over these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others in the House have mentioned, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has been working within Canada to shore 
up our domestic farm safety net programs.  He has been working on 
the international stage as well to get rid of the production 
distorting subsidies that are driving prices down.  In addition, 
the federal government is providing support to the agricultural 
sector through its $60 million a year CARD fund, the Canadian 
adaptation and rural development fund.  In so doing we are also 
supporting rural communities that depend on the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the support is helping farmers directly in acquiring new 
production and marketing techniques.  Other support is helping 
develop management skills that can be transferred to off farm 
activities and contribute to the capacity of a community to 
engage in other economic activities beyond primary agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm safety programming and leadership skills developed for 
farming are examples of initiatives that provide significant 
benefits to world communities.  The adaptation programming 
provided by CARD not only strengthens farms and food enterprises 
but enhances the role individuals in the agri-food sector play in 
their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond strictly agricultural related programs the federal 
framework for action in rural Canada has been developed, laying 
out an approach for the government to follow in its support of 
rural communities and the sectors that sustain them.  This 
framework draws on the programs and services available through 
other federal departments and agencies.  The government is 
looking at how we can bring together a range of activities to 
help the farm sector at this time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In three consecutive throne speeches our government has stated 
its commitment to a rural Canada made up of vibrant communities 
and a sustainable resource base.  With rural Canadians themselves 
in the lead we are building a rural Canada where residents have 
access to the tools, information and skills they need to make 
informed decisions and to take full advantage of the 
opportunities for personal community development, a rural Canada 
where citizens have access to science and technology, 
infrastructure and services to be full partners in Canada's 
knowledge based community and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago the governor general put some more flesh on 
commitments that will help bring rural Canada into the 21st 
century.  First, the government will harness the energy and the 
knowledge of our youth, both rural and urban, to help connect 
rural and urban communities to the information highway.  This is 
part of an overall commitment to a knowledge based economy where 
distance is less of a taboo.  Distance will not be a barrier in 
the future.  In the words of the governor general, technology 
enables urban and rural Canadians from the Atlantic to the west 
to the north to compete globally.  In five years we will be the 
most connected nation in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the high technology that will empower the economy 
of the new century.  We will also need the physical 
infrastructure to move people and goods.  The federal government 
will also work with the provinces and the private sector to 
develop and implement a five year plan to improve our 
infrastructure in small, remote and rural communities as well as 
in all cities.  I am sure that very popular upcoming program will 
have the support of all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very tangible commitments for Canadians living in 
rural remote communities.  They fit into a pattern that the 
government has been following since it took office.  We have 
steadily focused on making sure that rural Canadians share in the 
benefits of being part of this great country.  After all, they 
helped make it great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August the Prime Minister appointed a Secretary of State for 
World Development.  Again I thank the Prime Minister for the 
great vision he shared with us. 
This appointment serves as a strong signal of the importance the 
government attaches to rural Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also developed the rural lens to make sure 
the impact of policies and programs for rural Canadians has been 
given full consideration at all levels of the decision making 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One size does not fit all when it comes to developing policy in 
Canada.  The Secretary of State for Rural Development will have 
an opportunity with his cabinet colleagues to ensure the rural 
lens is being applied when policy discussions take place and the 
challenges and priorities of rural Canadians are understood and 
taken into account both in our current initiatives and in our 
long term planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important element of the government's work in rural 
Canada is to ensure rural Canadians see tangible results.  We 
have already started to do some very specific work at the 
community level by introducing a number of pilot projects across 
the country.  So far the Government of Canada has invested $3.8 
million through Canadian rural partnership to initiate 68 pilot 
projects all over Canada.  The CRP funds allowed project 
proponents to lever another $10 million from other federal 
departments and various other sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One project in Saskatchewan, for example, is aimed at developing 
and implementing an alternative to the current grain handling 
system to generate more returns for producers.  The government is 
now assessing proposals for a second round of pilot projects.  I 
am certain it will find other gems to enable rural Canadians to 
continue to make a valuable contribution to Canada's future 
successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the CRP pilot projects the Government of Canada has also 
made great strides in rural communities with the community access 
program, SchoolNet, Community Futures Development Centres and 
Health Canada's office of rural health where Dr. John Wooten is 
the chief executive director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that the choice to live in rural Canada 
should not be a choice that results in reduced citizenship 
rights.  Simply because people live in rural Canada does not mean 
they should have to put up with an inferior level of health care, 
an inferior level of social safety nets or inferior access to 
government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canada is the backbone of a large part of our economic 
wealth.  It is a great place and full of great energy and 
ingenuity.  The resources of the producers of fine food are 
shared with all Canadians.  Healthy rural communities are 
essential to a healthy agricultural food sector.  The government 
is working to build a strong foundation that will ensure the 
future of both the sector and rural Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of parliament to work with us to make the 
future as bright as it can possibly be.  The Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-food has played a very important role. 
Members of the committee from all five parties have worked very 
hard and very well together.  We have much left to do.  I ask for 
all people to co-operate and work together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the Liberal government member refers 
back to supply management.  Who was it that negotiated up to 1993 
article 11 and supply management, changing it from a quota system 
of imports to a tariff system designed to be reduced 
incrementally, eventually eliminating supply management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was that the Conservatives and Liberals, or was it the Reform 
Party that did that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate any 
questions about supply management because I will personally 
defend it the very best I can.  It is working.  We all agree that 
we have the best quality of food and the safest supply of food in 
the world.  It is less expensive today to buy milk or to buy 
butter in Canada than it is in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will fight to protect our producers.  Yes, a 
previous government worked at it but Reform was not there showing 
support for farmers since supply management.  I would ask its 
members to talk to their western colleagues in the supply 
management business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supply management is the only part of the agriculture sector 
that has been healthy each year in the past, and I ask the member 
to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
bothered by one point.  We hear the government say that it will 
provide $900 million for farmers.  That sounds great, but we read 
documentation that says the problem with AIDA as it is currently 
designed is that it denies those benefits to many of the 
producers it was originally supposed to help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As currently designed the AIDA program will not distribute the 
$900 million the federal government committed to farmers over the 
next two years.  It is a fallacy to say that $900 million will be 
provided.  It could be said that $60 billion will be provided, 
but if the program is designed so that no one receives it what 
good is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's $900 
million will be invested in rural Canada and I hope we can work 
toward investing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notify the member and all members of the House that the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, which is well 
represented by members of the Reform Party and of the 
Conservative Party, invited the top officials of AIDA to appear 
before it, I believe, tomorrow morning.  I am sure it will be a 
vigorous session.  I look forward to asking some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday of this week we have invited the ministers of 
agriculture for Saskatchewan and Manitoba to appear before us for 
a limited amount of time.  We want to work with people. Commodity 
prices is a very serious situation, but the situation is 
worldwide.  We are committed to the best we can do for rural 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make a comment on the member's glowing 
infomercial on the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the government's commitment to rural 
communities.  Everyone is to have Internet access, technology and 
all that wonderful stuff.  I am wondering how rural families can 
make use of this technology and all the wonderful things the 
government is to deliver to them when all these towns end up 
being ghost towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think this 
would be the time to share one of my passions, which is spending 
my personal time chasing around the ghost towns of Canada for the 
last 30 years.  I do not want to see any more ghost towns come 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba and Saskatchewan today there are communities that 
are very much at risk.  That is why we invested money into 
community access sites so people could go to the libraries and 
the schools to get the information they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to do the very best we can for our people.  I have 
spoken to many people in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta this 
year.  There is a crisis there that we need to work on.  The 
government caucus has worked on it for several months.  We look 
for the support of the House when we bring forward any new ideas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
speak to the debate this afternoon, although I am somewhat 
reluctant to get involved in it.  From what I heard in the House 
today it has unfortunately turned into a partisan debate. Members 
on all sides seem to be saying that those on the other side do 
not understand the debate or do not care, that somehow it is just 
a western problem, or that the government is only looking at the 
problems of farmers in central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an agricultural area, one of the richest and most 
diverse agricultural areas in Canada.  It is in southwestern 
Ontario and I represent about 90% of tobacco farmers in the 
country.  A number of my farm families and communities have been 
hurt because of the downturn in a certain commodity so I know 
somewhat from where I speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that also knowing there is a major problem in terms of 
this issue.  Farm families across the west, also somewhat in 
central Canada and the east, are really feeling the pinch of some 
of the international problems in agriculture.  I am not sure that 
I buy the argument totally that it is somehow all the 
government's fault or somehow the government is not standing up 
internationally at the trade table to protect Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that some of the actions of countries around the 
world, in particular the Europe and United States to the south, 
with the use of exports subsidies have had a major impact on the 
prices of commodities.  As a result they have had a major impact 
on what farm families are receiving for their products. 
That is only one of the problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a problem of overproduction.  It has always seemed 
funny to me that there can be overproduction in a world where 
people are starving, but it is said that there is overproduction 
of the products that people are willing to buy.  There has been a 
problem over the last couple of years.  It may seem funny to say 
this is a problem, but there has not been a major drought 
throughout the world and as a result there is overproduction. 
There is too much product on the market which has had an 
influence on the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the impact the Asian financial crisis has had on 
different commodities.  It certainly has also had a major impact 
on the price.  The bottom line is that farmers across the country 
are not getting the amount of income from their products that 
they received in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has responded in a number of ways.  As was said 
earlier we have responded by sitting down with the provinces and 
the farm organizations and working out a package of aid for 
farmers.  That was a year ago and I think there is some debate as 
to why more money has not actually gotten into the hands of 
farmers.  That is a legitimate debate.  Certainly people on all 
sides should sit down to figure out why it is that those farmers 
who have needed that money have not gotten the full amount of 
money they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only a problem of getting the funds to the family 
farms at this time.  There is an overall problem that the 
government, I agree, needs to resolve.  We need to do it by 
sitting down with the affected parties and the provinces.  It is 
not just a federal government problem.  The federal government 
sat down with the provinces concerned and worked out AIDA.  I 
would argue that maybe some of the provinces should have put in 
more money.  That is a legitimate argument.  I do not think it is 
totally the federal government's responsibility to do that. That 
is something which is being worked on. It is hoped that when the 
premiers come from western Canada in the next week to sit down 
and talk to the government, they will come up with more money and 
try to figure out a better way to get it into the hands of 
farmers immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the trade side, over the last couple of years we have sat 
down with the provinces, with the industry, with groups in 
western Canada and all throughout Canada to work out a trade 
position.  We hope it will help address some of these concerns of 
export subsidies, particularly with the Europeans and the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strong position which we will be taking to Seattle. We 
will sit down with other countries from around the world and try 
to get them to stop subsidizing their products so that Canadians 
can get better prices for their products. That is the right 
approach.  We have pulled the agricultural commodity groups and 
the provinces together to put forward a strong and united front. 
I think that will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that will not solve a problem in the short term. Within 
the next few weeks the provinces and the federal government need 
to figure out how to get more money into the hands of farmers 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was said earlier mostly by my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party, is that we should not have these trade 
organizations, that we should not have the WTO.  I would argue 
frankly that this is a good example of why we need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a relatively small country in terms of our 
international trade. We face groups like the Japanese, the 
Europeans and the Americans who have large economies.  It is 
difficult for us in these circumstances to sit down on a one to 
one basis and try to get them to stop their subsidies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do that at international meetings, for example at the WTO 
around the table when we have like-minded countries that will 
stand up with Canada and tell the other countries that what they 
are doing is hurting our economies. We have had success in the 
past.  We hope that over the next two or three years at the next 
round of negotiations we will get these countries to stop their 
direct subsidies which are hurting not only our grains and 
oilseeds farmers but farmers in other commodities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say sincerely to all Canadians who are listening that this is 
a problem for farm families.  This is not a cyclical problem 
although as members have said, it always seems to come and go. It 
is more than that.   All Canadians, particularly those who shop 
every day at the supermarket, need to know that Canadian farmers 
are not getting their fair share of the food dollar.  Canadian 
farmers over the past number of years as a result of some 
international practices and other issues have been getting less 
and less for what they actually produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon consumers in this country to get involved 
in this debate.  If they want a Canadian agricultural system, if 
they want food that is safe and which is grown in Canada, they 
will have to get involved and know what the issues are. They 
should also be part of the solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if you will pardon the pun, the member was saying that 
Canada is small potatoes when it comes to international trade. He 
talked glowingly about needing to convince the Europeans and the 
Americans and to use incentives to convince them to give a darn 
about the situation of Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he give us a brief outline of what those incentives would 
be if we are such a small player? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member would have 
to agree that the Americans have an economy that is ten times the 
size of ours and the Japanese and the Europeans, all of them put 
together, are large players.  The only way we can move some of 
these large players is to form with other groups.  An example is 
the Cairns group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international meetings we sit down with a group like that and 
state our interests.  It is in our interest to stop these 
international battles.  When we go to certain meetings, whether 
it is the OECD, the Cairns group meetings or APEC, all the 
countries get together and say “Look, you have to stop this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the ways we can change international policy. 
There are not a lot of things.  We cannot shoot missiles at each 
other, as some of the American friends have been saying.  We have 
to sit down at those international meetings and get a coalition 
of countries to force the larger players to listen to what we are 
saying.  That is one of the main things we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also make sure that when we are giving these arguments we 
are not breaking international rules ourselves.  That is one 
thing we also try to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say that we are being Boy Scouts, that the other guys 
are cheating and that we should be cheating too.  But we are 
trying to stop those people from cheating.  Sometimes what is 
said to be cheating really is not.  What a lot of Europeans and 
Americans are doing is well within the confines of what they have 
been able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for us we are small and the Americans are fairly 
large.  Many times they will take over at these meetings and set 
the agenda.  One way to change that is to get out front first. 
That is what we have tried to do.  That is why having a united 
front, having all the agriculture groups in Canada and the 
provinces all onside with a united position is the best way to 
make a difference internationally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased at some of the concluding remarks 
made by the member opposite. I was pleased to hear him 
acknowledge that there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the member opposite.  It is a 
question people in my riding have been asking me.  Why do the 
people in our cities not recognize the problem that exists in 
rural Canada? Let me explain and the member can have some time to 
formulate his answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the people in Saskatchewan feel that little attention is 
paid to the farm crisis because they are only a small minority of 
Canadians and unless we can demonstrate somehow that this crisis 
on the farms impacts on the people in the cities, the government 
will do very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question they want me to ask the government is:  How can 
farmers get the message to all Canadians that our farmers are 
important to the country, that the problems they have are very 
severe and that something needs to be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time someone sits down to have a meal they thank God, but 
they should also thank a farmer.  It affects everyone in their 
daily lives.  How can we get the message to people in the cities 
to recognize this problem and assist us in the solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one way we can do that is 
by what we are doing now.  We debate the issue and make it more 
public in a non-partisan way to show Canadians that it is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our former colleagues, the hon. Ralph Ferguson, put out a 
study called “Compare the Share”.  He took it upon himself as a 
member to try and put across to the consumers that farmers were 
not getting a fair share of the food dollar.  Things like that 
help.  Not only Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, but other 
government departments, including the rural secretariat and our 
department, are trying to make this more public.  They are trying 
to make consumers aware that it is important to them that we have 
a solid agricultural industry in Canada. We will continue to do 
that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Sackville—Mosquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, Native peoples; the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in western Canada in my constituency of 
Yorkton—Melville life on the farm has become very tough.  Many 
farm families are struggling to get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the incomes in Manitoba and Saskatchewan will drop 
by 98% this year.  Projected net farm income in Saskatchewan for 
1999 will be minus $48 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's lack of compassion and hard-hearted 
attitude is probably in part because it does not see the real 
people behind these statistics.  It sees the numbers but it does 
not see the faces. We hear these numbers day after day, but we do 
not hear how these numbers are impacting the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity in a somewhat different 
way than my colleagues, to pass along some of the comments that 
have been received in my office from families that are struggling 
to get through the worst crisis since the Great Depression.  I 
only hope that the government will listen to these people and 
listen to their stories as I try to represent them here in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about what it is doing for farmers but 
these comments will be clear evidence that it is not.  Here is a 
producer in the northern part of my constituency explaining how 
discouraged farmers are these days: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having great difficulty meeting financial obligations.  I am 
a young farmer who took over a small family farm.  I have cattle 
and my wife works in town as well but it is very difficult and 
stressful trying to make ends meet with two young children. Maybe 
welfare is the answer? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are hardworking individuals who are proud of what they 
do.  When farmers start talking about welfare, we know that life 
is getting very bad on the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a producer from Hudson Bay who is reeling from the 
effects of the farm income crisis: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stress, financial uncertainty, family unrest.  How can one plan 
for the future of their family when there doesn't appear to be 
any future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another quote from a farmer in Kamsack, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myself and three brothers farm 6,000 acres.  We keep 120 cows and 
feed 120 calves all winter.  We work over 300 days a year, half 
of them are 16 hour days.  I am having a hard time supporting a 
wife and two kids.  I have no family life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all real people with faces.  This is not a faceless 
problem.  The family is the one that ends up feeling the effects 
of the current farm income crisis.  This government in its Speech 
from the Throne talked about how it is helping the children of 
this country.  Saskatchewan farm families are not benefiting from 
the government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter from the wife of a farmer in the Kamsack 
area the other day and it touched me deeply.  I would like to 
share it with the House.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband has had to go out and get a job to put food on the 
table and support the family.  He would get up at 4:00 a.m. and 
work on the field till 2:00 p.m. then go to work so he could 
provide for his family.  He couldn't afford to take time off so 
some days he would work around the clock with only one or two 
hours of sleep.  This has deteriorated his health with him losing 
a great deal of weight and he has become so withdrawn trying all 
possible ways to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I love 
him dearly for this but I want my husband back, not a walking 
time bomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had to take a job also and now have to leave my children 
without a mother figure.  This is very hard and I cry every day 
that I leave, wondering if they are okay and if they need me.  My 
baby cries as I leave and I feel terrible to be going, he needs 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My daughter has been having trouble at school and she has a hard 
time adjusting to things around her.  She hears the calls from 
collectors and wonders if we will be okay or not.  She has 
complained of being sick so she can spend time with her parents 
who she misses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son has had to go see a therapist because he knows times are 
tough and he worries about all of us.  He also complains of being 
sick so he can be near us.  Many nights he would be sleeping at 
the foot of our bed.  When asked why, he said I just wanted to 
see my dad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an education fund for our children when the times were 
good but had to remove the money to pay the bills.  Now will my 
children go to college?  I don't know the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all suffering.  Is there anyone listening? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of stories really tug at our heartstrings and they 
put real faces to this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter could have come from a number of families that are 
trying to make a living on the farm.  This is really impacting on 
children as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus should be to create the right environment where the 
family farm can prosper.  Why is it so important to maintain the 
family farm?  If the nation's food production is in the hands of 
a few corporate farmers, those corporate farmers will have 
control over the food supply and will have a great deal of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what a farmer from Carragana had to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protect the family farms first.  If you lose us you will have big 
organized corporations run by chemical and fertilizer companies 
who will be able to unionize globally.  Then you can kiss your 
cheap food good-bye. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe this is an answer to a question I posed earlier.  How is 
this going to impact on people in the cities?  Maybe if they 
realized that this is going to have a severe impact they would 
begin to take notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent said that the Liberals just cannot seem to 
see past their noses and that our children in the future are 
going to suffer because government is not handling our present 
crisis properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister talks about how the government has put 
$900 million into a farm aid package called AIDA.  Very few 
qualify for support under this package.  Why has it been so 
ineffective?  I think it is because the program is designed for a 
drastic drop in income in 1998 when compared with farmers' 
previous three year average.  The problem is that most farmers 
have not had a drastic drop in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farmer from Canora put it best when he said: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I crunched some numbers in various scenarios and nobody in my 
neighbourhood qualified except for one 10,000 acre corporate 
farm.  The only small family farms that qualify are the southern 
durum producers who have just come off three consecutive years of 
all time record high prices and should have some cash resource. 
The small to average farms in the black soil zone who have been 
hanging on by their fingernails the last three years will be left 
to slip into the hole even further. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows the basic unfairness of the way the government 
structured the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to rework this AIDA package and make it so 
that farmers can get some support from the program.  However, 
that is not the entire answer.  Over the last 30 years government 
has mismanaged the entire agriculture sector, which is why a long 
term strategy has to be looked at.  Otherwise we are just going 
to go from one crisis to the next.  I would like to emphasize 
that a long term strategy is really needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farmer from Foam Lake talked about the need for a long term 
solution.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in place of an emergency aid package the government 
should look at the longer term solutions like lowering freight 
rates which is the biggest expense.  Check into prices of farm 
inputs.  Why are the costs rising?  Fuel expenses are a direct 
government responsibility and could be instantly lowered. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot more that I could read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be done immediately.  I emphasize that.  The long 
term solutions such as taxes on inputs can be dealt with 
immediately.  The government has to look at user fees charged to 
farmers, foreign subsidies and the high cost of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This farm crisis has thousands of faces.  Real people are being 
severely impacted by the drastic drop in income caused in part by 
the huge tax burden that is built right into a farmer's input 
costs.  My comments today are to impress on the government that 
it is destroying people's livelihoods.  Behind the statistics are 
many faces; faces of real people.  The government deals with this 
issue as if it is faceless and just another problem.  It is not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
commend my colleague for a very excellent speech.  He told some 
stories which I think are duplicated in all of our ridings.  I 
have had heard of similar situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a phone call from a young married woman who, with her 
husband, is trying to make the family farm work, having taken it 
over from his father.  It was really tough to pay the bills so 
she got a part time job to try to pay the farm bills.  Lo and 
behold, unexpectedly this young lady found herself with child. 
She kept on working at her part time job, helping her husband as 
much as she could on the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came that she could no longer work because of her 
impending childbirth, she applied for employment insurance, to 
which every person in this country is entitled.  This young lady 
was told that because she was part of a farm family and their 
income last year was <I>x</I> number of dollars she did not 
qualify.  She was told that she would not get employment 
insurance.  While everyone else is not asked how much money their 
husband made or how much their partner made when on maternity 
leave, here is a farm family trying to make ends meet, which 
needs employment insurance, and it is disqualified by the rules 
of the Liberal government.  Those stories abound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really want to commend my colleague for bringing that 
dimension to this issue.  It is exactly the kind of story we are 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the member would like to enlarge somewhat on 
the kinds of programs that the Liberal government puts out that 
claim to be supportive of families, supportive of children, which 
in fact run exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I was giving my 
speech I did not intend it to be some partisan rant against the 
government. 
I feel that the government and many people across the country 
have to recognize this problem.  I was trying to portray this as 
a crisis that is impacting on real people and has to be dealt 
with immediately. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague makes a good point.  Farmers are not treated the 
same as other people within society.  They do not qualify for a 
lot of the farm programs that are available, nor do they qualify 
for a lot of the provincial programs that are available because 
of the nature of their business.  Farmers would be the first to 
say “We do not want that.  We want to be treated fairly, the 
same as everyone else”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of farmers do not pay a lot of income tax.  One of my 
colleagues opposite said that if they were paying a lot of tax 
they would be making a lot of money.  They are paying a lot of 
tax, but not income tax.  They have property taxes.  They have 
taxes built into all of their inputs.  For example, when the 
government has a program by which it raises Canada pension plan 
premiums, or uses the employment insurance plan to raise money 
for whatever programs it wants to implement, farmers pay an 
inordinate amount of the rise in that tax.  I am going to call 
them taxes because they are put into general revenues.  They do 
not feel it is fair that they should have to pay that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pay in ways that the public does not realize.  For example, 
they may have a capital cost on a machine they buy.  Every 
company that employs someone pays Canada pension plan premiums. 
However, they really do not pay them.  They pass that cost on in 
the price of the machine or whatever product they produce. 
Farmers have to purchase that.  They have no choice as to whether 
they pay those Canada pension plan premiums that the company has 
to pay.  Built into that particular price is a cost that farmers 
have no control over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government makes a decision to raise Canada pension plan 
premiums or employment insurance premiums, farmers end up paying 
that because they cannot pass that cost on to anybody else.  They 
are caught in the international marketplace.  The prices they get 
for their product are dictated elsewhere.  Other companies which 
subsidize their farmers dump their excess on the world market, 
depressing prices, and farmers cannot make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians do not realize the high amount of tax that 
farmers pay.  The government collects fuel tax.  Farmers pay a 
lot of tax on fuel, as well as fertilizer.  Probably 50% of the 
cost of natural gas is tax.  Certain fertilizers are made from 
natural gas.  Therefore farmers pay that 50% tax which is built 
into the fertilizer they buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to talk about child care and how farmers cannot 
access a lot of these programs.  There are many government 
programs that farmers end up paying for and many Canadians do not 
realize that this is an unfair way of dealing with the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is certainly with mixed emotions that I rise today to 
speak on behalf of my constituents of Battlefords—Lloydminster, 
Saskatchewan regarding the crisis in agriculture which is raging 
across this country, most critically in the west.  In 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba we have seen incomes at an all time 
low.  I say mixed emotions because my constituents are 
increasingly frustrated by all levels of government.  Everybody 
takes a little blame for the seeming lack of understanding of the 
magnitude of this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are angry with governments over the ineptitude they have 
displayed with their pat answers.  It is always someone else's 
fault.  If they wait a little longer the program will work.  It 
has almost been a year and we are not seeing any results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal agriculture minister has told farmers to quit or to 
walk away from farms that have been in a family for generations, 
or to walk away from years of blood, sweat and tears building and 
maintaining a dream that has been in a family forever.  What 
advice to give to farmers who like to roll up their sleeves, get 
in there and solve problems.  What an absolute insult.  I have 
had farmers calling me, saying that this fellow just does not 
understand what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harsh reality is that it is not just the farm families any 
more that are in trouble.  It has gone past the farm gate.  It is 
now encroaching into Main Street, Saskatchewan, into Manitoba and 
other parts of the country as well.  It is affecting all of the 
agriculture related businesses, whether we are talking about 
inputs, farm fuel, fertilizer, chemicals or the seed companies. 
Everybody is starting to feel the pinch as their receivables 
escalate and skyrocket into numbers they have never seen before, 
with no end in sight.

about everybody out there in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this?  Why are we facing this crisis now?  It has been 
building for a number of years.  The main culprit was and 
continues to be an agriculture minister and his government that 
just will not move very far on this issue.  He promised us a 
bankable program by last Christmas.  That is almost 10 months ago 
and to date there are too few farmers qualifying for too few 
dollars to make any difference.  We have heard numbers like $220 
million out of a $15 billion program that has actually reached 
the farmers out there.  It is just a little too late and not 
nearly enough dollars.  Just in the nick of too late is what a 
lot of people are saying out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers that I have talked to are averaging five to six months 
for a response from the complicated forms they have sent in. 
Their accountants are frustrated by filling out the forms to the 
best of their ability and coming up with a number that seems 
acceptable to everyone, only to have it rejected by the AIDA 
committee working with the NISA committee and the Revenue Canada 
committee.  By the time the circle is done and they have jumped 
the hoops and hurdles that are tossed in front of them it is a 
bureaucratic nightmare.  It goes on an on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good percentage of farmers that applied in April and May last 
year are still waiting to receive some money.  They have received 
nothing.  It has certainly been a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bankers in western Canada, to their credit, have been great. 
They have turned out loans and taken interest only payments on 
those loans to try to help farmers stay put.  It is a bit of a 
different story when it comes to farm credit, that old boondoggle 
that was created federally years ago.  They have been a little 
more hardhearted when it comes to tossing farmers off their 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mess is compounded in Saskatchewan because our input costs 
have gone up with the demise of the Crow rate and with a 
provincial government that kind of let things slide a bit further 
than they should have done.  We are seeing a tremendous disparity 
between what the net incomes of Saskatchewan farmers have 
bottomed out and our neighbouring province in Alberta.  It is 
creating quite a controversy out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this crisis in agriculture.  What it comes down to is 
that no one has a magic wand.  What will we do about it?  How can 
we address these issues?  Everybody blames a different villain. 
We had the Asian flu a year ago and markets collapsed.  We have 
European and American subsidies.  We cut but they did not.  They 
have actually increased their funding to farmers.  We have to go 
to the WTO and the GATT negotiations with a little bigger stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a low dollar.  All of our inputs are based on American 
currency.  The fertilizer, fuel, chemicals, farm machinery, 
repairs, everything that comes out of the States and up here with 
67 cent dollars buying it.  Not totally.  A lot of inputs are 
based on American money whether or not they are manufactured 
because there is a lot of that trade back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had both flood and drought in Saskatchewan, opposite 
ends of the scale, which has led to a lot of farmers getting 
little or no coverage by crop insurance because of that multiple 
year problem.  Their premiums have gone sky high and the coverage 
they are able to get has gone way down.  There is no way to add 
or make use of a NISA with negative margins.  New farmers that do 
not have a three year average and so on do not qualify for any 
type of AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A combination of low selling prices for agricultural commodities 
and escalating input costs have put people into jeopardy. There 
are six billion people in the world now.  We had a big 
celebration a short time ago when the six billionth baby was 
born.  There is a tremendous amount of hungry people out there. 
We grow great product here.  It is safe.  It is ready to go to 
market, ready to be used, but we cannot seem to find buyers for 
it even with a 67 cent dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that a low dollar was great for trade. 
We do not see that stimulant adding to Canadian exporters. It 
just failed to deliver anything out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that has added to the situation is an agricultural 
system that has been in transition.  Farmers followed the 
buzzwords of the government.  They diversified, changed the way 
they did things, upgraded, worked the land a little differently 
and so on. They are extremely vulnerable at this time.  A lot of 
people made those changes and were kind of caught in a catch 22 
situation with payments to make on the new way of farming and no 
commodity prices to support it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do?  What can governments do?  In the short term I 
guess we have to prop up Canadian agriculture with a subsidy, 
cash in hand.  It is the only way to get everybody back to the 
starting line.  Canadian farmers are starting out a relay race 10 
yards behind everybody else, so we have to give them some cash in 
their hands to get them back to the starting line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at tens of thousands of jobs that can be 
affected because agriculture is definitely a primary industry. It 
affects everybody on the input and on the purchasing sides.  We 
need an aid program that delivers cash, not platitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program should be simplified.  I know that goes against the 
grain of a lot of government bureaucracies that like to control 
everything to the end, but we have to simplify it.  We have to 
get the money out there in a timely fashion.  No more studies. No 
more excuses.  Let us just get it done.   We have Christmas 
coming up again and I would hate the agriculture minister to be 
the grinch two years in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-term let us rethink government involvement in 
agriculture.  Taxes on input costs are exorbitant, as the last 
member talked about.  The major input cost of a lot of 
fertilizers is natural gas and 50% of that is taxes.  Last year 
the fertilizer institute talked about 20% of its costs being 
government taxes on its product.  All that comes off the bottom 
line of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what taxes on fuel amount to.  Some $5 billion or $6 
billion a year.  A lot of that is coming right out of the pockets 
of farmers.  These are not profit generated taxes, much like 
property tax.  In Saskatchewan we have seen property taxes go up 
by 52% in the last little while and the bulk of that is paid by 
57,000 farmers paying two-thirds of the property tax.  We have to 
look at the way that is done.  Interprovincial barriers to trade 
should be removed.  Another $5 billion disappears from people in 
the west every year because of trade barriers that we have 
developed between the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the longer term I guess we have to take a bigger stick to the 
next WTO and GATT negotiations.  We cannot and should not 
tolerate unfair subsidy practices.  They are killing us here at 
home.  We have to go with more people, with a bigger group, to 
get our ideas across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get serious about implementing value added processing in 
the prairies.  We have seen freedom of choice on marketing and 
delivery of our products being non-available to people.  The Crow 
rate is gone but we did not see deregulation.  This government 
and the provincial governments must look at all existing programs 
and propose changes and updates to and based on what is in the 
best interest of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm families are hardy.  They are good pioneer stock.  They are 
adaptable folk.  They have a proud heritage of standing up to the 
challenges, rolling up their sleeves and finding a solution.  Let 
those of us in government at all levels be part of the solutions 
rather than a major part of the problems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the province of 
Alberta recently put some more money into the program for its 
producers.  It was very welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to question the previous speaker and other members of the 
Reform Party, many of whom are from Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
two great provinces, on whether they have asked their provincial 
governments to put more money into the program.  As I said 
before, the top AIDA officials will be coming in front of our 
committee tomorrow and the ministers of agriculture for both 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan will be appearing before the House of 
Commons agriculture committee on Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to continue to look for all possible support in 
his own provincial government areas so we can work with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  I certainly agree with him that part of the problem 
has been provincial.  As I said in my speech, Saskatchewan is 
seeing huge disparities where Saskatchewan farmers have bottomed 
out compared to those of Alberta next door and even those of 
Manitoba, which is somewhere in the middle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta government created a program called FIDP which not 
everyone loves.  That is the nature of the beast with government 
programs.  It certainly has held its farmers at a better level 
than those of Saskatchewan.  We have been in a free-fall. Our 
crown corporations have been building kingdoms elsewhere in the 
world without staying at home and looking after the little guy. 
Our farmers have taken a hit at all levels and will continue to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers are coming here.  That is great.  They can talk and 
be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.  I look 
forward to the interventions at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GRIP program disappeared out of Saskatchewan.  The 
provincial government disappeared with about $140 million.  The 
federal government saved about $230 million.  All they have to do 
is put that money back and we would have about five times what 
the AIDA program will do for us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the future.  We do not have to reinvent 
anything.  We saw just a short time ago what rural voters in 
Saskatchewan thought of the agriculture policies of the NDP 
government.  They turfed the NDP government out of rural 
Saskatchewan, and rightly so.  It was not listening.  It has to 
get out there and start to help with the situation, not add to 
it.  Rates for SaskTel, SaskPower and Sask Gas and Energy will go 
through the roof.  It is compounding the problem and not helping 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have infrastructure that we can hardly afford to drive on. We 
have a seatbelts rule in the province just so we do not get 
bounced off the seat.  It has nothing to do with safety.  The 
situation we are facing in rural Saskatchewan is absolutely 
ridiculous.  It just gets worse and worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All levels of government, municipal, provincial and federal, 
must get in there and work together.  Let us forget the partisan 
crap.  Let us all get in there and make it happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can help out a bit.  The former provincial government 
of Manitoba, the provincial PCs, gave out $50 an acre for the 
flooded natural disaster acreage.  It was doing something.  The 
NDP Government of Saskatchewan has done nothing in the way of 
extra money.  We are waiting to see it come forward with money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quick question for the member.  The banks have been 
fairly lenient with farmers in trying to help them out a little. 
Farm credit has been tough.  I have also had calls that the 
Canadian Wheat Board is pressuring farmers over the cash advances 
they received in previous years.  I see no leniency there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the Canadian Wheat Board be more lenient on the cash 
advances than what it appears to be doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake for his intervention.  I agree.  Large 
corporations can follow the example of the banks and give farmers 
a break.  There is no way that they can buy back land that is 
coming up this year with the low commodity prices.  No one has 
had a chance to put any kind of cash reserves aside to make the 
down payment required to buy back the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers do not want to lose any of their land.  It is part of 
the viability of their operation.  Whether one loses a quarter, 
five quarters or all five sections really does not matter.  It is 
a chink in the armour.  It is a chip away at the bottom of the 
dike and everything else will break loose from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to revisit that situation.  We need to look long and 
hard at avenues that will allow farmers some breathing space to 
put a few nickels back in their jeans and make that down payment 
to stay viable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the 
debate.  I remind members that I represent a riding in downtown 
Toronto.  There is not a single farm in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I have always believed that national 
politicians should be sensitive to issues not just in our own 
riding or our own community but in every region of the country. 
Today is an example where this debate affects the people of my 
riding, not only in an indirect way but in a direct way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the member for Yorkton—Melville 
earlier.  He described in very dramatic detail what was happening 
in his community.  There were families with children facing the 
stress of watching their mothers and fathers working 80, 90 to 
100 hour weeks and not making ends meet.  He said that this was 
not a faceless problem, that these were real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also asked one question I want to try to answer.  What can we 
do to make the people who live in cities understand what is 
happening on the family farm?  That was the question he asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a downtown Toronto member of parliament I will attempt to 
answer that question.  The basis of my answer comes from an 
experience that I had in the House 10 years ago when I sat in 
opposition.  We had an agriculture critic from 
Lambton—Middlesex, the hon. Ralph Ferguson, who is a farmer to 
this day. 
He developed, at his own expense, a program entitled, “Compare 
the Share”.  When I go into a store and buy a bag of cookies for 
$5, the program shows what the retailer gets, what the wholesaler 
gets and what the manufacturer gets.  The family farm gets two 
pennies on that $5.  On what we pay for a quart of milk the 
farmer's share is 11 cents.  On a loaf of bread the family farmer 
gets six cents.  When we buy 10 pounds of potatoes for $1.50 the 
farmer gets 12 to 15 cents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Egmont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has spent most of my life as a city person, I had 
never seen that package before.  One day we decided to put up a 
display at my constituency office, which is on a very high 
profile street in downtown Toronto called the Danforth, showing 
the various shares on a quart of milk, a bag of cookies, a 
package of pasta and a loaf of bread.  We then showed how much a 
farmer pays for his land, machinery and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the member for Yorkton—Melville that the city people 
were shocked.  They had no idea the number of hours that farm 
families put in to get the two cents out of that $5 bag of 
cookies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We kept the “Compare the Share” display for about a month to 
six weeks and then obviously we had to change it.  That was one 
little section of a downtown area in Toronto, one of 22 sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked what we could do to make city folk understand. 
We have to revive “Compare the Share”.  Even for our own rural 
members in the House, there are probably a lot who would not be 
up to date on the current share that exists on a whole line of 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to go as far as re-examining the packaging that 
goes on products.  Maybe we should not just be doing “Compare 
the Share” in our offices.  Maybe we should use our power in the 
House of Commons to explore the notion of putting the approximate 
share that a farmer gets on all of the packaged goods.  What is 
wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that if we, in three, four or five years from 
now, lose the contribution of the family farm in the country, or 
if we discover four, five or six years from now that we no longer 
have any young people who want to work on the family farm because 
they are tired of working for $2 or $3 an hour, what will we do 
as a nation?  Without the family farm, the quality of food, which 
today is second to none, and even in terms of consumer price is 
as competitive or more competitive than most places in the world, 
we will find ourselves stuck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good debate today but we must not treat it as a 
partisan debate.  I know most members have not.  Let us get 
together and do something constructive.  I really believe the way 
to get the city people mobilized is to educate them about exactly 
what the farm family gets for every little contribution they make 
to the quality of life we have in our cities and in the whole 
country which is ranked number one in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
very pleased to see that the member from Toronto recognized the 
important contribution made by farmers to the food supply, which 
is safe and certainly among the best in the world.  I was also 
pleased to hear his idea on how to get city people to recognize 
the input of farmers.  I really appreciate that and think it is a 
good idea, but it still does not deal with these severe, critical 
problems that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not deal with pushing European countries and putting 
pressure on Asian countries to remove or reduce their import 
restrictions.  It does nothing to pressure the United States to 
reduce its unfair subsidies which make it very difficult for our 
farmers to compete because they are not competing on a level 
playing field.  They are competing against just too many odds. 
Our farmers have become so efficient that they can compete 
against an awful lot of odds that one would think they just would 
not be able to deal with, but they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have not dealt with the tax problem other than 
making it worse.  They have not dealt with the restrictions on 
farmers to develop more options for markets except by making it 
worse.  They have made things worse rather than improving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to be 
constructive in the debate.  I will not get diverted from where I 
am coming from.  I feel passionate as a member of parliament that 
we should do something to help the family farm in the country, 
especially those that are in deep economic and psychological pain 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that if we educate a majority of people in 
the country on just how the family farm is getting screwed—I 
will put it in direct terms of getting screwed—my sense is they 
will understand that through education in a way that is sort of 
understandable.  City folk are not going to understand.  I heard 
everybody stand up here today to talk about AIDA.  How many 
people in the city understand what AIDA is?  I am trying to help 
here.  Using that language is not the way to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to get city people mobilized to help the family farm in 
the country is to educate them on how they are getting screwed. 
Once that becomes a reality in their minds, then I think we can 
deal with all those other things very quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
were two members opposite who seemed to have an understanding of 
what farming is all about and what is really needed to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member who just spoke would be able to have 
the same kind of impact on the other members opposite and let 
them understand exactly how significant the family farm is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the effort that he is trying to make to help. 
However, we need to recognize that although we might recognize 
how important the family farm is, there is also the income 
structure that exists with the people who live in the city who 
buy that food.  If the tax burden is such that over 50% of it 
goes to taxes of one kind and another, it does not matter how 
well they understand the farm situation.  They recognize it but 
say “Well, look, I have to buy this stuff”.  If we are going to 
get this into some kind of a decent balanced situation there has 
to be the wherewithal to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers are taxed too heavily.  The consumer is taxed too 
heavily.  No matter which way we put this thing together, it 
seems that the education that takes place has to be a little bit 
broader than just the farm situation.  We have to get into the 
whole business of taxation and how we get together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member knows full 
well that he has never had any debate with me on the notion of 
comprehensive tax reform.  I have spent 12 years on the issue and 
I pray and hope that one day the executive of the government will 
become seized with that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have issues that we feel passionately about.  I agree 
with the member that comprehensive tax reform is something we 
need. However, I am not separating tax reform from any part of 
any issue in the House of Commons.  It is critical and it needs 
dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question the member for Yorkton—Melville asked me today was 
what can we do to make city folk realize the family farm is in 
this deep pain, and that is where I was coming from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
the member for Broadview—Greenwood for his contribution this 
evening to this very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the concerns surrounding 
the level of farm income this year.  I share with farmers and 
members of the House their concern over the difficult realities a 
number of farmers are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my colleagues across the floor to understand, as I 
believe they do but I want to remind them, how closely the 
minister of agriculture and the government have worked with 
producers and with other levels of government to put in place an 
effective system of safety nets to protect farmers and their 
income.  That is something that does not come across in what hon. 
members are reading in the papers and seeing on television.  Too 
many people want to make this a federal government problem when 
in fact it is everyone's problem.  The government has been 
working with all the players to balance all the interests and 
develop solutions that are acceptable to all the partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnership has been the hallmark of farm safety net policy over 
the last half decade.  In December 1994, after a year of 
consultations with farm groups, the minister of agriculture and 
agri-food of the day achieved a national consensus for a new 
Canadian farm safety net system, one that is income based and 
established on the whole farm principle, a system predicated on 
balancing the needs of all regions and all sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnerships yield results and our safety net system is proof of 
that.  Working together, producers and governments developed one 
of the most predictable, effective and reliable systems of farm 
income protection in the world, and this system is still 
evolving.  Contributions to both design and funding come from 
farmers themselves, from the federal government and from all the 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improvements are being sought on an ongoing basis. 
Unfortunately, today's market conditions are one of the driving 
forces behind the effort to improve safety net programming. 
However, Canadian farmers have a solid foundation on which to 
build and the federal government is continuing to work with them 
through the national safety net advisory committee to develop 
these improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently farmers in the country have a safety net system made 
up of crop insurance, the net income stabilization account or 
NISA and specific provincial initiatives.  As things stand now, 
the Government of Canada invests $60 million each and every year 
to these programs with the provinces spending an additional $400 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NISA account and federal-provincial crop insurance are 
designed to help farmers deal with normal market risks and 
weather.  NISA is a voluntary program designed to help producers 
achieve stable incomes over the long term.  It provides producers 
with the opportunity to deposit money annually into their income 
stabilization account and receive matching government 
contributions so their account grows. In lower income years 
producers are expected to bring their incomes up by making 
withdrawals from the funds they set aside in previous high income 
years.

$1.2 billion available in their NISA accounts.  They can withdraw 
that money at any time.  Up until October 14, 24,000 Canadian

normal cyclical risks that markets and mother nature present but 
the minister of agriculture has recognized that what has been 
happening over the past year and a half has been exceptional. 
All the cycles essentially bottomed out at the same time and a 
number of other factors came together to make the situation even 
worse. Many farmers' revenues plummeted as prices fell from the 
highs of the mid-nineties to dramatic lows.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Government of Canada responded with the AIDA 
program.  It was developed in consultation with industry and the 
provinces.  It is providing $1.5 billion with 60% coming from the 
federal government and 40% coming from the provincial 
governments. This money has been paid out over two years to help 
farmers through an income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In announcing AIDA in December 1998 the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to target the farmers in Canada who, I am 
confident, will succeed in the long term but need help now, due 
to circumstances beyond their control. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program builds on NISA, crop insurance and other 
existing risk management mechanisms.  It was designed to meet the 
green criteria of the WTO agreement on agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of our international commitments and obligations, I do 
not believe answers can be found by stepping back 10 years into 
the past with a repeat of ineffective, inequitable and 
unaffordable subsidies. Such measures cannot be financially 
sustained nor are they suited to an agri-food sector that is very 
dependent on the world marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government will continue to defend the interests of 
Canadian farmers in the international trade arena.  We will use 
the upcoming world trade negotiations to work toward removing 
trade distorting subsidies so our farmers can compete on a level 
playing field in the global trading system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has a long history of working 
with farmers and the agri-food industry to achieve those things 
which make our industry thrive.  Despite recent challenges, our 
sector as a whole is remarkably strong.  Our existing safety nets 
and now AIDA will help ensure it stays that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the Government of Canada understands that the current 
programs can be improved upon.  We are currently in the process 
of considering additional modifications to the AIDA program for 
the 1999 tax year.  We are setting out the parameters for the 
long term safety net options for the future.  All changes to AIDA 
and/or the development of any long term safety net options will 
be done in consultation and in partnership with the provinces, 
with the minister's national safety nets advisory committee and 
also with farm organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian producers have faced adversity before and have come 
through it, thanks to their own strength and innovation and 
thanks also to the efforts of all governments working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability of the agriculture and food industry to overcome the 
current challenge rests on the strength and stability of its 
foundation at home. Over the past year we have been working hard 
to provide that stable foundation by improving the existing 
safety net system and by developing new tools like AIDA.  That 
work continues.

member's comments, coming from the parliamentary secretary, 
really concern me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard no reference whatsoever to some of the key issues that 
are affecting farmers, such as tax reduction which would help 
immensely in improving the bottom line, and such as dealing with 
the unfair trade practices of other countries which would do more 
than anything else the government can do.  These programs are not 
going to cut it.  We have to fix up the problems in trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard no reference to reducing user fees which have been built 
up by the government at an unbelievable pace over the past six 
years, or reducing regulation and red tape so farmers do not 
spend half their winters working through the maze the government 
has set out for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these things were talked about. No solutions were 
offered by the parliamentary secretary.  That certainly does not 
respond to the concerns that farmers have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe the hon. member for 
Lakeland was listening to the speech.  I made specific reference 
to the efforts Canada is making through the World Trade 
Organization to reduce subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the world at large, Canada is not a great big player.  We are 
not a powerful player in the international agricultural field. We 
have to design and push with all our might to have a rules based 
system of trade so Canada can compete equally with other more 
powerful nations like the United States and the European common 
market. 
We cannot afford to match them dollar for dollar in the subsidy 
game.  We are not in that game.  I believe the Reform Party 
agrees that we cannot do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the parliamentary secretary's remarks earlier he 
said, “We will continue to defend the interests of farmers in 
international trade negotiations”.  That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago when the WTO said that countries should start 
looking at a 20% reduction of subsidies in their agricultural 
sector, the Liberal government, as the parliamentary secretary 
said, defended the interests of farmers by not taking 20%, 30% or 
40% off the subsidies in Canada.  It took 100% of the subsidies 
with respect to grain and oilseeds production in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he sincerely believe what he just said, that he will 
continue to defend the interests of our farmers in the future? 
They are reeling from the Liberal policies of the elimination of 
the Crow benefit and other subsidies.  How can he possibly hurt 
the farmers any more?  We would like to know because the farmers 
should be getting ready for the onslaught and the butchering of 
their agricultural life by the government.  Can the parliamentary 
secretary answer how he is going to continue to defend those 
types of attacks and persecution of our farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those comments come from a 
member of the fourth party who is from Saskatchewan and whose NDP 
government has been very tight in supporting its farmers within 
its own provincial boundaries.  For him to sit back and criticize 
the efforts we are putting in through the federal treasury to 
support his farmers in Saskatchewan leaves much to be desired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting in $600 million every year in safety nets and 
$900 million in the AIDA program.  We are looking at adjustments 
to that program so we can free up more money for the farmers.  I 
would say that we are coming through for the farmers of Canada.

for terminal cleaning.  He paid $4,546 for freight.  He paid 
$2,026 for handling.  He paid $64 for a malt barley levy.  He 
paid $146 for administration. Thirty-seven per cent of his cheque 
was gone before he got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government going to do about reducing input costs 
and reducing these types of bills that farmers are paying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, everybody recognizes that 
the reason we are in this jam right now and probably into the 
next year or so, is the low commodity prices experienced 
especially by the western grain farmer and people who export 
agricultural products.  That is something we have to face as a 
country.  It is not something that is faced just by the federal 
government or by the producers, but it is also faced by the 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working together we are addressing the situation.  Through 
our combined efforts we will be there for the farmer in his hour

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House of Commons today 
to discuss the farm crisis in western Canada and other parts of 
the country.  This country has a farm income crisis that is 
unprecedented and has not been seen since the depression of the 
1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent an urban rural constituency.  There are 37 rural 
communities and a number of farm families who live in and between 
those communities.  They are having a very traumatic time with 
respect to their industry, their livelihoods and their futures. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a number of things today about what has transpired 
and what may transpire in the future.  I want to focus on the 
priority of helping farm families and keeping our agricultural 
way of life.  I want to talk about that and the four reasons that 
we are in this situation today. Everyone knows why we are in this 
situation.  I want to elaborate on a few of the reasons.  There 
are four major reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that the commodity prices are in the dumpers. They are 
way, way below prices that we have ever seen before. Today 
farmers are getting for grain what farmers got in the 1930s, the 
same dollar, not the same dollar value.  That is a very serious 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, we have seen a huge reduction in subsidies and supports for 
farmers while other countries have maintained their supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, we have seen large increases in huge input costs over the 
last two or three years. They have gone unfettered in terms of 
taking away farmers' potential earnings and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the fourth reason is natural disasters.  There have 
been a lot of natural disasters. We will get to all of them, but 
I want to talk first about the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view and the view of the farmers in western Canada that 
the Liberal government has abandoned western prairie farmers. 
There used to be the Crow benefit, a transportation subsidy.  It 
was provided to our western farmers in perpetuity by law because 
of the $14 billion to $20 billion in assets that we gave the 
railway companies to provide that Crow benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we seen over the years?  Successive Liberal and 
Conservative governments have allowed the railways to spin off 
all those assets, the mining companies, land companies and all 
the other assets that were given to them to subsidize some of 
that grain transportation. Governments have encouraged them to 
spin these companies off. They have left the railway companies 
all by themselves trying to make a profit on the farmers' backs. 
On top of that governments have deregulated the railway industry 
to a degree where they have allowed the railways to do whatever 
they want concerning branch lines.  They have abandoned branch 
lines all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is abandoning its obligation to support western 
agriculture after successive governments have allowed billions 
and billions of dollars to be sucked out of the western 
agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years and four months ago I was at the Council of Europe in 
Strasbourg, France.  I went there as a delegate of this 
parliament.  For members who do not know, all the European 
countries meet four times a year.  Their members of parliament go 
there to talk about issues which are common to their countries 
and common to the world, actually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the agriculture committee.  I asked the members of 
that committee in Strasbourg, France what they would be doing 
with their subsidies for agriculture.  At the time the Liberals 
said that WTO makes it mandatory and we have to eliminate our 
subsidies for farmers.  That is what farmers were told.  The 
Liberals eliminated the transportation subsidy. Those farmers 
from Europe told me “We will not reduce our subsidies for 
farmers.  We have five years to address the subsidy issue for our 
farmers.  If you think for one moment we would sacrifice our 
farmers for the U.S.A., you are gravely mistaken”. That is what 
they told me.  It is in their <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are four years and four months later, the only 
government out of the 38 members of the Council of Europe, the 
U.S.A. and Canada that has abandoned its farmers.  The only 
country is Canada, the best place in the world in which to live, 
for everybody except farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have one of the major reasons for the crisis out west. 
There has been nothing in terms of supporting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is the drop in commodity prices.  Commodity 
prices are dropping because every other country has received 
subsidies.  My colleague from Palliser spoke this morning about 
the subsidies.  The Americans have committed $23 billion to their 
farmers plus another $13 billion, for a total of $36 billion to 
the American farmers.  That is supporting their farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are our Liberal ministers going to the states saying “This is 
GATTable.  This is against the WTO.  This is terrible”.  Not a 
peep, and on top of that not a dollar for western grain farmers. 
The Liberals talk about the AIDA program and the $900 million 
they are giving.  Everybody got it, except Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan farmers and some Alberta farmers as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Strasbourg, France, four years ago talking to the 
farm oriented members of parliament for Europe, they told me that 
their subsidies were in the vicinity of 55 cents to 60 cents on 
the dollar.  Ours with the Crow benefit was 19 cents, and the 
Americans at that time were at about 42 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are getting six cents on the dollar for every dollar 
farmers earn and the Europeans are getting 56 cents, almost 10 
times more than Canadians, and the Americans are getting six 
times more at 38 cents on the dollar.  Is this how our government 
has negotiated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys made a 
speech in the House not long ago when he showed Canadians the 
negotiating position of the Liberals.  He was on his knees for 
most of the speech because he was talking about the Liberal 
negotiating position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a betrayal in terms of the loss of subsidies to our 
farmers.  It is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One farmer told me that in this current world of the Liberal 
agricultural policy he feels like a kamikaze pilot with a two 
ship quota.  That is what all western farmers are feeling right 
now because of the ineptitude, the betrayal and the purposeful 
abandonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time since the 1930s we have seen the Liberals 
encourage farmers to demonstrate and to protest how they have 
been treated by the federal government.  They are demonstrating 
across western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fear, and farmers tell me this, is that if continued betrayal 
happens we will not have demonstrations, I fear there might be 
violence.  I do not want to see that.  I tell my farmers not to 
do that.  I do not know what they will do until they get some 
support from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do farmers get for their commodities?  When we go to the 
grocery store and buy a $4.50 box of shredded wheat, farmers get 
less than four cents out of the $4.50.  Where does the money go? 
It does not go to farmers.  That is part of their problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason we are in this pickle is because of increasing 
input costs.  There is a fuel tax on diesel fuel for farmers. 
The federal government takes about 12 cents a litre on that tax 
and it does not spend a dime on roads or transportation in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My advice to the government is that when it is looking at how it 
deals with western farmers maybe it should put some of the fuel 
tax into an agricultural support program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen transportation costs skyrocket.  I talked the other 
day to a farmer near Craik in my constituency.  He sent three 
carloads of barley to the marketplace.  One carload of the three 
was for his transportation costs.  Now we have serfs in our 
country working for the railway and grain companies.  All the 
farmers want to do is make a living for their families.  They are 
prepared to pay their fair share, but they want some respect and 
dignity from the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen fertilizer, chemical and pesticide costs increase. 
Taxes on those should be reduced or eliminated for our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most incredible increase in costs has been the downloading 
of equalization payments and moneys to the provinces in health 
care and education.  They have been downloaded directly to the 
farmers.  They have to pay higher costs for education and health 
care from their properties, businesses and family farms because 
the government was, in the words of the minister, continuing to 
defend the interests of farmers.  With friends like that we do 
not need any enemies in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm crisis is totally invisible to Ottawa.  The throne 
speech did not have one reference to the farm crisis.  We are 
hoping that there are some people opposite who are prepared to 
support our rural farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason we are in this pickle is because of natural 
disasters.  We have seen floods, frost, drought, hail and 
pestilence, but the greatest natural disaster has been the 
Liberal government opposite.  It does not seem to understand how 
to put an agricultural emergency program together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 13 months ago I raised the question of assistance for 
farmers in the House of Commons.  We called for an emergency 
debate.  The government opposite turned it down.  About 18 months 
ago my colleague from Palliser, our agricultural spokesperson, 
raised questions in the House about the impending crisis.  It 
fell on deaf ears because the Liberals were too busy doing other 
things. 
We see a Liberal government opposite which does not have an 
understanding of what agriculture is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the airport the other day when a cabinet minister came 
up to me and said “What is it you have in your hand?”  I said 
“What do you think it is?”  He said “Is it rice?”  I said 
“No, it is grain.  It is wheat”.  He did not understand what 
wheat was.  I found that quite incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an agricultural program like AIDA which has to start 
covering negative margins.  It has to start covering a longer 
term, not just three years but over five years.  The government 
would be well advised to take the advice of the farmers out west 
who say if we are going to have an emergency agriculture disaster 
assistance program, then maybe it should help agriculture 
producers directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in Saskatchewan and Manitoba that less than half of 
the farmers are qualifying for AIDA.  I had a call from a farmer 
just last week who was in tears because he has had a negative 
income for the past two years.  He received a call from AIDA in 
Winnipeg saying “We can't give you any money because you don't 
qualify”.  He told me that he will be finished by next spring. 
Unless he receives emergency aid his farm will be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of hundreds of farmers with whom I spoke over this 
last summer.  These farmers are desperate.  Their eyes are gaunt. 
They look like they have been abandoned by the federal 
government.  All they want is an opportunity to play on a level 
playing field in order to produce a product which is necessary in 
this world, food.  That is all they ask.  They do not want to be 
subsidized all the time.  They want to have a fair, level playing 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that does not seem to get it.  Instead it 
sends Mr. Kroeger around, who says that what we should do is take 
the cap off the transportation of grain.  We have already seen 
transportation costs triple since the Crow benefit was 
eliminated.  The government, in the words of the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of agriculture, continues to defend the 
interests of farmers in international trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is really doing a great job.  Railroads are 
expanding in the United States and we are helping them.  We have 
two railroads in this country, one that we paid for but never 
owned and one that we used to own but never paid for.  Now we 
have two railroads that we have paid for in both ways and someone 
else owns them and they are expanding everywhere.  When I asked 
the railroads if they would give the farmers a break on their 
transportation costs because they are making all of this money, 
they said “Maybe, but maybe not”.  Now the government is asking 
for the freight rate cap to be taken off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is the only party in the House of Commons, and in this 
country, which supports the retention of the cap on freight 
rates.  There should actually be a rollback to make farming more 
affordable for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have three kinds of farmers in Saskatchewan.  One-third of 
them are making it year by year.  If they have a bad year they 
might make it to the second year with certain supports.  For the 
middle third, if they have a couple of bad years in a row they 
can still make a go of it.  The other third does not have any 
land or equipment debt.  That is the structure of the 
agricultural community in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is tearing at my heartstrings and what I am pleading with 
the government to listen to is that I am talking to more and more 
farmers in that top third who have no land debt and no capital 
debt who are telling me they may farm one more year and then they 
will be gone because they now have to borrow on about one-third 
of their property assets to put in the grain next spring.  They 
have to buy fertilizers and other inputs.  They are going 
backwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the top third are in jeopardy, or contemplating leaving, what 
is happening with the other two-thirds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told by many sources that up to half of our farmers in 
Saskatchewan alone, in Manitoba and probably Alberta as well, may 
be out of business in the next 12 months if something is not 
forthcoming that is fair to them in this competitive world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to members of the co-op boards.  This does not only 
concern farmers.  We know that the Liberals wanted to restructure 
agriculture.  When the member for Wascana, the Liberal natural 
resources minister, was parliamentary secretary to Otto Lang from 
1974 to 1979, he and Otto Lang tried to get rid of the Crow 
benefit.  The member for Wascana, who was re-elected, came back 
and did it himself single-handedly, thanks to the good training 
of Otto Lang.  The only party that opposed that move was the NDP 
in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, unfortunately, four years and five months later we are 
saying that it has been a disaster, as we said it would be.  We 
are asking the government to reconsider that approach and to help 
our farmers as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to a farmer near Govan, Saskatchewan.  He has 10 
quarters of land that he has been farming for 30 years.  There is 
no debt on the land.  His equipment is paid for.  His children 
have moved away from the farm.  He told me that he may have one 
more year left to farm and then he is out of it.  That is a very 
serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals are not listening to these points, I have one 
more they should pay attention to.  A former federal Liberal 
candidate in the 1984 election who farms in my district said to 
me that last July or August he sent in his Liberal Party 
membership card.  He was a colleague of government members.  He 
ran with them shoulder to shoulder in an election campaign in the 
past.  He is a farmer and he is saying that he is sick and tired 
of the Liberals.  They have abandoned, betrayed and butchered 
farmers and he is done.  He is no longer a Liberal card carrier. 
He sent his Liberal membership back to a cabinet minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious situations.  I do not know if the 
dramatic situations that farmers are talking about will 
materialize.  However, in local newspapers, such as the 
<I>Davidson Leader</I>, which is a newspaper in my constituency 
and in that of one of my colleagues in the Reform Party, the 
headlines say that the minister of agriculture should resign. 
The <I>Davidson Leader</I> is a very important newspaper in the 
rural community that I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  It is almost as big as the <I>Moosomin 
World-Spectator</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>   It is almost as big as the <I>Moosomin 
World-Spectator</I>.  It is probably bigger than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious implications.  I said earlier that 
it is not just the farmers who are hurting.  Let us look at the 
spinoffs.  Just imagine if half of the farmers are out of 
business in the next 12 months in western Canada.  What will 
happen to the co-operatives, the credit union boards and those 
businesses?  What will happen to the hairdressing salons, the 
cafes, the gas stations and all of these other businesses and 
small businesses in the communities?  The A & W in Davidson, for 
example.  I guess that is going to be gone.  There are all kinds 
of important implications to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that happens, the tax base is lost and, voilà, we end up 
with no transportation system at all, or one that is crumbling 
faster than it is now.  We end up with an education system that 
is at risk and potentially will not withstand the upcoming 
disaster.  We will see our health care system totally collapse in 
rural districts.  It was a way of life that many people preferred 
to choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letters from all kinds of people.  A few are from 
children who are in school.  They are students in grades 7 and 8. 
A student from Creelman, Saskatchewan wrote to the Minister of 
Finance, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need financial assistance soon or many will go bankrupt. 
Without farming many other people in agriculture related jobs 
will also be without work.  Rural Saskatchewan as we know it will 
not exist.  Please help our farmers.  In doing so you will be 
saving our province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letter from another student.  He talks about being a 
fourth generation farmer. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of me farming is very slim.  Both my parents work 
off the farm and have rented their land out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my letter is to discuss the farming situation in 
western Canada.  I live in southeast Saskatchewan.  In the past 
four years, our family has had poor crops, poor prices, and 
escalating costs of machinery, fertilizer, chemicals, and fuel. 
Every cent they had went into the farm. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a young generation that will not be farming because 
of these agricultural policies initiated by the government 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies such as Flexi-Coil, which used to employ 1,800, is now 
employing 350 or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need?  Farmers need immediate cash.  In Saskatchewan 
alone the number is at least $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need stronger representation at the WTO to have other 
countries reduce their subsidies in the longer term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need tax cuts on fuel, fertilizer and chemicals.  We 
need to address those sorts of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we need to cap the freight rate on our transportation 
system for grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we need a fully financed AIDA program which will be 
there as a whole farm income plan in the event of future 
disasters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his comments on the issue.  I know he is from 
Saskatchewan and cares deeply for the farming community there. 
However, I am somewhat surprised by his comments.  I would hope 
he might pass his comments on to those in his party who developed 
the campaign promises.  As he knows in the last election, out of 
the $17.6 billion in new campaign promises only $11 million went 
to agriculture.  I might suggest that he pass that on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him regarding international trade.  He 
said that one of the problems that is creating this crisis is the 
fact that somehow we have not stood up to the Americans or the 
Europeans in terms of subsidies.  Is it not his party's position 
that we should pull out of the WTO?   Is it not also his party's 
position that we should not be negotiating at all when it comes 
to Seattle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he expects us to put forward a strong position on 
these issues if we are not part of the World Trade Organization 
or if we were not in a position, with meetings like Seattle, 
where we can pull together different countries from around the 
world that have a similar position to ours.  I would think it 
would be in Canada's interest, given the size of the country, to 
be able to draw together certain groups of countries to put 
forward a strong position on these very issues.  I wonder if the 
hon. member agrees with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary dealt with two issues, the first being that the New 
Democratic Party has had a very strong agricultural program in 
every election since, as I can recall, 1952.  We have program 
cards. I was looking at one the other day that was from the 1953 
or 1954 federal election.  In every campaign since 1953 or 1954, 
we have supported the Canadian Wheat Board and have said that we 
would fight to retain the Crow benefit.  That has been in every 
one of our policies including our policy of the last election. 
However, the Crow benefit is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to his second question, yes, we do believe the WTO 
is an important organization for our country and all countries, 
but the problem we have had is not with the hon. member opposite 
but with his colleagues before him who were trade ministers and 
gave away the farm.  They had no strength with which to 
negotiate. They said that 20% was a good idea but that they were 
going to do 100% because they were good.  And they were good, 
really good. They were so good that they have sacrificed half of 
our farm population in western Canada, and that is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking at here is an organization that does have 
opportunities for us.  We have to go to Seattle and try to get 
the subsidies on agriculture readjusted so they are more fair. In 
the interim until that happens, because it will not happen 
overnight and will probably take years, I would suggest to the 
parliamentary secretary that he stand with us and with the 
farmers.  The member represents a rural constituency and he knows 
the importance of these sorts of programs.  He should stand with 
us and help our farmers out west to get what they need to survive 
at least another year.  It is certainly what they deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's comments. 
The NDP member would have a lot more credibility if his 
government in Saskatchewan took agriculture a lot more seriously 
and supported the farmers.  That is one of the real problems we 
have when we come to Ottawa.  Many people here ask us what the 
provincial government is doing and we have to say “very, very 
little”.  That is one of the key problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want this to be too partisan, but I want to make some 
points here.  When the member pointed out some of the problems in 
Saskatchewan he failed to mention that the provincial government 
there has taxed farmers to death.  We complain about federal 
taxes but the taxes in the province are just as bad.  For 
example, the member talked a lot about the high cost of fuel.  It 
gets a lot of headlines back in the province.  However, he failed 
to mention that the provincial fuel tax is the highest in the 
country. 
Why not reduce that?  There is no reason he cannot put some 
pressure on his friends in the provincial government in 
Saskatchewan to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Province of Saskatchewan also makes huge profits off farmers 
through its crown corporations.  The natural gas is all handled 
by a crown corporation and farmers have to pay the taxes on that 
natural gas.  The electrical power is supplied by a crown 
corporation.  It is making huge profits.  The telephone company 
is a crown corporation making huge profits, in fact, expanding 
around the world.  The member complains about what is happening. 
This has to be rectified and the member should begin to address 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about property taxes and the downloading of all the 
education costs on farmers through those property taxes.  I could 
talk about transportation costs:  $50 million every year because 
the Government of Saskatchewan failed to put pressure on the 
restructuring of the railroads.  It did virtually nothing on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are four areas where nothing was done and farmers are now 
paying the costs because of the mismanagement back in the 
province of the NDP.  I think the member should answer some of 
those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am always happy to 
answer questions about the provincial government in Saskatchewan, 
although this is not the correct forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises a number of issues.  He talks about 
credibility.  I have some little quotes by him and other 
colleagues of his in the House of Commons from various policy 
books about how the Reform Party wants to eliminate the 
agriculture subsidies faster, harder and quicker so that there is 
not even the six cents on every dollar the farmers are receiving 
now.  Reform wants them to have nothing, not just six cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reformers are looking for in this forum are tax cuts 
because it is the honourable thing to do.  They talked about 
their priorities.  They are so busy cashing CNR and CPR dividend 
cheques that they do not have the interests of the farmers at 
heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some tax situations in Saskatchewan that are higher 
than most.  I remind the Reform member that it was his coalition 
of Reformers, Liberals and Tories who bankrupted Saskatchewan in 
the first place.  They were elected in 1982.  They took a 
province that did not have one dime of debt and $2 billion in 
heritage funds, and in nine years put the Saskatchewan government 
$16 billion in debt for one million people.  Now they are saying 
there are high taxes.  They should be embarrassed and ashamed of 
themselves.  They are the ones who put the people of Saskatchewan 
in this pickle, along with their colleagues across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about credibility.  The member for Yorkton—Melville 
says that Saskatchewan has the highest fuel tax in the country. 
He is not only incorrect, he is wrong. Saskatchewan actually has 
the fifth lowest tax regime on fuel which should be directed more 
into the agriculture situation.  Out of the 15 cents a litre that 
is collected in Saskatchewan on gasoline, about 80% goes back 
into the transportation programs such as highways and roads. 
Maybe it should use the whole 100%, as I have advocated here that 
the federal gas tax should be used 100% on rural transportation 
in rural Canada, not just in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out for the record that it was their government 
that gave away the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan in 1980 
which provided $100 million a year in revenues to the Province of 
Saskatchewan.  That was for potash that was sold outside the 
province.  There was new American and foreign money coming in 
with high wages, high production and great revenues, plus another 
$150 million a year profit that it was making.  They gave that 
all away.  Guess what?  Jobs were lost and the debt increased. 
They left the debt with the taxpayers and gave away all the 
assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have Chuck Childers, the now retired president of the 
Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, going around the country 
saying what a great success this privatized corporation is. There 
are no more revenues going to the province.  His salary is paid 
in U.S. dollars.  He will not take Canadian dollars.  He hired 
American vice-presidents to work with him and they are getting 
paid in U.S. dollars.  I am not saying that is good or bad, I am 
just outlining this as fact.  That is the way it is now under a 
Reform kind of crown corporation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the people of Saskatchewan would look at that in a very 
negative way.  They did not support this in 1991 or 1995.  I do 
not think they support it now.

lower than in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to 
provide the member with that information. Reading might give him 
a new dimension in terms of the facts. The Canadian Petroleum 
Products Institute provides this information which shows all the 
provinces across the country. Saskatchewan is about the fifth 
lowest when one considers all those that have gasoline taxes.  I 
think it is very important for a member like him to start reading 
some of this.

cannot table the document unless he gets unanimous consent in the

give the hon. member a copy and I think that is probably the best 
he can do under the circumstances.  That is why I did not pursue 
the matter.

late show to discuss the crisis that is happening in the Atlantic 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day the government appointed Mr. Mackenzie as a 
federal mediator to go down to Nova Scotia to discuss the 
situation between non-native and native fishermen after the 
Marshall decision of September 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the representative down there now has absolutely 
no trust in the people he is talking with.  He even admits that 
he knows absolutely nothing about the fishery.  Why would the 
federal government send someone down to Nova Scotia to discuss 
the fisheries crisis when the individual in question knows 
nothing about the fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we found out today is that since the Marshall 
decision has come out, besides the chaos and uncertainty this has 
created in everyone's lives in the maritime region, on March 8 of 
this year the Mi'kmaq nation came to Ottawa to discuss the 
proposed Marshall decision with the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the minister at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came here to give the government advance warning that if 
the supreme court was going to rule in favour of the aboriginal 
people, they would like to give the government enough time to 
come up with a short term plan to initiate the transfer of 
getting the aboriginal people into the fishery. They came here 
and the government basically told them to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want to talk to them because it was going 
to wait for the Marshall decision. That means the government did 
not want to plan ahead.  It did not want to discuss the future or 
the possible crisis that may happen as a result of the Marshall 
decision.  The government told the Mi'kmaq people who came here 
in good faith to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of the government and past Conservative 
governments.  They have consistently told aboriginal people who 
have had legitimate concerns across the country to go away, to 
pound sand, to take their case to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three straight court decisions from the supreme court have ruled 
in favour of the aboriginal people.  Every single time, the past 
governments and this current government have stood there like a 
deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck.  The 
government really does not know what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the livelihoods of thousands and thousands of people 
and their communities, their children are at stake.  The resource 
itself is at stake.  This government just stands around and says, 
“Go away, we do not want to talk to you”.  Now it is scrambling 
around.  This party has offered the government sound advice. 
Other parties have given the government advice as well which it 
has completely ignored.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic to notice that the previous minister who is now the 
environment minister must have known the decision was coming 
down.  If the DFO was the stock exchange we could almost accuse 
him of insider trading because he left the portfolio fairly 
quickly and went into another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a brand new minister who readily admits that he does 
not know much about the Mi'kmaq people.  He does not know much 
about fisheries as the head of one of the most volatile 
departments.  I call it one of the most out of control 
departments in Ottawa.  It has cost us billions of dollars in 
TAGS adjustments.  The stock itself is in chaos.  The auditor 
general said last April that the DFO and the government were 
managing the shellfish industry in the same manner that they 
managed the groundfish industry: right into the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. parliamentary secretary is quite 
simple.  Why did the government shut the door on the Mi'kmaq 
people on March 8 and in the ensuing weeks when they tried to 
initiate their conversations?  What will it do to resolve the 
situation immediately?

for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore on behalf of 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning the federal response to the Marshall decision on 
fishing and treaty rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has already spent two days 
in the maritimes meeting with aboriginal leaders, with commercial 
fishers and with his provincial counterparts.  Both ministers met 
on October 18 with the executive of the Atlantic Policy Congress 
which represents all the Atlantic chiefs to discuss issues 
arising from the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties at that meeting agreed that a made in Atlantic 
solution is required and that the fishing issue should be given 
first priority.  They also began to consider a process for 
dealing with the broader impact of the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 27 the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development will meet with the Atlantic chiefs in Cape Breton to 
continue the discussion launched last week.  In addition, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development consulted 
with the ministers responsible for aboriginal affairs in the 
maritime provinces on October 21.  DIAND staff is actively 
involved in reviewing the Marshall decision, its implication for 
first nations and its implication for all people in the 
maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two additional steps have also been taken.  First, the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans has been designed as the lead federal 
minister on the immediate issue relating to fisheries while the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will lead on 
the broader resource issue relating to the 1760 treaty and other 
historic maritime treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government has appointed a respected Nova Scotia 
lawyer, Mr. James Mackenzie, to serve as the federal 
representative in discussions arising from the Marshall decision 
both on fisheries issues and on the longer term implications of 
the court ruling on aboriginal access to resources.  Mr. 
Mackenzie began meeting with east coast chiefs and with 
non-aboriginal fishers last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans are both actively working with 
aboriginal leaders, with the provinces and with other 
stakeholders.  We intend to continue working co-operatively with

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
Canadians were asked if they believe that housing is a basic 
human right they would answer with a resounding yes.  Most 
everyone understands that without the basic provision of safe, 
secure, affordable housing it is pretty hard to make anything 
else in one's life work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most everyone gets that fundamental point but apparently not the 
Liberal government.  Despite the Golden report, the report of the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Housing and

this winter, the report of the Toronto Disaster Relief Committee, 
CMHC itself, and so on, we are still living with the terrible 
record of being the only industrialized country without a 
national housing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked myself how could this be when in 1990 the Minister of 
Finance, then in opposition, decried the fact that poverty and 
homelessness existed in Canada.  “It is reprehensible in a 
country as rich as Canada”, he said.  How can it be that we 
still have a housing disaster in Canada today when a minister of 
homelessness was appointed in March of this year?  How can a 
country as wealthy as Canada be condemned by the UN for its 
appalling record on homelessness, particularly for aboriginal 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These shameful conditions exist not because of the fault of 
individual people who are without housing or are homeless but 
because of deliberate, conscious public policy by design that has

made by the government in 1993 to dump housing and end 
construction of social and co-op housing.  We are living the 
consequences today of the decision made in 1993 to abandon social 
housing.  I implore the federal government to look at what is 
going on today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the Prime Minister asked the Minister of 
Labour to co-ordinate the activities of the Government of Canada 
related to homelessness, to bring together the information from 
these reports and to tabulate the documentation received from 
community groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities, municipalities and provinces have an important 
contribution to make and must understand that they need to be 
prepared to share in the responsibility for addressing the issue. 
We all need to be part of the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour spent the summer travelling to over 20 
communities from Vancouver to Halifax and spoke directly to 
Canadians who are homeless, to Canadians who work and volunteer 
their time to help the homeless, to businesses that are 
concerned, and to mayors and councils that are committed to 
eliminating homelessness in their communities.  The minister is 
compiling what she heard from the communities and from the many 
reports that have been prepared by the municipalities.  She will 
be the voice for those recommendations in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few months we have made progress.  The Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services was able to augment the $300 
million over five year RRAP program by $50 million, some of which 
was targeted directly to homeless shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development has identified funds 
under her department to address the needs of the homeless and to 
work toward eradicating the root causes and leading to 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The network of federal facilities in cities across Canada will 
initiate and co-ordinate a partnership process with provincial 
and municipal governments as well as with the voluntary and 
private sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the bottom line comes to partnership. 
Homelessness must be a priority for all levels of government 
working in partnership with the private and non-profit sectors.
