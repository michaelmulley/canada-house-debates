	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am making this statement today on behalf of the minister 
of multiculturalism who has the direct responsibility. However she 
is so active at the moment throughout the country on this very 
important day that she has asked me to present this ministerial 
statement on her behalf and I take great pleasure in doing so.
<P>
	As Canadians we have a great deal to be thankful for on this 
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
<P>
	In the 130 years we have grown together as a nation, we have 
been building a society which respects the diversity of its citizens. 
We have gained for ourselves a reputation around the world as a 
caring and compassionate country, a nation that can show the world 
how diverse people can live together in peace and respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The way we tolerate one another's differences is an example to 
all nations. It shows that we can find a solution that meets 
everyone's needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thirty-six years ago today dozens of innocent men and women 
protesting apartheid in South Africa were gunned down. The 
Sharpeville massacre showed the world that racism and hatred are 
challenges for the global family. If part of that family is victimized, 
violated or held back from reaching its full potential then we all 
suffer.
<P>
	Fortunately, much has changed in the decades since that terrible 
and horrible event. South Africa is now free from apartheid 
because of the enormous efforts made by countries around the 
world. And Canada played a very significant role in the fight 
against apartheid.
<P>
	The civil rights movement which has swept the United States has 
brought about a number of changes for the black population in that 
country.
<P>
	The iron curtain was lifted and new democratic rights have been 
established in a number of eastern European areas.
<P>
	Increasingly, Canadians try to embrace the reality of our 
diversity to provide protection and opportunities. I can say, for 
example, that one important initiative which was taken by this 
government was the Employment Equity Act which ensured that in 
the area of employment, racial discrimination could be eliminated 
and there would no longer be a barrier to people obtaining gainful 
employment.
<P>
	The General Assembly of the United Nations chose this day to 
recognize the importance of the ongoing struggle against racism 
and prejudice around the world.
<P>
	Canada has been at the fore in the global efforts to eradicate 
racism, prejudice and hatred. We have dedicated ourselves to peace 
and to building bridges between the different peoples of the world. 
We are engaged in active and positive reconstruction in Haiti, 
which had enormous discrimination built into it over the years by 
authoritarian dictatorships. Now we are helping to rebuild that 
country.
<P>
	We are helping countries around the world to develop new 
judicial systems and new human rights commissions which will 
give them the institutional basis on which they can build a more 
open society.

<P>
	On this International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, I urge all Canadians to reach out to their 
colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I urge Canadians everywhere to recognize that it is only when 
each and every one of us, no matter what our race, our religion, 
language or ethnicity, is able to participate fully that we will be a 
mature nation. We must hold ourselves up to the highest standards 
of respect and understanding if we are to continue to show the 
world what we can accomplish together.
<P>
	Canada has been called the prototype of the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	We have shown people how we can live together in peace and 
respect, how we can find non-violent ways of resolving differences 
and conflicts and how we can respect individual rights while 
maintaining justice for co-activities.
<P>
	We must always strive for that balance which creates a united 
nation while respecting the sum of its many parts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On this day, we must redouble our efforts. We must remain 
vigilant in fighting injustice and racial intolerance, both within our 
borders and around the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is an important day and I welcome the opportunity on 
behalf of the Government of Canada and my colleagues to present 
this statement. I look forward to the expressions of celebration and 
dedication that I am sure other members of the House would like to 
express.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, in principle, it should be 
the official opposition's turn, but it seems that their critic is not 
here yet. While we are waiting for the member of the official 
opposition, may the Reform Party have the floor?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I begin I 
would like to thank the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism for 
promoting this day in honour of the elimination of racial 
discrimination. At the meeting this morning we all heard wise 
words about what is happening around the world.
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I join my colleagues from all parties 
calling for an end to racial discrimination. I agree strongly with the 
themes being presented today. On  behalf of the Reform Party, I 
would like to say that racial discrimination in all forms is 
completely unacceptable.
<P>
	It is important to say this because I know there have been several 
false allegations levelled against Reformers in the past. I have 
personally heard individuals who have tried to paint our party as 
one that tolerates racist beliefs. However this was just political 
mischief on their part.
<P>
	I want the record to be perfectly clear. If there are any Canadians 
who think they can find a home for their racist beliefs in Reform 
they are dead wrong. Instead, they will find that they are not 
welcome and will be rooted out.
<P>
	It angers me that I even have to deny this ludicrous image. But 
Reformers will not accept the slurs of our political competitors 
without reply. A perfect example happened last night at our rally in 
Etobicoke North, a very ethnic riding. People from all ethnic 
backgrounds were there and I was delighted to see the terrific mix 
of people, as everyone will see from the newspapers today.
<P>
	I would like to give some advice to the government if it is 
willing to listen, and I know it is. In the quest to eradicate racial 
discrimination, it must be vigilant but it must not confuse the issues 
as it has often done in the past.
<P>
	The elimination of racial discrimination means that everyone has 
the right to be treated fairly and equally. Everyone has the same 
rights, everyone is equal. This means that institutionalizing reverse 
discrimination through bills like C-64 is wrong. Overlapping one 
layer of unfairness with another is no solution to problems.
<P>
	Instead, we have to make sure that Canadians of all ethnic 
backgrounds feel comfortable and proud to be who they are. All 
Canadians have to be given the chance to live up to their potential 
and this is done by looking beyond race and colour. It is done by 
judging the character and skills of people without regard to ethnic 
background. This is what Reformers believe and I think most 
Canadians would share this view.
<P>
	The time has come to abandon the prejudices of the past and 
abandon the reverse discrimination quick fixes that have not 
addressed the root of the racial problem. Let us make this day a 
new beginning. Let us work together to stamp out racism.
<P>
	I would like to quote what the Ambassador to South Africa said 
this morning at breakfast: ``Racism can, should and will be 
defeated''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this International Day for the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination. This event is quite timely, since the chief 
commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission tabled 
his annual report only two days ago.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1011"> 1011 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs rightly pointed out that Canada 
plays a leading role in the relentless fight against racism, hatred 
and prejudice.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the report tabled by the chief commissioner of the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission seriously tarnishes Canada's 
leadership in the global struggle against racism.
<P>
	The commissioner notes that the government has backtracked on 
the amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act that concern 
gays and lesbians. In this regard, he points out that this calls into 
question Canada's so-called leadership in the area of human rights, 
violates moral logic, and denies in a quasi-public way the many 
rights of good law-abiding, tax-paying Canadians.
<P>
	The commissioner shows that the government must go beyond 
lip service and show through concrete actions, through Canada's 
human rights legislation, that it wants to remain in the forefront of 
the fight against racism around the world.
<P>
	This example shows that the struggle against racism can never 
end and that even Canada is not beyond lowering its guard. We can 
only welcome yesterday's announcement by the Prime Minister 
that he would honour his commitment to the gay and lesbian 
communities.
<P>
	By marking this important day, we as Canadians and Quebecers 
must make a clear commitment to avoid letting up on human rights, 
as the commissioner pointed out. We must make it a basic duty to 
pursue the fight against injustice and racial intolerance, both within 
our borders through model legislation and abroad through effective 
and targeted action.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present two petitions. The 
first one concerns taxation of families and comes from Brighton, 
Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession, which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

<P>
	The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability. Specifically, fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risk associated with alcohol consumption.

constituents of my riding of Red Deer.
<P>
	The petitioners express their concerns that the availability of a 
low cost energy source is a natural advantage that Canadians have 
to offset the high cost of transportation because of the great

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-10, the borrowing authority bill.
<P>
	The bill authorizes the Minister of Finance as of April 1, 1996 to 
raise such amounts by way of a loan or by the issue and sale of 
securities of Canada as may be required for public works and 
general purpose. This in essence is the content of Bill C-10. I urge 
the House to pass the legislation so that regular financing 
operations for the government may continue.
<P>
	I will alert you, Mr. Speaker, to the fact that I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Edmonton East.
<P>
	Every government must decide where its priorities lie. This 
government has outlined its priorities in the latest budget. I believe 
it to be one of the best blueprints for growth and opportunity for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1013"> 1013 </A></B>
<P>
country since the red book. Traditional Liberal views are what this 
party is about and Liberalism recognizes that the government plays 
a part to make sure that the market works well for everyone. The 
course the government has set leads to equal opportunity, economic 
equity and national unity,  three main themes in the budget speech 
and in the direction the government is taking.
<P>
	First, if we look at social reform, the most vulnerable are 
protected in terms of employment insurance, as we have been 
assured that the impact of changes will not fall unfairly on workers 
who are in most need of support. This will ensure that there is equal 
opportunity for every individual in the country no matter which 
region they happen to live in.
<P>
	Who else can make the claim that they represent equal 
opportunity? The members of the third party certainly cannot. 
Whether it is the fishery, employment insurance, regional 
economic development, regardless of what it is, we know where 
they stand as far as Atlantic Canada is concerned.
<P>
	The contempt for Atlantic Canadians by the third party was 
demonstrated by the member for Fraser Valley West who, when 
asked about commenting that he would run in Nova Scotia in the 
next election, stated: ``I was trying to be nice because I knew it 
would be in the Atlantic Canadian papers. I did not want to say who 
the hell would want to run there''. This kind of inflammatory 
divisive statement does nothing to advance the cause of equality in 
a system for all Canadians.
<P>
	The announcement of an improvement to Canada's child support 
system with the particular objective of helping single parents and 
low income working families is very encouraging. This increased 
income from families living in poverty has been a particular 
concern of mine and many of my colleagues since being elected. I 
am pleased that the government is moving in that direction.
<P>
	The focus on jobs for youth is good news for New Brunswick 
and Fredericton-York-Sunbury in particular, as the summer 
career placement challenge program will double. This is an 
important change given the number of universities in the area. The 
emphasis on youth employment is very important and programs 
such as the youth services corps have served our province and my 
particular constituency very well.
<P>
	I welcome our commitment to build on these programs and the 
invitation to all of us to come up with more creative ideas. For 
example, we should be considering new ways of creating jobs such 
as recommending the distribution of work be changed so that the 
maximum allowable overtime annually by one worker is limited. 
This would encourage employers to hire more people and benefit 
the economy by reducing unemployment.
<P>
	The federal government with the private sector and the provinces 
could help students pay off their student loans through partnerships 
whereby the federal contribution could be the pay down on student 
loans. This would provide students with a lighter debt load and 
would create jobs for an age group that suffers unusually high rates 
of unemployment. Also it would contribute to worthwhile projects 
in all of our communities.
<P>
	A reaffirmation of our continuing commitment to the medicare 
system is reflected in the conditions set for the Canada health and 
social transfer. I am very pleased there is a commitment to 
establishing stable cash transfers from the federal government 
which will ensure that we are able to enforce national principles.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	Our social policy committee of caucus recommended separating 
cash from tax point revenues. I am delighted the government is 
headed in that direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Many Canadians disagree with the government's direct 
approach. They would like to talk about Canadian institutions like 
the Senate and find ways of improving them. Canadians want their 
country to do well. They want the various levels of government to 
be efficient and to fulfil their respective roles. They want the 
federation to be modernized. That is the direction we are headed in.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased with the emphasis the government has placed on 
technology, as Fredericton-York-Sunbury has been identified in 
many ways as a forward moving, high technology region. The high 
tech park in Fredericton is well on its way in our community. Our 
universities are information centres which offer much opportunity 
for growth, whether it is distance education at UNB or the 
dissemination of information to seniors through third age centre 
programs at St. Thomas. When we talk about technology and 
creating jobs, it is good news for our region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for national unity, it is not a matter of party politics. It is a 
matter of concern to all Canadians. It has been the government's 
position not to beat around the bush, by promising to involve every 
citizen of this country in the debate. As long as there is talk of yet 
another referendum in Quebec will, this government will discharge 
its responsibility in ensuring that everyone is acting above board, 
that the rules of the game are fair, that the consequences and 
implications are made clear and that, wherever they live, 
Canadians can have their say on the future of their country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Culture is an important component of identity. We are 
committed to strengthening such programs as the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, Telefilm Canada and the National Film 
Board. A country sharing a vision of itself is a country united.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At an upcoming first ministers' conference, we will have an 
opportunity to redefine the national economic development goal so 
as to determine our respective responsibilities as governments. 
Combined with the  governments' commitment to cultural institu-
<P>

tions, this approach clearly shows that those in power fully intend 
to keep our country united, and I commend them for that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I state again that I believe the budget was a reaffirmation of 
traditional Liberal values, addressing economic opportunity, social 
justice and national unity. I hope we can all recognize the 
importance of an unwavering commitment to this agenda so that 
we can keep the opportunities it creates alive for ourselves and for 
our children. I urge all members to support this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> By unanimous agreement we have agreed 
to go back to 20-minute speeches. It has not been indicated whether 
the text of the motion indicates there will be a question and answer 
period and the Chair has not been able to determine that. Therefore 
unless somebody can correct the Chair, we will go on the principle 
that we do have, if desired, a question and answer period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to what my friend opposite said. Unfortunately, I 
am not quite clear about what he said, and I would appreciate it if 
he could explain a few things to me.
<P>
	Yesterday in this House, the Prime Minister was questioned by 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, who asked him if he intented to 
hold a socio-economic summit like the one in Quebec City just 
yesterday. He said no. His answer was that the necessary public 
consultation had taken place at the time of the general election, in 
which his party was elected, and that that was enough.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	But it has been 24 or 26 months since the federal election. On the 
subject of culture, I remind the House that yesterday Mrs. Lambert, 
the Montreal architect, stressed the role Montreal plays in tourism 
and culture, as well as the need to preserve its architecture, and so 
on.
<P>
	Am I to conclude from the Prime Minister's answer-the hon. 
member will tell me-that he has innate knowledge and, more to 
the point, limitless knowledge, or should he not show humility 
instead and consult with his social, economic and cultural partners 
in the Canadian community?
<P>
	I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to respond to the question by the member.
<P>
	I point out a minor flaw in his preamble in reference to the fact 
that the government has not been a particularly consultative 
administration. In question period, although perhaps not coming 
from the member himself, most of the time the official opposition 
has challenged that the government consults too much.
<P>
	My experience as a member of Parliament has been to 
participate in the social security review which was a significant 
exercise in consultation. This type of exercise should not be limited 
to the Prime Minister or to the government. We all have a 
significant responsibility to consult with our own constituents in 
terms of the direction the country should take.
<P>
	In answer to his question, we have had a large number of 
consultations in Fredericton-York-Sunbury, 14 or 15. We had 
two consultations on the question of the budget. We had a 
consultation on health care, two consultations on the social security 
review and consultations on national defence and national unity 
following the referendum.
<P>
	Therefore I challenge the suggestion of the hon. member that the 
government and this Parliament have not been consultative, quite 
the contrary. I am quite pleased with the opportunity given to me as 
a member of Parliament to consult with my constituents and bring 
their concerns to this place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I get the impression that the hon. 
member is mixing things up but, since we must always assume that 
people are acting in good faith, I will not say ``deliberately''. 
However, when developing major policies, a ruling party has to 
conduct consultations throughout the land, to reach as many people 
as possible to develop a consensus.
<P>
	I know that the government does consult. It has even been 
criticized, and rightly so, for consulting regularly and often 
unnecessarily on some issues or subjects. Yesterday, in the debate 
on the motion concerning the committee set up by the Minister of 
Finance to review business taxation, we pointed out that this 
committee may not have been the ideal forum for consultation the 
minister could have devised.
<P>
	But when it comes to the general thrust of a country's 
socio-economic policies, I think that the government never once 
brought labour and the business community together as part of 
consultations on this subject. I would like the hon. member who 
just spoke to tell me this. Is it superfluous to gather all the 
socio-economic players around the same table in an attempt to 
create a consensus?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
only repeat what I said the first time the member put the question. I 
draw his attention to the social security review as an example.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1015"> 1015 </A></B>
<P>
	There were business, labour, social activists, women's groups, 
anti-poverty groups and university students. I believe we received 
600 briefs from organizations in all parts of Canada. It is probably 
one of the more comprehensive consultations ever been undertaken 
in the country.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I simply cannot concur that the government does not consult or 
that I have not been clear. On many occasions opposition members 
have challenged the government for consulting too much. I think 
that answers the question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to support Bill C-10, an act to provide for the borrowing 
authority.
<P>
	I enthusiastically support the budget tabled by the finance 
minister on March 6. It budget sets a course for our future, securing 
our financial future, securing our social programs, all of it in order 
to build a strong and united Canada which will be able to compete 
successfully in the world in the 21st Century.
<P>
	When the government embarked on this journey some 29 months 
ago Canada was at a fiscal and economic crossroads as a nation. It 
was faced with a structural deficit of over $42 billion and a debt of 
$508 billion which was growing much faster than our economic 
productivity.
<P>
	Our social programs were captive to the whims of financial 
markets and vulnerable to rising interest rates which drove up the 
cost of servicing the debt, putting increased pressure on medicare, 
our social safety net and our public pension system.
<P>
	It is a vicious cycle and it has exacted a heavy toll on Canadians. 
It sapped consumer confidence. It soaked up our domestic savings. 
It has increased our foreign indebtedness, reduced our productivity 
and dried up investment and job creation. We were on an 
unsustainable course. Quite simply, Canadians had lost faith in the 
capacity of the federal government to competently manage its 
fiscal affairs and create a climate for economic growth, investment 
and job creation.
<P>
	Over the past 29 months our government has taken dramatic, 
decisive and disciplined action based on what Canadians told us in 
their local communities.
<P>
	We listened when Canadians told us to refocus our spending 
priorities toward areas that are building blocks for our nation's 
future in a competitive world marketplace: a sustainable, publicly 
funded medicare system; a secure social safety net for vulnerable 
Canadians; an affordable pension system; investments  geared to 
achieving the vast current and future potential for our youth.
<P>
	The government is on track to meet these deficit targets: $24.3 
billion in 1996-97. The deficit will be reduced 60 per cent over four 
years through fundamental and structural changes in our spending 
habits, the lowest level since 1949-50.
<P>
	Over the past three years cumulative spending reductions have 
outstripped tax revenue measures by a ratio of seven to one. Six 
hundred and four thousand jobs have been created since we took 
office. There is further action in budget 1996.
<P>
	Budget 1996 takes steps to put our social programs on a 
sustainable and affordable path. We have established a floor level 
for cash transfers under the Canada health and social transfer and 
we have put in place a five-year funding allocation arrangement 
which recognizes for the first time population growth in provinces 
such as Alberta.
<P>
	We have established a new seniors benefit that will ensure future 
generations will reap the benefits of their contributions to the 
country. We have revamped the child support system to secure a 
future for children, our most valuable resource.
<P>
	These are major achievements which resulted from our political 
will and our commitment to listen to the collective wisdom of 
Canadians.
<P>
	On the evening of budget 1996 I held a budget round table in 
Edmonton East. It included small business owners, students, 
seniors, representatives from community associations and 
agencies. After watching the budget speech we conferences by 
telephone to discuss the impacts on Edmonton East. The general 
collective wisdom was that the budget took a careful and balanced 
approach to reducing the deficit by putting the interests of people 
first.
<P>
	Round table participants pointed out that reducing the deficit 
was simply a means to an end. It creates positive conditions for 
economic growth, investment and job creation, and it improves the 
standard of living for all Canadians.
<P>
	This shows the effectiveness of the government program review, 
the process designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars are value for 
money and are allocated to people's priorities.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	Program review is not only about spending less money, but 
spending it wisely, more effectively and more efficiently by 
measuring the results achieved. There has been a fundamental 
difference between the carefully measured approach toward getting 
the fiscal house in order and the slash and burn approach of the 
Reform Party of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1016"> 1016 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will sustain national standards in medicare and 
will ensure the viability of the social safety  net. It will secure the 
public pension retirement system for future generations of seniors. 
It will protect children and target investments toward people and 
technology. This is what will build the innovative economy needed 
to compete on the world stage.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada is proposing to reduce benefits to 
seniors by $3 billion over three years, to reduce funding to 
unemployment insurance by $3.4 billion, to reduce transfers to the 
provinces for equalization, health care, post-secondary education 
and social assistance by $6.5 billion over three years.
<P>
	While the Reform Party is proposing to eliminate the fiscal 
deficit over three years, it would create a human deficit of such 
epic proportions it would hamper Canada's ability to compete 
effectively. It would leave those who are most vulnerable in 
Canadian society to fend for themselves, denying them the 
opportunity to participate and to contribute in building an 
innovative economy for the future.
<P>
	What the Reform Party seems to forget is that deficit reduction is 
more than just numbers. It is about the future of people. When the 
Reform Party holds up the Klein government as a standard for 
deficit reduction, it fails to look beyond the numbers.
<P>
	Fifty-eight per cent of the reduction in Alberta's deficit over four 
years, or $2.3 billion, comes from increases in personal and 
corporate tax revenues, oil and gas revenue windfalls, video slot 
machines, health care premium increases, profit from the provinces 
own commercial businesses and offloading to local governments.
<P>
	Let us be clear for the record. The unconditional provincial grant 
to municipalities in Alberta has been reduced by 69 per cent from 
$1.74 billion to $58 million over four years. The provincial grant 
for community and family service support has been reduced by 
nearly 25 per cent.
<P>
	Participants in our Edmonton East budget round table were 
unanimous in their view that slash and burn budgeting is not the 
answer to achieving long term stability for Canada and security for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Measures to reallocate existing program spending toward the 
SchoolNet program that will ensure affordable access to the 
information highway for small to medium sized businesses and to 
encourage education and skill development through employment 
measures were seen as really positive by Edmonton East.
<P>
	Although 604,000 jobs were created since the Liberals took 
office and the unemployment rate has been reduced by 2 per cent, 
our Edmonton East group wisely pointed out that youth 
unemployment continues to be far too high, sapping Canada's 
future economic potential. As one participant said, dealing with the 
human deficit of youth unemployment should be a priority for the 
government.
<P>
	There was general support among the Edmonton East group 
regarding the government's focus on boosting Canada's innovative 
capacity as a means for fuelling productivity and growth. The 
establishment of Technology Partnership Canada will certainly be 
helpful to areas in Alberta where it is a growing sector of the 
economy.
<P>
	Small business owners in Edmonton East share the national 
problem of securing capital and export markets for their 
businesses. They comprise 90 per cent of all Alberta businesses and 
create over 70 per cent of all new jobs on an annual basis. Their 
continued health and access to capital is absolutely critical.
<P>
	Since we have come to office, we have done much to assist in 
this way. We have reduced regulations and paperwork. We have 
introduced single window business service centres and we continue 
to reduce the unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	Budget '96 has taken further action. A program will be instituted 
in which 2,000 computer students will help connect 50,000 small 
businesses to the Internet. Fifty million dollars in new equity 
capital will be provided to the Export Development Corporation 
and $50 million will be projected into the Business Development 
Bank.
<P>
	Participants in the Edmonton East Budget '96 round table also 
indicated their support with the tax fairness and equity measures 
contained in the budget. No tax increases, not personal, not 
corporate, not excise, not gas, was seen very positively by our 
group in Edmonton East. Our intention to consult Canadians on 
how the business taxation system could be improved was seen as 
vital. Canadians within their local communities, particularly small 
business owners, have valuable advice for us on the business 
taxation review.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Concern was expressed in Edmonton East about giving 
provincial governments, such as Alberta, increased flexibility over 
the design and administration of social programs. Many in 
Edmonton East had experienced firsthand the Klein government's 
dismantling of the health care system and its attack on the most 
vulnerable in society, the poor, the sick, the young and the aged.
<P>
	Participants were relieved to hear the government reaffirm its 
commitment to sustain Canada's social programs by taking action. 
The $11 billion floor level for cash transfers was considered 
favourable. Implementing a five-year funding allocation 
arrangement for the CHST that emphasizes growth in population is 
seen also as fair for Alberta.
<P>
	Ensuring that CHST cash allocations are tied to the provinces 
upholding the five basic principles of the Canada Health Act and 
the no minimum residency requirements for social assistance is 
also positive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1017"> 1017 </A></B>
<P>
	Our Edmonton East group has agreed with the need to set 
priorities for our future. One key priority is to maintain national 
standards within social programs, such as medicare, as a means 
of investing in people. There was absolutely no support for the 
dismantling of the publicly funded medicare system or massive 
commercialization or delisting of health care services as has been 
advocated by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The Edmonton East group believed that our network of social 
programs is a reflection of our unique Canadian identity. This is a 
unity issue. It is an example of how Canadian federalism can work 
effectively to meet the needs of its citizens.
<P>
	Edmonton East wants to be involved in the discussions leading 
to the development of shared values, principles and objectives, 
those that will underlie the CHST and the social union. They want 
to ensure that core Canadian values-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is extremely 
difficult to sit here, coming from the same province, and listen to a 
message that I know the people are not conveying in our province. 
The people are saying: ``What about the MP pension plan? You talk 
about setting an example and showing us that you really care about 
us. Are you taking the pension that none of us can get after only six 
years at age 55? Do you think that is fair? Is that setting an 
example''? I know what the people in Alberta are saying.
<P>
	The member who just spoke had a meeting of 17 people and we 
had 800 people out to a meeting on the same evening. I know what 
the people there were saying. It is very difficult to sit here and 
listen to a misrepresentation of the grassroots. They care that their 
income is continually dropping.
<P>
	The member is right. They care about medicare and so do we. 
They care about those terrible waiting lists that exist now. They 
care about the downsizing and the offloading that the Liberals are 
doing while saying that they are holier than thou. It is time they set 
an example instead of being all talk and no action.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question.
<P>
	Clearly, the people of Canada really need to be heard and 
understood. Each of us has a tremendous responsibility within our 
ridings to fairly represent the thoughts, feelings, wishes and desires 
of those people.
<P>
	We also recognize that there are differences in the thoughts, 
feeling and opinions of the people of various ridings and people 
within ridings. But of incredible importance is the honest effort and 
desire to meet with and discuss matters with the people.
<P>
	I have found it incredibly important to bring to Parliament the 
voices of the people of Edmonton East. We have discussed the 
issues. Our greatest desire is to bring understanding of these issues.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I have held nine forums on different issues of interest to 
Edmonton East. We have talked about aboriginal youth justice and 
euthanasia. We have included panellists who know and understand 
those issues so they can share with us the importance of 
understanding the issues before we make our decisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is once again showing its 
inability to provide measures that are fair to all Canadians and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Once again, low income people will be the ones paying for the 
Liberal government's unrealistic projects, for its shallow financial 
policies, for overlap, for the expense accounts of senior public 
servants-more on this later-for the maintenance of tax 
loopholes, not to mention useless structures-and the term useless 
is indeed the appropriate one-such as the other place, whose 
members were sleeping-and I will say it again to be 
understood-members of the other place were sleeping when the 
speech from the throne was being delivered.
<P>
	I think it would be in the interest of all Canadians and Quebecers 
to know how this came about. In 1867, the provinces that 
subscribed to the idea of a common pact had faith. The agreement 
was based on mutual trust. Consent was given following an 
agreement based on mutual trust. However, the progressive 
centralization of power in Ottawa gradually deprived the provinces 
of what little power they had left.
<P>
	This centralizing process reached its peak under the government 
of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. This is when the economy started to 
collapse. All hell broke loose, as we say. In 1977-78, Canada's 
deficit was $10 billion. The following year, it stood at $12.6 
billion. A $2.6 billion increase in one year is some kind of a record.
<P>
	The saga continued under Mr. Trudeau's successors. Former 
minister Allan MacEachen managed to accumulate a $56 billion 
deficit in three years. Marc Lalonde accumulated $70 billion over a 
period of two fiscal years. Michael Wilson accumulated $146 
billion in six years. As for the current finance minister, time will 
tell whether he will pick up the pace in terms of reducing the debt, 
without adversely affecting the poor. I doubt he will.
<P>
	Since the Trudeau years, Canada's spending has exceeded its 
revenues. We gave up the essential for the accessory. Imagine a 
family saying: ``We do not have  money to buy groceries this week 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1018"> 1018 </A></B>
<P>
because we treated ourselves over the weekend?''. It simply does 
not make sense.
<P>
	This financial abyss is the result of the fight led by Mr. Trudeau 
to crush Quebec separatists by throwing money out the window to 
ensure greater federal visibility. This is what has been dubbed the 
war of the flags. Faced with Quebec's wish to be recognized by the 
international community, the current Prime Minister said: ``What 
separatists want is a Quebec flag on the hood of diplomatic cars''. 
And that person is our Prime Minister. The level of discussion in 
this House can be really low. I can understand why visitors in the 
public gallery are disappointed by this circus. I am an elected 
member and even I sometimes get depressed when I go back to my 
riding, in Beauport. The lack of decorum in this House is simply 
incredible.
<P>
	By the way, in 1975, the accumulated debt was $23,958,000,000.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	After the Conservatives came to power, the debt rose 
substantially, reaching $125.625 billion by 1983, and it has 
continued to climb ever since, now standing at close to $600 
billion, the equivalent of $20,000 for each Canadian in the country, 
whatever their age. From the tiniest infant born a few minutes ago 
to the oldest person in the land, a 103 year old Quebec woman, they 
all have this $20,000 hanging over their head.
<P>
	Now, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are 
overcome with remorse over their earlier financial management 
under the Trudeau government, realizing they had better do 
something with a federal election coming up, if this budget is any 
indication. We in the Bloc Quebecois have news for the Liberals. 
We are ready for them in the next federal election. They have 
decided to bring down an election minded budget. Fine. But this 
social reform is a source of discontent throughout the country, both 
in Quebec and in the other provinces. A demonstration by people 
exasperated by the situation is the top story in the news and 
concrete proof of the mood in the country.
<P>
	And this brings me back to the lack of decorum in this House, 
about which I spoke earlier. I would like to add my comments, to 
give my opinion, regarding the remarks made by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, which were the epitome of 
arrogance. This same Minister of Human Resources Development 
used the term ``baveux'' in referring to a colleague, this was 
acknowledged, and he was not asked to withdraw his comment. 
This is the same Minister of Human Resources Development who 
called the demonstrators against unemployment insurance reform 
lazy people with nothing better to do on a Sunday. There were 
5,000 people demonstrating in Amqui, in the Matapédia valley. In 
other words, 5,000 lazy souls with nothing better to do on a Sunday 
than take part in a demonstration. This is  an arrogant disregard for 
the unemployed workers of Quebec and of Canada. It is 
unbelievable.
<P>
	I knew the Minister of Human Resources Development in the 
days when I was transport critic. This is the same man who, at a 
WESTAC meeting in Winnipeg on October 5 or 9, 1994, had the 
following to say about railway workers:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Railway workers cannot be blamed for negotiating excessive 
labour contracts because they only have a grade nine education''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What an insult to the 62,000 railway workers in Canada, to say 
that they cannot be blamed for negotiating excessive labour 
contracts because they have only a grade nine education. I know the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is a lawyer, but I was 
taught-and I too am a lawyer-that competency and intelligence 
were not handed out along with your diploma. Having a diploma up 
on the wall does not make you any more competent. When a 
minister who ought to be concerned about labour issues behaves 
like that, one wonders: Is this normal. Is it acceptable in a society 
like ours to be labelled ``baveux'', swine, spineless, shiftless? It is 
unacceptable. We do not accept it, nor do the people we represent. 
This does not have anything to do with party allegiance, either, for 
in our riding offices we have federalists, both Liberal and 
Conservative coming in to tell us: ``We will not stand for such 
unacceptable language. Denounce it.''
<P>
	And we do exactly that, when we have the chance, and that is 
what I am doing.
<P>
	What I wanted to illustrate was how the government is always 
picking on the same groups. One wonders whether the heart of the 
government is in the right place. What is proposed in this budget is 
a semblance of decentralization, but with the provinces retaining 
only a few theoretical powers, while following in the wake of 
Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau made a statement 
only a few months ago to the effect that decentralization of power 
would be the death of Canada. The present Prime Minister, and the 
present Minister of Finance, not wishing to contradict their mentor, 
are putting tools in place that will increase the decision making 
powers of the central government.
<P>
	It cannot be denied; the federal government is continually 
encroaching on the exclusive jurisdictions of the provinces, 
guaranteed to them by the Constitution. The overlap it deliberately 
created in the area of social security hampers the provinces' ability 
to establish any effective policies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1019"> 1019 </A></B>
<P>
	The measures in the 1996-97 budget do nothing to contribute 
to reducing expenditures or this year's deficit. On the contrary, 
what we got was an additional expenditure of $104 million over 
the 1995-96 budget. The government is behaving as if it had 
created no waste, as if there was no duplication and as if there 
were no tax inequities. You would think there were no 
unemployed, no such thing as bankruptcy and no cases of violence 
arising from the state of the economy, because sometimes we tend 
to neglect this in our debates.
<P>
	There is a lot of talk about job creation and the economy, but 
what does that do for tension in couples, in homes and among 
young people? What affects the level of suicide among young 
people and the dropping out rate? We should ask the question. Let 
us go to the source of the problem. What are they related to? Is it 
because things are going well? Are things going well?
<P>
	Go and talk to the principal of a secondary school or a 
comprehensive school. Ask her how her students are doing. Ask 
her whether things have improved or worsened in her 25 years in 
education. It is incredible; it is a disaster, and I think we have to 
point out the link, a direct one in my opinion, between dropping out 
of school, suicide among young people, domestic violence, 
including violence against children, and the state of the economy.
<P>
	I am not excusing those who commit violence, but, perhaps, 
when people are discouraged and feeling hugely stressed, they lose 
their patience. When all is calm, it is easy to control one's nerves.
<P>
	As the chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, 
I am very concerned over the use made of public funds. The 
reduction of the deficit, the Minister of Finance's pride and joy, is 
surreptitious, because the minister drew $5 billion from the surplus 
in the UI fund. This money comes directly out of the pockets of 
employers and employees, because, as we know, it is their 
contributions that keep the system afloat. The surplus might have 
perhaps been used to offset the continued under-employment of 
society's most disadvantaged.
<P>
	The minister is using public funds to buoy up Canada's financial 
rating on international markets, thereby forcing the people of his 
own country into a social crisis. Not only is he misleading 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, he is misleading international 
partners by falsifying the situation in Canada.
<P>
	Quebec considers this budget unacceptable, because it suffers 
the most when funding is on a per capita basis. According to this 
principle, Quebec alone will bear the brunt of 42 per cent of 
funding cuts. To make this bitter pill easier to swallow in Quebec, 
the federal government is announcing a one year delay, but what it 
is not saying is that the machinery has already been set in motion.
<P>
	Moreover, the cuts announced last year, which are coming into 
effect this year, amount to $2.5 billion, of  which $650 million in 
Quebec. In short, it is business as usual, Quebec is paying and the 
rest of Canada is lining its pocket.
<P>
	With regard to employment, the government is boasting it is 
creating jobs. The Prime Minister, answering a question from the 
Leader of the Opposition, replied: ``Look at what journalists have 
been saying about our budget. They all think it is a good budget''. I 
would like to quote the results of a SOM-<I>Le Soleil</I> poll conducted 
between March 1 and 6; 1,000 individuals throughout Quebec were 
asked: ``Are you counting on the federal budget to stimulate job 
creation?'' Twenty-eight per cent answered a little; 25 per cent 
answered not at all; 53 per cent of respondents know full well that 
the federal budget will contribute nothing to job creation, a fact 
which has proven true to a large extent.
<P>

<P>
	With regard to our young people, the government is earmarking 
$60 million more for student employment, but on the other hand, is 
reducing post-secondary education funding by $150 million in 
1996-97, and $400 to $500 million in 1997-98. These cuts are sure 
to result in increased tuition fees, which will limit access to 
education.
<P>
	In this Parliament, we have young people working as pages, 
young people who are benefitting from the democratic availability 
of education. Under the present system, young people from any 
social background can go to university for reasonable, acceptable 
fees. The kind of family or background they come from matters 
not. This is what democratization of education really means.
<P>
	If we go ahead with the increase, if we double or triple tuition 
fees-we could ask the young pages who work here if they would 
still be able to afford a university education if tuition fees were 
doubled or tripled. Possibly many would say they would not 
because they are not from a well-to-do family. There is a real 
danger in a country when you create two social classes of people.
<P>
	Rich people can afford health care, they can send their children 
to university, but if you have the misfortune of coming from a 
middle-class family or one that is a bit hard up, you cannot afford 
health care and university. So you are condemned to low-paying 
jobs and that does not make for what I would consider a more 
equitable country.
<P>
	How can we put public finances in order if, at the same time, we 
let senior public servants run up travel and expense accounts to the 
tune of $691 million? I see members of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts that I chair and I know that when time comes to 
examine this issue in committee, members from all parties will 
accept that we take a close look at those $691 million, a figure that 
was stated by Yves Séguin from the Mouvement pour le 
redressement économique du Québec.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Another example of the federal government not encouraging job 
creation is the allowable amounts for tax credits. This is seriously 
threatening the viability of venture capital funds of Quebec labour 
confederations like the FTQ and the CSN which create thousands 
of jobs. It seems there are 19 such funds all over Canada. It is 
not an issue that concerns only Quebec.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Minister of Finance does not want to 
encourage such constructive and viable initiatives. Instead, he puts 
in place a technical committee on business taxation, some 
members of which are already taking advantage of tax shelters 
offered to businesses having branches in countries considered tax 
heavens.
<P>
	I could also, but I do not have time, talk about the $6.4 billion in 
unpaid taxes by more than 400,000 delinquent taxpayers. Ordinary 
people listening to us who are about to file their income tax return, 
if they did not already do so, and include their cheque, would they 
have the right to be like the 400,000 delinquent taxpayers and not 
pay their income tax? It does not matter, the government is not 
going after them. It is not going after the $6.4 billion. This is 
incredible.
<P>
	I could also have talked about old age pensions, talked about 
interference or talked about child support payments. Unfortunately, 
you are signalling that I am running out of time.
<P>
	To conclude, with this budget, the government is proving once 
more that it is incapable of managing, of showing imagination and 
audacity in the search for solutions, and that it is incapable of 
acting in good faith to tackle, once and for all, the problems of the 
public debt and unemployment. This budget contains some 
paradoxical measures. It seems to be giving with one hand, while 
with the other taking away the means for people to get by.
<P>
	It is high time that the present federal system be seriously 
revamped. It stifles development of the provinces, which now are 
simply regional branches. As to the majority of Quebecers, they 
believe that it is through sovereignty and creation of a new 
partnership, in an atmosphere favourable to good negotiations, that 
we will reach, together, the balance required to grow as peoples.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sorry the hon. member from the Bloc is angry, disturbed and 
distraught about Canada. Life in Canada, the best country in the 
world, is very wonderful. I hope he will soon find peace and learn 
how to enjoy this wonderful country.
<P>
	The member made several references in his comments about 
Canada and Quebec taxpayers. I understand the member is a 
separatist and does not respect Canada, but I  invite him to get to 
know the rest of Canada by travelling outside of Quebec. He should 
believe, as I do, that he owns a bit of every part of Canada, every 
province, the lakes, the Rockies, Banff, the beautiful prairies and 
the wonderful maritimes. Walk on the rocks of Peggy's Cove and 
he will fall in love with Canada again and again.
<P>
	The member also asked whether this party had a heart. This party 
does have a heart and a soul; it is in the Prime Minister who we all 
know always speaks straight from the heart.
<P>
	The member in most of his speech basically said we have a lot of 
economic problems in Canada and gave examples of the 
consequences. He referred to things like school dropouts, teen 
suicides, et cetera. He contradicted himself by saying we were 
interfering in the areas that are exclusive jurisdictions of the 
provinces.
<P>
	Schools are under the responsibility of provincial jurisdiction 
and the dropout rate now in Canada is something like 22 per cent. If 
he speaks to the school boards he will find out most school boards 
are not dealing properly with dropouts. They are spending a lot of 
money on school dropouts but they are spending it on kids who 
have already dropped out. They are not spending anything on 
children who are thinking about dropping out.
<P>
	Rather than trying to rip the heart out of the country would it not 
be a better use of the member's time to start working within his 
riding to make sure we are spending and focusing our limited 
dollars on trying to prevent problems rather than reacting to them?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Mississauga-South mentioned that I should go to various places in 
Canada to get to know it. I will offer him the same thing. It is 
unfortunate that he will not be able to answer, but I wanted to ask 
him if he has ever been very close to my riding, in 
Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges, if he has ever travelled around the Île 
d'Orléans, if he has ever been on the Beaupré coast, if he has ever 
seen the heritage character of the Royale Avenue, in Beauport.
<P>
	It reminds me that, in 1980, when I was campaigning door to 
door and speaking with Mrs. Asselin, my neighbour in Chicoutimi, 
she told me: ``Michel, I cannot vote yes, because we will lose the 
Rockies''. I said: ``But the Montmorency falls in my riding will not 
stop flowing if we become sovereign tomorrow morning. A valve 
will not be installed at the top of them. We will be able to come and 
visit them, and we will be able to go see the Rockies''. The Alps are 
in a different country, and when we want to visit them, we take the 
plane and go see them.
<P>
	The Rocky Mountains as the symbol of Canadian unity, what a 
joke. Anyway, you are cutting the railway, you are cutting the very 
thing that led to Canada being  built, the railway. And you, the 
Liberals, are hacking it to bits. Mr. Bouchard, last night, said it: a 
project such as the high speed train, which could link Quebec to 
Windsor, would be an interesting partnership project. I made some 
speeches here on the HST, some carefully wrought speeches at 5.30 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1021"> 1021 </A></B>
<P>
p.m., the best time slot, and of the 177 Liberal members in front of 
me who could have come to listen to my speech on the HST-on 
which I had worked three days and three nights-not one was there 
to listen to it. So, you do not have a prayer.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of the ``best country in the world'', yet, 
he seems to be forgetting that the ``best country in the world'' is 
mortgaged to the hilt and living on credit. Personally, I could have 
a fantastic lifestyle if I loaded my credit cards to the limit. That is 
precisely what the ``best country in the world'' is doing. It is living 
on borrowed money, with every single baby born in the past ten 
minutes already saddled with a $20,000 debt. It is incredible. They 
will never convince us that ours is the ``best country in the world''.
<P>
	The hon. member said: ``I understand, the member is a 
separatist''. Just saying the word ``separatist'' makes them feel 
better. Yes, I am a separatist. The member is right. I admit it. But 
saying that I do not like Canada is not true.
<P>
	What we want, far from destroying your country, is a country we 
can call our own. I like Canada, and I do enjoy travelling in 
Canada. When I am in Vancouver, I find English Bay quite 
beautiful. When I visited Thunder Bay with the hon. member for 
Thunder Bay, I enjoyed Lake Superior. We do not want to destroy 
your country, but simply to build our own.
<P>
	Furthermore, we heard the hon. member's heartfelt cry, because 
the Liberal Party does have a heart. That reminded me of 1967, 
when I first got interested in politics. I was only 14 years old then, 
but I still remember the large signs saying: ``Canada, stand 
together; understand together''. We are now in 1996, but how could 
we explain that we reacted to such words in 1967? How is it that 
nowadays, in 1996, there are still 50 or 51 per cent of people in 
Quebec saying that this country is not working? Will you, once and 
for all, get it into your head that this country is not working? Get 
that into your head.
<P>
	Why is it that, since 1967, there are sovereignists saying: ``We 
want to get out. Let us go. We want to leave''? Why are you not 
letting us go? Because it suits you that we stay.
<P>
	Here is my last point, because I want to give other members who 
would like to speak the opportunity to do so. I like that, it gives us 
the opportunity to make another speech.
<P>
	Dropping out from school, I agree with the hon. member, falls 
within the school boards' jurisdiction. I  agree that it is up to the 
school boards to put whatever energy the money is needed into 
preventing dropping out. However, when I made my point about 
dropping out, it was to point out that that happens within a whole 
economic climate, like suicide among young people. We see an 
increase in the number of dropouts in the current economic 
conditions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we need to move this debate away from the heated 
rhetoric which has been taking place here today to the issue that 
really counts, the people of Canada, those of Longueuil, Lac-Saint 
Jean, Montreal, Papineau-St. Michel, Toronto, Hawkesbury or 
Victoria.
<P>
	The issues being discussed today affect everybody in the 
country. The hon. member brought up the issue of overlap in 
government. This is a problem we are all labouring under. We need 
to solve this problem for all our constituents, including Canadians 
in Quebec.
<P>
	The net transfer of payments in the order of billions of dollars 
has been going to Quebec for many years. Where does it come 
from? It comes from the west, British Columbia and Alberta. Do 
the people of Alberta and B.C. complain? Absolutely not. Why? At 
this time we are enjoying economic prosperity whereas the east is 
not.
<P>
	Since we are all Canadians we do not mind transferring the funds 
to the east to help other individuals in the country who are not 
doing as well. That is a part of being a Canadian.
<P>
	What will they do when the transfer funds are eliminated if they 
separate? The business community has repeatedly told the premier 
of Quebec that if there is separation there will be a huge negative 
economic impact on the people of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	What does the hon. member think about that, and what does he 
think about our 20-20 plan which is a comprehensive plan on how 
to decentralize federal-provincial jurisdictions for all Canadians 
across the country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member speaks 
about the transfers to the provinces, about equalization, he says that 
the people of Alberta and British-Columbia are paying a lot to 
support other provinces. Should we not also think about the poverty 
level in the Maritimes? Is British-Columbia paying for the 
Maritimes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> But when he says: ``We are paying and we are 
glad to be part of Canada'', I want to remind the hon. member that I 
went to Vancouver, last year, at the invitation of two Reform 
members, to speak on the  sovereign movement in Quebec. I was 
even invited as a guest speaker at the annual meeting of the Reform 
Party to talk about the sovereign movement. What do we hear more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1022"> 1022 </A></B>
<P>
and more often in British-Columbia about Quebec: ``Let them go. 
Let them go. We are sick of paying. Let them go.''
<P>
	To which we answer: ``We want to go. Let us go. You say that 
you are sick of paying for us, that you are sick of supporting us. 
Because you seem to think that you are supporting us. Very well, 
then let us go; we want to go. Let us go. Stop paying $99 trips from 
Vancouver to Montreal to come and tell us that you love us just 
three days before the referendum.''
<P>
	Do you really love us right now? You say you love us, but is it 
really true, with all the insults you hurl our way in the House? 
Quebecers will not be taken in at the next referendum. They will 
never forget the rally held on October 27, 1995. We will not be 
fooled again.
<P>
	The NDP member from Burnaby said: ``Next time, 60 per cent of 
Quebecers will vote yes.'' The hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway is right; he knows Quebec and shows some 
respect for Quebecers' wishes.
<P>
	The hon. member also talked about the companies that could flee 
Quebec. Do you think these companies have decided to settle in 
Quebec just because they like us?
<P>
	I was born in Chicoutimi, just like the hon. member representing 
the riding of Chicoutimi. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, 
we have Alcan and the paper mills. Why do you think Alcan chose 
to settle in Arvida, far away from the big markets? We are used to 
seeing aluminium plants springing up close to Chicago or Boston. 
Why do you think Alcan chose Arvida, in the depths of the 
country? Because of a natural resource called hydro. God created 
the Shipshaw and the Saguenay rivers and Alcan harnessed them to 
produce electricity.
<P>
	This is why some companies have chosen the province of 
Quebec. These companies are not in Quebec because they like us or 
just to please us. Their goal is to make money. No matter what 
political system is in place, if there is no longer any money to be 
made, these companies would take up and leave. There is no money 
to be made here anymore? Let us go to the Philippines or to 
Mexico.
<P>
	Once Quebec is sovereign, these companies will remain in 
Quebec if there is still money to be made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Lincoln.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc member is long on demagoguery and very short on 
substance. He started shouting because he did not like hearing 
questions asked by another member.  Maybe he did not like these 
questions, but I can tell him I did not like his answers at all, to put it 
bluntly.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that the member opposite is 
disrespectful of the Quebec people, of Quebec electors when he 
says: ``Let us go''. He knows the people in his province said the 
contrary in a referendum. Who is lacking respect in this House? 
The hon. member who just spoke. This kind of demagoguery is in 
no way conducive to good understanding.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I could also comment on his speech on the budget and the 
government's economic policy. Did he forget-I know he will 
listen carefully to what I have to say-that 600,000 more 
Canadians have found a job since the government came into office? 
Did he forget that? Why did he not mention it? Of course, too many 
Canadians are unemployed, but, at least, 600,000 more have a job 
now. What is the difference between interest rates now and on 
election day? Canadians know that our economy has improved 
thanks to the good management and leadership of our Prime 
Minister and Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Let us talk a little about the deficit, another point the hon. 
member criticized. The deficit went from 6.6 per cent to 3 per cent 
of the gross domestic product this year and will go down to 2 per 
cent next year. We are close, in Canada, to having a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	In 1993, when we were canvassing and telling people that we 
would bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of the GDP, many did not 
believe us and said it was not possible. Why? Because the previous 
government had never kept its word. In nine years, it never 
succeeded in making year-end figures and budget agree. As for us, 
we never failed even once in three years to make them agree. That 
is the difference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> That is great planning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Thanks to good management and to good planning 
by the Minister of Finance and our government, as my colleague 
said. Sure, we had to make some cuts. But we did not do it in the 
Mike Harris style. That is why we do not see tens of thousands of 
demonstrators today in front of Parliament.
<P>
	Yes, we had to cut, but we proceeded according to humanitarian 
principles, which is the best way to do things, and not as members 
of the Reform Party would have it, that is, cutting even more than 
we did to reduce the deficit. Of course, this depends on which 
Reform members we are talking about because some of them, like 
the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, are a little more 
reasonable than others. But some of them are extremists who would 
cut everything now in the Mike Harris style. In that case, we would 
have demonstrations. We would see people reduced to a state of 
dire poverty as so many have been by the Ontario government. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1023"> 1023 </A></B>
<P>
is not what we want. We want to treat people decently. Of  course, 
we have to make cuts, but we also want to treat people with respect.
<P>
	Listen to what certain Canadians have to say about the budget. 
Let me read quote a few of them. Most Canadians, men and 
women, know what Mrs. Solange Denis said, and I quote: ``No, I 
do not think that they took advantage of me to catch people's 
attention. I agree entirely with Mr. Martin's plan. I have always 
supported the Liberals.'' Bill Good is the host of an open-line 
program in British-Columbia, and it is well known that, in that part 
of the country, they do not always agree with the measures 
proposed by the Liberal Party. He said, and I quote: ``The Minister 
of Finance gained a lot of credibility by meeting the goals he had 
set, namely, by keeping interest rates relatively low.'' I ask the 
members opposite to listen carefully as I continue: ``International 
investors now think that the Minister of Finance is serious about 
reducing the deficit.'' Members of the Reform Party would learn a 
lot if only they listened to Bill Good. He also said this: ``Yes, they 
would want him to go faster, but he met the goals set and, in fact, he 
even exceeded them, something neither Mike Wilson nor Don 
Mazankowski even accomplished.'' He said that, not I.
<P>
	So that is what people say.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I can quote others. Jeffrey Simpson, of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, who 
is not considered to be a great Liberal, said: ``If only the federal 
government had presented ten years ago a budget similar to those 
of the last two years, including yesterday's budget-'' That was on 
March, 7. Those are the praises we are hearing.
<P>
	Ghislain Dufour, president of the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Now, there is a friend of mine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>Mr. Speaker, I wish the member would listen 
carefully and with all due respect. I am asking him to listen.
<P>
	This is what Mr. Dufour said: ``From a consolidation and 
continuity standpoint, it seems like a good budget''. That was said 
by Mr. Dufour.
<P>
	I can quote a few more. Bernard Derome, who does not 
frequently praise the Liberal Party, especially not during a 
referendum campaign, but that is another matter. Mr. Derome said: 
``Basically, the business community is satisfied. At least, it seems 
to be reassured. It feels that the Minister of Finance, since last year, 
has regained control over public finance''. I must say that I 
expected some praise, but not from him.
<P>
	There are many more people. Claude Edwards, president of the 
seniors' coalition for social equality. People talk about social 
justice, as do certain members of the Bloc Quebecois-of course, 
some of them talk of something else, but others do talk about it. I 
tell them:  ``That was in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> dated March 7''. Mr. 
Edwards said, and I quote: ``A number of things that we appreciate 
and that we had asked for were done''. He speaks for the coalition 
of seniors.
<P>
	You see, the budget is supported almost unanimously, except, of 
course, for some members on the other side. Our world is not 
perfect. But besides them, most Canadians, be they business 
people, seniors, private citizens or prominent Canadians, have 
good things to say about the budget.
<P>
	Of course, we succeeded in putting public finance in order. Our 
government achieved that. People are almost unanimous in 
admitting it. We will continue on the right track, manage well, 
avoid wasting public funds and restore respect among the 
population for government, not only for our government but also 
for future governments. Moreover, we will give Canadians the ray 
of hope that we want so dearly to give them.
<P>
	I say to the hon. members on the other side that if they want jobs 
created for their constituents, if they seriously want jobs, they only 
have to co-operate with us for the wellbeing of all the Canadians 
who hope for a better future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief enough to allow my colleagues to speak. I simply want to 
point out to our colleague from the Liberal Party that there is a 
subject he completely forgot to talk about, and it is our $600 billion 
debt.
<P>
	When he talks about the good things, he always shows only one 
side of the coin. When he talks about the deficit, he says that it is 
being reduced. Well, the deficit is not being reduced through good 
management and certainly not through spending cuts because, next 
year, there will be no cuts in government spending. The 
government is reducing the deficit by using the unemployment 
insurance fund, by shirking its responsibilities, by cutting its 
transfers to provinces, by laying off employees. That is how the 
deficit is being reduced.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	We hear constantly about the referendum. We hear that 
Quebecers voted no in the last referendum. But everybody forgets 
to say that the yes side is now up to 49.5 or 49.6 per cent and that it 
will win the next time.
<P>
	I would like the member to tell us about the programs he has 
proposed to eliminate the debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to give my colleague a 
lecture on economics but, before eliminating the debt, we have to 
get rid of the deficit.
<P>
	I think most Canadians who listen to this speech or who will read 
it in <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow will know that. The comparison that nees 
to be made is this: What is the point of discussing old debts if we 
still have not paid off the new debt? The first thing to do is to 
eliminate the deficit. We have reduced it, and we have done this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1024"> 1024 </A></B>
<P>
well.  The next step is to eliminate it. After that, of course, we will 
start paying off the debt.
<P>
	The hon. member raised an issue I had forgotten to mention. We 
have been told in recent days that beginning next year the deficit of 
Canada will be, in terms of its gross domestic product, the lowest 
of the seven most industrialised countries in the world. The lowest. 
In other words, we have a better record than the other six members 
of the G-7.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell never 
fails to astound me as he stands up in this House and blames the 
country's problems on everyone else except the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member realizes that over the last 35 years the 
Liberal government has held power in this country more than the 
Tories, far more than the Tories. All the things that have caused 
discontent in the province of Quebec could have been sorted out a 
long time ago by previous Liberal governments. Sure, the Bloc 
party has to take some credit for whipping up the current separatist 
feeling within Quebec, but the things the province of Quebec is 
asking for, such as devolution of powers and more control over 
things the province of Quebec could do better itself are the same 
things the other provinces in Canada have been asking for all these 
years.
<P>
	Why did it take bringing the country to the very brink of 
separation which was caused by the Liberals' inept handling of the 
referendum campaign in Quebec? Why did it take coming so close 
to breaking up the country of Canada to wake the Liberals up to the 
point that finally after 35 years they are starting to talk about 
devolving some of the powers of the federal government to the 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I am hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I can. You do not listen to the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Maybe that is the difference between us and what 
I just heard across the way.
<P>
	We just heard two things. First, the way to save this country is to 
emasculate it and second, this government here today should have 
done something 35 years ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> They have the same philosophy today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across may think, and I am not one 
of them, that all of us should stand for splitting the spoils among 
provinces and having no country left. That is not the Canada I see. I 
see a strong and united Canada and I intend to do my share to keep 
this country together.
<P>
	I do not stand with that kind of nonsense that the member across 
believes in, which is to totally emasculate the country. It is nearly 
as bad as what the Bloc Quebecois-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Lincoln.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-10. In concert with the 
1994-95 budget, the 1996 budget continues a comprehensive 
strategy for federal finances that is determined, measured and 
responsible.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Jobs and economic growth are the priority of every G-7 nation 
and certainly are the priority in Canada. Our government was 
elected on a jobs and growth platform and it has spent the last two 
and one-half years trying to meet those goals. To meet the 
objectives of jobs and growth we had to make some tough 
decisions. The 1996 budget stays the course on deficit fighting and 
we have made those tough decisions.
<P>
	As a federal government we need to strike a balance between 
reducing those deficits in a prudent and measured way while not 
hurting those most in need. One only has to look at the reaction of 
the people of Ontario recently to understand that the Tories' slash 
and burn approach does not work and it is an approach that this 
government will never emulate.
<P>
	Listen to some of the comments. John McCallum, chief 
economist at the Royal Bank said that the Minister of Finance ``has 
struck a good balance between on the one hand having to get the 
deficit down and on the other hand not inflicting real damage on a 
struggling economy. I think the course is being steered quite well''.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec Chamber of Commerce stated that 
the budget gives a positive signal to financial markets and it is felt 
that the minister will deliver what he promised by cutting the 
deficit. This is quite contrary to what is being said by the Bloc 
members across the way who say: ``Please, please let us go''. Let 
us remember that Canadians live in Quebec and they have said: 
``We want to stay in Canada and we will do everything possible to 
ensure that this country remains united''.
<P>
	In the past 27 months the most common theme I have heard is 
action. Action is needed. Canadians know that government cannot 
be all things to all people. They do expect government to spend 
taxpayers' dollars prudently and to ensure a better future for their 
children. We will provide that future. We will achieve this through 
our determination. We are not letting up.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance stated, the attack on the deficit is 
irrevocable and irreversible. We will balance the books. 
Furthermore we will put the debt to GDP ratio on a constant 
downward track year after year after year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1025"> 1025 </A></B>
<P>
	Our fiscal action plan is measured; it is not indiscriminate, it 
is not mindless but it is structured by a pace that is conducive to 
adaptation. It is not designed to be a quick fix, but it is designed 
to achieve long term and permanent progress. It is also responsible 
because it is a strategy that involves carefully weighing the needs 
of our economy and our society, and equally carefully designing 
the policy options to meet those needs. Clearly our fiscal house 
is getting in order. We need to do that to sustain jobs and growth 
over the long term.
<P>
	Many in my riding of Lincoln are involved in the small business 
community. I believe that this budget sends very strong signals, a 
signal that this government is committed to promoting and 
enhancing small business. The economic recovery of this country 
is based on the growth of that small and medium size business 
sector.
<P>
	We need to get the fundamentals right. The lethal combination of 
high interest rates and deficit borrowing meant a growing share of 
government resources were going to servicing interest payments on 
our growing debt. This year those charges will cost the government 
some $47 billion, money that cannot go to lowering the taxes, 
aiding those in need or helping the economy create those new jobs.
<P>
	The first budget in 1994 set the course for our fiscal house so that 
we could create that environment for jobs and growth. In 1995-96 
we stayed the course.
<P>
	It is worth looking at what signals this budget is sending to small 
business in my community of Lincoln and across the country. The 
budget recognizes that the role of government is to provide the 
private sector with a framework for growth. Our budget to date has 
reflected our fiscal and economic policies of getting interest rates 
down, of keeping inflation low and of cutting the burden of deficits 
in order to create that climate.
<P>
	The budget also announced initiatives to encourage technology 
and innovation. The Minister of Industry recently released the 
science and technology package which will form the basis of 
Canada's global competitiveness in the 21st century.
<P>
	Again no one is suggesting that this budget or the last two 
budgets are the panacea for the Canadian economy. However, I 
think we can all agree that we are certainly on the right track. I can 
say that with full confidence because just last week I had the 
pleasure of participating in the opening of the Cosella Dorken 
plant, a joint venture between Canadian and German companies in 
Beamsville. It is an innovative company that is poised for growth 
and export.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Locally, I see the impact of getting the fundamentals right, of 
getting lower interest rates, of getting low inflation and of cutting 
the deficits. At the end of the day, tackling Canada's fiscal problem 
is not the goal in and of itself. Rather it is a fundamental 
component of  our objectives of national growth, new jobs and 
economic security.
<P>
	We will continue to set credible, two year rolling deficit targets 
by using prudent economic assumptions for fiscal planning 
purposes and by establishing contingency reserves. Credibility is 
being restored to the nation's finances. We have maintained our 
focus on reducing program spending because the debt is a problem 
created by government. We all know that. The solution should 
focus on cutting in our own backyard.
<P>
	There are no new tax increases in this budget, not in personal 
taxes, corporate taxes or excise taxes. Constituents of Lincoln feel 
confident that this government is listening when they say they are 
overtaxed and it does not increase taxes.
<P>
	My constituents are pleased with the direction our government 
has taken. They are confident that by staying the course and 
continuing to be sensitive to those most in need Canada can 
continue to be a model to all the world as a country where fiscal 
soundness, a competitive environment and social responsibility are 
not mutually exclusive but rather are all interconnected.
<P>
	The job before us is clear. It is to build on the progress we have 
made, to see it translated into good jobs, sustained growth and 
social programs suited to the millennium that lies ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to congratulate the member for Lincoln for his great speech. Of 
course, his speech was typical of Liberal supporters who, of course, 
will fully approve, whatever the content of the Minister of 
Finance's budget.
<P>
	A recent opinion poll suggested that barely four per cent of 
Canadians trusted their politicians. Unfortunately, the quality of 
our members of Parliament and ministers, the present Minister of 
Finance in particular, is no help in improving this meagre four per 
cent our constituents are giving us. With four per cent, we might 
just as well say we are in the basement. Since the margin of error is 
plus or minus three per cent, one might wonder whether it is one 
per cent or seven per cent. If it really is one per cent, it could mean 
only their friends.
<P>
	Speaking of credibility, Mr. Mulroney, on taking office in 1984, 
said: ``Let me run this country for 20 years, and you will not 
recognize the country''. We put our trust in him for nine years and, 
in fact, after nine years, Canada-or Quebec-is almost 
unrecognizable.
<P>
	When Mr. Mulroney took office, the Liberals had accumulated a 
$250 billion debt. Oddly enough, this morning, not one member 
opposite mentioned that fact. Yet, these Liberals are the ones who 
created this outrageous deficit of $250 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1026"> 1026 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Mulroney took over the government with a deficit of $250 
billion and brought it to $500 billion. Two years and a few months 
after the Liberals came back in office, the amount is over $600 
billion-from $500 to $600 billion. It seems that the bigger the 
deficit, the less scary it is.
<P>
	The member for Lincoln should also understand that these 
Liberals are ruining our reputations as politicians. The Deputy 
Prime Minister, the member for Hamilton, promised to resign if, 
after twelve months, the GST had not been scrapped. What did she 
do? Yesterday, she did not hesitate to vote against a motion, a silly 
motion, I must say.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In this budget-and I would like the member for Lincoln to tell 
us why-the Minister of Finance did absolutely nothing to reform 
the tax system in order to eliminate the numerous tax shelters that 
allow people to pay less taxes, something he himself is an expert at. 
On the contrary, he targeted the unemployed, farmers, women and 
young people. This is the future the Liberal Party is preparing for 
us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to dispute the polling that was 
done. Certainly the polling I am doing in Lincoln states that the 
credibility of members of Parliament is increasing. Read the 
commentary that is out there.
<P>
	I would be interested in seeing the poll, its sample and its size. 
Better still, I would like to see the question that was posed in order 
to get the response which the hon. member was looking for. I know 
there is always some doubt when we talk about the question here in 
the House.
<P>
	The hon. member asked what we were doing with respect to the 
debt. Again, let us talk basic economics. We need to tackle the 
deficit before we can talk about the debt. We need to put the 
fundamentals in place.
<P>
	It is astonishing to me when I hear comments which suggest that 
the party opposite or the member opposite is not concerned about 
the debt. No one in the House is supportive of putting a burden on 
our future generations.
<P>
	We are committed to getting our fiscal house in order. We are 
committed to putting the fundamentals in place. We are committed 
to dealing with the debt. However, we have to deal with the deficit 
first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am astounded to hear the remark about putting a burden 
on future generations from the hon. member for Lincoln.
<P>
	Using the Liberals' own numbers, they are going to add a 
minimum of another $100 billion to the national debt and another 
$10 billion to the interest payments. If  that is not a burden, I do not 
know what it is. It is a burden which was created by the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about there being no tax increases in the 
recent budget. I would like to refer to the de-taxing of child support 
payments for custodial parents. While I am sympathetic to that 
change, will the hon. member deny that the change will in fact 
result in a net revenue gain of $200 million to the Liberal 
government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, again we are on the constant downward 
trend. We are meeting our economic targets of reducing the deficit 
and ultimately dealing with the debt. We are not doing it in a slash 
and burn fashion, which is how Ontario is doing it.
<P>
	The easiest thing for us to do would be simply to come forward, 
slash and burn, and get the numbers down. However, that is not the 
goal in and of itself. We must take a balanced approach in dealing 
with the debt and deficit. We must deal with social programs. We 
cannot cripple the economy because we want to hit a certain 
number. We have to be balanced, measured and determined.
<P>
	When we talk about tax reform, when we talk about wanting to 
change things, we have to get the fundamentals in place in order to 
deal with the main objectives of jobs and growth in the economy. 
That is what we are committed to on this side of the House. We are 
going to deal with it.
<P>
	With respect to changes in taxes, we are talking about fairness, 
what is equitable. We made some of those changes in the last 
budget and we will continue to do so as we move into the following 
budget and the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have followed 
this debate with interest.
<P>
	Some of the quotes the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell used were interesting. Maybe I 
should reply to some of those with some quotes from the Prime 
Minister: ``I have a plan and I have the people''. We are still 
waiting to hear the plan. We are still waiting to see which people 
will carry this out.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	He said we will have a government that will listen to the average 
Canadians and earn their trust with a balanced, realistic plan with 
concrete goals, not empty promises. He said that after nine years of 
broken promises and shattered dreams Canadians deserve a change. 
We are all still waiting.
<P>
	He said that for nine years Conservatives have claimed to cut 
costs while they have been transferring them to the provincial and 
local levels but the same taxpayers keep paying. They still keep 
paying because we still keep transferring it to the provinces. We 
still keep hearing the phony thing that we have planned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1027"> 1027 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of people have not heard about that plan and certainly do 
not see it coming from the government. In the past couple of 
weeks I talked to 400 farmers in Alberta. I have talked to people 
in Etobicoke. I talked to people in Regina last weekend. They are 
all waiting for that plan.
<P>
	They are looking at what the Liberals are saying: ``We have 
everything under control. Feel good, be happy, do not worry about 
anything''. Everything is fine is what the spin doctors are telling 
the Canadian people but the Canadian people are way ahead of the 
politicians.
<P>
	Albertans feel pride because now we are starting to pay down our 
debt. The pride and the feeling of accomplishment certainly are 
much greater than anybody feels from the lame duck budget the 
federal government has put forward now for a third year.
<P>
	I have made up a little card which I have started handing out to 
people. People say the Liberals say everything is under control. We 
hear quotes from some of their henchmen saying everything is 
under control. We have a deficit that has gone from $42 billion to 
$30 billion to $21 billion to $17 billion; are we not wonderful? 
Really what we have done is set the target so low that anybody 
could hit it.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc said what the Liberals never talk 
about is the $600 billion of debt. They never talk about the $50 
billion of interest accumulating every year which has to be paid 
down before we can provide any services.
<P>
	What members have to look at is how that happened, which is on 
my card. We started in 1972 with approximately $16 billion and a 
Liberal government. In 1983 and we we up to $160 billion under a 
Liberal government.
<P>
	In 1984 we said here is a guy who said he will not let this grow 
any more from $160 billion. By 1993 we all know the day we were 
elected it was $489 billion. When we go back to the people again, it 
will be $620 billion. It is going straight up, but the Liberals never 
talk about that.
<P>
	The people talk about that. The people know what is threatening 
their programs, what is threatening their health care, what is 
threatening their jobs, what is threatening their pensions. They are 
all being threatened by that debt and by those interest payments. 
That is what is threatening the programs, and the people are smart 
enough to know that.
<P>
	The people are asking where is the plan? Where are the targets 
that will actually achieve something? Do not simply offload 
problems to the provinces. The provinces are trying to do their job; 
at least seven will have a balanced budget. Then they will start 
paying down their debt.
<P>
	I mentioned the pride when that is finally achieved.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk to the people. What do the people say? They say 
lower taxes to give them the incentive to create jobs. Give them 
some reforms to the systems in place so they can preserve what 
they all value as Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberals are stuck on this slash and burn thing. Two or three 
years ago some speech writer wrote that down for them and they 
are not clever enough to come up with anything new that describes 
anything like what the people are saying.
<P>
	We should probably start right here with ourselves. What are we 
doing with the number of members of Parliament? We are 
increasing it. We should be decreasing the number of members of 
Parliament and setting an example. We are over governed. We do 
not need all the government we have. We should be totally 
reforming that place on the other side of this building. That is a 
disgrace. I am embarrassed about it but nothing comes forward in 
that regard.
<P>
	We do not have reform in this Parliament. We have members 
taking their pensions and justifying it. How can they do that when 
they are telling people they have a plan, that they will lower 
spending, that they will set the example for Canadians?
<P>
	We are increasing the number of members of Parliament. We are 
taking a watered down pension. We are not doing anything about 
the GST. We are not doing anything about the debt. We have so 
little business to do in the House that it is embarrassing. We 
delayed the opening of Parliament because there is so little to do.
<P>
	The people of Canada recognize this. They know the sham that is 
going on. They know the government has no plan. They know the 
government will not deal with the debt, will not deal with the 
interest payments, will not deal with threats to our social programs, 
will not provide jobs. It is just sitting there coasting along and 
hoping a miracle happens.
<P>
	I do not believe that miracle will happen. Business knew what to 
do long ago to get its act together. Government has not even 
started. In this place nothing has happened. This budget is another 
disaster with no goals, no limits, no plan as we were promised.
<P>
	The people know where it is at and the people again, as so often 
is the case, are way ahead of their leaders. They are ahead of their 
bureaucrats and they know what has to happen. They are prepared 
for it and they will take pride in it.
<P>
	We need a government that has a plan, and yet there is no plan. 
Yesterday's debate was a perfect example: ``We will get rid of the 
GST, that is a promise. We will kill it, destroy it, bury it''. 
Yesterday in the House every single last Liberal voted to keep the 
GST. That is the plan and the delivery of the things they went door 
to door with and promised.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1028"> 1028 </A></B>
<P>
	How can one feel any way but unhappy with this place? How 
can one feel anything but disgust when one hears the sorts of 
things we keep hearing? There are prepared speeches that people 
pick up. They do not feel it from the heart. They do not feel it 
from their people. They have not talked to their people. They are 
just doing what the spin doctors say will get them elected again. 
It is a disgrace.
<P>
	We are talking about the most important thing we all have, our 
economy. We do not have jobs, we do not have anything and there 
is no plan here. We have MPs taking their pensions, we have MPs 
increasing the number of members in this place. We have no plan, 
and that is sad. It is sad for my grandchildren, for my children, for 
future generations. We should all have a moment of silence, and the 
members across should join, because of the lack of a plan. The 
budget only demonstrates that.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
always listen very attentively when the hon. member speaks 
because when he first came to Ottawa he made a lot of sense. 
However, today he has fallen into the Reform rhetoric and does not 
make any sense at all.
<P>
	He said he was in Etobicoke helping the Reform candidate to get 
elected there. I was there as well. There was not much support for 
the Reform Party in Etobicoke.
<P>
	The other day he also saw what happened at Queen's Park when 
the riot police had to be called in. These are scenes we witness in 
other countries. Never did we predict we would witness such 
scenes here. The Harris government is doing what the Reform 
Party wants for the entire country. Does the hon. member want to 
see these kinds of scenes repeated across the country?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is what the people want. That is why 
they elected him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> An hon. member says that is what people want. If that 
is what people want, can he explain why the government party is 
running 58 per cent in the polls and his party ratings are going 
down further and further? It shows the public is not buying the 
Reform program.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to talk about the GST. He tied that in 
with party's lowering taxes. It would lower taxes, get rid of the 
GST. At the same time he criticizes the deficit and the public debt. 
What he shared with us will drive the deficit up even further and 
increase the public debt.
<P>
	That is why I said he used to make sense but all of a sudden does 
not make sense. He complains the government has no plan. The 
government ran on a plan. We put out a very clear platform and the 
people gave us the mandate to implement the platform over the 
next five years.
<P>
	We have another two years to go. Mike Harris tried to do in one 
year what we are spreading over a four year period. This why the 
people are quite happy with our latest budget, quite happy with the 
first two budgets. They know we are on track. The financial 
confidence is there. The investment confidence is there. I think the 
government is right on track and I do not see why the Reform Party 
cannot understand this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were a number of 
questions and I do not have enough time to answer them all.
<P>
	I remind the member that a number of Liberals believe that 
support is an inch thick and a mile wide.
<P>
	I tried to convey the feeling that Albertans have of the pride of 
ridding the deficit and who are now working on the debt. We are 
proud of that. The threat to everything in the country is the growing 
debt and the interest payments. That is the message; $50 billion in 
interest is what is threatening health care, pensions and jobs. 
Business will not provide more jobs until it sees a plan and light at 
the end of the tunnel. The only light at the end of the tunnel must be 
the lowering of taxes, a plan whereby people are treated equally 
and fairly.
<P>
	With regard to his reference to polls, I go back to a much earlier 
politician from this place when he described that polls were for big 
dogs. That probably summarizes what we can do with these polls.
<P>
	Why the great popularity of the government? After probably the 
most disliked Prime Minister the country has ever had, anything 
would be a breath of fresh air. I agree with that. We need light at the 
end of the tunnel. The debt and the deficit have to be dealt with and 
interest payments must be cut down.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-10, an act to enable the government to borrow, 
simply should not exist. It is proof positive that the government has 
failed the Canadian people in trying to do that which it professes to 
do, which is get our economic house in order, preserve social 
programs and above all else, give hope to a Canadian public that so 
desperately needs hope.
<P>
	Once again the government has mortgaged the future of every 
Canadian. It is borrowing on the future of Canadians, their children 
and their children's children to pay for today. Granted all of what 
we have today goes on their shoulders because previous 
governments, Progressive Conservative and Liberal alike, have 
spent wildly giving us the situation we have today.
<P>
	Although the government has done a few things that no previous 
government has done, it still has much further to go. It is still 
compromising the country as we know it, compromising the very 
roots of Canadian society. Hence we see the great angst that exists 
among  the Canadian people: their fear of the unknown, their fear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1029"> 1029 </A></B>
<P>
of the future, their fear of losing their jobs, their fear that their 
children cannot find jobs, their fear of losing the social programs 
which all of us have come to depend on for health care, for 
education and for pensions.
<P>
	The fact that we have to borrow from the future speaks loudly to 
the fact that our economic house is not in order.
<P>
	Reformers have been accused of being the slash and burn party. 
The government has repeatedly said that it is on the right track. 
This is a track running right into a brick wall.
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund at the end of last year told the 
finance minister clearly that if the government does not change its 
targets, if it does not bring those targets more into line and be more 
aggressive, not only in its deficit reduction, but most important, in 
its debt reduction, then Canada is going to be in severe trouble.
<P>
	We need not look any further than New Zealand to see the 
consequences of inaction. If the government does not act, if it does 
not get our economic house in order today, then Canadians are 
going to suffer. Those who will suffer the most are the poorest and 
most dispossessed in society. These are the people above all else 
who we should be here to help. The fact that the government is 
borrowing once again, spending more money than it takes in, is 
compromising the health, the welfare and the future of every 
Canadian.
<P>
	Three years ago the Reform Party gave the government a 
specific, concise and effective plan to get the country's economic 
house in order, to get people back to work, to give confidence back 
to the people, to preserve social programs, to preserve programs 
that help those who need help. Did the government take it? 
Absolutely not. The government ignored it, to its peril and the peril 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	The purpose of the plan was to make sensitive, effective cuts to 
government spending to preserve funding for those people who 
need it the most, to preserve health care, to preserve education and 
to preserve the core of the pension programs for those who need 
them for the future. The government ignored it. Yet the Liberal plan 
we are following is eroding away at government spending as we 
speak.
<P>
	When we were all elected two years ago the government had 
$120 billion to spend on government programs. Today it has $103 
billion. Next year it will have $93 billion to $94 billion. Where has 
the money gone? It has gone to pay the interest that must be paid on 
the debt, the debt that is being added to as we speak, the debt that 
will continue to be added to because the government has failed to 
balance the books. Every day Canadians have to balance their 
books. If we do not we go bankrupt. That is reality. The 
government is  committing Canada to bankruptcy and that is 
completely unthinkable.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Why does the government not act? It does not act out of fear. I 
understand that. It takes courage to move ahead and address the 
problems in our midst. Why are the problems in our midst not 
addressed? It is for fear of having to lead the debate, for fear of the 
media and for fear of what some small minority groups will say.
<P>
	However, members must have the courage to act on their 
principles. They must have the courage to do the right thing for the 
Canadian public. If they do not it will be the Canadian public that 
suffers. It is our job. It is not our job to play partisan politics which 
is what we are descending into and to an even greater degree every 
day. This place is fracturing into different groups rather than 
having the vigorous debate that is necessary to find solutions to the 
problems of the country.
<P>
	I fear that the problems have become secondary to playing the 
game of politics. The maintenance and acquisition of power is the 
game. Canada's problems become secondary to that little dance 
that is going on here. That is the system and the morass with which 
we are faced. However, this is an opportunity to change that system 
and to become more effective.
<P>
	As an aside, I personally believe that we need to make a hybrid 
model between the American system and the Canadian system to 
give individual members of Parliament more power, to give 
committees more power in enacting legislation and to enable all 
members of Parliament to represent their constituents rather than 
doing what the party tells them do. That is something that we in this 
party have been pushing forward for a very long time, free votes in 
the House of Commons. I believe it is essential for a democracy to 
have this because we do not live in a democracy today.
<P>
	If those changes can be made then this House will provide a 
more vigorous and effective debate that enables members to 
formulate plans that can be directly applied to the problems which 
face Canadians today. I fear these problems are not being dealt with 
in an effective fashion in the House because of the insidious 
creeping of partisan politics among us. That is in part why we do 
not see action on the great problems that face Canada today.
<P>
	However, it is still inexcusable for the government not to act on 
the economic situation by continually borrowing on the future of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance wants to create a study group to 
determine how the tax system can be addressed more effectively 
for businesses. I will give the minister a free bit of advice. If he 
wants to improve the economics in Canada, if he wants to give 
people a better chance of getting a job, if he wants to preserve 
social programs and if he wants to give people hope, then he should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1030"> 1030 </A></B>
<P>
cut the  tax rate. People should be given more money in their 
pockets so they can spend it.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, I believe in 1991, in the dark years of the 
Conservatives, the Prime Minister of the day actually decreased 
taxes for a very brief moment in time. What happened? More 
money was coming into government coffers at that time than ever 
before. What did the government then do? It started to tax wildly. It 
brought in the GST and increased taxes. What did all that do? It 
simply decreased the amount of money coming into the public 
purse, crushed the economy, raised taxes, decreased the ability of 
people to get jobs and generally smothered an economy that could 
otherwise have been more vigorous.
<P>
	In Canada, we have an enormous opportunity. We are blessed 
with enormous riches in minerals, in timber but also in the people. 
We have an enormous wealth of individual strength, tolerance and 
understanding that cannot be rivalled by any other country in the 
world. These enormous talents, ideas and potential need to be 
focused on the issues that not only affect us but affect all countries 
in the world. It does Canadians a great disservice not to do that.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I implore the government to use its power to work with us, to 
employ some of our ideas and to use them itself for the good of all 
Canadians. The problems of this country cannot wait another day. 
They must be acted on today. The solutions are out there. Let us act 
on them for everybody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is one of the more moderate members of 
the Reform Party. However he stated some things that I do not 
think carry a lot of water.
<P>
	He is using the New Jersey model to cut taxes. Let us take a look 
at that New Jersey model since he brought it up. New Jersey is now 
the most polarized state in the United States. The poor have never 
been more poor and the rich have never been more rich. The middle 
class has shrunk. That is the state that cut taxes. It is a model that 
was used by one of our provinces in its approach to an election.
<P>
	The other model he used was New Zealand. New Zealand has not 
recovered from the crash of its program. it is still not on its feet yet. 
It is not a vibrant society.
<P>
	Why are the major financial lenders in the world giving kudos to 
Canada? It is because we are attacking the problems in a thorough 
manner. The government has set targets and it will reach those 
targets, as stated by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about a fractious caucus. There is no 
more fractious caucus than the one to which he belongs. That 
caucus brings its members back to account to them and some come 
out in tears. It does not paint a very good picture of a party's 
solidarity.
<P>
	He also talked about freedom of speech. That does not speak 
well for the party either. Talk about practising the new politics. The 
party that came into power saying it was going to do it a new way 
but it just found a new way of doing the old things better.
<P>
	This is not as easy as one thinks from the outside. It takes a lot of 
co-ordination and practice among all of the parties. To bring laws 
into place a lot of consultation has to take place and there is no 
knee-jerk reaction to it.
<P>
	I wanted to pick up on those points made by the hon. member. I 
have one question for him. Has the Reform Party chosen to use the 
New Jersey model for a tax cut model the same as the province of 
Ontario did and end up as a result with a polarized community of 
the very rich and very poor?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his questions. I am glad he asked them.
<P>
	First, I never brought up a New Jersey model in my speech. To 
answer his question on tax cuts like there were in New Zealand, the 
plan we gave the government, the zero in three plan, did not 
involve an across the board tax cut for anybody.
<P>
	Reformers maintain that government spending has to be 
controlled, the deficit has to be brought down to zero and then the 
debt, the real ogre, must be attacked. That is the plan we gave to the 
government. That is the plan it ignored.
<P>
	Second, I did bring up the New Zealand model. It does take time 
for a country to get back on its feet after decades of overspending. 
The reality for New Zealand is it took 10 years. For Canada it is 
probably going to take a similar amount of time. If the changes are 
made today, we cannot expect to have the results for some years.
<P>
	The converse of that argument is if the changes are not made 
things will be a lot worse for a lot longer. That is why we demand 
that the issues be addressed now, and if the government fails to do 
that it will imperil the Canadian public.
<P>
	The hon. member did make a number of erroneous statements. 
New Zealand is doing better than it has ever done. It is one of the 
lions in terms of economic growth of countries in the world. Over 
the last couple of years its economic growth rate has increased 
dramatically from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member said that kudos have been given to Canada. I 
suggest the hon. member look at what the International Monetary 
Fund said. The IMF gave our Minister of Finance a very stern 
warning, making it very clear that his targets are totally unaccept-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1031"> 1031 </A></B>
<P>
able. That is not  the first time. It has been repeated time and time 
again. The primary international financial agency in the world has 
told Canada to buck up or it will be in trouble.
<P>
	The hon. member brought up the issue of free speech. We do not 
have a bunch of cowardly individuals, such as those who are in 
government. Many of them say they would like to make changes in 
the government but are afraid to do so because of the whip 
structure. At least in our party we can speak our mind, and we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	I rise to speak on second reading of Bill C-10, the borrowing 
authority bill. The government is asking this honourable House for 
$18.7 billion of borrowing authority for the 1996-97 fiscal year. As 
in previous years, the amount of borrowing authority requested in 
the bill is directly connected to the financial requirements set out in 
the 1996 budget.
<P>
	The budget which was presented on March 6 was good news for 
Canadians. It focuses on many important areas that need the 
attention of government. The areas being addressed that I am 
especially pleased with are the deficit, the economy, social 
programs and young Canadians. Bill C-10 will allow for the 
implementation of these initiatives.
<P>
	I would like to applaud the Minister of Finance for keeping the 
government on its deficit targets with no new taxes. It is reassuring 
to see that it is possible for a government to make a budgetary plan, 
as was outlined in the Liberal red book, and then stick to it budget 
after budget. Our deficit targets are not only being met, they may 
be exceeded. This provides us with the confidence that our deficit 
target for 1996-97 of 3 per cent of GDP is secure, as well as our 
new interim target of 2 per cent for 1997-98.
<P>
	The main objective of the Liberal platform during the election 
was job creation. That is exactly what we are aiming to do through 
creating the proper economic climate by getting our fiscal house in 
order. There is a direct link between deficit reduction, interest rate 
reductions and job creation.
<P>
	The government has not only kept its promises, it has made new 
ones.
<P>
	A very important focus in the budget is on children, youth and 
the future of our country. The budget provides an additional $165 
million over three years to help students and their families deal 
with the increased costs of education. The budget will increase 
education tax credits, raise the limit on the transfer of tuition and 
education credits and increase the limit of contributions to RESP, 
the registered educational savings plan. That is a small price to pay 
to open up new educational opportunities to the younger 
generation. I welcome these measures.
<P>
	Also announced was an additional $315 million of funding over 
the next three years to create new youth employment opportunities. 
There was a real need for government action in this area.
<P>
	This country has a 16 per cent youth unemployment rate. That is 
unacceptable to me and it is unacceptable to the government. It is 
important to provide young people with new challenges and their 
rightful place in the workforce. That is why the government has 
committed to doubling the funding for the summer career program 
to provide students with the work experience needed when they 
graduate and seek their first full time job.
<P>
	I am also pleased with the government's new domestic Team 
Canada style partnership approach between business and 
government to create entry level jobs for our youth. The 
government is also on the right track when it devotes funding to 
involving youth in the Internet. That has happened in several ways.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The SchoolNet program will eventually connect all schools 
throughout Canada to the information highway. This is vital in 
keeping Canada globally competitive. It provides youth with the 
technological skills which will soon be considered mandatory to 
doing business throughout the world. This also provides schools 
with a link to the rest of the country which promotes the exchange 
of information and allows students to learn about their country in 
new and creative ways.
<P>
	I applaud the innovative plan announced in the budget by the 
minister to provide jobs to 2,000 computer students to connect 
50,000 small businesses to the Internet. This not only provides 
valuable work experience for youth but will give small businesses 
the competitive edge they need to succeed in today's economy.
<P>
	The financial security of children was also an important focus of 
the budget. I was pleased to see that new child support measures 
will be introduced. Fairer tax treatment has been called for by 
custodial parents for some time now and the government has acted. 
The new tax system will be simpler for parents. To be fair, the 
increased tax revenues received will be reinvested to support the 
implementation costs of the federal child support guidelines.
<P>
	In addition to this, children will be directly aided by a two-step 
doubling of the working income supplement. This increase from a 
maximum annual benefit of $500 to $700 in 1997 and to $1,000 in 
July 1998 will help low income families cope with such increased 
costs as child care and transportation to work. This supplement is 
an added incentive to work rather than to collect social assistance.
<P>
	This type of incentive is vital to break the cycle of financial 
dependence that many Canadians face. These changes will affect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1032"> 1032 </A></B>
<P>
upwards of 700,000 families by increasing their benefits an 
average of $350 a year. It is  important to note that one-third of 
these families are headed by single parents.
<P>
	A major focus of the recent budget which we are implementing 
with Bill C-10 will be helping Canadians who need it the most. 
This has been exemplified by the government's new initiatives for 
children and youth, which I have discussed, and for seniors with the 
new seniors benefit which will begin in the year 2001.
<P>
	Along these same lines, the government has taken measures to 
protect those Canadians who need medical services, 
post-secondary education and social assistance. These services 
were secured in the last budget when the government created the 
Canadian health and social transfer.
<P>
	The government in the budget announced a firm commitment for 
five years starting in 1998-99. For the first two years funding will 
remain constant at $25.1 billion. For the remaining three years 
funding will increase each year. This is good news for the 
provinces and for all Canadians.
<P>
	Recently I met with representatives of the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities. They told me that they are very 
supportive of this on behalf of the municipalities. They feel it will 
provide them with the stability they need as they do their planning. 
That was very encouraging to me.
<P>
	There is security in knowing that funding will remain the same 
or higher for the five-year period beginning in 1998-99. The 
government has made several other long term commitments such 
as the new seniors benefit. Not only does this allow Canadians the 
opportunity to plan ahead, but it demonstrates to business that the 
government has a long term financial plan that will promote a 
stable economy. They can therefore feel secure doing business in 
Canada.
<P>
	I fully support Bill C-10 and the budget it is implementing. The 
budget contains much needed programs and additional spending in 
the areas I have outlined. We have met our deficit targets and will 
continue to do so with no new taxes in 1996-97. I urge all members 
of the House to vote for Bill C-10.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the member opposite talk about 
his party's lack of vision in reducing the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The province of Alberta has adopted platforms which parallel 
what the Reform Party believes with regard to fiscal matters and 
responsibility. This year the Government of Alberta will not only 
balance its budget but also anticipates having a surplus. It can make 
a decision to either apply the surplus to the debt, to its health care 
system, to post-secondary education, or to the seniors program. 
Alberta has the luxury of a surplus  because it has adopted some 
very hard and tough fiscal programs to get its deficit under control 
and its budget balanced.
<P>
	How would the hon. member respond to that success?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member talked about a vision or 
lack of vision with respect to the deficit; it depends on how one 
looks at it. I would be the first to acknowledge there are two plans, 
two visions for the future, two budgets: the budget presented by the 
Reform Party and the government's budget.
<P>
	I said in my speech and I have said over and over that the deficit 
is something we must get under control. We are not only committed 
to reducing the deficit on a planned basis but to eventually 
eliminating it, then being able to use that money for programs and 
to pay off the debt.
<P>
	There is a difference between the position of the party opposite 
and my position. I recognize there are two deficits while the 
member opposite only recognizes one deficit. He recognizes the 
fiscal deficit as I do but I also recognize the human deficit. We 
cannot put the people of this country at risk and make the human 
deficit worse by taking the approach advocated by the member 
opposite.
<P>
	I appreciate what the member is saying. To a great extent we 
agree on many issues as they relate to the eventual elimination of 
the deficit, but there is a difference in approach. As I have stated, 
the main difference is the recognition by this side of the House that 
we must also consider the human deficit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have liked my colleague to talk a little more about the 1,400,000 
unemployed people in this country. He did not mention them. Of 
course, he referred to the program designed to provide summer 
jobs for students, but this program will not save Canada or the 
unemployed.
<P>
	I would like to find out from my colleague what measures are 
favoured by his party to create high paying jobs that would enable 
people to make ends meet and to put bread on the table.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to give the member 
specifics but my timeframe will not allow me to do that.
<P>
	I did address the question of unemployment. I did address the 
question of the unacceptable level of youth unemployment which is 
at 16 per cent. As I mentioned in my speech I also recognize, as I 
believe the hon. member opposite should recognize, the direct link 
between deficit reduction which will lead to interest rate reduction 
and will lead to job creation. That is a sound economic principle. I 
am sure the member opposite realizes that until we get our fiscal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1033"> 1033 </A></B>
<P>
house in order, businesses will not  have the climate in which to 
create the jobs we need in this country.
<P>
	We have had a good record of job creation but it has to get better. 
The unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent is still unacceptable. The 
youth unemployment rate of 16 per cent is unacceptable. I am 
convinced the measures we started two budgets ago and that we are 
continuing with this budget will over time reduce that rate. I am 
very confident of that.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I, of course, wish to speak to this bill to provide 
borrowing authority so that the federal government can service its 
debt. This debate deals with the last budget speech delivered by the 
Minister of Finance, the hon. member for LaSalle-Émard.
<P>
	I think it is important to remind our listeners that the 1996 
budget contains no tax increases. There is no increase in individual 
income tax, corporate tax or the excise tax. In fact, there were no 
tax increases in this budget, which was very well received by the 
media in general, by the national and international financial 
community, of course, and by groups of young and not so young 
people, including seniors.
<P>
	In its third budget, the government intends to continue keeping 
the federal deficit under control. Since the last two budgets, we 
have saved $21.5 billion. This is a significant cut in the present 
circumstances.
<P>
	The government's third budget cuts another $1.9 billion. In 
1992, Canada's debt amounted to 6 per cent of our gross domestic 
product. It was a very large debt, one of the largest in the western 
world.
<P>
	This year, however, the debt has fallen from 6 to 3 per cent of 
GDP, and our goal is to reduce this figure to less than 2 per cent. 
Should we reach this goal, Canada's deficit would rank among the 
lowest in the western world.
<P>
	I am also proud to tell you that, of all western countries, Canada 
is the one that borrows the least, so that it can service its debt and 
stimulate the economy.
<P>
	This, I think, is serious evidence that highlights the 
government's competence and, of course, the finance minister's 
determination to help and especially to ensure-repeat, 
ensure-that the Canadian government remains fiscally 
responsible.
<P>
	The budget touched on several issues. I especially want to tell 
Canadian seniors that they can rest assured that those over 65 years 
of age will continue to receive benefits. The only changes that were 
made concern people who have single status or earn $52,000 or 
more. As far as couples are concerned, the program will still apply 
to those who earn $78,000 or less.
<P>
	As for young people, it has been announced that nearly $300 
million will be invested over the next three years to encourage 
young people to re-enter the workforce as well as to set up 
apprenticeship programs. Also, the federal government intends to 
make sure that twice as many summer jobs are available for 
students.
<P>
	I think the government is headed in the right direction. Much 
attention is paid to independent workers as well as to new 
technologies and new incentives for business to invest in various 
areas, including in the rural area.
<P>
	The past year, the federal government invested in the 
information highway to make so-called remote areas more 
competitive and, of course, up to date as regards new technology 
and the new marketplace, as we know it.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I should also say a word about what has been going on in 
Quebec, especially over the last few days, as the Quebec 
government, through its premier, Mr. Bouchard-a former member 
of this House, as you know-is hosting a socio-economic 
conference bringing together union leaders, industry and Quebec 
government members of course.
<P>
	I am rather surprised to see that the premier has the intention of 
bringing down a balanced budget within four years. But I think that 
what is important is to realize why the premier is aiming for the 
year 2000 with his plans to balance the budget, and that is because, 
at one time, this man was notorious for his cuts affecting the 
Quebec government and its employees, who suffered wage cuts in 
excess of 20 per cent during the 80s.
<P>
	I think that Quebec will have it hard in the next few years, for 
two reasons: because of the size of the accumulated debt in Quebec 
and because Quebec is the Canadian province whose per capita 
indebtedness is the highest. I must also add that the signal sent to 
Mr. Bouchard on October 30 last by the people-by the industry, 
small business and the public in general-is the following: ``Put 
your fiscal house in order and work toward economic growth. This 
is all we want and this is how we will pull Quebec out of its 
economic slump''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the premier still seeks to achieve sovereignty, 
that is Quebec's independence.
<P>
	Let me remind you that, as a cornerstone of the Canadian 
federation, Quebec is very much a winner. This year alone, Quebec 
will receive close to $11.634 billion in federal transfers, including 
$3.8 billion in equalization payments.
<P>
	As regards the issue of equalization, opposition members often 
tell us that Quebec is the big loser in Confederation, but that is 
simply not true. Since 1993-94, federal equalization payments to 
Quebec went from $3.7 billion-again that was for 1993-94-to 
$3.8 billion the following year and $3.8 billion this year. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1034"> 1034 </A></B>
<P>
1996-97, they will go up to almost $4 billion. It is obvious that  
Quebec benefits from being a member of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	However, in spite of these federal transfers, Quebec is about to 
make drastic cuts affecting welfare recipients. It will reduce the 
schools' budgets. I feel, as do several other people, that Quebec 
will experience lasting difficulties if the political issue, which is a 
real threat, is not settled.
<P>
	We are simply asking the premier of Quebec, and I believe I am 
speaking on behalf of a large percentage of Quebecers who want to 
remain in the Canadian federation, to sit down with the federal 
government to find solutions that will ensure jobs and a future for 
all. This is what we want.
<P>
	Quebecers voted no for several reasons, the first one being of 
course that they want to stay in the Canadian federation. But I 
believe that the political maturity of Quebecers made them realize 
that, to move forward and reach the objectives that they had as a 
society, including getting the Quebec and Canadian economies 
back on track, we must work together.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Time is running out, but let me tell you that Quebec's economic 
growth will be dependent on political stability. Quebec's debt will 
certainly decrease, provided we believe in economic growth, which 
is the key to getting rid of the debt in Quebec and Canada within the 
next few years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
start off by congratulating the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. He is very involved in the 
regional development of his riding. He often wears his work shirt to 
show that he knows what work is all about. And work can also be 
profitable.
<P>
	However, I want to ask my distinguished colleague, who cannot 
seem to stop bragging about his new budget, how come in his 
riding, and especially in the Magdalen Islands, more than 10 per 
cent of the overall population rallied to protest against the tough UI 
reform. Every federal measure taken these days seems to go after 
the seasonal unemployed, numerous in his riding and in mine as 
well. In other words, the government is mostly picking on women 
and young Canadians.
<P>
	Does this budget mention anything about tax shelters and tax 
avoidance? Not once. The Aucoins, from the Magdalen Islands, 
whom I had the pleasure to talk to again yesterday, as well as the 
Delaneys and Mr. Dalhousie are not very proud of their member of 
Parliament. A letter published in the op-ed page of <I>L'écho du Nord</I> 
and <I>Le Radar</I> harshly criticized not so much the hon. member, but 
rather the federal government which is hardly visible in the 
regions. It is as if the federal government only cares about the 
larger urban areas, while the smaller towns and communities in the 
member's riding are being hard hit.
<P>
	The hon. member for Îles-de-la-Madeleine knows something 
about the predicament the seasonal workers and frequent users are 
now in. No wonder the deficit has been reduced, with the $5.6 
billion the government is taking from the UI fund. A strange thing 
to do. While the big companies are not paying their fair share of the 
deficit and the taxes, the government goes after ordinary 
Canadians.
<P>
	I think the hon. member for Îles-de-la-Madeleine should 
apologize to his voters. He should be ashamed. I think he will soon 
be invited to a meeting where he will have to explain the measures 
his government will take to water down the Axworthy reform, 
which has now become the Young reform.
<P>
	How is he going to sweeten the pill for his voters? I would like to 
hear what the hon. member has to say about all of this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We undoubtedly want to 
hear what the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has to say, but he is not being 
given a lot of time to answer in this five-minute question and 
comment period. With the consent of the House, I will give the hon. 
member a little more time, in fact as much time as the previous 
speaker, to reply to the hon. member for Frontenac.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the hon. member of the opposition that I 
naturally prefer work shirts to ties. I think that might answer his 
question. The hon. member across the way seems strangely 
interested in the riding of Bonaventure-«les-de-la-Madeleine, to 
the point where it almost sounds like he is considering running 
against me. It is, of course, a lovely area.
<P>
	However, it will take a lot to kickstart the economy. Take 
unemployment insurance reform. I have had the privilege of 
meeting with my constituents, who had a number of very 
interesting and constructive ideas to pass on. I also offered my 
opinion to the minister. I implore him to make major changes to 
this bill. We are, in fact, going to invite opposition members and a 
number of Liberal MPs to suggest constructive changes to this bill.
<P>
	Quebecers, and particularly the people of my riding, are no 
longer satisfied with the status quo, with an unemployment rate of 
20 per cent and higher, with a dropout rate of over 40 per cent. This 
is why we want to introduce incentives to give young people a 
chance, to give them some hope in the region I come from. This is 
what is important.
<P>
	Furthermore, I was the first to rise, as a member from Quebec I 
would add, when I told the minister that we had to re-examine the 
method used to calculate unemployment insurance benefits, that 
the 410 hours is unacceptable in my region. That is what I said. I 
also said that we must take a second look at this idea of penalizing  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1035"> 1035 </A></B>
<P>
seasonal workers, of dropping from 55 per cent to 50 per cent of 
income after five years of benefits. I took a stand.
<P>
	I have confidence in the minister, I have confidence in this 
government, and I want my constituents to know that it was the 
Canadian government, a Liberal government, that established this 
country's social safety net. It is to the great credit of my party and I 
have not forgotten it. But I can tell you that it was the former 
Leader of the Opposition who cut the budget in Quebec by 20 per 
cent in 1982-83. There are tens of thousands, hundreds of 
thousands of Quebecers who have not forgotten that yet.
<P>
	We want equity and with the amounts, the $300 million we will 
be transferring to remote areas, the programs to promote the 
employability of people in a number of sectors, particularly 
aquaculture and the high tech field, in order to give the young and 
the not so young a chance, a hope that they will be able to find 
suitable employment.
<P>
	In conclusion, our government is an equitable one which seeks 
social justice above all and that is why I am here as the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, so that we will be heard loud 
and clear, listened to here in the House of Commons, and to ensure 
that these programs meet our needs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This concludes the period of 
questions and comments. We have also used up the five hours of 
debate on second reading of the bill on borrowing authority.
<P>
	I am told that unanimous agreement was reached earlier today 
for addresses to be either 20 minutes in length, or divided into 2 
blocks of 10 minutes each. In both cases, however, there will be no 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Lévis. In connection 
with Bill C-10, I shall be attempting to strike a totally different note 
from what I have been hearing since this morning. I wish to speak 
of the government's borrowing authority.
<P>
	Can we still afford to borrow? When all our credit cards are 
charged to the hilt, can we still afford to borrow? We should keep in 
mind how things were years ago in our families, in Quebec and 
Canada. Very often, Mother controlled the budget. She knew that 
the family had to live on the money that was available. Money was 
only borrowed as a last resort, generally to acquire such major 
items as a home, when there was no other way.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Today this government is borrowing right and left, borrowing to 
meet day-to-day expenses, borrowing just to buy its groceries, as it 
were. It is even going so far as to dip into the UI fund, the workers' 
fund, in order to get billions of dollars to reduce its deficit.
<P>
	The government certainly does not seem to have the same family 
tradition as I. Why does it want to borrow so much money? And 
how, more importantly, can it want to continue to borrow and to put 
the people of this country further into debt? The budget presented 
by the Minister of Finance contains all of the answers to these 
questions, I think.
<P>
	This government is not tackling the deficit, yet it is shouting 
from the rooftops that it has solved Canada's financial problems. 
Untrue. We know very well that, at the end of this year, the debt 
will have surpassed the $600 billion mark. You may well say ``but 
that is just a drop in the ocean''. The problem is, the government 
seems unaware that the ocean is raging out of control.
<P>
	What is worse still, I think that it is stirring up the winds of storm 
even further with this bill. We need only look at what is going on in 
our own ridings. People are taking to the streets and with reason. 
Their message to us is clear.
<P>
	Borrowing, at some point in time, also means having to pay 
back, and that is what we are doing. We are paying back $49 billion 
a year in interest and more than half of this goes abroad. It is money 
we could use, money that could be invested at home to create jobs 
for young people, money that could be invested in paying jobs and 
in research and development-all to improve things in our 
communities. But, no.
<P>
	Why is this government rejecting the evidence. Why is it not 
putting its shoulder to the wheel when it is asking the 
disadvantaged to do so even more? I need only think of those 
receiving UI, who had been hoping to hear about jobs from the 
Minister of Finance, but who, once again, can see that those 
opposite are doing nothing about their problems, except add to 
them.
<P>
	Here again, I repeat, he is using the unemployment insurance 
fund to refloat his deficit. People are not unemployed because they 
want to be. They are forced into it. It is jobs they want. If the 
money in the UI fund was used for jobs, the Minister of Finance 
could settle much of the problems of his deficit and his borrowing 
power.
<P>
	Generally, what people want is to survive without government 
handouts, but the minister has forgotten this. Digging in the 
pockets of the disadvantaged is something they know how to do. 
What about asking those who use tax shelters to make an 
effort-not a chance.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	What about setting up mechanisms to plug the loopholes that 
enable taxpayers to avoid paying income tax-not a chance, either. 
Instead, a committee of alleged experts is set up and is to report 
within a few months. Reports like these often end up on the shelf.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1036"> 1036 </A></B>
<P>
	Just ask someone who is unemployed if they know about tax 
havens. Those who come to my riding office do not even know 
what a tax shelter is. They are looking for a job.
<P>
	The Liberal government can no longer meet the needs of those of 
its citizens in greatest difficulty. What is more, it is also passing on 
to the provinces a shortfall problem. The government is 
announcing it is cutting dairy subsidies. It keeps on increasing 
expenditures.
<P>
	In this year's budget, it will spend an additional $104 million; 
great management, indeed. Moreover, the government wants to add 
to the debt with this bill. Enough is enough. It is about time our 
friends across the way realize that the Canadian people has had it, it 
is suffocating.
<P>
	The finance minister should look at what has been happening in 
Quebec lately. This is a responsible government which consults 
people and takes their views into account. This is a government 
which wants a better future for its people.
<P>
	When can we expect the Liberal government to go through a 
similar exercise? When can we expect the people opposite to listen 
to Canadians? Is this government afraid of true consultation? To 
look at what is happening with its unemployment insurance reform 
is to know the answer. As I was saying earlier, people have taken to 
the streets, and they keep on coming. This government is lending a 
deaf ear. These people are not protesting because they are lazy, this 
is not true. Nor because they are arrogant. They are protesting 
because their livelihood is at stake, their family's livelihood is at 
stake. I cannot help but repeat that the Liberal ship is rudderless in 
an ocean of troubles.
<P>
	She is taking with her millions of people who are suffering and 
have no trust in the government. This government does not deserve 
their trust, anyway. Why? Because it has betrayed their trust. It is 
certainly not by putting the country further into debt that it will 
redeem itself and regain their trust. Therefore, we must fight any 
further borrowing with all our strength.
<P>
	The finance minister should go back to the drawing board and 
make new suggestions. The Bloc Quebecois, in the Standing 
Committee on Finances, offered solutions; he should try them out. 
He should try to offer Canadians real solutions such as the one the 
Bloc Quebecois made.
<P>
	But since it is not possible to review them all, I will mention 
only this one. The government could try to collect the $6 billion 
owed to Revenue Canada. The auditor general has criticized the 
government on several occasions for failing to do this. What is 
being done to collect from some 77,000 corporations which pay no 
federal income tax? I believe we should stop compiling statistics 
and start trying to get the money where it really is. The Bloc 
Quebecois made suggestions. Borrowing is  not a solution. 
Therefore, we cannot support any further borrowing.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also thank my 
colleague from Chicoutimi for having agreed to share his time with 
me. I am pleased to have a turn at voicing my opinion on Bill C-10 
on the government's borrowing authority. I interpret this bill, in the 
same vein as my colleague from Chicoutimi, as the federal 
government's asking the members of the House of Commons' 
permission to put Canadians and Quebecers further into debt, for, 
in the budget presented to us, there has been no real effort to tackle 
the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	The Minister's projection refers to the next three years, and we 
can see that his planning has not yet allowed him to successfully 
predict the day there will no longer be an operating deficit, when 
the deficit will be zero and we can start paying back that debt.
<P>
	We need to realize that the public debt has increased by close to 
$100 billion since the Liberals came to power, on the federal level 
alone. I tried to use my calculator to divide that $600 billion by the 
number of people in Canada, a little over 27 million, to get a figure 
per capita. I must admit I had to give up and do it manually because 
my calculator was not able to divide $600 billion by 27 million.
<P>
	I was amazed. I said to myself ``Incredible''. People hear about 
the public debt all the time, but in terms of billions. A billion more, 
a billion less, they do not have much idea what that represents. One 
of my colleagues figured it out the other day. He said it came to 
$100 million per day, $69,000 per minute. That breaks down to 
$1,100 per second. Imagine, this all adds up.
<P>
	We are talking big numbers, but if we express it in terms of 
individual Canadians, when we reach the end of the fiscal year, 
when we have reached $602.7 billion, the figure will be $22,322 
per person. Newborn babies in Canada owe $22,322 from day one, 
in terms of the federal debt alone. Earlier, I was saying that, with 
the Liberals, it is another $100 billion. Individual Canadians have 
gone another $3,800 into debt since the Liberals came to power.
<P>
	Sometimes in municipalities they talk of taxpayers, but here 
every single Canadian, from infants to old folks, will owe $22,000. 
That means that a family of four, comprising two parents and two 
children, will owe nearly $100,000 in debt to the federal 
government alone. I am saying this, because people often look at 
their own budget first. It is, therefore, a considerable amount.
<P>
	Of course the Minister of Finance planned to reduce the deficit 
from $32 billion to $24.3 billion this year. In one way, there is a 
reduction. But, how did he manage it? He did it over the past two 
years by cutting $7 billion in transfer payments to the provinces. 
He is asking the provinces to work at the deficit more than he is 
doing  himself, because, if you look at the budget carefully, you can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1037"> 1037 </A></B>
<P>
see that it has increased in the end by $150 million. Federal 
expenditures are not really being cut.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Seven billion dollars in reduction comes from transfer payments 
to the provinces, and $5 billion comes from the unemployment 
insurance fund. The federal government is feeding off the 
provinces and the unemployed. They are the ones being asked to 
pay off the deficit and to work on the debt, because we will 
certainly not pay off the debt by the year 2000. We are only 
reducing the deficit.
<P>
	I listened earlier to the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine when he talked about youth. 
He also talked extensively about the provincial government. I 
found that a bit odd, I thought maybe he wanted to run for 
provincial office. He devoted eight minutes, out of his ten-minute 
speech, to the Quebec government.
<P>
	I will not make the same mistake. I will talk about the federal 
government, since this is where we are. This is the House of 
Commons, therefore, we will talk about the federal debt. My 
specific role as member of the opposition is that of critic for 
training and youth.
<P>
	In the throne speech and in the budget speech, the government 
said it would double funding for summer jobs. Naturally, I looked 
closely at that; I perused the press release issued by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development on March 12, 1996. I read each 
line and each figure. I added the amounts and discovered that there 
is a $14,350,000 shortfall in the $120 million announced.
<P>
	I see the parliamentary secretary is here now. I wonder what 
happened in the government press release; there are three possible 
explanations for that $14,350,000 gap. It might be a printing error. 
If that is the case, it is unfortunate, but we should know. It might be 
a miscalculation. In that case, a mistake of $14,350,000 is cause for 
concern and one could be a bit insecure. If the human resource 
development minister cannot add figures, if his many civil servants 
cannot add properly, where does that lead us?
<P>
	A third possibility is that it means new cuts since the tabling of 
the budget. We would like to know.
<P>
	Assuming that this is a mistake and that the amount is really 
$120 million, instead of $60 million last year, we must understand 
that the $120 million the Liberal government is spending for 
summer jobs this year is even less than what the Conservatives 
were spending when they were in office.
<P>
	The last year the Conservatives were in office, just before the 
Liberals in 1993, they spent $156 million for summer jobs. In the 
two previous budgets, that is for  1991-92 and 1990-91, they had 
spent $180 million for summer jobs.
<P>
	The Liberals are boasting that they are doubling and increasing 
the amounts, but if we put that in perspective, it is a reduction over 
what the previous government was doing. And I do not take 
inflation into account.
<P>
	Also, assuming that this $60 million is true, even if we cannot 
find this amount in the press release, that means $15 million for 
Quebec, $60 million to be divided by about 25 per cent of the 
population, which represents Quebec's population; for Quebec, it is 
$15 million more than last year. However, this year, as a result of a 
decision that was made last year by the then Minister of Human 
Resources Development, transfers to Quebec for post-secondary 
education will be cut by $150 million.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	This is an additional $15 million to dissimulate a $150 million 
cut to post-secondary education, which will indirectly affect 
students since slashing transfer payments to Quebec in this area by 
$150 million will force educational institutions and the Quebec 
government to raise tuition fees. It has already started, and it is 
only going to get worse.
<P>
	In fact, what they are doing is investing a little more in McJobs, 
in summer jobs, while forcing individual students, the targeted 
public, to borrow more money. This is what I would call an indirect 
transfer to students.
<P>
	Among other measures in this budget, the Liberal government 
wants to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act to make it even 
more difficult for new entrants to the labour force to collect 
benefits. While they needed only 300 hours of work in some 
regions and 400 in others, new entrants are now required to 
accumulate 910 hours to qualify. Is this helping young people? I 
think this is a masquerade.
<P>
	In the old days, seniors used to warn us about getting candy, 
explaining that recipients should wait for the other shoe to drop. 
This is what is hitting us, what is hitting students. It is a little 
present. An increase on the one hand, but a cut that is ten times 
bigger on the other hand.
<P>
	This is what I call smoke and mirrors designed to hide this 
government's unforgivable attitude toward young people, on whom 
this budget places the heaviest burden for paying back the debt.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government is not making a special effort for 
young people. On the contrary, it is making a special effort to push 
them even further into debt.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg South.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1038"> 1038 </A></B>
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-10, 
which provides borrowing authority. The budget is an outstanding 
document. It is balanced and fair and comes to terms with our 
deficit while creating opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	I begin with a matter of deep concern to my constituents as well 
as to the constituents of Waterloo, the neighbouring riding, the 
announcement having to do with the insurance industry.
<P>
	The announcement that the present restrictions will be 
maintained governing the selling of insurance by banks has been 
warmly welcomed in my riding of Kitchener. It was an important 
announcement. It has been applauded by large insurance 
companies such as Manulife, the Mutual Group and Economical 
Mutual, and by the many hundreds of agents who sell insurance in 
our area. It was an important decision which reflects the 
importance of the diversity in the financial services sector and 
which recognizes also the importance of insurance as the lifeblood 
of our communities.
<P>
	The insurance industry, other businesses in Kitchener and the 
citizens of Kitchener are gratified that the budget takes an 
important step toward restoring Canada's confidence and toward 
restoring a sense of hope among Canadians.
<P>
	Moreover, it addresses their worries about security. It has done 
this in so many ways, in direct responses in the changes affecting 
seniors security and in the broader questions of economic security. 
It addresses, in short, our fears and our hopes. Most important, it 
addresses a question which very much concerns my riding, the 
problem of youth and their future.
<P>
	Let us admit that under the Liberal government the economy has 
shown significant improvement. Our interest rates have declined 
by three percentage points in the last year, a remarkable 
achievement. We were challenged to meet the American rates. We 
have done so and we will improve on that.
<P>
	We have achieved a level of inflation which was unimaginable 
five years ago. It is the lowest level in 30 years. There is every 
indication that it will be lower.
<P>
	The competitiveness of the country has been greatly improved. 
We are now a trading country setting a mark for the world to match. 
Our improvement in trade not only with the United States with 
which we have an agreement but with the rest of the world is 
improving rapidly.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, since our election in 1993, we have created 600,000 
new jobs. In the last three months alone we have created 137,000 
jobs. These are all real accomplishments but as the finance minister 
pointed out, much work remains to be done and we are doing it. We 
are assuring a  future for our youth which can give them the kind of 
opportunities we had.
<P>
	During the Christmas break I had the opportunity to speak at 
many schools in the Waterloo region and in my riding of Kitchener. 
I also spoke with many young people in my constituency office, 
over family dinners and at other gatherings during the holidays.
<P>
	What struck me very strongly were the deep concerns of our 
youth. They do not have the opportunities we had when we were 
younger. They have legitimate fears about their futures. The youth 
unemployment rate is much higher than it was 20 and 30 years ago 
and it is very unacceptable for all of us. We are fulfilling our 
obligation to deal with these questions. The unemployment rate in 
my riding for youth under 25 is roughly 14 per cent. It is lower than 
the national average but is still absolutely unacceptable.
<P>
	The stories I heard during my Christmas vacation were often 
very sad. I heard about individuals who studied for many years but 
who found no opportunities to use their degrees. There were fears 
of technological change which youth recognized could not be 
avoided. I sensed in their comments that although they had these 
fears, there was an enormous commitment to the challenges of the 
future and a recognition that learning and training were 
fundamental to the kinds of opportunities that our youth would 
have in the future.
<P>
	The transition to work has been recognized as critically 
important in this budget and in all government policies: from 
school to the workplace, from the classroom to the shop floor. In 
this respect, the Waterloo Region Roman Catholic Separate School 
Board and the Waterloo County Board of Education have been 
leaders in Canada in co-op education. I have been privileged to 
have co-op students work in my constituency office. These students 
have learned computer and filing skills which supplement what 
they are learning in the classroom. I am confident my hope will be 
reflected in reality that this experience will lead them to job 
opportunities in the future.
<P>
	As I have said, the government has recognized the concerns and 
the problems and has striven to create opportunities. Let me 
indicate how it has done so. First, the government has reallocated 
$315 million in budget savings to help create employment 
opportunities for young Canadians.
<P>
	Second, the government has devoted $160 million to youth 
internship programs and Youth Services Canada. In the Waterloo 
region, Lutherwood has a program under Youth Services Canada 
which brings together youths with seniors and the police to work at 
finding job opportunities in the broadest possible sense within the 
community. It is a very successful program carried out by an 
esteemed institution within our region.
<P>
	Third, there has been a doubling of funds to $120 million for 
student summer employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1039"> 1039 </A></B>
<P>
	All of these things are extremely important but ultimately 
success will depend on encouraging a climate of innovation within 
Canada and within our region. In this case, the Waterloo region 
and Kitchener are models. Kitchener was the centre of traditional 
industry and manufacturing. Thirty years ago Kitchener was called 
the Akron of Canada and tires were its major business. Tires are 
still made in Kitchener but far more people are employed in other 
industries and far fewer make tires. Textiles was another industry, 
as was furniture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> And shoes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> My colleague from Waterloo reminds me of the 
making of shoes.
<P>
	These industries remain but they do not employ as many people 
as they did earlier. Those thousands of jobs that have been lost in 
what we call the more traditional industries, which are still 
extremely important, have been replaced by others such as jobs in 
educational institutions, for example. A great university and one of 
Canada's leading community colleges are located in 
Kitchener-Waterloo. The auto sector and the aerospace industry 
have grown to fill the gap created by the loss of other industries. 
We have developed a fairly significant high tech sector.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The budget will help Kitchener maintain its competitive edge. 
An additional $270 million have been allocated over the next three 
years to encourage technological innovation. We have created 
through the technology partnership program in excess of $500 
million over the next three years which will assist the aerospace 
industry in our area as well as in other industries.
<P>
	For our youth in this year's budget we have allowed $30 million 
over the next three years for SchoolNet, an Internet computer 
program for young students. It is a program that I have personally 
examined and have found to be a remarkable achievement for 
Industry Canada. Its benefits can only be imagined in terms of the 
work done in schools and the effects it will have on young 
Canadians.
<P>
	Once again this budget has created opportunities for youth and 
has dealt with the problems of the past. We have looked at the 
opportunities for the future and we can be proud that finally we are 
dealing with the hopes and fears of all Canadians, not only in 
Kitchener but throughout Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been interesting for me as a new member in this House to watch the 
business of budget creation.
<P>
	I spent some time in the early eighties as a senior bureaucrat in 
the provincial Government of Manitoba and then some five years 
in the provincial legislature as the finance critic. I have participated 
in the creation of  budgets from the perspective of a bureaucrat. I 
have participated in budgets from the perspective of a critic sitting 
on the opposite side of the House. For these last couple of years I 
have had the opportunity to participate as a backbencher of the 
governing party.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance for his 
unprecedented openness in the budget development process. Never 
in my experience has a Minister of Finance been so willing to 
consult, to open the process up, to invite people in and to sincerely 
listen to and respond to their concerns.
<P>
	After the last budget I sent out a letter to a cross-section of 
people in my riding which included individuals from a large 
university, small and large businesses, social services and labour. I 
asked them to take up the finance minister's challenge. He said to 
us at the end of the budget process last year that he would be as 
open to us as he could possibly be, that he would invite as many of 
us as possible into the process of examining possibilities and 
developing new approaches to the finances of this country.
<P>
	I invited a large number of people from across Canada into those 
very discussions. We set up a series of working groups. We first 
spent some time looking at issues they wanted the finance minister 
and government to focus on. Over time we began to do more 
detailed research on the issues and worked them down. This fall we 
came up with a series of proposals which we presented to the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In my role as chair of the social policy committee of caucus I 
went through a similar process with a series of working groups in 
our own caucus. I want to reflect on some of that work today.
<P>
	The people in my riding of Winnipeg South said this to the 
Minister of Finance: ``Continue to meet your targets. We know it is 
tough. The deficit process has been a difficult one. It is not easy. 
Nobody likes the process of cutting but we believe that it is 
producing better decisions, more efficient decisions and in the end 
the pain will be worth it''. That is exactly what we are beginning to 
experience as confidence has increased in the finance minister's 
ability to manage the financial affairs of the country.
<P>
	The terrible fluctuations in interest rates, fluctuations in the 
dollar and the uncertainty about investment decisions has begun to 
diminish and we see a much more stable, secure investment climate 
for the people who are confronting those decisions in their lives 
today.
<P>
	All of the indicators are moving in the right direction. The 
feedback response and the analysis of the course set and 
maintained by the finance minister has been extremely positive. I 
can tell the finance minister and the House that it meets with the 
complete approval of the people in my constituency.
<P>

<P>
	There were some areas of concern. Seniors had a serious concern 
at the time of discussions on the reform of the pension program. I 
had a number of groups working on it, a number of people 
consulting with me on it. People were caught because they could 
see from the tables and the research produced that there was a 
serious problem with the Canada pension plan. They knew there 
were some serious inequities in the distribution of support under 
the OAS and the GIS. They had that information.
<P>
	People who were on income support programs, people who were 
retired and receiving benefits or people who were close to 
retirement and close to receiving benefits were extremely 
concerned. These were people with very limited options. They had 
set their course, they had made their plans and to have those 
programs changed suddenly was very threatening and very 
frightening.
<P>
	They have reacted to the finance minister's decisions with great 
support and great relief. He and the government are committing to 
no change in the benefit structure for people who are currently 
receiving pensions. The government has agreed to involve seniors 
in a process of change that will take some years. The idea that 
people can alter their planning as they approach their retirement 
has been received with great support and great appreciation.
<P>
	Another great concern was the threat of very large cuts to social 
programs, particularly the plan to combine the EPF health, the EPF 
post-secondary education and the Canada assistance plan into the 
Canada health and social transfer. People understand we have to 
deal with the major expenditure programs in order to get a deficit 
of our magnitude under control. They know and accept that. There 
was a great deal of concern about the size of the cuts and what the 
eventual outcome would be.
<P>
	There was much work done within the caucus committee and a 
tremendous amount of time put into this by the advisory committee 
in my riding. It came forward with a proposal much like the one 
that came out of the finance committee, that a floor be placed on 
these payments which could be maintained until such time as the 
deficit could be brought to zero and we could start to reinvest in 
health care.
<P>
	We are delighted the finance minister has chosen to take that 
route. Not only are we delighted he has chosen to accept the 
recommendations to establish a floor but that he has actually set a 
higher floor than we thought was possible. People are absolutely 
delighted that we will continue to play a role in medicare, 
post-secondary education and social programs in this country into 
the foreseeable future and that now the real work has begun on 
determining the national standards and principles in terms of 
providing a true social safety net for all Canadians.
<P>
	Another area provoked a lot of debate in my riding because I 
have a very large university, the University of Manitoba, one of the 
best universities in Canada located fully within the boundaries of 
my riding. Like all universities it is undergoing tremendous 
difficulty right now as it works to restructure its programming, 
upgrade its style of teaching and its technology. There is a 
tremendous amount of pressure on universities across the country.
<P>
	The pressure is very difficult to understand in some ways when 
we think that Canada is at the forefront of countries in transition to 
becoming knowledge based economies. By their very existence 
universities are major producers of knowledge. They are net 
generators of new ideas, of information, of new approaches and 
challenges to the ways in which we think of doing business.
<P>
	Yet those very institutions that are so vital to our growth and our 
continued economic health are currently under tremendous 
pressure at all levels. Students have felt the effects of many 
increases in their fees to the point where people are beginning to 
make decisions not to go to university because of the costs. The 
pressure from new technologies and the questions about the style, 
the nature and the goals of training have put enormous pressure on 
the faculties of universities across the country.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	They have been looking to us, asking us what our policy is on 
post-secondary education. They note that in the red book on page 
111, which all members have memorized by this point, the second 
largest cash commitment we made was $1 billion in new money in 
the area of research and development. They have also noticed that 
in the budgets of the past two years, the first two years of this 
government, did not live up to that commitment. Not only did we 
not make those new investments, but we began to cut support for 
science research in Canada.
<P>
	I am delighted and certainly the people in my riding are 
delighted to see the government begin to act upon this very 
important promise. The decisions on research and development, 
the support for students, the greater involvement of business and 
universities in the economic life of this country are decisions that 
are broadly welcomed.
<P>
	Finally, the decisions around youth job creation were central to 
the discussions I had in my riding. People wanted to see us give 
more varied opportunities and options to youth in their search for 
employment and opportunities for wealth and security.
<P>
	The decisions the finance minister finally made, which are 
reflected in the budget in terms of student aid, summer help and 
entry into the labour market, have been broadly welcomed. By and 
large, the constituents of Winnipeg South have been delighted by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1041"> 1041 </A></B>
<P>
the budget. We  wish the finance minister well and look forward to 
working with him on the next one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by congratulating the Minister of Finance. He 
gave an excellent political speech when he brought in his budget. 
He smiled throughout and came very close on a number of 
occasions to breaking his arm while patting himself on the back.
<P>
	What we are talking about is a futurama like ``2001: A Space 
Odyssey''. Everything happens way down the street. We were 
pleased to see the minister admit and recognize what Reform has 
been saying for the past eight years, that in the present financial 
circumstances, universality is really an impossible dream. What 
must happen and what he did in this budget is to recognize that 
support must be focused on those who need it.
<P>
	Sadly, the minister has misled the public. He said for instance, 
that 75 per cent of old aged people would be better off. He 
neglected to say that if 75 per cent are going to be better off then 25 
per cent will be worse off. He did not mention that.
<P>
	He said there would be no new taxes. Between 1993 and 1995, 
the average Canadian family income tax has increased by $993 in 
real 1994 dollars. Since 1987, disposable income before taxes has 
dropped by 8.6 percentage points. The minister said: ``We are not 
raising personal taxes. We are not raising corporate taxes. We are 
not raising excise taxes. In fact, we are not raising taxes''.
<P>
	However, in the budget at least nine changes to the Income Tax 
Act provide for a tax grab through the back door. What about the 
reduction of RRSP termination age from 71 to 69? This adds only 
$100 million by the year 2000. What about no more tax deductions 
for RRSP fees paid outside the plan? This adds $10 million over the 
next three years.
<P>
	The minister has frozen the RRSP contribution limit at $13,500, 
whereas it was supposed to rise to $14,500 and beyond. This is 
until 2003 and results in $215 million in extra taxes over the next 
three years. These RRSP changes send conflicting messages. 
People are asked to provide for their own future, yet the incentive 
and advantages of doing so have been stripped away. Taxes have 
increased.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	What about the taxation of those paying child support payments? 
We were looking for the mechanism whereby we could be assured 
those child support payments went to the appropriate place, to the 
children concerned. The finance minister has said that the 
government will collect the taxes which may be diverted 
elsewhere. This was not the purpose of child support payments. It 
remains to be seen if the changes will benefit the children and the 
families involved.
<P>
	Despite election promises, the GST and the Deputy Prime 
Minister are still with us. During the election campaign Liberal 
candidates stood on doorsteps and said that they were going to axe 
the GST, that they were going to scrap the GST, that they were 
going to abolish the GST. Here we are three budgets downstream 
and not a change has been made.
<P>
	In yesterday's GST debate the Liberal government members 
voted against the motion to abolish the GST. Even if the GST were 
harmonized, as the government suggests it is going to be, this 
would increase taxes for all Canadians, except perhaps Albertans 
who do not have a provincial sales tax. It would broaden the 
taxation base.
<P>
	Why or how did the finance minister think he would succeed 
where the former Conservative minister Wilson could not? Was he 
hoper-groping? Was this a rash promise, a naive promise or was it a 
deliberately calculated vote garnering election misrepresentation to 
the Canadian public? Whichever, it has become yet another broken 
promise. The finance minister even avoided using the term GST, 
referring to it rather as the federal sales tax. He is asking the 
provinces to help him achieve his deficit reduction. He has passed 
the cost saving measures on to them.
<P>
	The government has also proposed spending $50 million to try to 
battle the underground economy. It expects to cash in on $185 
million over the next three years. The root cause of the 
underground economy has not been addressed. This includes high 
personal income taxes and the GST. Obviously, as long as these 
remain in place there will be a higher and more active underground 
or barter economy.
<P>
	The budget affects taxation in an indirect way. It backs off from 
fiscal restraint and does not provide any tax relief into the next 
century. These rolling two-year targets which the finance minister 
is so proud of exhorting are being met because they are too timid, 
too faltering and too slow. Almost anyone can be an expert high 
jumper if the bar is set only a foot above the ground. The reason the 
targets have been met, besides being set too low, is because we 
have had a growing economy and the interest rates have remained 
unexpectedly low.
<P>
	Let us look at our next projection. The next deficit target is set at 
$24.7 billion. That is another $25 billion added to drive our debt to 
over $600 billion with another $2 billion added to the interest on 
that debt. Under the Liberals the debt has increased by more than 
$100 billion since 1993. The interest payments on the debt have 
gone from $38 billion to around $48 billion. That is $10 billion 
paid out at the expense of social programs.
<P>
	The taxpayers' budget would have cut only $1 billion in health 
and welfare spending; whereas the Liberals cut $8.2 billion to the 
Canada health and social transfer. The Reform Party has been 
saying for the past eight years that the biggest threat to Canada's 
social programs is the debt and the interest payments on that debt.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1042"> 1042 </A></B>
<P>
	The target for the following year has another $17 billion deficit 
and we will be well on our way toward a debt of over $700 billion.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	If the Liberals would have adopted the Reform taxpayers' budget 
in 1994 instead of following their infamous soft rolling two-year 
targets, by this time next year we would be debating where to apply 
the surplus. Would we apply it to the debt or to social programs? By 
the next election, rather than increasing the debt by $112 billion the 
debt would have increased by only $50 billion, a difference of $62 
billion, almost $3 billion less in interest payments that we would be 
required to pay.
<P>
	There is still no time line for a balanced budget. The minister 
simply will not say when he intends to balance the budget. That 
means there is no tax relief. This is causing economic concern and 
a lack of confidence for both the consumer and the business 
community. This constrains spending and expansion which in turn 
constrains employment opportunities.
<P>
	The government has said that it is going to strike a technical 
committee to study the business income taxation act which will 
look for ways to encourage job creation and investment, yet 
another committee. This is simply window dressing. Based on past 
experience, we know the cost of a committee is anywhere from 
$500,000 to $5 million.
<P>
	The Liberals spent $6 billion on the infrastructure program. We 
know every well this created no lasting jobs and was borrowed 
money that went down the drain. The best way to fuel the economy 
and to create jobs is to balance the budget and start to pay down the 
debt.
<P>
	Canada is a rich country despite the huge debt we have. 
However, it needs a far sighted, courageous government willing to 
do what must be done. This government, this budget lacking in 
foresight, courage, ideas and leadership is not doing the job. Most 
of these budget measures will not be implemented until after the 
next election. Promises, promises. Much like the past election, the 
Liberals make them, but they do not have to keep them. This 
budget is not the budget Canada needs at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I believe there is time for questions and answers. I 
propose that we do that right after the question period. We will 
recognize questioners at that time.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
February 80,000 public servants in occupations dominated by 
women thought they had won a major victory in their 11 year 
struggle to win pay equity from the federal government.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled against the 
government's attempt to quash the findings of a study that found a 
large wage gap between women and men in comparable positions 
in the public service and began hearings on how the government 
could make good on its legal obligations.
<P>
	However, today we learned that the Liberals will try to steal that 
victory and continue to deny pay equity to public servants. The 
Liberals ought to be ashamed of the way they are evading their 
legal obligations at the tribunal's hearings by bringing forth the 
argument that pay equity discriminates against men. The idea is to 
pay women more, not men less.
<P>
	The Liberals should heed the advice of Canada's human rights 
commissioner and take the lead in pay equity. The Liberals have 
thrown out a challenge to the private sector to be responsible. We in 
the New Democratic Party join with those Canadians who also 
expect the federal government to be a responsible employer.

<P>
	Now we have learned that there is a plan to distribute dental

its plans to subsidize inmate sex with free condoms and drug use 
through the distribution of bleach kits.
<P>
	When will this insanity end? Canadians want common sense

<P>
	Racial discrimination is a costly thing. It is costly in human,

based on the premise that people are not all equal. However, 
Canada and Quebec both view people's equality as a fundamental

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Martin 
Luther King dreamt of the end of racial discrimination. Nelson 
Mandela suffered years of imprisonment for it and hundreds of 
thousands fought  for it in this century. Through their struggles they 
sought a world free of racial discrimination in which equality and 
harmony prevail.
<P>
	Today, March 21, marks the United Nation's internationally 
designated day for the elimination of racial discrimination. While 
most governments are attempting to address this challenging issue, 
we continue to witness too much racism, whether it be in the 
workplace, the school yard or even our neighbourhood.
<P>
	When former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau introduced 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms it was a bold step in 
an effort to combat racism and to ensure for all Canadians their 
fundamental rights and freedoms.
<P>
	The challenge to eliminate racism is a great one but governments 
must remain determined in their effort to achieve this. As we mark 
this day I ask that all Canadians rise to the challenge by combating 
racism whenever and wherever it is witnessed.
<P>
	As one authority once said, in the end you can only teach the 
things that you are; if we practice racism then it is racism that we 
teach.

national anthem. Like you, I care deeply about the unity of this 
great nation of ours.
<P>
	I feel a deep sense of pride when I see my country named as the 
number one country in the world in which to live. Yet I am also a 
Canadian of Italian heritage. I have many things to be proud of in 
my culture of origin.
<P>
	I stand here today on the international day for the elimination of 
racial discrimination and say that only in this country can I be 
proud to be a Canadian and just as proud of my Italian heritage.
<P>
	Together we can be one people and yet respectful of our 
differences. We have done much as country to promote racial 
cohesion and respect, yet lately we see an increase in racial tension 
in our land. Today what we have built together may be at risk.
<P>
	Let us renew on this day our commitment to keep our Canadian 
values alive, to eliminate discrimination in all of its ugly forms, the 
ugliest of which surely must be racism.

Quebecois wishes to salute this event, which was successful in 
getting groups in Quebec to work together toward a common goal. 
This summit is another demonstration of Quebec's own way of

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly, the federal government does not  appear to want to 
back down on the matter of manpower training, insisting on 
maintaining and even heightening duplication and overlap, which, 
as we know, lead to inefficiency and waste in this sector so vital in 
a full-blown employment crisis. Yesterday, the Prime Minister 
reiterated his intentions saying, with regard to active measures: 
``these are federal programs-and they will remain under our 
control''.
<P>
	Given the reaffirmation of the Quebec consensus yesterday at the 
socio-economic conference in Quebec City, which had been 
reached by management, unions and government and which 
requests the federal government to withdraw from active measures, 
will the Prime Minister agree to reverse his decision and permit the 
elimination of overlap in the area of manpower?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted because progress was made. We are no 
longer talking about manpower training. Everybody acknowledges 
it, and, now I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for 
finally acknowledging that we offered to withdraw from manpower 
training.
<P>
	As for the other measures arising from federal government 
programs, the bill currently under review provides for discussions 
and negotiations with the provinces so that our respective programs 
may be discussed and harmonized in order to eliminate duplication.
<P>
	The bill being considered provides for it, and, when the 
governments are ready to discuss it, we will be ready too. Only, I 
say that the money collected under the programs previously known 
as unemployment insurance and soon to be called employment 
insurance, with the money then that we collect from federal 
taxpayers, we must be able to respond to questions and to assume 
responsibility for it before all members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a fine demonstration of the following principle: it is 
not easy to negotiate with he who hears only what he wants to hear. 
It really is not easy. The Prime Minister knows very well that the 
Quebec consensus demands the federal government's complete 
withdrawal from the areas of job training, manpower and active 
measures. The Prime Minister should remember.
<P>
	When federalists such as Ghislain Dufour, Laurent Beaudoin and 
André Bérard say it cannot go on-and are even prepared to 
accompany Louise Harel to Ottawa to make the Prime Minister 
listen to reason-is it not clear to the Prime Minister that Quebec 
opposes his position in the field of manpower training and that 
even his federalist allies are bothered by it? Does he understand 
that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1047"> 1047 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just told the hon. Leader of the Opposition that 
we are prepared to withdraw from manpower training.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we realize that the Prime Minister's referendum promises 
are worth very little. First, a veto that is no veto, recognition of 
Quebec as a distinct society that is not recognition and a promise to 
withdraw from the field of manpower that is no promise.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, if he continues in the field 
of manpower as he has been going, it will be his third strike? In 
baseball, it is three strikes and you are out.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I recall rightly, the leader of the yes side in the last 
referendum, Mr. Parizeau, said they had won the first period in 
1993, the second in 1994 and that they were going to win the third 
in 1995. Well-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> We are in overtime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have never seen 
anyone lose and then say he was going into overtime after the third 
period. You lost the referendum. The game is over. That is it.
<P>
	Are they going into overtime until they win?
<P>
	Listen, Mr. Speaker, I have just told this House clearly that the 
promises we made in the throne speech and before stand. We will 
withdraw from the field of manpower. I have repeated it, and we 
will withdraw. If they want us to withdraw right now, we are ready 
to do so.
<P>
	As for active measures, thse are not manpower training, but 
something else. I said that the bill provides for negotiations on 
them. They want us to sign a blank cheque. For heaven's sake. This 
is taxpayers' money. It is money from workers in Alberta, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario that is redistributed to 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Quebec. We have a 
responsibility to be fair to everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday Ghislain Dufour was speaking of active 
measures. In light of the economic summit which ended in Quebec 
City yesterday, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the Prime 
Minister of Canada is completely out of touch with Quebec reality.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister engage in federal-provincial 
squabbles? Why is he adding fuel to the fire? Why is he involved in 
a flagwaving battle at the expense of the 800,000 plus men and 
women who are waiting for a real manpower policy to come along 
so that they can find a job?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too can quote business leaders, if that is what you want. 
They stated clearly that the greatest handicap to economic growth 
in Quebec at the present time is the idea of separatism the members 
across the way are upholding.
<P>
	If they really wanted to create jobs for unemployed Quebecers, 
they would put the whole idea of independence on ice, so we could 
work together on creating jobs for Quebecers, for the people of 
Montreal in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, those same business leaders, in many instances 
federalists, nonetheless have agreed to work with the sovereignists 
in Quebec. They have managed to reach a consensus, a concept this 
Prime Minister of Canada has not managed to reach, to feel 
comfortable with, to understand in the slightest.
<P>
	Not long ago, the Prime Minister was accusing us of talking 
about the Constitution, when what had to be talked about was jobs, 
according to him. Now, when everybody is talking about 
employment, he is the one bringing up the Constitution. Cute trick, 
would you not say?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	When will he, or his minister, meet with the government of 
Quebec and negotiate on the basis of consensus, a consensus 
reached by federalists and others, that same consensus referred to 
yesterday by everybody, from Gérald Larose to Laurent Beaudoin, 
from Daniel Johnson to Lucien Bouchard?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> I have set 
out the government's position clearly. The Minister is prepared to 
meet with the minister at any time. He has said so.
<P>
	On the matter of manpower training, which is the term still used 
here in this House and everywhere else, what we are saying is that 
we are pulling out of it.
<P>
	But, as concerns unemployment insurance programs, and the 
monies we collect from all employees and employers across 
Canada, it is our constitutional responsibility to administer them. I 
am not talking Constitution, but merely saying that I want people to 
respect the Constitution we have at this time, which states that 
unemployment insurance is a federal responsibility.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the separatist premier of Quebec committed 
that province to enacting a deficit elimination law and achieving 
that target by the year 2000.  Apparently this measure enjoys 
consider-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1048"> 1048 </A></B>
<P>
able support from Quebec business executives, union leaders, 
federalists and separatists.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government is in danger of letting the 
separatists get out in front, this time on the issue of who can 
manage government finances more responsibly. When will the 
Prime Minister establish a firm date for the elimination of the 
federal deficit, or is he prepared to play second fiddle to Lucien 
Bouchard on that issue?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a program which is very well known. We said 
that this year we will be at 3 per cent of the GDP and we will meet 
that target. The Minister of Finance set another target of 2 per cent 
for next year and again we will meet that target.
<P>
	People are so impressed by the way we are managing the 
situation that today Canada's interest rates are lower than those in 
the United States. With the way it is being managed, interest rates 
have gone down by more than 3 points in one year.
<P>
	I am delighted with the decision yesterday in Quebec about 
setting the goal of reducing its deficit. Ours is going down. We will 
be at 2 per cent. The most important thing is to have a realistic 
target and meet it.
<P>
	The Gingrich friends of those in the third party have passed 
about six bills in the United States about a target and they never 
met it. Here, we have a short term target that is met. The business 
community is applauding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assume that either the Prime Minister did not hear my 
question or he did not understand it.
<P>
	We are talking about manoeuvring for the next referendum in 
Quebec. The premier of Quebec has committed his government to 
deficit elimination. He will then blame any failure to meet that 
target on deficit unloading by the federal government, of which 
there was a great deal in the recent budget. There is a trap here. I 
challenge the Prime Minister to avoid it.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister guarantee that the federal government 
will be in better shape than the separatist Government of Quebec on 
deficit elimination, debt reduction and tax relief prior to the next 
referendum?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are way ahead today. We are also way ahead of the 
Ontario government. We have managed to do that in a civilized 
way, in the Liberal way. It will not be by slashing and burning or by 
not caring whether people are suffering in our society like the 
Reform Party would do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is sleep walking again on this issue in 
preparation for the next contest with the separatists in Quebec. In 
order to win that contest the  federal government must appear 
fiscally stronger and more fiscally responsible than the separatist 
Government of Quebec. It has to be ahead on debt elimination, it 
has to be ahead on debt reduction and it has to be ahead on tax 
relief. Unbelievably, the government seems to be willing to trail the 
separatists on these three counts.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that by dragging his feet on 
those three subjects or talking a lot about those three subjects but 
not addressing them, he is weakening the federalist position even 
before the next contest with the Quebec separatists begins?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the third party is getting up for his fourth 
strike.
<P>
	We are ahead. We started two and a half years ago and we are 
ahead of our program. Interest rates will recede again. At this 
moment they are below the interest rates of the United States. 
Interest rates in Canada have dropped three points in the last 12 
months. We managed to do that while making sure that the people 
who are the weakest in Canadian society were not the ones who 
paid the price.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Prime Minister refused to hand over active 
measures by hiding behind remarks allegedly made by Ghislain 
Dufour to the effect that the consensus was about manpower 
training. Yesterday at the Quebec summit, it was Mr. Dufour who 
introduced a motion to have all manpower training active measures 
transferred back to Quebec. He even volunteered to accompany 
Mrs. Harel.
<P>
	I ask again: In view of this clearly expressed consensus and the 
October 30 results, will the Prime Minister show good faith and 
take a realistic attitude by agreeing to transfer to Quebec all active 
measures and relevant budgets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe it is important to 
emphasize again the good faith demonstrated by all those involved 
in this issue.
<P>
	On March 18, I sent a letter to the minister responsible for this 
issue in Quebec, in which I said, in essence, the following: ``I do 
recognize the fact that there is a consensus in Quebec and that the 
province is very serious about taking charge of the active measures 
relating to Quebec's labour market, as indicated in the motion 
passed by the National Assembly of Quebec on December 4, 1995. 
Moreover, I fully agree with some of the principles set forth in the 
document received from  you. These principles-the need for 
integrated active labour market measures, partnerships, decentral-

ized decision making, result-oriented action-are perfectly in 
keeping with those outlined by the Government of Canada in Part II 
of the bill. It would seem to me that they are also closely akin to the 
positions taken by many of our colleagues from the other 
provinces, as described in the document issued by the ministerial 
council on social policy reform''.
<P>
	My hon. colleague should be reminded of the fact that we had 
already put this proposal forward before this gathering took place 
in Montreal and Quebec City this week.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister-since he has been the one answering in the past 
three days-realize that having two overlapping systems is 
expensive: $250 million, according to the previous Liberal 
government? What is he waiting for then to let employee and 
employer contributions be put to use to create jobs rather than to 
enhance the visibility of the federal government?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that some kind of a 
consensus has been reached, even between us and members 
representing the opposition in this House. In fact, if you listened to 
what I was proposing to the Quebec minister responsible, all we are 
waiting for now is for a Quebec delegation to come and tell us what 
they have to propose on the basis of the Quebec consensus and 
what is already provided for in Part II of Bill C-12-

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party 
was told directly by the Haitian embassy and by our own foreign 
affairs protocol office that the Haitian president was not scheduled 
to come to Canada after his Washington visit until just last week. 
The arranging of this trip was directly connected to the byelection. 
The Prime Minister should have known this yesterday when he 
said: ``There was no connection at all. There was none. There was 
none''.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister withdraw his incorrect statements, 
admit there has been a serious manipulation of a byelection and ask 
the ethics counsellor to investigate this unfortunate misuse of 
power?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is becoming increasingly evident that the definition of 
the new politics of the Reform Party is to reduce everything to the 
most base partisan level absolutely possible.
<P>
	It is absolutely deplorable that the hon. member is taking a visit 
from the newly elected President of Haiti, who is visiting his major 
partners, the Dominican Republic, the United States and Canada, 
countries which are directly involved in the development and 
reconstruction of his country and responsible for the United 
Nations force to talk about its implementation, and turning it into a 
partisan attack. It is absolutely deplorable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the critical 
question is: When was the invitation issued?
<P>
	The Haitians have told the Reform Party the truth. Liberal 
golden boy Pierre Pettigrew has used his government influence to 
bring in the Haitian president to help him win the byelection 
campaign.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister categorically deny that his government 
arranged for the Haitian president's Montreal visit just last week 
when it was discovered that the byelection was too close to call? If 
he will not deny this, will he admit that the government's actions 
have blatantly interfered with the byelection process and that was 
totally wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is really wrong is the attitude, facts and presentation 
of the hon. member. The only thing wrong with the visit is the kind 
of position that party has taken.
<P>
	Let me cite the facts. The decision of the Haitian president to 
come to Canada was based solely upon the need to work with the 
American government and our own government. He made that 
decision at a time that was most convenient after his inauguration. 
During his visit he is meeting with senior business leaders here in 
Ottawa and in Quebec. He is meeting with the leader of the 
Government of Quebec. He is also meeting with the Leader of the 
Opposition. There is nothing partisan about that. He just wants to 
meet with people who are interested in the welfare of Haiti. That is 
one reason he is not meeting with the Reform Party.

establishment of a roving commission on taxation that will review 
the whole tax system as part of a transparent process that will call 
for public input.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1050"> 1050 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us why his government has decided 
that the tax system should be reviewed behind closed doors by 
a small group of experts, a group of insiders who have become 
rich by using tax shelters, who in fact would not benefit in any 
way from any changes?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, any tax reform would lead to the introduction of a bill in 
the House of Commons, which then decides if the bill is good or 
bad. Whether or not there is a roving commission, what counts is 
the bill that comes before Parliament.
<P>
	So far, the Minister of Finance has shown that he can bring down 
very balanced budgets, from which he himself has eliminated a 
considerable number of tax loopholes, including family trusts, an 
issue that was raised by the hon. member. I think that the method 
used by Canada's Minister of Finance is quite effective.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, Canadian interest rates have dropped by 
three points in the last year. Our interest rates are now lower than 
those in the U.S. Everyone has their own way of doing things, but I 
am quite satisfied with the method that has been used so far by 
Canada's Minister of Finance.
<P>

Speaker, the Prime Minister is telling us that there is no problem, 
that the foxes are guarding the henhouse and even contributing to 
Liberal Party coffers. Well, the foxes are going to reach biased 
conclusions, because these committee experts advise large 
corporations on how to avoid paying their fair share to Revenue 
Canada. The Prime Minister is telling us: ``There is no problem; we 
are in good hands''. The world has turned topsy-turvy.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants his government to be credible when 
it says it wants to restore fair and equitable taxation in Canada, he 
should immediately undertake to open up and democratize his 
committee by getting all Canadians involved, because taxation 
concerns everyone, and not only those who benefit.

may vary by the end of the year.

<P>
	Although the Prime Minister is trying to defend both ministers, 
he cannot have it both ways. Either the former minister of 
immigration was wrong for producing this piece of Liberal

Canadians which minister messed up?

decision after she became minister and decided not to proceed with 
the distribution of the pamphlet. That was her privilege and her 
right. It was the privilege and the right of the minister to work on

compensation in return. Grain producers, however, have received 
$2.9 billion in compensation.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Agriculture admit that his action is unfair to 
the dairy producers of Canada, who would be entitled to expect 
compensation of at least $800 million, of which $400 million 
should go to the dairy producers of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman knows, the 
western grain transportation subsidy in western Canada was 
cancelled all at once in the decision taken in the budget of 1995. 
The subsidy terminated completely on August 1 last year.
<P>

<P>
	To assist farmers in the transition process away from what had

totally unsubsidized regime, a transition program was put in place 
temporarily. It is being implemented quite literally as we speak.
<P>
	With respect to the dairy subsidy there is not a termination of the 
subsidy all at once. The phasing out process began in the 1995 
budget with a first reduction of 15 per cent in the current year and 
another 15 per cent next year. As we announced in the 1996 budget

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to pay tribute to the late Ernest 
Manning.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Manning when he was in the 
House and it is with sadness that I speak. He was quite a 
remarkable man and he had a very remarkable record of service to 
his church, to Alberta and to Canada.
<P>
	He became the youngest cabinet minister in the Commonwealth 
at the age of 26. He served in the provincial government for 33 
years, for 25 years as premier. He was radio host of Back to the 
Bible Hour for almost 50 years. It is no wonder that the people of 
Alberta came to know him and trust him.
<P>
	More than any other politician, he was the architect of modern 
Alberta. He brought its finances under control, established the 
foundation of the provincial social services system, and ensured the 
development of the province's oil and gas industry which has been 
so vital to its prosperity. The results of his work are very evident 
today in a strong and prosperous Alberta.
<P>
	In his eulogy, the member for Calgary Southwest mentioned that 
his father attended every first ministers conference from the day 
they were established by Mackenzie King until the beginning of the 
Trudeau administration. His commitment to Canada was never 
questioned.
<P>
	I think it was this remarkable record of service that made Mr. 
Trudeau appoint him to the Senate. Mr. Manning understood better 
than most the way that Canada works. For 13 years he sat as an 
independent senator. Apparently he once said that a lot of people 
think senators are entirely preoccupied with protocol, alcohol and 
Geritol. Of course, Mr. Manning was not preoccupied with these 
matters. I had the honour to serve in Parliament with Senator 
Manning and he was always very conscientious in carrying out his 
duties.
<P>
	Throughout his life he worked for a strong Alberta and a united 
Canada. He was a legendary figure in Canadian history and an 
outstanding model of public service.
<P>
	We see very clearly that his legacy lives on in the work of his 
son. I know they were very close and this is a very sad loss for him.
<P>
	On behalf of all members of the government, I extend our 
sincere condolences to the family of the late Ernest Manning.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I myself knew Mr. Manning as a senator. I even had the pleasure 
of speaking with him a few times. He was an exceptionally 
courteous man who enjoyed giving advice on request. He was not 
the type to dictate what we should do on a daily basis but, if we had 
an opportunity to talk to him and to ask him a few questions on his 
past experiences, he was always very courteous and eager to help. 
As I was saying earlier, Canada has lost a great patriot, a truly great 
Canadian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my colleagues, I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Manning, as I 
called him for many, many years.
<P>
	In the annals of Canadian history, Ernest Charles Manning will 
be remembered as a statesman, a leader and a builder. Over the 
course of some 25 years as the premier of Alberta, he led Albertans 
from the poverty and destitution of the depression to the prosperity 
and affluence of today.
<P>
	Inheriting a financially bankrupt treasury in 1935, he left Alberta 
debt free. Some 30 per cent of the budget of the Alberta 
government was cash in the bank when he left. That is a 
tremendous record and something we do not always see today.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	At the time Mr. Manning took over in 1935, the bankers of the 
day were not willing to provide Alberta with money, nor was the 
Government of Canada. He had a very difficult time to start within 
that depression era. Presiding over the development of the oil and 
gas industry which reversed the province's fortunes, Mr. Manning 
made possible the economic, social and educational infrastructure 
which exists today in Alberta.
<P>
	On the national scene he played a leading role in bringing the 
concerns of western Canadians to the halls of power in Ottawa. As 
the Prime Minister said very well, he participated in every 
federal-provincial conference from Mackenzie King to Pierre 
Trudeau and spent 13 years as a senator where he became the 
leading advocate for the reform of that institution. He has left his 
mark on our province of Alberta and our country Canada.
<P>
	When I speak of Mr. Manning today, I pay tribute to the man 
himself, one whom I considered to be a teacher, a mentor and a 
very close friend. I had the honour and privilege of serving in Mr. 
Manning's government and cabinet for five years. The lessons I 
learned during that period of time remain with me today and will 
remain with me for the rest of my life.
<P>
	There are lessons we would all do well to learn. Above all, they 
centre around three basic words: honesty, integrity and fairness. 
Mr. Manning stood for something at all times. Everything he did, 
every action he took was grounded in a very firm moral conviction. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1055"> 1055 </A></B>
<P>
Every decision  he reached was in the embodiment of a 
fundamental principle. Mixed into that principle always was this 
element of fairness.
<P>
	When groups would come to make presentations to us as a 
cabinet, he made sure that both sides were heard and that 
everybody was able to understand the problem. In the final analysis 
he was able to pick out of the conversation the key thing that had to 
be decided, then he would ask cabinet: ``Is this what we are 
deciding? Is it fair and is it right for our people?'' At that point we 
would make a decision and proceed. It was a very open, democratic 
process.
<P>
	Every policy he brought forward in Alberta was sought to realize 
his goal of creating an environment in which each individual could 
have the freedom and resources to reach their full potential and 
make a contribution to society. A central characteristic of Mr. 
Manning was his strong ethical grounding, his sense of moral 
centre. It acted as his compass and the guiding means of his 
conduct in his government.
<P>
	There was no room for favouritism in Mr. Manning's Alberta. 
There were no kickbacks, there were no grafts. It simply was not 
done. Even members of the business community who were very 
suspicious of social credit in its beginning came to respect him and 
to trust him. When he gave them his word, they knew it was good, 
and it was.
<P>
	I remember many of our experiences together: the medicare 
discussions; the locating of the University of Lethbridge in 
southern Alberta; CPR's relocation in Calgary; meeting with the 
Metis people of northern Alberta; the paper on human resources 
development; the book on political realignment. I remember the 
one day in his office about a week before he resigned as premier 
when he sat back in his chair, pulled the right bottom drawer open 
and said to me: ``There are many new things to do yet, Ray. I have a 
drawerful''. His thoughts were always about the future and not on 
the past.
<P>
	Mr. Manning, in his deeds and actions, set a standard by which 
all politicians are measured. A man of dignity and integrity, a 
devoted Christian and a loving father, he was a credit to his 
profession. Taken from us at the age of 87 he will be missed as a 
leader in our communities, missed by his family, by his son, by his 
province, by his country, but we are all richer, warmer and wiser for 
the great experience of having known him.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all know how difficult political life can be. When a 
political figure disappears, it is only fitting to reflect briefly on the 
career of the deceased.
<P>
	A political career spanning 46 years is very long and it certainly 
shows how much trust the people of Alberta had put in Mr. 
Manning.
<P>
	What is impressive is the innumerable decisions that had to be 
made by this politician during his career, decisions which had an 
impact on the life of his loved ones and which were dictated, I am 
sure, by an extraordinary sense of duty and great respect for 
democracy.
<P>
	Mr. Manning certainly was committed in the purest sense of the 
word. For all these reasons, the members of my party join me in 
extending our deepest sympathy to the leader of the third party, 
who was sorely afflicted by the passing of his father.
<P>
	Going beyond political differences, we must bow down before 
great men and women and this, we always do. There is no doubt 
that, with a career spanning 46 years, including many years as 
premier, Mr. Manning was one of the great ones.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to share a few thoughts about Mr. Manning and some of 
the experiences I had with him.

Manning had gone out of power. All I knew was the incredible 
respect the name Ernest Manning had in the entire province of 
Alberta because of his history and his amazing political career.

	When I first was elected to the House of Commons in a 
byelection on March 13, 1989, Mr. Manning's son, Preston, was 
with me in my campaign office. As one can imagine, we were 
pretty excited that night. Mr. Manning Sr. was down in Arizona and 
his son, Preston, phoned him. I think the conversation went 
something like this: ``Dad, we won, we really won''. He was so 
excited he said: ``Put her on, I would like to talk to her''.
<P>
	I was a little nervous. My life had just been turned upside down 
already and then I got to speak with this famous Canadian. He said: 
``Hello, Deborah, this is Ernest Manning. I want to let you know we 
are thrilled that you just won the byelection. I do believe this is 
going to make some change in Canadian politics''. That was an 
incredible moment for me when Ernest Manning knew my name 
and spoke to me on the telephone. It was a remarkable experience 
for me, one I will never forget.
<P>
	Shortly after that I was passed the torch from one of the original 
Reformers, Mr. Doug Campbell, the former premier of Manitoba. I 
think about Doug Campbell, Stan Waters, who came to the Senate 
shortly after that, and Ernest Manning and the affect those people 
have had on my life. Of the three, Mr. Manning was the last to pass 
on. I have lost an incredible number of role models and heroes in 
Doug Campbell, Stan Waters and Mr. Manning.  However, my life 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1056"> 1056 </A></B>
<P>
is so much richer for having known them. They have had an 
incredible influence on my life.
<P>
	In the spring of 1994, shortly after Lew and I were married, he 
was taking me to the Edmonton municipal airport for yet another 
trip to Ottawa. While we were saying our goodbyes and I was ready 
to get on the plane, Mr. Manning Sr. came up the escalator and 
around a post and we nearly crashed into each other. He was 
walking as upright and tall as he could walk carrying his briefcase. 
He was well into his eighties but was looking sharp and knew 
exactly where he was going.
<P>
	When we realized we recognized each other he said: ``Deborah, 
it is so nice to see you''. He shook my hand and then looked at my 
brand new husband and said: ``Lewis, it is so nice to see you''. My 
husband said: ``You too, Mr. Manning''. We had a short visit and 
then he was on his way back to Calgary.
<P>
	When he left I said to my husband: ``Have you guys met 
before?'' Lew said no. However, because we had sent a Christmas 
card to them, Mr. Manning, ages later, remembered my husband's 
name. That was an impression that will last on us forever. This was 
the kind of man he was.
<P>
	He knew people because he cared about them. Because Mr. 
Manning had some sort of feeling for me and for what was going on 
in my life and that I was newly married, he took the time to 
memorize my husband's name. That was another moving 
experience for me which I appreciated so much.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	In terms of his role modelling he was a man who integrated his 
strong personal Christian faith with his political career. I think that 
would stand to serve us all well, that those of us who have a strong 
Christian faith must never be ashamed to say yes, it is part of my 
political belief and I am not hesitant to share it.
<P>
	I pay tribute to his wife, Muriel, today and to their son, Preston. 
Thank you for sharing your family with us. I know Preston has 
grown up in a very political and a very public home. I thank the 
Manning family, especially Mrs. Manning, Mr. Ernest Manning's 
widow. Thank you for sharing Ernest Manning with us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would also like to pay tribute today to the late Senator Manning and 
on behalf of my colleagues in the NDP caucus express our sincere 
condolences to our colleague in the House, the member for Calgary 
Southwest, who was proud to call this distinguished politician, 
distinguished Albertan and distinguished Canadian his father.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the late Mr. Manning was born and 
raised in Saskatchewan near Rosetown. Had he not heard the call of 
Bible Bill Aberhart over the radio and enrolled in his school in 
Calgary at a young age,  heaven knows what might have happened 
to his political consciousness had he stayed in that area. It was, 
after all, an area represented for many years by another 
distinguished Christian gentleman by the name Mr. J. Coldwell.
<P>
	I say this by way of wanting to point out that many in the CCF 
and in the Social Credit had more in common than the fact they 
grew out of the dirty thirties. What they had in common, though 
they disagreed over implementation, was the insight attributed to 
former Alberta Premier Manning in a biography done of him that 
religion is something that should not just be taken down from the 
shelf on Sundays; that you cannot divorce spiritual values from the 
things of every day life and that therefore it is impossible finally 
not to mix religion and politics.
<P>
	We in the political sphere are making spiritual judgments all the 
time and we would all do well to be instructed in that by honouring 
the life and memory of great Canadians like Ernest Manning who, 
like others of his day and generation, on the left and on the right, 
saw the reality of God as a decisive factor in their political 
deliberations.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to add my voice, the voice of my party colleagues on the 
Senate side and obviously that of the member for Saint John to all 
other members in the House to pay tribute to Ernest Manning.
<P>
	He was a Canadian who had an enduring political career that in 
itself speaks to the values he espoused and also speaks to the values 
recognized in him by the men and women, Canadians all across the 
country, who were called from time to time to confirm and reaffirm 
their confidence in this great man.
<P>
	He left an indelible mark on the country. From time to time 
Canadians may want to search their memories and look back on 
some of his views as we look to the future. For example, in 1981 he 
had his own views on the patriation process the country was 
confronted with. As we examine the situation we are in today there 
is no doubt there was some wisdom in the words he spoke at that 
time with regard to changes being proposed to the country.
<P>
	Obviously his influence was beyond his own generation. 
Evidence is that we have today here in the House of Commons his 
son, the leader of the Reform Party, who has had some success, I 
am sorry to say for Conservatives in some regard, in his own 
political career.
<P>
	I extend to him and to his family and to Mrs. Manning our very 
deep gratitude for having supported him, Mr. Ernest Manning, 
through those years. I extend our deep appreciation for his devotion 
to Canada and also our condolences at this time.
<P>
	It may be of some interest to Mr. Manning and to all the 
Mannings and those who worked with the family  from time to time 
to know that his influence went way beyond Alberta. Though I 
never had the honour of meeting him, I do have very fond 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1057"> 1057 </A></B>
<P>
memories of his voice, something passed on from generation to 
generation through the magic of radio.
<P>
	My other was a very devout Catholic. In our home in the kitchen 
after dinner in the evenings I remember very well her listening to 
the radio show of Ernest Manning. I still remember the jingle. I can 
still remember that voice and the words. She was a very big fan of 
Mr. Manning, although I should say for his ideas with regard to 
Christianity and its basic values.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Through my youth this voice was very familiar in our home in 
Sherbrooke, Quebec, thousands of miles away from wherever he 
was speaking. In that respect his influence has gone beyond the 
political forum into every area of our lives. We are appreciative of 
that.
<P>
	Again, to Preston Manning and to his family we send our very 
deep condolences.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, 
an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year beginning 
on April 1, 1996, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to order made 
Tuesday, March 19, 1996, the motion is deemed adopted on 
division.
<P>
	Accordingly, pursuant to order made Tuesday, March 19, 1996, 
the bill stands referred to committee of the whole.
<P>
	I do now leave the chair for the House to go into committee of 
the whole.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and the House went 
into committee thereon, Mr. Kilger in the chair.)
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Order. House in committee of the 
whole on Bill C-10, an act to provide borrowing authority for the 
fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1996.
<P>
	Shall clause 1 carry?
<P>
	On clause 1:
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, I have a few words 
to say to the bill. I welcome this opportunity to speak to hon. 
members on Bill C-10, the borrowing authority bill for fiscal year 
1996-97.
<P>
	Our goal once again is to have the borrowing authority in place 
on April 1, the beginning of the government's new fiscal year. This 
will ensure continued regular financing operations for the 
government.
<P>
	All borrowing authority granted by last year's borrowing 
authority act, including the $3 billion non-lapsing amount, will be 
depleted by the middle of April. If this legislation is not in effect on 
time, it means that the government's funding requirements would 
have to be met by using section 47 of the Financial Administration 
Act.
<P>
	Section 47 restricts borrowing to short term funds, and having to 
resort to these could easily be costly for the government and to 
Canadian taxpayers. It would expose the government to the 
additional interest rate risk implied by increased short term 
funding. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1058"> 1058 </A></B>
<P>
That is why it is  critical that borrowing authority be secured as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	Before I comment on the various clauses of the bill, it is 
appropriate to review our economic and fiscal progress. The 
Canadian economy has shown a mixed performance over the past 
couple of years. Growth in 1994 was very strong at 4.6 per cent for 
the year as a whole, again reflecting both a strong U.S. recovery 
which fuelled a surge in Canadian exports and the positive response 
of domestic demand to declines in interest rates.
<P>
	In 1995 however, U.S. interest rates rose sharply to contain 
possible U.S. inflationary pressures. Higher U.S. rates spilled over 
into Canada in the form of both higher Canadian rates and slowing 
growth in Canadian exports. Canadian GDP rose only 2.2 per cent, 
a number which masks really the extent of the slowing. From the 
end of 1994 to the end of 1995 the Canadian economy only 
expanded by .6 per cent.
<P>
	The weakness in 1995 in both U.S. and Canada has set the stage 
for stronger growth in 1996. Inflation pressures in both the U.S. 
and Canada have declined. Inflation in Canada remains below the 
midpoint of the 1 to 3 per cent target band that we set with the Bank 
of Canada. It is lower than the U.S. rate and the best domestic 
numbers in 30 years.
<P>
	Interest rates also fell sharply. Short term rates are down 3 
percentage points from the 1995 budget and the spread with U.S. 
short term rates has been eliminated. Indeed this morning there was 
a negative spread. This decline in Canada was aided by growing 
evidence that the Canadian government is getting its fiscal deficits 
under control.
<P>
	Signs of stronger growth in 1996 are now becoming evident, 
particularly the recent strength in job creation in both Canada and 
in the United States. Low cost pressures and good productivity 
growth have translated into a sharp improvement in Canada's 
competitive position.
<P>
	The trade figures show the results: a record merchandise trade 
surplus of $28.3 billion in 1995 and a current account deficit that 
fell to only 1.7 per cent of GDP, its lowest level in 10 years and an 
improvement even greater than that in the last quarter of last year.
<P>
	The 1996 budget is the third milepost on the government's 
journey to securing fiscal stability in a vibrant, dynamic and 
competitive economy for Canadians. The first two budgets 
implemented unprecedented reductions to program spending which 
are structural in nature and extend through the medium term 
planning horizon.
<P>
	With these measures, our 1995-96 and 1996-97 deficit targets 
bringing our deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP are secure despite 
the lower GDP growth than we had originally assumed. 
Contributing to this progress is the fact that interest rates are also 
significantly lower than  projected. This has neutralized the adverse 
effects of lower growth on the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The measures in the 1996 budget consolidate and extend those in 
our first two budgets and further contribute to our economic and 
financial objectives. We have maintained our focus on reducing 
program spending. There are no tax rate increases in the 1996 
budget.
<P>
	Expenditure cuts amount to $1.9 billion for 1998-99 and build on 
the reductions of the previous two budgets to keep program 
spending on a downward trend. Together the three budgets will 
contribute $26.1 billion in savings for 1997-98. This action 
together with the reform of the employment insurance program 
will ensure we hit our new deficit target to bring the deficit down to 
2 per cent of GDP on the way to a balanced budget. Let me now 
turn to the various clauses in the bill.
<P>
	Clause 2(1) requests borrowing authority in the amount of $18.7 
billion for the fiscal year 1996-97. This amount is required to meet 
financial requirements of $13.7 billion, to cover exchange fund 
account earnings of $1 billion, and to provide a $4 billion 
non-lapsing amount.
<P>
	The $4 billion non-lapsing amount represents a $1 billion 
increase from previous years. Since 1986 the non-lapsing amount 
has been $3 billion. It was raised in that year from $2 billion. This 
increase is a prudent measure which will provide the government 
with the ability to manage foreign exchange requirements more 
effectively in light of the increased market flows and volatility in 
recent years. It can either be used during the course of the year to 
manage contingencies such as unexpected foreign exchange 
requirements, or it can be carried forward to the next year if the 
next year's borrowing authority is not passed before the beginning 
of the next fiscal year.
<P>
	Clause 2(1) also ensures that the borrowing authority provided in 
this bill may only be used after the 1996-97 fiscal year begins.
<P>
	Clause 2(2) ensures that any portion of the $3 billion non-lapsing 
amount granted by the Borrowing Authority Act, 1995-96 that is 
used in 1996-97, the next fiscal year, will be deducted from the 
1996-97 borrowing authority. This prevents any use of the 1995-96 
non-lapsing amount effectively adding to the borrowing authority 
for 1996-97.
<P>
	Clause 3 states that all unused borrowing authority granted by 
this bill in excess of $4 billion will be cancelled on March 31, 
1997. This allows the $4 billion non-lapsing amount to be carried 
forward into 1997-98.
<P>
	Clause 4 stipulates that for the purposes of calculating borrowing 
authority usage, the effective date is April 1.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1059"> 1059 </A></B>
<P>
	Clause 5 deals with the cancellation of unused borrowing 
authority from 1995-96. If this bill comes into force before April 
1, any unused borrowing authority granted by the Borrowing 
Authority Act, 1995-96 is cancelled effective March 31. If the bill 
comes into force after April 1, the $3 billion non-lapsing amount 
granted by the Borrowing Authority Act, 1995-96 can be used in 
the period between March 31 and the date this bill comes into 
force.
<P>
	Borrowing authority is a normal part of the operations of the 
government. It is important for the smooth functioning of the 
government borrowing program that authority be in place at the 
beginning of a new fiscal year.
<P>
	I thank hon. members for their co-operation in agreeing that this 
bill pass so quickly. I am now open for questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I listened to the secretary of state explain his borrowing 
authority bill, I was very touched, but not in a positive way.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member just said, what is costly to the 
state is not the delay in passing this bill but, rather, the federal 
government's inability to make decisions that should have been 
made since it took office. It is also the lack of a true and sound 
management of public finances, with a determined effort to 
eliminate waste. It is the inability to make decisions that should 
have been made two and half years ago, so as to put our fiscal 
house in order with a real tax reform and not the smoke and mirror 
scheme proposed in the last budget.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	It is also the inability to develop policies that would truly 
stimulate employment. All this is costly to the Quebec state and to 
taxpayers. What is also costly to the Canadian state is to have a 
government that does not do its job in its fields of jurisdiction and, 
moreover, continues to want to interfere in areas which come under 
provincial jurisdiction. This is costly to the Canadian state, as well 
as to the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Earlier, the opposition leader lambasted the government because 
the Prime Minister will not make a decision and comply with 
Quebec's unanimous request concerning manpower training and 
active employment measures. The Prime Minister refuses to 
comply with the wish of 800,000 Quebecers who are waiting for a 
true labour market policy to rejoin the workforce, earn a living with 
dignity.
<P>
	All this is costly to the Canadian state, but it is particularly 
costly to those who have been paying since the finance minister 
took over, and I am referring to the unemployed and the poor in our 
society.
<P>
	The government is asking us to authorize it to borrow $18.6 
billion on behalf of Quebecers and Canadians, while it is plagued 
by chronic incompetence. This is asking a lot from the official 
opposition. We will, therefore, oppose this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my understanding I have about 20 minutes to question 
the minister on this budget. I would like to ask a number of precise 
questions which will require precise answers. I do hope that when I 
ask my first question the minister will have the courtesy of not 
taking the remainder of the time to prevent me from asking other 
questions. I hope we have this understanding, otherwise I will be 
forced to give a speech which would not be particularly productive.
<P>
	I know how responsive, intelligent and well informed the 
minister is, especially since the Deputy Minister of Finance is 
sitting next to him and can help him with technical issues.
<P>
	I will begin with one of the most puzzling treatments in this 
budget, the issue of the revenues gained from the unemployment 
insurance fund. We all know that the unemployment insurance fund 
was set up as an independently functioning system. The 
requirement was that during periods when the economy had 
slackened there would be an opportunity for the revenues to be 
smaller than the expenditures and for it to run a deficit. The 
cumulative deficit would then have to be eliminated when there 
was economic prosperity. Over time this account is to balance.
<P>
	The question arising from these budget plans is that since 
1993-94, the beginning of the mandate of this government, 
projecting forward to 1997-98, the end of this budget's cycle, there 
is a projected cumulative surplus in this fund of $23.1 billion. I am 
not entirely sure about the treatment of the accumulated deficit in 
the past, but it was clearly $6 billion which I think will come to $17 
billion but I believe some of that $6 billion had already been repaid 
earlier. Therefore, we ended up with, let us say, a planned surplus 
of $15 billion. That $15 billion is clearly a very large sum relative 
to the total expenditure of the entire fund. In fact it covers 
practically one year's outlay.
<P>
	I would like to point out one other fact. Between 1996-97 and 
1997-98 budgetary revenues of the Government of Canada are 
planned to increase by $6 billion. When these are broken down we 
find that $5 million of that comes from the surplus generated by the 
unemployment insurance system. In other words, this is an 
improvement in the deficit, a moving toward the target of 2 per cent 
of GDP being financed to the tune of more than 80 per cent out of 
surpluses generated by the unemployment insurance system, a 
surplus which is not by statute supposed to go toward financing 
general deficit.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1060"> 1060 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister have in place any rationale for explaining why 
suddenly the unemployment insurance system should be made into 
a cash cow to improve the general deficit when clearly the legal 
system is, the system of the unemployment insurance system is, 
that it be balanced over the long run? What criteria is he using in 
deciding when enough is enough?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member did not give me a 
long question. I thought it was going to be a 55-minute lecture from 
the professor. I will be brief in my reply.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance system is there to protect the 
unemployed. One of the methods used to protect the unemployed is 
to build a substantial surplus so that during the next recession, and 
there will be one some day as both the hon. member and I know, it 
will be unnecessary to raise the premium rates because there were 
insufficient funds. That is the reason for the cushion.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned revenues. On revenue increases I 
would refer to the fiscal plan, page 106. The total budget in 
revenues went up from $130.6 billion to $135 billion in 1995-96 
and 1996-97; almost $4.6 billion. The unemployment insurance 
contributions went up 3 per cent. I would suggest to the hon. 
member that is considerably less than 10 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Chairman, I did not hear about any systematic 
objective measure being put forward for the workers who are 
complaining about this regressive job-killing tax. When is the 
government going back to the system that existed since the 
inception of the unemployment insurance system, namely, that the 
premiums would be lowered in order to limit the accumulation of 
funds. How big exactly does the minister think this fund should be 
allowed to grow?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, the fund grows for two reasons. 
First, there are fewer payouts of the fund. In other words 
unemployment is down.
<P>
	Second, it grows through contributions. The contribution rate is 
set each fall in conjunction with the Minister of Finance and with 
the Minister of Human Resources Development. It will be set this 
fall so I cannot tell the member how big the fund will be in the 
future without knowing how many payments out there are going to 
be.
<P>
	I do know that we need a substantial cushion because last time 
premium rates had to be raised in the middle of a recession. That is 
the wrong thing to do and that must be prevented in the future.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Chairman, it is just nonsense when the minister 
says that he does not know what the income and outgo will be 
because the best he can make is in the  budget. The best guess is 
that by the end of this budget cycle there will be a cumulative 
surplus of $25 billion. I am not be right on $25 billion. Maybe it is 
only $15 billion.
<P>
	I ask the minister again, will it be $15 billion? Will it be $20 
billion? Will it be $50 billion? At what point will the government 
go back to the tradition of the past and say the accumulation is large 
enough and lower the contribution rate? What criteria is the 
minister offering? What hope can he hold out to employers and 
highly taxed workers? When can we expect this cash cow to stop 
being used for reducing the general deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, that is interesting. We have lowered 
the premium rates twice now. Just for planning assumptions there 
is a premium rate in that number and that is a lower premium rate 
than there is now.
<P>
	The cumulative surplus in the unemployment insurance fund 
will only be about $10 billion by the end of 1997. That number is 
subject to change because a different premium rate could be agreed 
on than the one that was used for planning assumptions in the 
budget. If the planning assumptions unfold that is the number that 
will be affected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Chairman, I give up. I am obviously not going 
to get an answer that I think the workers and employers of Canada 
want to know. What will be a target for the accumulation of those 
funds? I never get an answer to that question.
<P>
	I would like to turn to another one. Between 1993-94 and 
1997-98 the deficit in Canada will have gone down by exactly $25 
billion. I congratulate the government for this achievement. 
However, I find when I look at the extent to which revenues 
increased in Canada, including those coming somewhat 
questionably from the unemployment insurance fund, revenues 
during this period will have also increased $25 billion. Part of that 
increase has been taking place as a result of 22 separate and 
different tax increases.
<P>
	In other words, the government over its mandate is planning to 
reduce the deficit by an amount exactly equal to the amount of 
increased taxes extracted from the people of Canada.
<P>
	Whenever I tell this to Canadians they say that they are horrified. 
They say: ``What happened to all the spending cuts that the 
government has undertaken that are hurting me so badly?'' I say: ``I 
looked in the budget. There were $14 billion worth of spending 
cuts''. They say: ``I don't understand this. What happened to those 
spending cuts? How come they did not result in a lowering of the 
deficit? Where did it all go?''
<P>
	Please answer to Canadians what happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I know that my good friend across 
the way will find this a very difficult thing to realize but the 
economy grew. The increased tax revenues  were as a result of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1061"> 1061 </A></B>
<P>
economy growing. The tax rates were not increased. Almost none 
of the total revenues were as a result of tax increases.
<P>
	It is a funny thing. Does the hon. member not want the economy 
to grow? Would he be happier to see the economy not grow?
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	When the economy grows, corporations make profits, people 
become employed and they both pay taxes. Not only that, many 
people go off unemployment insurance and that cuts expenses. 
When that happens the deficit is reduced. That is the way it works. I 
did not think I would have to explain that to a fellow economist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Chairman, I thought we would keep it between 
two fellow economists. I am very disappointed at receiving such an 
unsatisfactory answer.
<P>
	The hon. minister cannot deny that the government plans two 
years from now to have a budget which will benefit from taking 
away from Canadians, partly through economic growth, partly 
through gasoline tax increases and other surcharges on 
corporations, another $25 billion. At the same time, that increase 
has done nothing but matched the reduction in the deficit. On top of 
that, $14 billion less will be spent on government programs in that 
two-year period.
<P>
	I ask the minister again, where is that money going?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, as a banker I have always felt that it 
was important to pay the interest on the debt. Unfortunately the 
Government of Canada has a very large debt and a very large 
portion of that debt bears interest. Some of it does not, but most of 
it does. A large part of that interest is paid and that is why a large 
part of the additional expenditures or the program spending has 
been down each year for a number of years. Since we have been in 
office it has been down.
<P>
	The cost of carrying the public debt has increased because the 
public debt has increased.
<P>
	A light has gone on in the hon. member's mind because he 
realizes there is interest paid on the public debt. I am sure it does 
not come as a surprise to the hon. member that there are interest 
payments on the debt. Unfortunately we have to pay interest.
<P>
	Maybe the Reform Party has a better idea than paying interest. 
Maybe it does not want to pay interest on the public debt. Maybe 
that is the system which that party has. However, it is not the 
system of the government. It has obligations and believes that the 
interest payments on the public debt should be paid. That is where 
the additional expenditures will go.
<P>
	Program spending has been down year after year and the public 
debt costs have increased. It is very simple. I think the hon. 
member knew that answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Chairman, I hope the people of Canada will 
begin to realize that all of those painful spending cuts were used up 
to pay more interest.
<P>
	Was the higher interest on the debt which was inherited or was it 
on the debt which was created by delaying the spending cuts? That 
is what I was driving at.
<P>
	The Liberals inherited a certain debt which had a certain cost. 
However, that cost has risen by $14 billion. Why did it increase by 
$14 billion? It increased because the government added to the debt 
when it simply slowed down the rate at which it cut its 
expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	I can understand all the political rhetoric about setting targets 
and so on, but what this minister has just admitted is that $14 
billion increase in interest he had to pay by taking it out of the hides 
of Canadians is due to not having quicker targets. That is the 
criticism the Reform Party has made of the approach of having 
targets that are too low. If the same cuts had been made more 
quickly all those cuts would now have produced a balanced budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member is quite wrong. We 
have had an operating surplus since 1994. That means our 
expenditures on program spending have been lower than the 
revenue we have generated. It is not our debt that has been 
increasing the payment of interest; it is the debt we inherited that 
has increased it. The interest payments on that debt are the total 
amount.
<P>
	I am sorry, but the hon. member is dead wrong on that. We have 
had an operating surplus since 1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Reformers were speaking, we in the Bloc kept quiet, and I would 
ask them to do likewise.
<P>
	I have listened with great attention to what the Secretary of State 
for Finance has had to say. He began by saying, quite clearly: ``We 
are using UI receipts to reduce our deficit'' or rather ``Revenues 
from the UI fund will enable us to reduce our deficit''. It seems to 
me that is fairly clear. At the same time, he is trying to convince 
people with his answers that this is not the case at all. Revenues 
from the UI fund are to be used as a cushion to protect against 
future economic crises.
<P>
	I would really like an explanation, because this is really almost 
beyond understanding. He is saying that the UI fund will be used to 
reduce the deficit, and at the same time that these revenues will be 
used to create a cushion against economic downturns in future. But 
we know very well they are being used to reduce the deficit. We 
know very well, for it is written in the budget speech. The UI fund 
is being used to reduce the debt, moreover it is included in the debt 
consolidation calculations.
<P>
	Honesty is needed; the public must be told clearly what the 
Minister of Finance is up to. In my opinion, the government's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1062"> 1062 </A></B>
<P>
approach to the UI fund smacks of  dishonesty. We know very well 
that, at this time, the fund contains a surplus, which is being used to 
decrease the debt, and we know very well, too, that UI reform will 
make it possible to get even more money out in future to eliminate 
that debt.
<P>
	What does that mean? It means that the government is using the 
unemployed, the small and large businesses, each of whom pays 
into the UI fund, and using those funds to reduce its debt. In other 
words, this is a new tax, a hidden form of taxation the government 
is using to reduce its deficit. At the same time it would have us 
believe that it has not raised taxes for several years, not since it 
came to power. It says it has not raised taxes or changed the tax 
system, whereas we know that it is using roundabout, sneaky 
methods to tax employers and employees, that these funds come 
from taxes siphoned off from the UI fund, and that they are being 
used to reduce the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I would like to know how much more he plans to get, next year, 
out of the UI fund than will be going back to the unemployed? 
What amount does he plan to get his hands on to help with his 
deficit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, the hon. member has made a little 
error. We have been reducing the rate on unemployment insurance 
premiums for several years. That means employed workers and 
businesses are paying a lower rate.
<P>
	There is an unemployment insurance fund which forms part of 
the public accounts of Canada. I suggest the hon. member check 
with the auditor general. We follow the rules of the auditor general. 
If the hon. member does not like the rules which have been set out 
to handle the public accounts of Canada, he should make 
suggestions in the appropriate committee when the matter comes 
up.
<P>
	We will not know the exact numbers in the unemployment 
insurance account until we know how many people will be 
applying for and receiving unemployment insurance and until the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development set the new rate for this year, which will be done 
sometime this fall.
<P>
	In the meantime, we have a planning number. The planning 
number will reach by the end of 1997, if the planning assumptions 
are correct, approximately $10 billion. That is a sum which can be 
used in the future. It can be used to help the unemployed during a 
recession. It will prevent the very serious situation of having to 
raise premiums in the middle of a recession, the last thing any 
government wants to do.
<P>
	That is the reason for the fund's being there. If the hon. member 
would like to follow the items through the government accounting 
procedures, he is welcome to do so. They are quite open and clear 
procedures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, it is not very clear. 
Well, he partially answered the question, but he did not give me an 
answer about using unemployment insurance money for current 
expenditures.
<P>
	Could he tell me how he can create an unemployment insurance 
fund, while he uses this money for current accounts?
<P>
	I would like him to explain that, because it is not very clear in 
my mind. At first, he mentioned that the unemployment insurance 
funds would go to the deficit. Well, if these funds are being used for 
the deficit, it means the money is being used for current accounts.
<P>
	How is he going to build up an unemployment insurance fund, 
when he is using this money for current expenditures. I would like 
him to explain that to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, I believe there is a difficulty of 
understanding.
<P>
	There is no reason we could not set up a fund within the UI fund 
to look after a future problem. It is not being used for current daily 
operations of government. If the member looks at the budget 
papers he will find there is an operating surplus.
<P>
	All of the revenues of the government must go into the 
calculation of the total revenues, including premiums from 
unemployment. That is the auditor general's rule as to how 
government accounts are handled. All of the expenditures, 
including the expenditures for unemployment insurance payments, 
go on the payment side. The net difference is the operating 
numbers. For the last few years there has been an operating surplus.
<P>
	As I said, if the hon. member does not like that system or does 
not understand it, I cannot go beyond that. All I can tell him is we 
do have an unemployment insurance fund looking after the 
unemployed. If a future recession happens we will have the ability 
to handle that recession without raising premiums in the 
unemployment insurance fund to the severe detriment of workers 
and business when a recession hits.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, he admits that there 
is a surplus. Everyone knows that, as far as UI is concerned, the 
government collects more than it spends.
<P>
	He also told us at the beginning of his speech that this surplus 
would be used for current expenditures, for  deficit reduction. That 
is what I cannot understand. He admits to a UI surplus and, in the 
same breath, tells us that this surplus will be used to reduce the 
deficit. It is not clear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1063"> 1063 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like him to try once again to answer me if he can. I 
myself cannot understand, and I think no one can, when they talk 
about putting the money in the consolidated revenue fund and then 
use it for current expenditures, for running a surplus. We know the 
government is trying to reduce the deficit. If it is trying to reduce 
the deficit, then it cannot run a surplus since it uses this money for 
current expenditures. I do not understand, and it is hard to 
understand.
<P>
	I would also like to know what the Minister of Finance has done 
to eliminate duplication. We know that Quebec is in the midst of a 
debate on manpower training, among other things, but we are fully 
aware that duplication between Quebec and Ottawa costs a total of 
some $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year. We also know full well that, 
by eliminating duplication with the other provinces, we would 
probably save $10 billion a year.
<P>
	I wonder if the government has done enough to eliminate 
duplication to deserve our support for a loan or the disposition of 
the money. We may not agree to approve a working capital if the 
government has not made every effort to ensure that this money is 
managed as efficiently as possible.
<P>
	Studies have been done on the most efficient way of managing 
money, and duplication is said to be extremely costly. There is now 
a wide consensus in Quebec that manpower training should be 
concentrated in that province. We know that we could save a lot of 
money. The government could save money and we would be much 
more efficient.
<P>
	We would be much more efficient mainly because our workers 
would be better qualified. Our economy could be more efficient 
and our employees would be more efficient.
<P>
	Not only would we save money by eliminating duplication, but 
we could be more efficient at the same time. We would have a more 
efficient economy, which would mean greater earning power in 
terms of government revenue. The taxpayers would pay higher 
taxes, businesses would make higher profits, and so on.
<P>
	Has the government done all that could be done to make the 
entire government machinery more efficient? If that were the case, 
it would not be coming to us all the time to ask for extravagant 
amounts, like $18.7 billion, to cover current expenditures and have 
us believe, as the minister did in his speech, that taxes are not being 
raised when they are dipping into the UI fund to replenish the 
current account. In addition, the government is asking for higher 
and higher services charges.
<P>
	They say there will be no tax increases, but at the same time they 
are charging more and more for services that  the federal 
government is supposed to give or provide using the taxes it has 
collected. The government is increasing service charges. Those are 
taxes in disguise. I would like to hear the minister on this point.
<P>
	How much did he increase service charges last year, for example, 
for the people of Canada? It would be important to know how much 
more Canadians are paying, perhaps not in raised taxes but in 
increased service charges. It would be very important to know that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, the hon. member asked a number of 
questions. I remind him that in 1991 unemployment insurance had 
a deficit of $4.2 billion. The previous year the cumulative surplus 
was $2 billion, so that left the deficit at $2 billion. The next year, 
1992, there was a deficit of $2.6 billion, cumulative deficit, $4.7 
billion. The following year there was another deficit of $1.2 billion, 
leaving a cumulative deficit of almost $6 billion in those three 
years alone.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Surely the hon. member realizes that is not the way a prudent 
fiscal house should be run and is not a way to help the unemployed. 
At the same time there were increases in unemployment insurance 
premiums which again hurt the job efforts at those times.
<P>
	We are running the surplus in the UI fund to prevent that sort of 
thing from happening again.
<P>
	The hon. member also asked about duplication. At times there 
have been questions of duplication. We have done an enormous job 
over the last two and half years to eliminate duplication in 
government services in helping the provinces.
<P>
	In my field we are working right now on a Canadian securities 
commission. We are trying with the provinces to get their 
co-operation. Do we get that co-operation from Quebec? Not yet 
but we hope to. Do we have the Bloc telling us it is a good idea to 
put a Canadian securities commission in? Is it a good idea to reduce 
the overlap and duplication in the securities business? Does the 
Bloc come out strongly in favour of that? No. From the questions I 
have heard it is quite the reverse.
<P>
	I do not see why the hon. member is asking me what the 
government has done about overlap and duplication when they are 
the ones who have not come out in favour of reducing overlap and 
duplication in an area which could obviously be made into a much 
easier and simpler system at the federal level.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil): </B>Mr. Speaker, you know, it is funny, 
when we hear this talk of duplication. The federal government tells 
us that it is the provinces, like Quebec, that should withdraw and let 
it manage certain areas, when we know that after the war the 
federal government began to get involved in just about everything, 
in sectors  that until then had been under the exclusive jurisdiction 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1064"> 1064 </A></B>
<P>
of the provinces. At one time, Quebec and the provinces even had 
responsibility for unemployment insurance. It was only after the 
war that the federal government decided, almost unilaterally, 
through a sort of amendment to the Constitution, to take over 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	After the seventies, the federal government moved into the areas 
of education and health, and interfered in all sorts of sectors that do 
not concern it and that, under the Constitution, it should stay out of.
<P>
	Who is interfering? The federal government is. Then it says the 
provinces should withdraw because of duplication. It is truly 
comical. In other words, the federal government wants to take over 
education and health and, at the same time, to tell the provinces to 
withdraw, to avoid duplication. Yes, but it was the federal 
government that charged in where it had no business. And it says: 
``Withdraw, this is not your concern. We are looking after 
education and health''. And these exclusive rights are recognized in 
the Constitution.
<P>
	But when we speak about education and manpower training, we 
mean education. As far as I know, education is provincial. And, in 
Quebec, we are capable of looking after our own education and 
training. It is hard to understand. I listened to the Prime Minister at 
noon, and yesterday and the day before, and that is also very 
difficult to understand. To us, manpower training means education. 
It comes under education. Training and education go together. To 
us, this is clear.
<P>
	So we say to the federal government: ``Withdraw from this field, 
it is none of your business. You are just confusing things''. The 
federal government adds courses in our institutions, with rules 
different from ours. Who suffers? The students themselves, men 
and women who have lost their jobs and want to train for other 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This hinders manpower training and economic growth. Because 
of this, our labour force is less skilled, since the federal 
government is involved in areas where it has no business. As for 
the return on investment in manpower training, the fact that both 
levels of government are involved probably reduces the return by 
50 per cent. This is a waste of at least 50 per cent.
<P>
	If the Secretary of State for Finance properly understood that, he 
would say: ``It would be good for me to save money and be more 
efficient''. But no. The federal government only wants to prove that 
it is indispensable. This is mere politics. The federal government 
wants to get involved in everything to prove that it really is 
indispensable. It thinks that without the almighty federal 
government people would not survive.
<P>
	This is why it continues to interfere in manpower training. The 
federal government knows it has no business in that area. It 
intereferes in manpower training  to prove, to Quebecers in 
particular, that without Ottawa they would be very unfortunate, 
when in fact it knows full well that it has no business in that sector.
<P>
	How much money would the federal government save if it 
withdrew from sectors which do not come under its jurisdiction, 
such as education? This is the first question. There is also the 
health sector. The federal government interferes in that sector; it 
sets national standards. But some provinces, particularly smaller 
ones, would probably manage their health system differently if left 
to their own devices. Once again, the federal government has 
become the grand master controlling the health sector. Many 
provinces would like to manage their health care system differently 
and thus save money. However, Ottawa prevents them from 
properly managing that sector.
<P>
	Again, how much does that cost the federal government? These 
are all questions that should be answered but have not been 
answered.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, if the hon. member does not believe 
there are any responses, I guess I do not need to reply.
<P>
	However, I think it is a very interesting speech on revisionist 
history which would give credit to some governments of the 1950s.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance was agreed to by all provinces, 
unlike what the hon. member said, I believe in the 1930s, before the 
second world war.
<P>
	He spoke about overlap and duplication. There has been a clear 
offer from the minister of human resources on the table for some 
while. Has Quebec responded? Not yet. The minister of human 
resources was quite clear this afternoon in question period about 
those questions. It was quite clear that the areas of provincial 
jurisdiction were being respected by the government and have 
continued to be respected.
<P>
	Other matters the hon. member discussed have little if anything 
to do with the bill on borrowing authority. However, that we have a 
national employment insurance scheme is and has been of 
substantial benefit to Quebecers over the last years and the member 
should recognize that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I point out four facts to the 
minister about the unemployment insurance system. First, at the 
moment 23 cents of every dollar collected in premiums, clearly 
identified on the tax returns as premiums going to the 
unemployment insurance fund, are going toward fighting the 
general deficit.
<P>
	Second, in 1997-98 the deficit of the general government is 
expected to be $17 billion. In that same year his budget document 
indicates that the unemployment insurance fund will run a $5 
billion surplus.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1065"> 1065 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	That $5 billion surplus is of questionable appropriateness. I do 
not want to use the word legality. I have asked the unemployment 
insurance council what the law says. I did not get a clear cut answer 
out of this and therefore I will not use the word here.
<P>
	I remind the minister the $17 billion deficit would balloon to $22 
billion if this government behaves the way other governments 
behaved in the past with respect to the unemployment insurance 
fund and did not use a $5 billion surplus in order to reduce the 
general deficit.
<P>
	During the very prolonged slump from 1990 to 1993 the 
accumulated deficit was $6 billion. According to his figures and 
the figures in the budget, the cumulative surplus accumulated will 
be $20 billion.
<P>
	When is enough enough in order to cover for the contingency 
overcoming slowdown in economic activity, $20 billion in light of 
the fact that $6 billion was used during the prolonged, deep 
recession in the early 1990s?
<P>
	The treatment of unemployment insurance funds at the moment 
is a ticking time bomb. If the minister is to be in this position come 
the next recession the general deficit will increase rapidly because 
of all the funds that have been devoted to pay the unemployed.
<P>
	It is a two-edged sword. I do not believe it is in the interest of 
Canada to use an independent insurance fund for reducing general 
revenue in order to make it look good to avoid the necessary cuts 
all Canadians know have to be made.
<P>
	I have another question for the minister. Following our earlier 
discussion, if I may summarize, there is $25 billion in extra tax 
revenue extracted per year at the end of this mandate according to 
his budget. That is exactly the amount by which the deficit goes 
down.
<P>
	I ask the minister where the $14 billion in spending cuts went. 
He admitted it goes to paying more interest on the debt. Then I 
reminded him that was exactly what I expected him to say. He 
insisted it was not the government's fault that the $14 billion was 
going to service the debt.
<P>
	I have the numbers here. When this government came into power 
the public debt was $508 billion. By the end of the expected cycle 
in this budget, the debt will be $619.7 billion. If calculated 
correctly, that is $115 billion in extra debt accumulated by this 
government.
<P>
	That is exactly where the money saved from all the spending cuts 
is going, just to service the increase in the debt which was almost 
completely due to the fact that this government delayed the cuts. 
That is the point.
<P>
	I have a question which I am sure the minister has been waiting 
for breathlessly. The government ran on the platform of jobs, jobs, 
jobs. The media and I have been looking and looking in this budget. 
We could not find any reference that was in all the preceding 
budgets as far  as I know since the end of the second world war 
about what will be the level of jobs in Canada over the budget cycle 
and what will be the level of unemployment over the budget cycle. 
We found it very strange that a central promise of the election 
campaign was not even mentioned in the document which 
incorporates the centre, the focus of this government's program to 
deal with what it considers to be the most important issue.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I wonder whether the minister could tell the people of Canada 
why there was no mention of job targets or unemployment rates in 
the budget, or maybe I just missed that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, I have always had a high regard 
for Yale University. I thought it might have had a course in 
accounting that the hon. member might have taken at some point.
<P>
	Let me remind him of a few numbers. He talked about a $17 
billion deficit that would balloon to $22 billion. Let us look at that 
deficit the way those at Yale would look at it when looking at the 
U.S. deficit. If we look at the deficit in the same way as the hon. 
member did at Yale, the deficit would be $6 billion. It would be $6 
billion if we did it the same way the Americans do their numbers. 
That is the difference.
<P>
	That is so very close to a balanced budget that even the hon. 
member should stand up and cheer when he sees that number. All 
he has to do is go back to Yale and ask how the fiscal deficit is 
calculated down there. If he asked that question he would get the 
answer. If we did it the same way as it is done in the U.S., it would 
be $6 billion and not an imaginary $22 billion. That is the 
remarkable result of this government's efforts at deficit reduction.
<P>
	The question was so long I have forgotten what the rest of it was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Employment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Employment. I read through the budget speech. I 
read through the budget papers. I could hardly turn a page without 
finding something that mentioned jobs. Jobs for the young people. 
Growth and jobs. It was all through the budget papers.
<P>
	We promised jobs. It has not been an easy time. This country has 
only got about 600,000 new jobs since January 1994. Not bad, 
600,000 jobs. There were only 140,000 in the last three months. It 
is not as many as we would like to have. We would like to have 
more than that and we intend to have more than that. I suggest that 
the hon. member just wait and see how this budget does have that 
impact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Chairman, I find it very interesting that the 
hon. member brings up the proud institution at which I received my 
Ph.D. some 35 years ago.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1066"> 1066 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I have been infected by 
all the knowledge the bank where he used to work has broadcast. 
I used his documents in my classes at Simon Fraser University 
where I had been teaching for 25 years.
<P>
	We are living in Canada, not the United States. That was a 
diversion of attention which I am sure the viewers of this debate 
will see right through. I did not get an answer to the question. The 
minister did not respond at all to the challenge that the deficit is 
$17 billion according to the budget. The same budget provides 
information which says that if the government stopped its 
accumulation of unemployment insurance fund surpluses, the 
deficit would not be $17 billion but $22 billion. He did not respond 
to that at all.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	My questions about targeted employment levels, forecasts of 
employment and unemployment rates were not answered. I cannot 
even dignify his answer by saying indirectly it was a total 
smoke-screen. This is a breaking with historic precedent. It used to 
be a yardstick. When those government members sat over here on 
this side of the House, they constantly reminded the government on 
what the promises were on the unemployment rate and why they 
were not delivered.
<P>
	I would ask the minister to respond to one other thing in this 
budget. The finance minister's father was responsible for 
introducing to Canada one of the achievements of which we was 
most proud, the universal access to social programs.
<P>
	Universality of access to social programs. I looked it up in the 
dictionary. It is defined as receiving benefits without any questions 
being asked about the background of the individual. We all know 
that this is very important and efficient. It gets rid of the means test. 
It prevents people from hiding assets. It prevents all kinds of 
inefficient changes in behaviour and it increases the dignity of 
people who are enjoying these benefits.
<P>
	The previous government introduced a slight violation of the 
principle of universality by saying to certain old age security 
recipients that they could get the money but if they were too rich, 
the government would take it back. Some people have called that a 
break in universality. I do not want to argue about that. One could 
interpret it this way and one could say that universality had already 
been broken by the previous government.
<P>
	I think the hon. finance minister's father would probably turn in 
his grave if he knew that his son was responsible for breaking down 
the principle of universality. In the finance minister's proposed 
treatment of old age security benefits, eligibility for the first time 
since the 1970s will be based on income. A means test has been 
reintroduced. It is necessary to point out that it was this 
government which did this.
<P>
	I would like to hear what the minister has to say to the people of 
Canada, all the strong supporters of members of the Liberal Party 
who went into the election campaign saying: ``We have a record of 
looking after the welfare of people and universality is a sacred 
matter''. What is the answer to the people of Canada who put their 
trust in the Liberal Party in relation to what it has actually done in 
this budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, first of all I would like to remind 
the hon. member that we are discussing a bill on borrowing 
requirements.
<P>
	The reason I say that is that the number of $6 billion which I 
mentioned earlier, not this year's borrowing requirement but next 
year's borrowing requirement, is actually a borrowing requirement 
number. That is why I thought it pertinent to remind the hon. 
member that this was a borrowing requirement bill and not a 
budget. He will have ample opportunity under the budget 
legislation in committee to discuss all the matters he brought out 
today.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I would add that universality has been gone for some time with 
the income testing for the GIS. I think that was in 1988 or earlier.
<P>
	It is very difficult for me to listen to the Reform Party say there 
is a need for universality and much more government spending, 
that a higher level of spending is necessary for social programs, 
when a little over a year ago that party suggested a slash and burn 
budget that would have affected these programs. The Reform Party 
would have taken money from medicare and social programs. The 
Reform Party would have ruined the social system. I find it very 
difficult to listen to the comments from the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Chairman, the minister set the tone. When 
he made his introductory speech, he opened up the debate about the 
budget. He bragged about all the accomplishments in the budget. I 
have the right to respond to his bragging.
<P>
	It is very clear the hon. member does not understand that the 
people of Canada are very unhappy about having voted for a party 
which said it would get rid of the GST, that it would respect 
universality, that it would not cut medicare. There were all kinds of 
promises of this sort.
<P>
	When we knocked on doors these issues were brought up all the 
time. I felt very uncomfortable when I was confronted by 
constituents who said: ``I am not going to vote for you. I am going 
to vote for the people who promised to get rid of the GST, preserve 
universality of access, will not cut transfers to the provinces''.
<P>
	Is that something we should take sitting down without reacting? 
The issue is credibility. What kind of credibility will the 
government have in the future?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1067"> 1067 </A></B>
<P>
	There is constant reference to the fact that the red book 
promises are being fulfilled. Well, we have heard enough about 
the GST. It is time to pull out the promise that there would be 
no end to the concept of universality. Under discussion today is 
the government's budget, not what the Reform Party would have 
done.
<P>
	What is relevant is the fact that we went to the voters and said: 
``We cannot act irresponsibly and promise the elimination of the 
deficit. We cannot act irresponsibly and say that the country's 
financial crisis is likely to be eliminated simply by economic 
growth'' as was promised. Credibility is the issue. The 
government's broken promises are the issue. We are talking about 
the budget that delivers the core of the Liberal program for 
government in the next two years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, I know it is very difficult for the 
Reform Party when we are running at a 58 per cent approval rating 
and the Reform Party is running at 12 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I know how disturbed the Canadian people are with this 
government. They do not listen to the rhetoric of the Reform Party. 
They are not listening to the rhetoric of the Reform Party about all 
of the perceived items rather than real items.
<P>
	The real truth is that this party has delivered good government 
and good, solid results, results the Reform Party would not have 
dealt with. We have handled our social programs with justice and 
fairness. We have made adjustments in those programs the Reform 
Party would not have even thought of. We have done this with care 
and kindness and with the fiscal result that we have met our targets 
again and again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Chair, the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound was complaining about what he thought 
was an absence of reference to jobs in the finance minister's 
budget.
<P>
	I submit it is because the hon. member's mind is in the past. In 
the old days when government was different people would look for 
large, so-called mega projects. Usually job numbers were attached 
to mega projects: 500 jobs, 1,000 jobs and so on.
<P>
	What the member for Capilano-Howe Sound does not 
understand is that the economy has changed and the budgets have 
changed. The approach is much more sophisticated. For example, 
when we hear the finance minister talking about a reduction of 3 
percentage points in interest rates, that means a lot of jobs. When 
the finance minister refers to more than a 20 per cent jump in trade, 
that means jobs. Every $1 billion in trade means 11,000 jobs.
<P>
	To gain a fundamental understanding of the budget, one has to 
understand modern economics, the modern economy and modern 
government. I do not think the  hon. member understands that. 
Perhaps he should go back to Yale and get a refresher course.
<P>
	I ask the hon. secretary of state whether there is this new 
manifestation of jobs in the budget where something like a 3 
percentage point drop in interest rates really does mean jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, not only does a 3 per cent drop in 
interest rates mean jobs, it means there is more than that in the 
budget. Meeting our fiscal targets means the interest rates drop but 
there is more than that. There were jobs for young people. A 
technology fund will be set up. All of these things bring our budget 
to a modern economy in which there are not just jobs but useful, 
productive and interesting work for our young people and for all 
people in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Chair, it is not the Reform Party and the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound whose thinking is in the past; 
it is the members of the Liberal Party whose thinking is in the past. 
They still believe it is up to the government to create jobs through 
job incentive programs.
<P>
	History will show that the only real jobs that have ever been 
created in Canada have come from the private sector. The private 
sector has been telling the government to give it a break on tax 
levels, on the cost of doing business and on payroll taxes and it will 
create the jobs. In other words, get out of our face and get out of our 
pockets and we will create the jobs.
<P>
	The minister said these jobs are all being created because trade 
has been increased. That may be true. We would not be getting half 
the trade business if the government had not gone to our trading 
partners and offered to finance the goods with taxpayer money in 
order to make the deals. Why is that? The cost of doing business is 
so high in this country that we are no longer competitive. We can 
no longer sell our products abroad unless we have government 
financing to help the deal along. Talk about being in the past.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I ask the minister whether he believes, yes or no, that real, long 
lasting, good paying, permanent jobs can come only from the 
private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, of course they come from the private 
sector. They come from the private sector because this government 
gives the private sector an environment in which jobs are growing. 
That is the environment this government sets, not the environment 
the Reform Party would set.
<P>
	The member complains about our social programs. Referring to 
the old age program, Solange Denis who shouted ``goodbye, 
Charlie Brown'' to Brian Mulroney but this is what she said about 
our budget: ``No, I do not think it was used to attract people. I fully 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1068"> 1068 </A></B>
<P>
approve of  the finance minister's plan. I have always supported the 
Liberals anyway''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is she the next senator?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> I think she is too old to be a senator.
<P>
	Even Dalton Camp, the arch Conservative, said: ``According to 
Wednesday's media reports almost everybody liked the budget and 
generally approved of it. They were not offended or threatened by 
it. The overall editorial tone was laudatory, if not exultant, 
sounding like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a rousing finale of 
its rendition of the Battle Hymn of the Republic''.
<P>
	Some business economists have sent items about the budget. 
``We are on a role. There is a momentum building in the 
economy'', said Andrew Pyle of Path International. Sherry Cooper, 
Nesbitt Burns chief economist said: ``Evidence continues to mount 
that the Canadian economy is finally breaking away from last 
year's nearly recessionary condition''. I could go on.
<P>
	The export business in this country is not just moving along 
slowly. It is not just being promoted by the private sector. It is our 
Prime Minister who has taken hundreds of businessmen on trading 
trips, signed billions of dollars worth of contracts and has done an 
absolutely marvellous job.
<P>
	He realizes the importance of Canada's competitiveness. We 
have been competitive. We are competitive. We are more 
competitive right now on the international scale than we have ever 
been in the last 40 years since they started taking the statistics. As a 
result of that we will probably reach very soon this year a roughly 
balanced international current account.
<P>
	When the government took office there was close to a $30 billion 
deficit in our current account. That means this country had to 
borrow internationally $30 billion. As a result of the export 
promotion the Prime Minister has done, as a result of the economic 
policies of this government, that has been reduced to a very small 
figure in the last quarter in the last year.
<P>
	This year we will probably record a surplus. That is the net result 
of the sales of goods and services and the purchase of goods and 
services abroad. That is a remarkable turnaround. Any economist 
will say that is remarkable.
<P>
	It is not solely the result of the private sector. It is the result of 
the climate the government has produced for the private sector to 
grow in the export market, the efforts of the Minister for 
International Trade, the foreign affairs minister and especially the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Chair, I am informed there has been 
verification as to the actual time the debate will end. It is now 
officially 5.27 p.m. As there were discussions, I thought we should 
clear that up for the record.
<P>
	I wonder if members would give unanimous consent to end the 
debate, pass the amendments and move to third reading. We would 
be willing on this side to divide the time into three. The 
government would take ten minutes to ensure that all three parties 
could speak at third reading, if that is their wish. Otherwise we are 
perfectly willing to use up the remaining time at this stage. 
However, we thought it would be advantageous to all parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Is there unanimous consent 
to conclude this debate?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order. This is 
not a matter of debate. We are on questions. I ask that the Chair 
remember that we are not hearing one member for 10 minutes or 15 
minutes; it is time for questions.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> I remind hon. members that 
in committee of the whole a member has 20 minutes for questions 
and answers. The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
still has the floor if he wants it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Chair, I would respectfully like to cede my 
time to the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> You cannot do that. The hon. 
member for Dartmouth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Chair, I have sat here and 
tried to understand the concerns of members of the third party. I 
have listened to a multitude of their finance critics. They just keep 
getting up. I am not exactly sure exactly what their problem is.
<P>
	They talked about the deficit. They talked about the debt. They 
talked about public confidence. They talked about business 
confidence. They are now converts to the principle of universality.
<P>
	I have heard the finance critic opposite say a number of 
conflicting things. On the one hand he was criticizing us for not just 
meeting our debt and deficit projections and targets but for 
exceeding them. On the other hand he was telling us we should be 
investing more dollars into job creation. He cannot have it both 
ways.
<P>
	They cannot on the one hand criticize us for exceeding our 
targets on deficit reduction and spending controls and on the other 
hand get up and criticize the secretary of state-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are here to debate the budget, so ask your 
minister a question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1069"> 1069 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Perhaps members opposite could put up their 
hands a little faster the next time so they can ask a question. I 
have been here for the last hour and a half. I know some days 
I am not as clear in thought as I want to be, but these guys have 
me completely confused.
<P>
	I would like to ask a couple of questions about the numbers we 
have been given in the budget and in the borrowing authority bill.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the minister can tell me if the 
Minister of Finance has met the deficit targets he has put forward in 
each of his budgets. If the answer is in the affirmative I would like 
to know if he has exceeded them.
<P>
	I also want to know, because members opposite seem so 
concerned about Canadians who are jobless, whether we have 
created any jobs and how many jobs have been created because of 
the fiscal framework of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I think this is important for people who are watching the debate. 
I think I am asking the types of questions Canadians want 
answered.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The next thing I want to know is whether the government in the 
fiscal framework of the budgets it has put forward and the various 
borrowing authorities that have come out, has it maintained the 
principle of access to things like health care across the country by 
the priority and by the transfers? Second, in the whole area of 
social policy and transfers to the provinces whether it has stabilized 
the transfers to the provinces through things like the CHST, 
equalization and other programs?
<P>
	I get confused when I sit here after I read all of what the 
government has done. I am a part of that government and I was 
rather proud of the platform we ran on. As a matter of fact I am 
quite proud of the way the Minister of Finance has done his job in 
the last two and a half years. He has not just met those 
commitments but exceeded them.
<P>
	Is it true that the government, through the Minister of Finance 
and under the direct auspices of the Prime Minister, has done what 
the Reform Party obviously finds so distasteful? Has it put 
confidence back into the Canadian economy, made sure that 
Canadian investors keep up with where we are going? Has it driven 
down interest rates so that there is more investment in this country? 
Has it created an atmosphere for the creation of not 10,000, not 
50,000, not 100,000 but 600,000 jobs and at the same time has its 
deficit projections under control?
<P>
	At the same time the government has stabilized the transfers to 
the provinces. It has made sure that programs that are as much a 
part of the fabric of the country as anything else that defines us 
have not been savaged, as the members opposite would have done. 
The government  has managed to do it all with the support of over 
58 per cent of the Canadian public while the policies of the 
members opposite are in such disrepute with the Canadian public 
that they are mired at 12 per cent in the polls. Their members run 
off in all directions crying at the drop of a hat. They know that they 
have frittered away the opportunity that was given to them in the 
last election by the Canadian electorate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, when we first took office I 
remember the finance minister and I sitting in the Department of 
Finance considering just where we sat. We came into a government 
that was in disrepute. We came in at a time and pondered over what 
the previous government had done. That previous government had 
given an estimated deficit of $32 billion.
<P>
	What was the result we were looking at? The result was $42 
billion to $44 billion, close to $45 billion at the first shot. That was 
a disaster.
<P>
	The next thing that happened was the finance minister said: ``We 
are going to not only set targets to bring our deficit down to 3 per 
cent of GDP in the third year of our mandate as we promised, we 
are going to set those targets and we are going to achieve them''. I 
was at that finance department meeting and he told them: ``Do not 
make any mistake, there is no way those targets can be exceeded. I 
want targets met in every way every year''.
<P>
	The first year the target was $39.7 billion and the final result was 
$37.5 billion. When we put that target out what was the press 
saying, what was the Reform Party saying? They were saying: 
``You'll never each the target. You'll never make those numbers. 
Those are impossible targets to make''. Now they say that we are 
too low but they were not saying that then. They were saying that 
we would never make our targets. The first target was not just $39.7 
billion, we got $37.5 billion. It was bettered by more than $2 
billion.
<P>
	Our next year's target was set at $32 billion. Are we going to 
meet that target? You bet we are going to meet that target. We are 
going to beat that target and better it this year. The $24.7 billion, 
the 3 per cent of GDP target for next fiscal year is going to be met 
and bettered again. We have another target after that of 2 per cent of 
GDP down to $17 billion.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	If the deficits are measured in the same way that the Europeans 
and the Americans do, that deficit of 2 per cent of GDP would fall 
to $6 billion or less than 1 per cent of GDP. That is virtually a 
balanced result and is in the fourth year of the mandate. That is a 
remarkable set of numbers.
<P>
	The hon. member also asked me about job creation. I think he 
answered his own question mind you, but I would be happy to 
answer it again for him.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1070"> 1070 </A></B>
<P>
	In the first year of our mandate there was 4.6 per cent of real 
growth, or almost 400,000 new jobs, and it continued. The second 
year was not as good. We did not get nearly as many.
<P>
	Job growth has revived the last three months. We got 140,000 
new jobs and since we took office 600,000 new jobs have been 
created. They have been created by the private sector. Those are 
full time jobs. It is because of the positive atmosphere of the 
government. The financial markets have said that the government 
is a credible government. This government has credibility.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why are they pulling their money out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> They are putting their money there too because the 
interest rates have fallen 3 percentage points. This morning when I 
looked at the numbers, Canadian short term interest rates were 
below U.S. short term rates by 11 basis points. That is the key to 
credibility. That is the result of the credibility of this government. 
It is the result of doing the right thing in the budget and doing the 
right thing for social programs.
<P>
	We have not forgotten social programs. I am going to talk a little 
bit about social programs because we have had-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> No, no, you are getting into hot water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, I know the Reform Party does 
not want me to talk about the social programs because the Liberals 
have achieved this great budget situation not by savaging the social 
programs but by maintaining them and by maintaining the transfers 
to the provinces.
<P>
	We have taken the infrastructure program which was strongly 
felt by the municipalities and the provinces and backed by this 
government and that created jobs. We have our job creation 
program in our youth employment program. We have a technology 
training program and all are the kinds of things that Canadians 
want. That is why the Reform Party is at 12 per cent in the polls and 
we are at 58 per cent.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. member for Dartmouth still has seven 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Chairman, I want to commend the 
secretary of state. He has cleared up a lot of the misunderstanding 
that has been put to the Canadian public through C-SPAN because 
of some of the comments made by the various critics on the Reform 
Party side.
<P>
	One thing the Reform Party members cannot stand is good news. 
They cannot stand the good fiscal news that is coming from this 
side of House.
<P>
	I want to remind everybody here that in the nine years prior to 
the government being elected there was a right  wing government. 
It was a Conservative government. It had promised the Canadian 
public that it would put the finances of this country where they 
should have been, or so it said.
<P>
	For nine successive budgets the ministers of finance came in and 
each and every time made projections. They made projections 
about what the deficit would be. They made projections about 
employment.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Who started this mess?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> In every single budget it missed its targets. 
The investment community, both domestically and internationally 
said the Government of Canada did not know where it was going 
and it was not credible when it made projections.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear from the secretary of state that we do not 
have to worry because the government has regained the confidence 
of the domestic and international communities. The Minister of 
Finance and the government have met every target in every budget 
that has been brought forward.
<P>
	Before I ask my question, the member for Capilano wanted 
projections on jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> What is the news on the GST? Let us hear 
something about the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> They cannot take the good news.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> What good news?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> They want to know where the jobs are. The 
secretary of state clearly said that because of our fiscal policies 
there have been 600,000 jobs created. The fiscal framework has 
been put in place. Even the good planning by the government 
cannot secure every Canadian a future job. We cannot do it.
<P>
	Unfortunately the jobs that are in jeopardy and which labour 
market surveys show are going down are jobs for Reform members 
of Parliament. No matter what we do, the future for that particular 
occupation seems to be very dismal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> How can you keep a straight face when you say 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> There is one thing I need an answer to because 
the vast majority of the Canadian public, 58 per cent, 74 per cent in 
Atlantic Canada and 68 per cent in Ontario, think that the 
government is doing a very good job in meeting its projections and 
commitments in the red book.
<P>
	The member for Capilano may have a degree from Yale. I do not 
know if its standards were lower than what I thought it was when I 
went through university but he clearly just does not get it.
<P>
	When the government came to office my understanding was that 
the operating balance was about  $4 billion in the hole. The 
government of the day was spending $4 billion more than it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1071"> 1071 </A></B>
<P>
taking in. The borrowing requirement that year was almost $30 
billion and $4 billion was the operating deficit.
<P>
	If I read the documents that were tabled in the House correctly 
and if I understand the borrowing authority properly I do not think 
the numbers lie. I know that sometimes people in the House try to 
misconstrue these numbers but they seem to be clear.
<P>
	I ask the secretary of state if it is true that we have reversed the 
operating deficit from 1993-94 of $4 billion and that the operating 
surplus is now $16.8 billion because of the policies of the 
government? It is projected-and we meet our projections, so 
nobody should question them-for 1997-98 that it will be a $35 
billion surplus in the operating account and that the actual financial 
requirements will have diminished to $6 billion.
<P>
	If that is true does it mean in effect that the financial 
requirements have been shaved by almost $24 billion in only two 
and a half years of managing the economy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chair, the numbers the hon. member gave 
are quite correct. When we first looked at the budget of the 
government, in 1993-94 the revenues were $116 billion. The 
program spending was $120 billion with an operating deficit of $4 
billion. In our first year in office we turned that around to $4.6 
billion surplus and we did it by cutting program spending. Program 
spending fell again in 1995-96 and there was an operating surplus 
of $16.8 billion.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	As the hon. member said, in 1996-97 the projection is a $26 
billion operating surplus and in 1997-98 a $35 billion operating 
surplus. The financial requirements for the coming fiscal year are 
only $13.7 billion. Next year when I bring these numbers to the 
House the amount will drop to $6 billion. Down from $30 billion to 
$6 billion in that length time is a remarkable achievement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Chairman, 
there is a whole pile of things I would like to ask. I will make my 
questions short, sit down, then get back up and ask something else. 
I have a couple of questions for the minister which get away from 
the things that we have talked about.
<P>
	By the way, the government is talking about job creation. If 
spending would create jobs the security guard would have two 
more jobs to go to when he finished here. Everybody would have 
two or three jobs if spending would create them.
<P>
	A year ago the official language commissioner said that bonuses 
were not needed and recommended they be scrapped. The amount 
spent last year on official language bonuses was $86.6 million. He 
said: ``Don't do that. It is not necessary. It is considered a waste by 
most''.
<P>
	Under the prison perks I find it amazing that cablevision cost us 
$1 million. There were all kinds of lawsuits involving $60,000 in 
claims by prisoners. Most of all, $180,000 was spent on condoms 
by our prisons. Those are just a few items. The list of that kind of 
waste and idiotic spending is quite long.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister, can we look forward to that kind of 
waste stopping or is the government planning to spend more money 
for condoms to buy the votes from the convicts who are now 
allowed to vote thanks to this government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, I know how interested the hon. 
member and the Reform Party are in the prison population. They 
did not quite make it to Singapore to check out caning. However, 
instead of condoms they would probably bring back the paddle 
from there.
<P>
	This is Neanderthal talk. The items the hon. member brings up 
are very interesting. I am sure he will bring them up in the 
appropriate committee but this is not the appropriate committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Chairman, there was absolutely no 
answer to the question. We are talking about the budget. We are 
talking about public accounts. We are talking about spending. We 
never talk about the $600 billion debt. I have not even heard that 
mentioned over there. We hear 6 per cent of GDP down to 5 per 
cent of GDP down to 4 per cent of GDP, next year 3 per cent and 
then 2 per cent of GDP. We never hear that we started at $400 
billion, went to $500 billion, are now up to $600 billion and soon 
will be on our way to $700 billion in debt. We do not hear any talk 
about that.
<P>
	When I ask a simple question I do not even get an answer. Are 
the bonuses which cost us $86 million going to be scrapped as was 
advised? Are we going to stop spending foolishly? The waste is 
enormous and it is still going on. Do not give me a bunch of 
baloney that they will decide at different committees. This is the 
finance minister. This is the budget that is supposed to address 
these things. This is the borrowing bill. Are we going to borrow 
more money to meet this kind of waste or is the waste going to 
continue? That is the question. I would like a straight answer.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Chairman, the hon. member has discovered 
we have a borrowing bill before us. He should also discover what a 
remarkable job the government has done in reducing its borrowing 
requirements. If he looks at those numbers he will see the 
projections are down from $30 billion to $6 billion in borrowing 
requirements which is a remarkable achievement. We have cut 
government spending. We have removed the waste.
<P>
	The hon. member should bring forward those items at the 
appropriate committee level. He can go through it in committee 
line by line. Those are the things they should  be doing in their 
appropriate committees. That is what the hon. member is there for, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1072"> 1072 </A></B>
<P>
to be part of a committee and look at those expenditures line by 
line.
<P>
	This is a borrowing bill. Look at the larger picture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Chairman, it is really hard to 
understand why the government in power cannot say: ``No, we are 
not going to give any more bonuses to bilingualism''. Would that 
not be a great thing to say? The government would be applauded. 
Or it could say: ``No, we are not going to spend any more money in 
our prisons to buy condoms. Canadians do not like us doing that, so 
we will stop''.
<P>
	Why do government members not have the guts to stand up and 
say some of these things? They have the opportunity to do some of 
these things and they do not. That is what I absolutely cannot 
understand and neither can anybody across this land. They can sit 
over there an brag all they want.
<P>
	Why did the minister not talk about the 80,000 bankruptcies last 
year? They all blame the government of the day. I would like the 
minister to tell me where the savings are. I did not go to Yale nor 
did I go wherever he went. When the government pays $30 billion 
interest and then somewhere down the road it is paying $50 billion 
interest, that is a $20 billion increase. That is what it represents. 
Interest debt servicing has become the largest expense this 
government has. I think that is correct and if not, the minister can 
set me straight. It is the largest expenditure we now have.
<P>
	When we have a $30 billion deficit, then we go to a $17 billion 
deficit we have just saved $13 billion, but the interest has gone up 
by $17 billion. I would like to know where the savings are? Are 
there any savings? I do not think so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> The hon. member suggested that I do not have the 
guts. I certainly do not have his anyway.
<P>
	I will try to raise the level of discussion and ask the hon. member 
if he is in favour of paying interest on borrowed funds. Is he really 
telling us that we should not be paying interest? Is there some 
problem in his mind about paying interest to people who have 
loaned the Government of Canada money? Is the hon. member old 
enough to remember Alberta was a province that reneged on its 
debts and paid the penalty for years?
<P>
	We do not do that in this government. We are trying to work our 
way through the deficit reduction program to get at our level of 
debt. We do not think it is an impossible situation to handle it the 
way we have been. In fact, the financial markets have said again 
and again that it is the right way to do it. The government is doing it 
in the correct manner. It is handling its finances in the right way, 
better than anyone.
<P>
	The finance minister has met every target which he has set. Is 
there another party in the House which can say  that it set a deficit 
target and met it? There is not a party in the House that can say that. 
Until there is, I would say this is the party that is believable, not 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Chairman, it is too bad that he referred 
to my anatomy. Yes, I have a lot of guts. In fact, I have a lot more 
than he will ever have.
<P>
	He also referred to my age. Guess what? I am old enough to 
remember when Mr. Trudeau came into this building and his 
government started this whole mess. That was the start and it went 
right up to $160 billion. I am old enough to remember that. Some 
members probably were not born then, but I was.
<P>
	I also know that Mr. Mulroney was going to heal it and he did 
not.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You were an American citizen then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I was an American citizen long before that.
<P>
	When I came to this country in 1967, Mr. Trudeau took power 
and started this whole mess. The debt was created by a Liberal 
government. I am old enough not to forget it. I will not forget that 
this government is continuing-

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should introduce 
amendments to the Financial Administration Act requiring all departments and 
agencies to table in the House of Commons a specific response to the auditor 
general's report on their activities, including time frames within which corrective 
action will be taken regarding any shortcomings or failures of administration 
identified by the auditor general; and such reports  should be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts and any other relevant standing 
committees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on 
another motion the Reform Party has put forward on the issue of 
good government. Good government because I think it is more than 
time that Parliament started to exercise its due and rightful 
authority to ensure that the government, this government or any 
other government for that matter, be held accountable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1074"> 1074 </A></B>
<P>
	The public accounts committee is the committee of opposition 
which is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the 
government is held accountable for the work it does. The 
deficiencies in the government are investigated and the 
government is held accountable for them. It is impossible for us to 
do all the work ourselves. That is why the Auditor General of 
Canada does a great deal of important work on behalf of all 
Canadians, on behalf of Parliament, to ensure that the workings of 
government are investigated and reported upon.
<P>
	I cannot overemphasize the need for Parliament to have 
confidence in the Auditor General of Canada. I am pleased to say 
that this country and this Parliament are extremely well served by 
today's incumbent and his staff. This country owes a great deal of 
gratitude to the work that is done by that office and the reports that 
are filed and tabled in the House for the benefit of the public 
accounts, for the benefit of parliamentarians and in essence for the 
benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The reason for my motion today is that the public accounts 
committee cannot deal with every point raised by the auditor 
general. The auditor general is an officer appointed by Parliament. 
He is not a civil servant. He does not work for the government. He 
tables his reports in the House. He tells us as parliamentarians what 
he has found as he has investigated the workings of the 
government.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of his responsibilities. Section 7(2) of 
the Auditor General Act states that each report of the auditor 
general shall call attention to anything that he considers to be of 
significance and of a nature that should be brought to the attention 
of the House of Commons. It sounds fairly important to me.
<P>
	It further states that he has to report on accounts that have not 
been faithfully and properly maintained or public money that has 
not been fully accounted for or paid where so required by law.
<P>
	It continues that where essential records have not been 
maintained or rules and procedures applied have been insufficient 
to safeguard and control public property it is his duty to advise us. 
He is to report on money that has been expended for other than 
purposes for which it was appropriated by Parliament. He is to 
advise us on money  that has been expended without due regard to 
economy or efficiency.
<P>
	Each and every point is a very significant point that Canadians 
and Parliament would want to know if the Auditor General of 
Canada finds these types of things going on when he investigates 
various departments of government.
<P>
	As we know, he tables his report in the House three times a year. 
The report is automatically referred to the public accounts 
committee and from there we take a look at the more serious issues 
in public accounts. We investigate them. We call in witnesses. We 
call in senior officials from various departments. We ask for 
accountability. We ask for an explanation. We want to find out why 
these things happen. We want to find out why there has been loss of 
management control. We want to know the reasons.
<P>
	The public accounts committee makes serious and definitive 
recommendations to government to ensure that government gets 
the message that things must change because the auditor general 
has said things must change.
<P>
	The public accounts committee tables a report after its 
investigation and the House requires the government to respond to 
that report so we know the government has heard the report of the 
public accounts committee and we know the position of the 
government and what it intends to do.
<P>
	As I said, we cannot look at everything the auditor general 
tables. That is the intent of my motion. My motion would require 
that the government respond anyway to the House and tell 
parliamentarians and tell Canadians what it will do about the 
deficiencies, the mismanagement, the errors, the defalcations and 
the other irregularities the auditor general has found and reports to 
parliamentarians in his report.
<P>
	I do not think that is much of an issue. It is what I call 
completing the circle of accountability. The auditor general 
investigates, he advises us of his findings. The public accounts 
committee looks at some issues and asks the government for a 
report. This motion asks the government to table a report on the 
issues not investigated by the public accounts committee.
<P>
	Therefore we as parliamentarians, the various standings 
committees of the House of Commons, may take these reports and 
if they find them wanting may on their own continue an 
investigation and ask for an accounting by the various civil 
servants involved.
<P>
	That is what the motion calls for. The role of the auditor general 
is paramount to maintaining integrity and confidence in the 
management of the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	As members know, 45,000 civil servants have been laid off or 
are in the process of being laid off. We also have a  very severe debt 
problem. We have a deficit that we in the Reform Party would like 
to see eliminated at a much greater speed than the Minister of 
Finance is prepared to do. Because he is not doing very much, in 
our opinion, to reduce the deficit, the debt continues to mount and 
our credit is being eroded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1075"> 1075 </A></B>
<P>
	These are dangerous subjects and dangerous issues at this point. 
We need to have integrity in government. That is why we are really 
fortunate to have the office of the auditor general whose reports are 
credible, lucid and concise but at the same time they are specific in 
pointing out serious deficiencies in the management of the affairs 
of the country by the government.
<P>
	We need this motion because we want to close the loop of 
accountability and have the government table in the House a 
response to an officer of the House that it has heard what he has to 
say, that it has looked at the deficiencies he has brought to its 
attention and that it is prepared to table in the House its response: 
what it will do and when, and how can we be assured it will not 
happen again. That is the simple test of accountability.
<P>
	Take for example what we have missed in the past in public 
accounts. In ``Information and Technology: Managing the Risks'', 
chapter eight of his report, the main recommendation was that 
information technology was risky, that the government must take 
concerted action and have the vision and the authority to 
successfully manage these risks.
<P>
	We found out in a subsequent report that these risks were not 
well managed and they reappeared a year later in the auditor 
general's 1995 report in a chapter on systems development.
<P>
	Just because the public accounts committee was not able to table 
the report and call witnesses and say this must change now, the 
government carried on in the same old way and ignored the 
recommendations of the auditor general. The $50 million budget 
that we as Canadians paid to have the auditor general report on 
these things was money wasted because the report was not heard.
<P>
	What about the federal management and the food safety system? 
From chapter 13: ``The members of the interdepartmental 
committee on food regulations are collectively responsible for 
ensuring that federal food safety programs are evaluated 
periodically''.
<P>
	Money had been wasted and Health Canada could not ensure that 
health and safety standards were applied in all cases. What 
happened? We now have the Minister of Finance announcing in the 
budget that we are to privatize and consolidate all the food 
inspection programs in the country. What are the implications to all 
that? We do not know. Honestly, as parliamentarians we do not 
know.
<P>
	The auditor general said Health Canada could not ensure that 
health and safety standards were applied and now we find that the 
government is to slough the whole  thing off into some crown 
corporation managed by the provinces and the federal government. 
We have lost control and we do not know what has happened with 
the previous problem. No doubt it will get rolled into the new 
crown corporation envisaged by the Minister of Finance. What 
about the health and safety of Canadians?
<P>
	The government has not spoken. It has not said the auditor 
general has raised a concern on behalf of all Canadians. Mum is the 
word from that side; not one word.
<P>
	Health and food safety is vitally important. Listen to the news 
today about cattle in the United Kingdom and the problems it has 
with health and safety. We have health and safety concerns here 
that the auditor general has raised and there has not been one word 
from that side.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	What is going on? We do not know. What do those members 
intend to do about the concerns of the auditor general? We do not 
know. Have they done anything so far? We do not know. Will it cost 
money to fix up the problems so Canadians can be assured the food 
and health programs are safe? We do not know.
<P>
	There has not been a word from that side of the House since the 
auditor general tabled a report in the House saying: ``I have a 
concern. What will you do about it?'' That is why I tabled my 
motion.
<P>
	With respect to foreign affairs and assistance to the former 
Soviet Union, central and eastern Europe, in chapter 21 the auditor 
general said: ``The result of all the moneys that were being spent 
was unclear. There was an immediate injection into the economy 
but we may not realize the full potential of trade and investment 
opportunities we thought we could have''. That is what he said last 
year. What did we do this year? We spent $114 million on the 
program.
<P>
	Last year the auditor general said the benefits of the program 
were unclear. We have not heard a word from the government as to 
whether it is prepared to tell Canadians it will tighten up 
accountability and provide value for money. There was not a word.
<P>
	In the budget there was another $114 million of hard earned 
taxpayer dollars shovelled down the drain. The deficit continues to 
mount, the debt increases and taxes increase and the government 
shovels $114 million down the drain with no clear accountability as 
to whether it is doing any good for anybody. That is the way the 
government has been managing its affairs for the last two and a half 
years.
<P>
	The auditor general has tabled reports in the House which have 
said it has to stop, it should be changed and it should be cleaned up, 
but nothing has been done. It seems fairly simple to me that as 
parliamentarians we can expect a response from the government 
when the  auditor general, an officer of the House, tells us in plain, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1076"> 1076 </A></B>
<P>
simple language that this is not good enough and it must change. 
What will the government do about it? We hear nothing.
<P>
	Those are three instances. I could go on at great length citing 
chapter after chapter from the report the auditor general tabled in 
the House. I think of the ones the public accounts committee did 
investigate. There seemed to be a fairly lackadaisical attitude on 
behalf of the government in dealing with these things.
<P>
	I remember one of the first items we investigated as the public 
accounts committee after the election. There was a $1 billion loss 
experienced by Revenue Canada. Without going into details, it 
dragged on through the courts. Do not worry, the government will 
win. Twelve years later it finally got to the Supreme Court which 
said: ``We do not want to hear about this. The case is lost. The 
taxpayer wins''. Revenue Canada said: ``How much money is on 
the line, by the way?''
<P>
	Twelve years after the case went to court somebody said: ``How 
much is on the line, by the way?'' They were staggered to find out 
that $1 billion went down the drain and they had to write a cheque. 
The Minister of Finance had to readjust the previous year's deficit 
to account for a loss of that magnitude.
<P>
	We heard testimony in front of the public accounts committee. 
We heard from the assistant deputy minister of the Department of 
Finance. I said to him: ``What happened here? Who is at fault when 
we lose $1 billion?'' He said nobody is at fault, the system failed. I 
am concerned that attitude is endemic right through government. It 
must be changed. It seems fairly simple to me.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	In closing, I asked the government what it thought. Is this a good 
idea? The response I got was: ``We do not want to create another 
bureaucracy. This is going to cost too much to investigate. We do 
not even want to hear about it. We are going to vote this motion 
down''. That is hypocrisy at its worst. It is the most lame duck 
excuse I have ever heard for government getting itself out of an 
embarrassing situation.
<P>
	This government should be ashamed to even think it is going to 
use that type of simple lame duck excuse to wriggle its way out of 
responding to Canadians whose hard earned tax money has 
continued to go down through the holes in the floor. That money 
continues to go down the drain because this government is not 
interested in being accountable and tabling in this House a simple 
response to the auditor general who is an officer of this House as to 
what it is going to do to fix the problems that exist all through the 
government.
<P>
	I could go on at length. I hope that when we hear from the 
government side, it will have changed its mind. I hope it will have 
realized that Canadians are entitled to a  response, that Canadians 
expect a response and that they will get a response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure 
today to have the opportunity to address the House on the motion to 
amend the Financial Administration Act. I applaud the member for 
St. Albert for moving this motion.
<P>
	My fellow members recognize as I do the importance of the role 
of the auditor general having a watchful eye on how the 
government spends the taxpayer's dollar. In a continued effort to 
get government right, we should consider what can be done to 
ensure that Canadians receive top value from their government.
<P>
	As a result, I would like to thank the member for St. Albert for 
raising the issue of the follow up by departments and agencies on 
recommendations that the auditor general makes in his reports. I 
am sure we all agree that when problems are identified, everything 
should be done to ensure that actions are taken to remedy any 
shortcomings the auditor general identifies in his report.
<P>
	The member's proposal has some merit as it would require all 
departments and agencies to table in this House a specific response 
to the auditor general's comments. This response would include 
time frames for corrective action and would also be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	On the other hand, during this era of fiscal restraint and with the 
focus on efficiency, we want to ensure that overlap and duplication 
of actions does not occur.
<P>
	The report of the auditor general is never taken lightly. Members 
of this House, the media, the public and many of us look forward to 
the tabling of each auditor general's report. As a consequence, the 
government is highly motivated to respond to the concerns raised 
in each of the reports.
<P>
	Each department or agency has the opportunity to respond to the 
comments made by the auditor general and a response is published 
with the report. This public statement allows the affected party to 
indicate what actions will be taken in response to the auditor 
general's concerns and findings.
<P>
	The report of the auditor general provides ample fodder for 
questions and lively discussions during question period in this 
House. Canadians can see ministers being called on to account for 
activities within their departments. Canadians see and hear through 
their representatives important questions raised and responded to 
about activities of the government.
<P>
	I do not need to remind my fellow members that the auditor 
general himself follows up every two years on the progress and 
recommendations. I am positive that all members would agree that 
the Office of the Auditor  General must be diligent in reporting on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1077"> 1077 </A></B>
<P>
the efficiency of the Canadian government operations. Do we want 
to undermine the efforts of his office by attempting to duplicate this 
work?
<P>
	As my fellow members will know and must agree, the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts is already very involved with the 
follow up recommendations of the auditor general. The member for 
St. Albert, a long time member of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts, could assure you that this involvement occurs.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Each year the Standing Committee on Public Accounts calls on a 
number of departments to demonstrate what actions they have 
taken to rectify shortcomings noted by the auditor general. The 
public accounts committee has asked for detailed workplans on the 
status of various activities. It has further asked that updates on 
projects and their status be provided every six months. Follow up 
that is as careful and precise as this ensures that the affected 
department or agency works hard to remedy problems noted by the 
auditor general.
<P>
	I am sure we would not want the Canadian citizenry to perceive a 
duplication of activity in a time when we are trying to streamline 
and provide the best possible service for each tax dollar.
<P>
	Not only does the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
follow up in depth with selected departments or agencies, but it 
also contacts all departments and agencies that are mentioned in 
each report. In doing so, it requests an update on the actions taken 
in light of the auditor general's comments. This diligence, as the 
member for St. Albert a committee member himself must agree, 
should not be underestimated.
<P>
	I fully support the will behind the member's motion. We all want 
to ensure that government improves and uses the advice of the 
auditor general to its fullest extent. We are all aware of our strained 
fiscal situation and the ongoing questions of where government 
should put its limited resources.
<P>
	However, when one considers the current mechanisms which are 
in place, they certainly seem to provide more than adequate 
monitoring of activities in response to the recommendations of the 
auditor general. We must ensure that we continue to create a culture 
in which the measurement of success will not be the amount of 
paper we produce but the level of service we provide for 
Canadians.
<P>
	In light of this we should seriously consider how much added 
value for our dollar the proposed motion will provide. In our 
eagerness to ensure that government does strive to improve on any 
shortcomings, we must be wary of the tendency to produce a bigger 
and more expensive bureaucracy.
<P>
	While the spirit of my fellow member's motion truly is 
admirable and timely, I question whether the Canadian taxpayer 
would be able, much less willing, to foot the bill the motion entails. 
Additional reporting of each detail to the House will be costly. We 
should consider the Canadian citizen to whom we are all 
accountable as we debate this motion to amend the Financial 
Administration Act. We should consider that while the will is to 
ensure cost effective government, is the result cost effective?
<P>
	By way of conclusion, allow me to summarize. There can be no 
debate as to the level of gravity with which the auditor general's 
reports are received. It is a document which is widely available in 
various mediums to the Canadian public.
<P>
	The proposed motion to amend the Financial Administration Act 
does raise an important issue of formal reporting of activities in 
response to recommendations of the auditor general. We should 
consider the level of reporting and follow up on the auditor 
general's report that currently exists whilst debating this motion.
<P>
	Departments and agencies are provided the opportunity to 
publicly state their response and intended actions within the report 
itself.
<P>
	Question period is a venue where one may ask the minister what 
he or she intends to do about concerns raised by the auditor general.
<P>
	The auditor general himself follows up on the actions of the 
affected departments and agencies every two years.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts contacts each and 
every department and agency mentioned in each report. The 
committee asks them to report on their progress on the 
recommendations of the auditor general. The public accounts 
committee also issues frequent reports on government activity to 
which the government must respond.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In further asking departments and agencies to table detailed 
responses in this House, are we thereby undermining the important 
roles of both the auditor general and the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts?
<P>
	Currently, departments and agencies respond to the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts, the auditor general, the media and 
the public at large. In asking departments and agencies additionally 
to table formal reports in this House, are we asking the Canadian 
public to pay for a larger and more expensive bureaucracy?
<P>
	During this time of fiscal restraint, while we are trying to 
achieve maximum efficiency with a modicum of resources, we 
should consider as we debate this motion whether it will be cost 
effective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1078"> 1078 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that all of us here have the same goal. We all want 
to ensure that the government continues to improve. We all want 
to ensure that Canadians receive value for their tax dollars. The 
spirit of this motion is clearly there and I applaud it. However the 
spirit may not end up being reflected in the result.
<P>
	It does not matter whether it is the government, a business, a 
municipal government or any organization that handles funds, it is 
the way in which one does business. It is the efficient way in which 
one does business and not the amount of paper and the reporting 
that makes the business function or makes it efficient.
<P>
	We are here to clarify and to reduce government burden, not to 
extend the bureaucracy. We feel there are enough mechanisms in 
the reporting of this document that this House should be satisfied.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise in this House to speak on the motion put forward by 
the hon. member for St. Albert. I am doubly pleased because my 
hon. friend from St. Albert, with whom I sit on the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts, is among the members of that 
party who take the work they do very seriously. Every time the hon. 
member speaks, he is clearly trying to improve on things, he is a 
making a sincere effort and not joking around. I commend him for 
that.
<P>
	Today, his motion reflects just that. I am not at all surprised to 
hear my government colleague comment that the motion is in order 
and describe it as totally admirable because it is designed to 
improve in things. The government member says that he agrees in 
principle with this proposal but that he cannot support it. It is like 
saying that you are all for virtue but cannot afford to be virtuous.
<P>
	Through this private member's motion, he has an opportunity to 
make sure that the government will save money, and we are in great 
need of some. Since we cannot get any more money out of the 
taxpayers' pockets, we must take steps to save the government 
money that can then be put toward other programs, which are 
necessary to ensure the well-being of our taxpayers.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts does a fine job, and 
the auditor general is also doing his job. But the auditor general 
will not achieve the desired result in his audits unless he can count 
on the support of a committee of elected representatives and that is 
the role the public accounts committee is playing.
<P>
	The auditor general mentioned on several occasions having 
made one recommendation after another to certain departments; 
yet, two or three years later, none had been acted on.
<P>
	It is true that, when he carries out an audit, the auditor general 
questions departmental officials, those individuals who are 
responsible for making certain decisions.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	It is also true that these people then have the opportunity to tell 
the auditor general what they think of the issue. In other words, the 
auditor general could tell department officials: ``It seems to us that 
the books for your program should be kept in this fashion''.
<P>
	It may happen that officials defend their position and say: 
``Sorry, but we do not agree. We feel that we should continue to 
account for the money spent like we have been doing for three or 
four years''.
<P>
	The auditor general is an expert, but he is not infallible. 
Moreover, departments have competent officials and staff who can 
make a case for a different way of doing things. If the truth was 
always obvious, we would not need lawyers and courts. It may be 
that, in some cases, a department will not agree with the auditor 
general's opinion.
<P>
	What better way to deal with the issue than to refer the dispute to 
a committee made up of elected men and women? That committee 
would review the issue and report to the House, which would make 
the final decision, since it is the supreme authority in the land.
<P>
	The auditor general told us on numerous occasions that it was 
important for the public accounts committee to urge the House to 
order a department, I will not name any for the time being, to 
follow up on the auditor's recommendations. Under such 
circumstances, some departments have indeed agreed to change 
their attitude or their way of doing things.
<P>
	This is an important measure which, we feel, should have been 
put in effect a long time ago. Let us not forget, as the auditor 
general himself pointed out, that close to 70 per cent of government 
programs are not subject to any assessment. Hundreds of millions 
of dollars are invested in a scant 30 per cent of the programs, and 
barely thirty programs are evaluated. The question is asked: did the 
program yield the expected results?
<P>
	For example, there was the fishery problem-one which affected 
your area, Madam Speaker-the problem of the New Brunswick 
fisheries. At one point they were hit with disaster and the 
government, overnight practically, in just days, set up a relief 
program for the fishermen. Nobody stopped to say: ``If we create a 
program, we must be sure to create program evaluation criteria at 
the same time, to be sure at the end whether the money went to the 
right people, if they had enough, if they had too much''.
<P>
	There are a whole lot of questions to be thought of ahead of time, 
to ensure that the money has been spent properly, has attained the 
desired objective.  Unfortunately, nothing like that is done in 70 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1079"> 1079 </A></B>
<P>
cent of the cases, something the auditor general has often 
mentioned. Unfortunately, however, it has not been possible to set 
up such a thing.
<P>
	Of course, a minister can be told ``Mr. Minister, the auditor 
general wants you to apply this or that measure''. Then the minister 
via the departmental employees, or the deputy minister if the case 
involves the public accounts committee, will often respond with: 
``Oh yes, we agree with the auditor general's recommendations and 
we will take the necessary steps or do everything in our power to 
remedy the situation''.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	So when the minister said he agreed with the recommendation 
and that he would do everything in his power to improve the 
situation we are enclined to believe him and expect that, with the 
next report by the auditor general, everything will be in order. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case. If there is no mechanism in 
place to follow the thing through, we will never know whether 
recommendations have been followed or not.
<P>
	I have to talk about schools from time, because I come from an 
educational background. The effect would be the same if, in a 
school, we made rules and established discipline for students but 
never went to see whether they were behaving or following the 
rules. You know where we would end up, and it would not take 
long: the students would realize that, when the school principal 
issued an order, he never checked up on it or made sure it was 
followed. So the students would very quickly avoid putting 
themselves out and would simply do what they felt like with the 
least amount of effort.
<P>
	The same thing happens when the auditor general makes 
recommendations and a department says: ``Oh yes, oh yes, we will 
follow them''. There is, however, no follow up if no agency is 
assigned to ensure action has been taken. Things will never change.
<P>
	If, as proposed by my colleague for St. Albert, each department 
identified by the auditor general-and not every department is 
identified every year, there is not time to examine them all; some 
departments may be examined only every two, three or four 
years-would know the next day, if this legislation were passed, 
that it had to prepare a response to the questions raised by the 
auditor general and, as well, a plan to remedy the situation. These 
plans would be tabled in the House so that the ultimate authority 
would know that action had been taken.
<P>
	You know this is the only way we will improve things. This is 
not to add to the paper burden. We are not asking for 75-page 
reports; we are asking the department to respond to the allegations 
of the auditor general in a report that would be determined ahead of 
time to be a certain length-not too long-and would be concise 
and clear so that taxpayers could understand it. This way we  could 
save money that would no doubt be very welcome in other areas.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
parliamentary secretary for public works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I would like to have a quick clarification. Does 
the rotation not go back to the Reform Party if it is our motion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We are trying 
to ensure that all opposition parties to the motion have an 
opportunity to put forward their views. The mover of the motion 
had 20 minutes to put forward his views. We will hear a 
government member and then we will hear a Reform member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on another point of order. 
There are three hours of debate on the motion. It is a votable item. 
There are rules in the standing orders with respect to the rotation 
we should be following.
<P>
	I will live by your decision. However, if there are rules I think we 
should follow them. I believe the Reform Party is the next to speak. 
It is our motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Effectively it 
is your motion and you had the first 20 minutes to put forward your 
point of view. I will now give the floor to the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Public Works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I was wondering if you could quote the standing 
order which allows the rotation to go from the Reform Party to the 
Liberal Party to the official opposition and then back to the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is no 
standing order. It is the Chair who decides who will speak next.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to thank the hon. member for St. Albert for his motion 
to introduce amendments to the Financial Administration Act, an 
act that will require all departments and agencies to table in the 
House their responses to the auditor general's reports on their 
activities.
<P>
	I am pleased because there is no question that accountability is 
very important. It is so important that the Government of Canada 
has been working hard to make the public service more open, more 
responsive and more accountable.
<P>
	The member will know that the Liberal red book committed the 
government to measure program results over time and to measure 
how well a government delivers its programs and services to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1080"> 1080 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians. As a result,  accountability is now one of the 
cornerstones of a government-wide review process.
<P>
	Before I explain how accountability to Canadian taxpayers fits 
into this review process, let me first give some historical 
background. I would like to take this opportunity to reacquaint my 
colleagues with all the hard work that has been done in the pursuit 
of accountability. Sometimes we forget to mention our 
achievements. They get lost in the blizzard of issues and papers we 
must deal with every day.
<P>
	In 1993 the auditor general referred to program evaluation as 
``an essential part of government''. He called for government wide 
evaluations to be strengthened. As a taxpayer myself, I fully 
support the auditor general in his push for increased performance 
and accountability information. I recognize the need for sensible 
and good control frameworks in federal departments and agencies. 
That is what makes for good government, one that is responsive to 
taxpayers, that does not tolerate waste and mismanagement, a 
government that is affordable.
<P>
	In response to the auditor general's call for more reporting 
information, the public accounts committee called many witnesses 
to its hearings. We should commend the committee in its work. It 
did a thorough investigation and its report was unequivocal. It 
demanded more performance information. It supported the auditor 
general in recommending that departments and agencies step up 
their evaluation efforts. In essence, it called for greater 
accountability.
<P>
	In the meantime, also in response to the 1993 auditor general's 
call for strengthening government review, the treasury board 
secretariat released its review policy. In this policy, the secretariat 
asked that all federal departments and agencies conduct reviews. It 
asked that they use performance information in their business 
planning processes and that they make this performance 
information accessible to the public. In short, the treasury board 
secretariat was calling for greater accountability.
<P>
	In 1995 treasury board issued a revised expenditure management 
system. This revised policy required departments to articulate 
goals, targets and measures in key expenditure areas. It also asked 
each department to identify the reviews it would carry out over the 
coming year.
<P>
	Beginning this year, 1996, this expenditure management system 
asks that departmental performance reports tie into the annual 
business plan process.
<P>
	Put simply, departments and agencies must show Parliament and 
all Canadians whether the goals set in their business plans have 
been met and if not, why not. That, if I am not mistaken, is called 
accountability. All this is in response to the 1993 report of the 
auditor general.
<P>
	It is clear to me that Parliament and the public service are very 
respectful of the auditor general's recommendations, that they have 
responded to his call for more reporting information in very 
concrete ways.
<P>
	However, the push to make our public service more efficient, 
more responsive and more affordable did not stop there. Last year 
my colleagues on both sides of the House will recall the document 
Strengthening Government Review. It was tabled here last 
November by the treasury board president. The president's 1995 
report of review lays out the government's commitment to 
accountability very clearly. It provides readers with a snapshot of 
all the different review tools being used in government departments 
and agencies. It looks at accomplishments made over the previous 
two years and it provides a guide on how reporting procedures can 
be further strengthened. This report calls for the integration of a 
review into the management cycle of government. It wants the 
review to permeate every level of government from frontline 
managers right to the top, to deputy ministers. This will result in 
even better reporting.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The goal is to make these reports, evaluations, reviews and 
internal audits available to the general public in a format that we 
can all understand. The goal is accountability. Let me take a 
moment to read what the then President of the Treasury Board told 
the House last November. He said: ``The government is 
accountable to the citizens of this country. Performance 
information should be available to Parliament, departmental 
managers and central agencies. Our government is committed to 
delivering programs that work for the Canadian taxpayer''.
<P>
	As a result of these initiatives, accountability is now entrenched 
in the public service culture. It is now an integral part of the way 
we do business in Ottawa. The public accounts committee will 
keep a vigilant eye on this commitment, we can be sure of that. The 
auditor general will follow up on his 1993 recommendations and 
we can be sure of that as well. It is very clear that we have good 
reporting and accountability structures in place.
<P>
	It is worth spending a few minutes to examine how 
accountability has become a cornerstone of the federal 
government's review agenda. We all know that program and 
service evaluations have played an important role in program 
review. They are essential components of the Getting the 
Government Right initiative the President of Treasury Board spoke 
of in the House just a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
	Evaluations, internal audits and other review management tools 
will help to clarify federal roles and responsibilities. They will help 
to ensure that resources are devoted to the highest priorities. They 
will respond to public demand for better and more accessible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1081"> 1081 </A></B>
<P>
government and these review tools will help to deliver a  public 
service Canadians can afford. This is accountability.
<P>
	These review management tools, evaluations and internal audits 
do not just look at what is working and what is not. Done properly, 
they also recommend a course of action for correcting problems or 
missteps. Review is a continuous learning exercise. Government is 
always measuring what it does. It is always looking for new, more 
appropriate methods of delivering programs and services. It is 
looking for progress, not perfection.
<P>
	Let me give an example to which members can relate. The 
estimates tabled with the recent budget are undergoing radical 
change. In response to calls from parliamentarians for documents 
that provide information in a user friendly format, a pilot project 
was launched. I was personally involved in that.
<P>
	Two weeks ago we received six of what are called part IIIs from 
this pilot. Six departments agreed to change the way they have 
traditionally reported their activities. I urge everyone in the House 
to look at the part IIIs from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Natural Resources Canada, 
Agriculture Canada, Revenue Canada and Transport Canada. They 
will see that although these part IIIs were produced under tight 
deadlines each of these departments have made an honest effort to 
make them more readable and more user friendly.
<P>
	In the drive to provide legislators with useful information and to 
become even more accountable to the Canadian public, more pilots 
are planned. We seek feedback on these projects. We will learn 
from those remarks. We are committed to providing information 
that is meaningful, easy to follow and that supports the 
government's agenda of openness and accountability.
<P>
	As I have said, the government recognizes the need to get 
information into the hands of legislators and the public. It listens to 
recommendations made by the auditor general, the public accounts 
committee and members of the House. Recommendations are acted 
on, changes are made. Taxpayers of Canada expect no less.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to commend the public 
accounts committee. As our hon. friend can attest, it maintains a 
busy schedule. I think this committee issued 15 reports in 1995 and 
its work did not stop there. Each summer the committee asks for an 
activity update from all those departments and agencies which have 
not appeared as witnesses. It has, as it should, maintained a 
watchful eye. I expect it to continue this good work, to live up to 
the responsibility Canadians have vested in it.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to put 
these facts on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to apologize for giving you a hard time earlier. I thought there 
were set rules and perhaps there was an oversight.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Just to clarify 
how fair the Chair is, I would like to say that half of the time for 
this debate has been allocated to the Reform Party, 20 minutes to 
the Liberal Party and 10 minutes to the Bloc members. Equity is in 
the system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I appreciate that, Madam Speaker, but this is a 
three-hour debate. We do not know whether it is more than fair. If 
you continue that the rest of the way we will really appreciate it.
<P>
	First, I would like to point out that my speech this afternoon is 
intended to convince the government to recognize that we have a 
problem. In so doing, I will obviously be creating the need to solve 
that problem and offer a solution.
<P>
	Since this is the first time the government has heard about the 
solution presented by my colleague from St. Albert I feel the 
government deserves some time to consider it. We would not want 
it to be too hasty in its position, especially in light of the first two 
comments we heard by its members. We would like government 
members to listen to the debate with an open mind.
<P>
	It seems very suspicious. This is the first time we have brought 
this forward and suddenly the government has concluded that it 
would involve a bigger bureaucracy, that it would cost more 
money, that therefore we could not do it, that it is going along quite 
nicely as it is. I will get back to the bigger bureaucracy issue in a 
second.
<P>
	The suggestion by my colleague requires all departments and 
agencies to table in the House of Commons a specific response to 
the auditor general's report on their activities, including 
timeframes within which corrective action would be taken 
regarding any shortcomings. This is the point that I want to stress. 
This is the point that I want to concentrate on. It is the corrective 
measures that will produce the efficiency gains in the system.
<P>
	As my colleague from St. Albert said, we pay $50 million for an 
auditor general and three times a year he is reported in the 
newspaper for a couple of days. There are headlines about 
government waste here and government waste there, which is not 
necessarily the fault of the politicians. However, he sees this waste. 
What happens after? How do we know if there is a follow up? At 
what point will there be a follow up?
<P>
	This suggestion is a way to take advantage of the $50 million 
investment in the auditor general and a way to allow departments 
and bureaucrats to respond. Heaven knows they have received a lot 
of flak lately. Heaven knows they have not had a raise in pay for a 
long time and unlike the MPs they could not give themselves an 
increase in their pensions. Therefore, they have to suffer  at the 
mercy of the criticism of the auditor general. If they were given a 
specific opportunity to respond as to when they would have 
corrective measures, they could follow that timeline, and politi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1082"> 1082 </A></B>
<P>
cians could come and go. It is more important that we have some 
production out of the criticism. This process would only occur if 
there were areas which needed fixing. This is what the purpose of 
the auditor general is.
<P>
	There is an excellent suggestion in the motion. It legitimizes the 
auditor general's review. If there are no problems, there are no 
problems. If there is a problem, then let us solve it. When will we 
solve it? Who is responsible for solving it? These are the things that 
are not happening in all cases.
<P>
	As my colleague said, the public accounts committee does 
review things. It does do a good job. It takes time. If we make a list 
and we have to do things one through ten, it takes 10 times longer 
to do it. If we had 10 departments doing it we could get it all done 
in the same amount of time. That is the point in terms of efficiency 
gains. That is the point in terms of solving problems faster, thereby 
saving money.
<P>
	The negative impression that an auditor general's report could 
give of government could be eliminated sooner. The reputation and 
the integrity of government would also improve if this motion were 
adopted. It shows co-operation. It does not show a hand up like a 
football player trying to block somebody from tackling them.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The opportunity for departments to clarify and rectify any 
criticisms more quickly gives them the opportunity to take matters 
into their own hands and do something about the issue as fast as 
possible.
<P>
	I would now like to spend a couple of minutes on the hypocrisy 
of the government. I spoke yesterday about the GST and the 
sanctimoniousness, the hypocrisy of how the government raises 
duplicity to its highest form.
<P>
	Today I will try to make a constructive suggestion. Already the 
argument is being used that with the size of the deficit, which is 
going down, that bureaucracy cannot be made bigger. It is going to 
cost us more money and, therefore, it cannot be done.
<P>
	How hypocritical is that statement? I will tell the House how 
hypocritical it is. The government said it wants efficiency, to retain 
a small bureaucracy. Then someone tell me why the government 
voted to add six more members of Parliament to the House of 
Commons? It wants to increase the numbers from 295 to 301. That 
is what the Liberals voted for, to approve the electoral boundaries 
which would increase the number of seats to 301, an additional six 
seats. The government is hypocritical for supporting the addition of 
six more MPs. It is a cost that will be far higher-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. There must at 
least be some semblance of truth. I wonder if the hon. member can 
tell us when he voted on the item he claims to have voted on? The 
House has never voted to increase its membership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not believe we are on questions 
or comments at this time. If the member will tell me that in the next 
election there will not be 301 seats, then I will take back my charge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Did you vote for it? Nobody voted for it. It was 
never ruled. There has never been a vote. There was never a vote on 
that issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe we have addressed the 
issue of electoral boundaries, have we not?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Did we address the issue of-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> There has never been a vote on increasing the 
membership. Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Did we have a debate on electoral boundaries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> And did the government support the new boundaries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The government was against the new boundaries?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We are 
debating a motion put forward by a colleague. If the member 
wishes to resume debate on that issue please go ahead. He still has 
two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, you are subtracting the time from 
me that another member used when he rose on a point of order to 
debate me on the side, which I think was maybe out of order.
<P>
	The bill proposes to give the auditor general's work a little more 
legitimacy, a little more of a businesslike approach. It is like any 
kind of business where a consultant is hired to show where it is 
strong or weak, to show where it can improve. That is basically 
what the auditor is trying to do. The auditor is trying to improve the 
operation of government. I believe that when a report is given on 
three or four departments a couple of times during the year that 
those departments should respond. I think it is a big improvement 
which I heartily endorse.
<P>
	Once again I feel bad because the government does not want to 
listen, does not want to learn.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	Winston Churchill said that some people like to learn but they do 
not like to be taught. When this government was in opposition it 
felt like it knew everything. Now that  those members are opposite, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1083"> 1083 </A></B>
<P>
it is obvious they do not have a plan. They do not even have the 
people. The Prime Minister is firing people right, left and centre.
<P>
	Here we are trying to make a suggestion. I wish the government 
had an open mind. I wish it would give this motion due diligence 
and see if this is not in the best interests of Canadians. We are not 
talking about the best interests of Liberals or Reformers. We are 
talking about the best interests of Canadians, Canada, and how we 
can make the system work a lot better and more efficiently.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALTRADE">INTERNATIONAL TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, all is not well in the agricultural sector. Despite 
higher than expected grain prices and the usual spring optimism 
that all of us prairie folk experience at this time of year, there are 
many things that concern us. I cannot begin in the short time 
available tonight to describe everything that is of concern but I 
have to raise the issues relating to international trade, particularly 
the activities of the United States government in the marketplace.
<P>
	I originally rose on March 14 with comments about the U.S. 
farm bill and grazing fees for cattle. At that time I expressed 
concern to the minister that not enough was being done to represent 
the interests of Canadian producers.
<P>
	Here in Canada we are virtually disarming ourselves in this 
international agricultural trade war. We have abandoned our long 
time financial commitment for the transportation of grain to port. 
We are in the process of deregulating the transportation sector and 
we have undermined the stability of the supply managed sector. In 
each case we as a nation have left our farmers and the communities 
they support with less support than the farmers in the countries 
with whom we compete in the world marketplace.
<P>
	Despite our rush to eliminate agricultural subsidies or 
commitments to the orderly marketing of our products, the United 
States does not think we have gone far enough. The Americans 
continue to pressure us, to reduce the authority of the Canadian 
Wheat Board just as they continue to pressure us to remove more 
quickly the remaining tariffs that exist for our supply managed  
products. The Americans do not have a leg to stand on. Their facts 
do not add up. They are wrong, but that does not stop the 
Americans from complaining and seeking remedies to their 
perceived problems.
<P>
	Canadian farmers ask: Where is the Canadian government? 
Where is the minister of agriculture? Where are our complaints 
against the American government which continues to play financial 
games in the world agricultural marketplace, which again penalizes 
Canadian producers? Where is the Canadian argument designed to 
protect Canadian interests?
<P>
	For example, on March 14 I pointed out that the collapse of the 
U.S. farm bill means that the Americans have to revert to an old 
farm bill, which provides massive subsidy levels for corn and price 
guarantees for wheat. Corn can be subsidized to $7. Wheat can be 
guaranteed to $9. What Canadian farmer, even at the higher world 
prices we are receiving today, would not want to see their 
government guarantee the price of their wheat at $9?
<P>
	These are the people we are competing against in the 
international marketplace and our producers cannot do it on their 
own. It is unfair and the Canadian government has an obligation to 
stand up and strongly oppose situations like these.
<P>
	The other example I gave on March 14 was the indirect beef 
subsidy. The U.S. government owns a lot of grazing land. It leases 
that land to cattle producers in return for a certain lease payment. 
The U.S. government just reduced the lease payment on that 
grazing land by 20 per cent. Is that not another agricultural subsidy 
we should be addressing?
<P>
	On supply management, the U.S. has instigated yet another 
challenge that has made Canadian poultry, dairy and egg producers 
very nervous, all this despite the fact that the Canadian case before 
the NAFTA panel is clear, strong and correct.
<P>
	Canada is doing more to eliminate or reduce agricultural 
subsidies than any of our trading partners or competitors. In most 
cases Canada is doing more and doing it more quickly than is 
required by NAFTA or GATT agreements.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are spending all of our time defending 
ourselves against petty political U.S. accusations. Perhaps it is time 
we made some accusations of our own and forced the U.S. to 
account for some of its unfriendly activities.
<P>
	Will the minister of agriculture assure Canadian producers and 
the communities they support that he will not only defend 
Canadian interests but will also challenge the U.S. violations of our 
negotiated trade agreements?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the U.S. is in the 
process of writing a new farm bill to guide its agricultural policy 
for the seven year period to  the year 2002. Although this bill is 
later than normal, a compromise version of the U.S. Senate and 
House of Representatives bill is expected to be agreed upon and 
forwarded to the U.S. President for signature in the next few weeks.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1084"> 1084 </A></B>
<P>
	References by the hon. member to U.S. support prices based on 
1949 legislation reflect a possibility that is extremely unlikely to 
materialize.
<P>
	Both the U.S. House and Senate bills that were passed in 
February would enact the freedom to farm concept. This concept 
would eliminate target prices for major crops as well as deficiency 
payments, land set aside requirements and planting restrictions 
previously required for farmers to participate in income support 
programs. In exchange, a seven year production flexibility contract 
for eligible crops will provide annual fixed and declining payments 
to farmers irrespective of the level of world prices or actual 
production.
<P>
	Under such legislation, U.S. government involvement in 
agriculture would decline and U.S. farmers would respond to 
market forces more than they have in the last 50 years. Moreover, 
export subsidy provisions would not exceed the U.S. commitment 
allowable under the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	We are monitoring developments and will be very vigilant in 
ensuring that the U.S. lives up to all of its commitments under 
international agreements, including the aggregate level of support 
it can provide to its agricultural sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to standing Order 24 (1).
<P>
