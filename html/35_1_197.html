	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present a number of petitions representing all 
provinces and territories expressing concern that breast cancer 
has not been taken on as a national issue and a national priority, 
given that 5,400 Canadian women will die this year from that 
disease and about 17,000 Canadian women will be diagnosed.
<P>
	The petitioners have asked that Parliament establish a toll free 
information and support line. They urge the government to 
begin consultations to establish parameters for a national 
registry of drugs and medical devices and various forms of 
biotechnology.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these petitioners, while applauding the initiatives of 
government and the CRTC to reduce violence and abuse in all of 
its forms in the media, continue to emphasize the importance of 
accentuating the efforts because they believe it is not necessary 
in order to educate, to inform or to entertain. They also believe 
that very often these depictions of abuse and violence are 
contrary to their efforts to raise their children.
<P>
	Once again they ask government and the CRTC to be 
extremely vigilant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The petitioners are responsible people who believe in the need 
to reduce violence and abuse in the media.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to introduce a petition to Parliament. The petitioners 
are calling on Parliament to enact legislation against serious 
personal injury crimes being committed by high risk offenders 
in support of my colleague's Bill C-240.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me because an incident inspired the 
petition. There are 27 pages directly related to this. I suggested 
to the people in that community that one of the most effective 
ways of getting this on to the table was through a petition. This 
shows a very responsible attitude on the part of the people from 
Elkford.

have several petitions to place before the House.
<P>
	The first asks that Parliament not pass Bill C-41 with section 
718.2 as presently written and in any event not include the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation, as the behaviour people 
engage in does not warrant special considerations in Canadian 
law.

surrounding constituencies.
<P>
	The first petition contains approximately 335 names. The 
petitioners ask that Parliament not amend the human rights 
code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights 
and freedoms in any way which would tend to indicate societal 
approval of same sex relationship or of homosexuality, 
including amending the human rights code to include in the 
prohibited grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase

Parliament make no changes in the law which would sanction or 
allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or active or passive

<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was 
unavoidably detained. If I had been here I would have supported 
my colleague's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate this 
morning.
<P>
	What a difference a year makes. A little over a year ago 
Reform Party MPs said they were to take 15 per cent pay cuts. 
Then they pretended they wanted a reduction in MPs benefits. 
Now Reform Party MPs are asking for a pay raise. Would you 
believe it? Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Duplicity, thy name is Reform. That is what we 
have this morning. We have some MPs who should be recalled 
from the opposition side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Recall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Most members of Parliament, if not all, are 
worth every cent of their pay cheques. In principle members are 
underpaid. The hon. member for Ottawa Centre put it very 
eloquently. The Prime Minister has said it before. We all agree it 
is true but that is not the point at the present time. In particular 
one political party in the House, is saying two things at once.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Which one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I have to admit it is the Reform Party.
<P>
	By coincidence this is the same party that wanted to be frugal. 
When it came to Ottawa the first thing it asked for was larger 
office space. This is the same party that came to Ottawa and 
rejected a limousine and had one delivered by the back entrance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12338"> 12338 </A></B>
<P>
	Shall I remind the House about the suitable venture of the 
leader of that party? Let us not talk about free contributions to 
people's RRSPs and other such ventures to enhance the salary 
package of those who were claiming that MPs were overpaid.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that today's debate has 
nothing to do with MPs' salaries and benefits. The debate held 
today in this House is about honesty and openness. That is the 
real issue being debated in this House.
<P>
	As we can see, some members of a political formation across 
the way are now getting it in the neck with regard to openness, 
honesty and sincerity in this House.
<P>
	We have been debating this bill for several hours already.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last week Reform Party MPs proposed meaningless 
amendments to the bill because they did not want it to go to 
committee. Why did they not want it to go to committee? 
Because they did not really want a pay decrease. They wanted a 
pay increase. Now we know why they did not want the bill to go 
to committee. They produced dilatory motions to stop the bill 
from going to committee.
<P>
	This morning they tried their best again to stop the bill from 
going to committee. It will not happen again. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the question be now put.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am almost embarrassed to rise after the speech of the member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	His comments clearly indicate the kinds of problems we have. 
Reform Party members, I will remind members, took pay cuts 
over the last year. Other members of Parliament did not do that. 
Members of the Reform Party have committed to opt out of the 
MP pension plan. We anticipate that very few other members of 
Parliament will do that. There will be a few honourable people 
on the other side.
<P>
	Perhaps one of the reasons Reform Party members are willing 
to do these things is that unlike the previous speaker and many 
others on the other side, Reform Party members had no trouble 
before they were here and will have no trouble after they are here 
finding other employment and making a decent living.
<P>
	In any case, let me address the bill before us today, Bill C-85, 
an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act, which is of course the MP pension. These amendments have 
been a long time in coming. For 18 months this government has 
been promising changes. Finally we see the marginal changes 
that we see now.
<P>
	The Reform Party has long called for changes to the overly 
generous pensions for MPs. Last November 22, I and many of 
my colleagues spoke in support of the motion of the hon. 
member for Beaver River, asking the government to replace the 
current members of Parliament retirement allowance with a plan 
reflecting the current norms for private sector pensions. This 
was rejected by both the Liberals and the separatists. Clearly, 
the Liberals' new proposal, the freedom 55 plan, does not 
accomplish this.
<P>
	Before I speak to some of the specifics of this bill in the few 
minutes I have, I would like to make it clear that I personally 
would support a fair pension plan. My wife and I just purchased 
our first home and we are planning for our future, but I could not 
go home and look my wife or my constituents in the eye if I 
opted into a plan like the one offered in Bill C-85. Instead, I will 
put my own money into an RRSP, just like millions of other 
Canadians, and hopefully the government will not see fit to cut 
those again, as it has in the past.
<P>
	Let us take a look at how this plan evolved from the plan 
introduced by Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent in 1952 to the 
monstrosity that is proposed today. According to Mr. St. 
Laurent, the original plan was ``to be actuarially sound and a 
matter that would operate without any further charge on the 
public funds than the matching of contribution to be made by all 
members of Parliament''.
<P>
	Mr. St. Laurent indicated that the plan was never really 
intended at the time to be a pension per se. According to Mr. St. 
Laurent, it was to provide for members in their later years and to 
reward them for their public service.
<P>
	At that time members contributed 6 per cent of what was an 
annual $4,000 salary in return for an allowance equal to only 4.5 
per cent of their indemnity if they retired after serving more than 
two Parliaments.
<P>
	In 1963 the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act 
was amended to require members to contribute 6 per cent of 
their $12,000 indemnity per annum. Rather than the flat 
percentage allowance, benefits were increased to 2.5 per cent of 
the member's annual indemnity up to a maximum of 75 per cent.
<P>
	In 1965 additional provisions were made for a retirement 
allowance plan to allow senators to participate at a 3 per cent 
benefit accrual rate. Members will recall that at that time the 
term for senators was changed from life to age 75, so for the first 
time there was provision for retirement in the Senate.
<P>
	It was really in 1981 that the changes to the benefit rate for 
MPs began to make this plan the obscene one we have today. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12339"> 12339 </A></B>
<P>
This was when the benefit accrual rate was increased to 5 per 
cent and the generous inflation protection, the full inflation 
protection we now have, was implemented.
<P>
	We can see from the report on the administration of the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act for 1983 that 
while it varied from year to year, the plan kept up the appearance 
of a one-to-one member-to-government contribution ratio 
from 1952 all the way to 1992. However, as we know, this was an 
illusion due to accounting practices, and it vanished in 1991-92 
with the $158 million top-up that was needed to the plan. This 
actuarial adjustment credit was needed to comply with 
legislative changes in Bill C-55 at the time requiring that 
adequate contributions be credited to meet the costs of pension 
obligations as they accrue.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	With this top up, the cost of the plan to taxpayers in the form 
of interest on the plan was also increased. Many people do not 
know that the government does in fact pay a generous rate of 
interest on this account, which is of course a cost to the 
taxpayers but which is not included in the total cost the 
government admits is involved in this plan.
<P>
	With the top up in 1992, the unrecognized cost was $3.4 
million. It has gradually escalated to $20.4 million in 1992-93 
and then to $23 million in 1993-94. It is also interesting to note 
that the rate at which the government pays interest into the MP 
pension plan, about 10 per cent, while not an unreasonable rate, 
is considerably higher than the 4 per cent it will pay when it 
returns contributions to members who choose to opt out or who 
do not meet the six-year vesting period.
<P>
	Bill C-55 also caused the division of the members' pension 
plan into two parts to achieve compliance with changes to the 
Income Tax Act regarding the rules for registered pension plans. 
Now we have one portion that conforms with rules for 
registration and the other a ``retirement compensation 
arrangement'' that does not. This portion has much higher 
associated costs for the plan because of the refundable tax paid 
on it. Bill C-85 does not correct this.
<P>
	Clearly the 1952 idea of providing politicians with a financial 
buffer to compensate them for periods of employment 
uncertainty is contrary to the reality our constituents now face. 
In the 1990s the concept of job security has all but disappeared, 
not just for Canadians in the broad workforce but even for 
Canadians in the most traditionally secure areas of the public 
sector.
<P>
	Similarly unacceptable is the argument that MPs are 
underpaid and thus must get bigger retirement benefits. If the 
government feels MPs are underpaid, then the government 
should address that issue in a transparent manner, not through 
the backward route of an overly generous pension plan. The 
Reform Party's position on this is clear: there should be no 
increase in MP salaries or office budgets until this country's 
budget is balanced.
<P>
	As many private sector employers and some of the provincial 
legislatures have obviously realized, this type of plan, a defined 
benefit plan, is very costly to employers and the costs are 
difficult to accurately predict. There is no real relationship 
between how much a member contributes to the plan and the 
benefits a member receives.
<P>
	Several provincial governments have recently taken drastic 
measures to scale back or to eliminate traditional pension 
benefits for politicians. Prince Edward Island rolled back 
pension benefits and then wound up the plan completely. 
Similarly, the Alberta government lowered the benefits for some 
of the recipients already collecting their pensions and then 
ended the plan for future MLAs.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the benefit accrual rate for Alberta 
MLAs prior to this roll back was 4 per cent, the rate now being 
proposed by the government. A study had found that the net 
value of one year's worth of pension accrual for an MLA was 
$28,733 under that plan, compared to an equivalent $9,034 in 
the private sector. For the federal plan we are presently under 
and under which many members of the House will still collect 
benefits, this number was $42,741 a year.
<P>
	The Manitoba legislature will implement reforms far in 
excess of those proposed by this government following the next 
election. Their pension plan arrangement will be replaced by an 
RRSP savings plan arrangement where taxpayers only have to 
match each member's contribution.
<P>
	Even here in Ontario the provincial Liberals in their ``son of 
red book'' promised that if they are elected they will scrap the 
Ontario legislative pension plan and replace it with a group 
RRSP, exactly what the Reform Party proposes. We saw it in 
1993 and we are seeing now in Ontario how different Liberals 
are when they are running for election as compared to when they 
are actually sitting in a Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to address Bill 
C-85, amendments to the MPs' pension plan. At the same time, I 
share a bit of shame in the House, having heard the atrocious 
remarks of the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I address the citizens of Canada. I hope, ladies and gentlemen 
of the public, you read <I>Hansard</I> of today to listen to what the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell had to say. In that 
you will hear a perversion of the facts, where that member 
deliberately went after the Reform Party to twist things around 
and indicate that what we were talking about here was aug-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12340"> 12340 </A></B>
<P>
mentation of MPs' salaries rather than the pension plan, which 
is the thing we are directly addressing.
<P>
	One should not get emotional. This should be a place where 
one addresses logic and reason and brings facts out into the 
open. I find that really the remarks of that member typify what is 
wrong with the political process in Canada.
<P>
	We are talking about a pension plan. We believe sincerely that 
the pension plan given to MPs is simply far too generous. We are 
speaking on behalf of the Canadian public in that regard. They 
say it is too generous, it is gold plated, we should cut it back. 
What the government is doing to respond to the public is simply 
not good enough, and that is our point.
<P>
	In any event, the government has finally found the courage to 
tackle the problem, if insufficiently. I am saddened that the 
Liberal fat pack has refused to abandon its place at the public 
trough, which has resulted in what is really a very poor excuse 
for MP pension reform. There is insufficient reform in that bill.
<P>
	In their 1991 book, <I>The Great Reckoning</I>, authors James Dale 
Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg wrote: ``In the past, 
those societies that have treated persons differently, based upon 
what they are, rather than what they do, have faltered 
economically, and opportunity has been foreclosed for almost 
everyone''. This quotation is appropriate to our debate here 
today, for with the MP pension plan we have a group of 295 men 
and women who are being treated differently simply because 
they are members of Parliament. How are they treated 
differently? Under this revised pension sham, MPs can collect a 
pension at the age of 55. In the private sector, most people have 
to wait until they are 65.
<P>
	Even with lowering the annual accrual rate to 4 per cent, it 
means that this plan proposed by the government is twice as rich 
as that of the plan of the average Canadian worker. The MP plan 
is fully indexed against inflation, which is something that is 
virtually unheard of in the private sector.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government and its gang of present and 
future trough feeders feel that they have a right to be treated so 
much better than the average Canadian? While it may be true 
that this bill will fulfil the red book promise to reform the plan, 
it is a hollow and purely symbolic reform.
<P>
	For example, the red book speaks of eliminating double 
dipping, the practice of collecting an MP pension while earning 
a government paycheque, usually for a patronage appointment. 
The government says that their proposal will eliminate double 
dipping. But if we look closely at the bill we see it simply defers 
the practice. Pension benefits continue to grow but are deferred 
for as long as the patronage position lasts.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Once again we see that these amendments are nothing but 
smoke and mirrors. The Canadian public is incensed at the 
current obscenely generous gold plated pension plan for MPs. It 
is equally outraged by these amendments which merely 
downgrade the gold plated plan to a silver plated one.
<P>
	The fact that politicians have a bad reputation in Canada is 
largely due to this type of largesse. The government had the 
opportunity to address the massive public concern but refused to 
do so. It blew it. Like most other things the Liberal government 
has done, it reacted in a half hearted foot dragging way. It has 
proven once again that if the public wants real reform they had 
better send in some real Reformers.
<P>
	As a real Reformer, I oppose this plan. However, I am not here 
to simply criticize. As a Reformer, I also have an alternative. 
Last year I asked my constituents about MP pension reform. I 
asked how long an MP should have to serve before getting a 
pension and at what age. We asked this question widely in my 
constituency.
<P>
	Based on the responses I received I presented my constituents 
with a proposal to revamp the plan. Support for this proposal 
was ten to one in favour. Since that time I have been working on 
the plan on behalf of the people of Nanaimo-Cowichan and I 
am proud to say that the process is now complete. Yesterday the 
collective voice of my constituents was heard on this issue in the 
House when I introduced my private member's bill.
<P>
	In comparing the government's farcical attempt at pension 
reform with that proposed by my constituents in 
Nanaimo-Cowichan we see many glaring discrepancies. For 
instance, under the Liberal plan taxpayers contribute $3.50 for 
every dollar put in by the MP. Under the Nanaimo-Cowichan 
plan, taxpayers contribute nothing since they are already paying 
the MP's salary. Under the Liberal plan the pension fund is 
managed by the government, which has a worse fiscal record in 
management than Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Under my 
constituents' proposal the pension fund will be administered by 
the private sector.
<P>
	Under the Liberal plan, taxpayers are on the hook to eligible 
MPs for life. Under our plan MPs would receive a one time lump 
sum payment consisting of the money which they contributed 
plus the interest accumulated, which could be considerable.
<P>
	Under the Liberal proposal the Liberal fat pack maintains its 
front row reservation at the public trough while newer MPs will 
be moved back to the second row, thus creating a two tiered 
pension plan. Under the Nanaimo-Cowichan plan all MPs are 
treated equally, as no one is entitled to belly up to the trough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12341"> 12341 </A></B>
<P>
	In comparison with the so-called reform package put forward 
by the Liberal government there is only a one-time opportunity 
to opt out of the plan. That means that all future MPs will be 
forced to swill from the public trough, like it or not. Our 
proposal allows MPs to opt out of the plan at their discretion.
<P>
	Liberals, like the hon. Deputy Prime Minister and her fat pack 
colleagues, say they have worked hard for their gold plated 
pensions and deserve what they have coming. I trust that the 
voters are wise enough to see through the smoke and mirrors to 
discover the hypocrisy and deceit behind the bill so that the 
Liberal fat packers get what is coming to them.
<P>
	A true democracy must be based on quality citizens who come 
forward to serve their country out of a genuine desire to make 
our society a better place in which to live, not out of a desire to 
better one's own standard of living.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not believe that politics should be a lifelong profession. It 
should be a momentary detour in one's career path. 
Unfortunately, the bill to which we are addressing ourselves 
today promotes the former and does nothing to restore 
Canadians' faith in their politicians. The citizens of Canada will 
judge the government of today on this bill.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to abandon this frivolous bill, 
although I know I am not going to get much reaction from across 
the way. I urge members to take a long, hard look at the proposal 
put forward on behalf of the constituents of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan in the bill I introduced yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this bill today.
<P>
	When I listened to the words the government whip had about 
the Reform Party and this pension plan, it makes me ashamed to 
be sitting in the House listening to that kind of poor rhetoric 
from the Liberal government. People in my riding of Fraser 
Valley West living in Langley, Aldergrove and Abbotsford must 
be shaking their heads today wondering what is happening in 
that place where they are supposed to be running this country.
<P>
	What is happening in this place is a major disappointment. 
When I was elected I thought I could come to the House and try 
to change this government and get it off things like this fat 
pension plan. I thought just maybe we could try the concept of a 
triple-E Senate where senators would be elected, effective and 
would have equal representation. I thought we could deal with 
things like balancing the budget. I thought we could look at 
trying to reduce the number of frivolous grants that are given out 
year after year after year. I thought I could effect a change in 
patronage and ethics and get the government to change.
<P>
	However, everything I have just mentioned is still happening 
is still supported by this government, even though it knows it is 
wrong. The Liberals sat on this side of the House in the last 
session of Parliament and belittled the Conservatives for it and 
here the Liberals are still at it.
<P>
	The Liberals made a promise in a document called the Liberal 
red book. The Liberal red book actually came out during the 
election. It was not a long term plan they had. It was an election 
tool. The promise was to make some changes in this pension 
plan.
<P>
	I will go through these changes. Essentially that was a facade. 
The government has told the Canadian people it is changing 
things but it is not doing it. They are weak changes. They are not 
real reforms to the pension plan. It is just a facade to make the 
folks out there think that something is really happening here. 
What is really happening out there is that people are overtaxed, 
frustrated and fed up. It is no wonder from listening to this kind 
of rhetoric on pension plans.
<P>
	I could call these Liberals hypocritical for saying one thing 
and doing another, but I will not. I could call them trough 
slurping pension planners for making an absolutely abysmal 
excuse in trying to change a pension plan, but I will not. I could 
call them overindulging politicians for taking more than what 
they are worth, but I will not. What I will call these Liberals and 
this government are plain bad managers.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Organizations in Canada that work in developing pension 
plans for their employees work within the Income Tax Act, as I 
have done in developing a pension plan for my employees. I give 
what is fair and reasonable, usually a dollar for a dollar. That is 
not what is happening here. Here government members are 
telling Canadians that they are going to reduce some benefits 
and save Canadians money while at the same time they milk the 
system for all it is worth. I think that is disgusting.
<P>
	Let us think about what the Liberals are developing. They 
want to establish a future minimum age of 55. I checked the 
records and the majority of parliamentarians in the House are 
already 55 years old. What kind of smoke are they putting out 
here? They want to eliminate double dipping. That is nice. They 
are saying that when they give the patronage jobs to their 
friends, they will not give them the $130,000 or $180,000 plus a 
pension. They will hold the pension back.
<P>
	What the government does not really say about this is that the 
pension members earn while they are MPs is still accumulating 
compound interest. When they get out of the patronage job, the 
double dipping job they are talking about, they get the MPs 
pension updated and indexed. They also get all the returns from 
the patronage position. Talk about being at the trough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12342"> 12342 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals have talked about lowering the rate at which the 
benefits accrue. They currently accrue at 5 per cent. It is 5 per 
cent of $64,000 for every year of service. They said: ``We are 
going to do something here. We will bring it down to 4 per 
cent''. What Liberal members are not saying is that 4 per cent is 
still double the rate of private sector pension plans, registered 
plans under the Income Tax Act. They also do not say that there 
are special provisions in the Income Tax Act to make way for 
that.
<P>
	If we want to reform a pension plan or anything else in the 
House, we had better start a real reform, not the half baked idea 
of telling people one thing and doing another. Hypocrites.
<P>
	They have lowered the rate at which individual members 
contribute to the plan from 11 per cent to 9 per cent. Very good. 
Members here will get a 2 per cent return, more cash in their 
hands. Congratulations. At the same time that is being done, 
what really happens is the contributions they are giving are 
really going to cost more to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Reform Party members will opt out. Now what are they to do? 
In this pension plan they need all the contributions to make it 
viable. If we opt out of it they will be short of cash. They have 
taken 2 per cent of the cash coming in from members so who are 
they to hit? That is right folks, the Canadian taxpayer. That is 
who is to pay for it.
<P>
	They have given us an opportunity to opt out. I am opting out 
of this plan. I have a family to look after as well and I do not have 
a job to go to at the end of my parliamentary career. That is just 
fine with me. That is just fine with my wife and family. We will 
go back to our riding and we will hold our heads a little higher.
<P>
	For those people who forced at least some change, the Liberal 
government is saying: ``We will make it very difficult for you 
when you opt out. You can never get back in''. That is fine. I can 
live with that. ``We will give you a 4 per cent return''. Well, that 
is good too.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	They are not saying that there is absolutely no hope for 
anybody opting out of the plan to make a move to get back in. 
People are entitled to change their minds, but the government 
has to be very careful about what it is doing. This is not an act to 
punish. If people want to opt out, let them opt out. The 
government has a bad management style that will not be 
forgotten.
<P>
	Finally let me say that the RRSP limits this year were 
supposed to be $14,500 for the average Canadian citizen but the 
government kept it at $13,500. Folks out there get a little less 
and folks across here get a little more. Is that a great example 
you set?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Before the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West concludes his remarks in the 
brief period of time left, I recognize there are strongly held 
views on the issue. It is vigorous debate,  but I urge you and 
remind you that all interventions must be done through the Chair 
or the Speaker and not directly across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an 
emotional debate and deservedly so. Many people believe that 
the this pension plan is gold plated and is too large. I am 
convinced that some Liberal members probably feel the same 
way but cannot make change because their party says: ``This is 
the way it is to be''.
<P>
	That is unfortunate but I sincerely hope the next time we go to 
the polls people remember what happened in the House this year 
on this issue and in this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
last 24 hours I have learned much about why many politicians 
can talk so much and say so little. I have learned much about 
why many politicians say so little in failing in their attempt to be 
all things to all people.
<P>
	I have also learned why many politicians prefer to say nothing 
at all, for if a politician says nothing there are no words that can 
be used against him or her to deflect from the substance of 
debate.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House, instead of answering a reasonable 
question from my Reform colleague from Kootenay East, the 
President of the Treasury Board decided that the only response 
required was to refer to comments I made in the House on May 4.
<P>
	Suddenly the debate is no longer about pensions but about the 
comments of a member of the House who raised the 
compensation issue. The issue was raised in my capacity as an 
individual and not as a matter of Reform Party policy and was so 
qualified. The issue was raised by other members of the House 
from other parties during the course of the debate. It was an 
issue that all speakers recognize was separate from the main 
issue of debate, that being the pension of parliamentarians.
<P>
	This is all quite regrettable. It is important to at least 
reference the issue of our basic compensation since the studies 
dealing with our pensions do not address them in isolation but 
rather in the context of the other moneys and benefits we 
receive.
<P>
	The issue of our compensation was raised by the President of 
the Treasury Board when he introduced legislation and stated 
that they could not wait for the day when we could deal with 
salary increases as suggested in the Sobeco, Ernst and Young 
study. They could not afford them then. While the total 
compensation approach outlined in the study is worthy of 
further discussion it is not functionally possible at this time, as 
reported in <I>Hansard</I> of May 4.
<P>
	The position of the President of the Treasury Board is entirely 
consistent with Reform Party policy. The Liberals campaigned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12343"> 12343 </A></B>
<P>
in 1993 on a general promise of changes to the MP pension plan 
without specifics being provided.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We campaigned in 1993 with specifics provided on how we 
would change MP pension. As well we provided specifics on 
why the compensation of MPs must continue to be frozen. We 
said explicitly that until a balanced budget was achieved the 
salaries and expenses of government MPs and their offices 
would be frozen. Our position has not changed.
<P>
	I was not the only member raising compensation issues in the 
House during the course of debate on pensions. The Liberal 
member for Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe was quite 
explicit. In <I>Hansard</I> of May 4 he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We cannot give ourselves a raise when we are telling everyone else to hold the 
line.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Referring to the Ernst Young report he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However the report recommended an increase in pay for members of 
Parliament. I would be more than happy, if that happened, to see the pensions 
done away with and work within an RRSP program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was a Liberal member speaking and another Reform 
suggestion. Another Liberal copies Reform award might be due 
to the hon. member. He expressed sentiments not unlike those 
expressed by Reform members for many years. I agree with him 
as I agree with the President of the Treasury Board that the issue 
of MPs salaries is a matter to be addressed at some later time. In 
this respect we have all perhaps clouded the issue of the merits 
or demerits of the current pension plan proposals by raising 
salary issues at the same time.
<P>
	To the extent that I have clouded issues by raising such issues 
I must express regret. However, I believe it regrettable the 
President of the Treasury Board would use my comments to 
avoid addressing issues of substance in the pension debate, one 
of the most important debates in the current Parliament.
<P>
	To paraphrase a recent hit by the reunited ``Eagles'', a band 
with which the hon. Liberal House leader is certainly familiar if 
not the President of the Treasury Board, I respectfully ask the 
President of the Treasury Board to get over it, to quit playing his 
petty partisan politics, to get on with the debate of MP pensions, 
and to let us get on to the substance of the issues with respect to 
our pension plan.
<P>
	The Liberals think they have us. They think we will not talk 
about it any more because of what I suggested in debate in the 
House over a week ago. We will not run away from the issue. We 
will address it.
<P>
	For the Liberals who are present and listening to the debate, 
the Canadian public is totally fed up with self-serving MPs 
giving themselves a fat cat, gold plated, three tier trough regular 
for the old folks, the old veterans; trough light for the class of 
1988 and onward and the ones from 1993; and trough stout for 
cabinet ministers who can contribute anything they want down 
the road. A pension plan like that for life is ridiculous.
<P>
	Why will the President of the Treasury Board not introduce 
some ideas about a matching contribution plan, a one for one? 
For every dollar wonderful deserving MPs put into a pension 
plan the government matches by a dollar. Why does the 
government not do that? It cannot do that because it has to be 
better. The Liberals think they are a better class of citizen now 
they are elected, that they deserve three and a half times, and 
that they deserved a six to one plan before that.
<P>
	There is no question the President of the Treasury Board is 
touting a proposal on the basis of sophistry just like the Minister 
of Finance, using clever but misleading arguments to lead to a 
false and wrong conclusion. The Canadian public is fed up with 
the lack of courage the Liberal government is showing and the 
lack of integrity when it promised integrity in the red book. How 
does it show integrity for the Liberals to talk about a proposal of 
another member and call it a salary increase when all we are 
talking about is looking at the pension plan which is too 
generous.
<P>
	The number one objective of my Reform colleagues in the 
House and I is to kill the Cadillac pension plan. The government 
is not interested in it. The Liberals think they deserve more. 
They think they desperately have to save Sheila, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, so that she could get if she were to leave next 
month $2.7 million. They have to protect Mr. Boudria, the man 
who worked-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am quite 
prepared to understand that in the enthusiasm of debate one 
member's name might slip but when another is used it becomes a 
little suspicious. I caution members to refer to one another by 
riding or by ministerial portfolio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said our objective is to kill the 
MP pension plan because it is too generous, too extravagant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is illegal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is illegal in the private sector as well. The 
Liberals want to protect $2.7 million for the Deputy Prime 
Minister and $2.2 million for the chief government whip. These 
are the millionaires, including the Minister for Human 
Resources Development. The minister of public works will get 
$3 million; the minister of immigration, $3 million; and the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood, $1 million. He has a good 
proposal for tax reform but the government is more interested in 
its self-serving MP pension plan than it is in tax reform. It will 
not even give him the time of day.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12344"> 12344 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	We are against the pension plan for a simple reason. It raises a 
double standard. Why do we as MPs now deserve more and 
better than what is out there in the private sector? Would the 
President of the Treasury Board tell me that? If the Canadian 
public wants MPs to have a pension plan, why not one that is the 
same as the private sector dollar for dollar? Why can MPs 
contribute 9 per cent while in the private sector it is 5 per cent? 
Why not 5 per cent and 5 per cent? Why a full pension at age 55 
when in the private sector 65 years of age qualifies and if the 
pension is taken before that age the person receives less?
<P>
	It is just common sense and it will not apply to the House. The 
Liberals will not accept it. All I can say is that I do not 
understand the mentality of the 100-plus Liberal rookies who 
are here. Veteran politicians are laughing all the way to the bank 
because they received their six to one. It was backdated to 1988 
to make sure the member for Beaver River had the option to opt 
out. We have the option to opt out. In 1997, if there is an 
election, the new Reformers who come here will not have the 
option to opt out. That is hypocritical. That is something the 
Canadian public will not forget. I am frustrated to no end. When 
these people were in opposition they indicated that the 
Conservative government lacked integrity and lacked morals.
<P>
	I am really starting to wonder if the government is interested 
in the best interests of the Canadian public. It has an opportunity 
like the Reform Party to opt out of the Cadillac pension plan. 
The rookies have an opportunity to stuff it in the faces of the 
veterans and say: ``No, you are not going to catch us''. If they do 
not opt out, I am very confident the Canadian public will vote 
them out. I think that is what will happen.
<P>
	In summary, these people were elected to restore integrity as 
promised in the red book. By trying to rush debate on the issue 
through the House without allowing time for proper debate and 
without allowing the hon. member for Calgary West to speak 
first today, they are trying to deny an opportunity to allow us to 
detail fully what they are trying to foist and hoist upon the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to address this bizarre piece of legislation, Bill C-85. 
I want to paint a bit of a picture for people.
<P>
	If someone told an ordinary Canadian citizen that he had a 
great business proposition, that for every dollar put into an 
investment he would get back $3.50, he would say that it was 
amazing and great. He would want to do it. Not only that. It 
would be guaranteed by the Government of Canada. We are not 
talking about 10 per cent, 8 per cent or 5 per cent on a Canada 
savings bond. We are talking about a 350 per cent return on 
investment.
<P>
	The only problem is that it is not available to the average 
Canadian citizen. It is only available to members of Parliament. 
It is disgusting. It is the height of hypocrisy. My hon. friend 
from Macleod said: ``They were not hypocrites but hypo-grits 
when they proposed this''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I thought it was a very good line. I give 
accolades to the member for Macleod.
<P>
	Apart from the puns, Bill C-85 has a very serious side. That is 
what concerns me. Bill C-85 is way out of step on several 
counts. I want to talk about those for a moment and the faulty 
premise on which this bill is built.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Two years ago when I was knocking on doors in my 
constituency, in Brooks, Taber and Medicine Hat-and 
Medicine Hat in particular because it is a retirement town-one 
of the topics which people talked about was that they were sick 
and tired of the MP pension plan.
<P>
	They did not say: ``We are sick of the aspect which says that 
taxpayers kick in $6 and MPs kick in one''. They said: ``We are 
sick of the double standard''. They did not say that they wanted 
3.5 times instead of 6 times what MPs kick in. They said: ``We 
expect a pension plan like anybody else's, where if the employee 
puts in a dollar maybe the employer will contribute a dollar, but 
nothing richer than that''.
<P>
	I took that to heart. Members of the Reform Party took it to 
heart. However, the government has completely ignored it. It 
has come up with another form of padding its members' pockets 
at the expense of taxpayers. It is crazy. This bill is completely 
out to lunch when it comes to respecting the wishes of the 
taxpayers. We are here to serve the taxpayers, not to serve 
ourselves.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands is sitting over 
there scrambling to defend his trip to the trough. He is 
completely out of step with what Canadians are saying.
<P>
	Another thing that Canadians mentioned to us is the huge 
debt. The debt at that time was $480 billion. It has now rocketed 
up to $550 billion. Surely members have some sympathy for the 
long-suffering taxpayer when they are considering the 
remuneration which they give themselves. However, no 
empathy was shown when the government proposed Bill C-85. 
It is another trip to the trough. It is a minor improvement over 
what the previous government gave to its members, but it is so 
far out of step that it defies logic. It defies description.
<P>
	Medicine Hat to a large extent is a retirement town. In many 
cases its people exist on pensions. They find this debate 
absolutely unbelievable. The government will be talking this 
fall when the finance ministers convene about how to change the 
CPP to make it actuarially sound. The OECD says that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12345"> 12345 </A></B>
<P>
retirement age will have to be pushed to age 79 to make it 
actuarially sound.
<P>
	However, the government is proposing that we have pensions 
which are fully payable at age 55 with contributions from the 
taxpayer which are three and a half times what MPs have to put 
in. People find that absolutely unbelievable. I defy members 
across the way to come to my communities of Medicine Hat, 
Brooks, Taber, Bow Island, Tilley and all the other communities 
and justify this outrageous pension plan.
<P>
	One subject which I wish to address is the whole idea of MPs' 
remuneration. It is well past the time when MPs should be 
allowed to set their own remuneration package. This bill does 
not deal with that. It completely ignores that. MPs and elected 
officials in other jurisdictions are about the only people in the 
country who are allowed to set their own wages and 
remuneration packages.
<P>
	The president of General Motors or a teacher or a business 
person who owns a business cannot set his or her own wage. 
Business people are accountable to customers. They have to pay 
their suppliers. They can draw a wage based on all of that, but at 
the end of the day they have to depend on their customers and 
their employees before they can decide what kind of 
remuneration package they can have.
<P>
	According to the government, MPs are above that. Bill C-85 
makes no mention of it. It suggests that MPs should have a 
remuneration package which is based simply on the whims and 
caprices of the government. It has nothing to do with reality. It is 
an argument entirely in the abstract. The government has no 
perspective at all when it talks about the remuneration package 
or at least the member of Parliament pension plan. It is crazy.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	One of the things that MPs are supposed to do is to talk to their 
constituents on a regular basis so they can find out where their 
constituents stand on these types of issues. It is a fundamental 
responsibility of a member of Parliament. However, none of that 
has been done when it comes to Bill C-85.
<P>
	Instead, the government has decided to eschew the opinions 
of the public. It has said it does not want to hear from the public 
on this. It does not want to find out what the public thinks. What 
it wants to do is set up its own pension plan that is far richer than 
anything that is available in the private sector. If Canadians do 
not like it, that is tough luck because that is what the government 
will do.
<P>
	When we knock on doors people are so cynical about 
politicians they will not listen to the first word we say about 
serious issues. All they believe we are doing is padding our own 
nest. I cannot argue against that. How can we argue against what 
the public is saying when it is absolutely true?
<P>
	It is a well established tradition in this place and the 
government has done nothing to improve on it despite all of its 
promises in the red book. It has failed to restore integrity which 
is important and critical so people will respect and ultimately 
have faith in their government. This is a necessary step so that 
people will willing bring forward ideas for the important 
debates that need to occur so that the government enjoys the 
faith of the people. It is a very important aspect that the 
government has, I guess, intentionally ignored. It has pushed 
ahead with Bill C-85 and is actually now trying to invoke its 
own form of closure by not allowing a free and full debate.
<P>
	The Reform Party has all kinds of concerns with this 
legislation. I want to touch on a fairly technical but still 
important part of it. The government has really tried, in my 
judgment, to deceive people by saying it is going to cut the 
contribution level down from 11 per cent to 9 per cent.
<P>
	However, as my hon. friend from Fraser Valley West pointed 
out, there will not be enough money coming in. Reform MPs are 
opting out. I want to make it very clear that Reform MPs are 
opting out of this heinous plan. However, because of that the 
government is going to end up having to draw on more taxpayer 
dollars to make this thing fly. That is crazy.
<P>
	The government has failed to consult with the people. It is 
padding its own pockets, padding its own nest, looking after 
itself and refusing to go to the people on an issue that is very 
important to them. It is an issue of integrity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
is a rather important debate and I do not believe we have a 
quorum. I only see four Liberals in the House for this important 
debate. It is rather disappointing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the roots of this Chamber stem back to its namesake in 
London, Britain's own House of Commons. Those words 
``House of Commons'' refer to the purpose of this institution; to 
represent the commons or the commoners within government.
<P>
	We carry on that tradition today by representing grassroots 
Canadians from all walks of life. Or do we? It is a question each 
of us should ask before engaging in this debate over MPs' 
pensions. Are we representing the same Canadians who elected 
us to this Chamber?
<P>
	Two years ago Canadians clearly demanded change. After the 
1993 election the once Progressive Conservatives were pushed 
to the backbenches of Canadian history and these Chambers 
greeted two new parties. The party that I am proud to be a 
member of, the Reform Party of Canada, promised to think, 
work and act differently. We started by putting our policies on 
paper. First in the blue book and then economizing by  putting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12346"> 12346 </A></B>
<P>
this on the blue sheet long before the Liberals came out with 
their own red ink book.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	We promised to truly fulfil our role as representatives of the 
people, going against our own party's official positions if 
necessary to represent our local electorate. In contrast, 
Canadians have seen how the Liberals handle MPs who strive to 
represent their own constituents. They are tossed from 
committees and bombarded with veiled threats from their 
leader. May I add, the Canadians I have spoken to have been 
appalled by these actions. They do not want to be ruled by 
Parliament. They want to be heard by Parliament.
<P>
	Reform has also promised to fight for real change in such 
areas as government waste, deficits and debt and the MPs 
pensions. Over the past year I have stood in the House on three 
separate occasions demanding change in the MP pension plan. 
Or as I have come to call it, the MP pension scam. When one 
compares the private sector pension plans with the MPs pension 
scam as I have, it is obvious change is needed.
<P>
	Under current tax laws, contributions to a pension plan cannot 
exceed 20 per cent of a salary, that is for the average Canadian. 
According to the accounting company KPMG Chartered 
Accountants, most private sector corporations spend the 
equivalent of between 13 per cent and 18 per cent of their payroll 
on pension plans. Some are far below these levels.
<P>
	For example, one of Canada's largest telecommunications 
companies is at a mere 10 per cent of their payroll. Yet 
government after government has allowed MPs and Senators to 
skate around these rules, exempting themselves to a level equal 
to 63 per cent of the payroll equivalent. This means that if the 
plan was fully subsidized by MP pay cheques, over two-thirds 
of our income would go into supporting the MP pension plan. 
Even under the new proposals, pensions would be at 57 per cent 
of payroll, well over half. This kind of extravagance only leads 
to contempt among grassroots Canadians.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have spoken out against this sort of 
waste. The language has not been positive. It is has been 
downright unparliamentary. Let me take a moment to quote 
from a few letters and comments I have received.
<P>
	One constituent writes: ``The government has been asking we 
taxpayers to tighten our belt as we struggle to live on less as they 
take in more taxes. It is time for them to set the example in 
restraint. Don't just talk about it, do it''. Is spending seven 
million tax dollars a year on the new pension scam restraint? Is it 
responsible spending in the eyes of average Canadians? Think 
about it.
<P>
	Another quote: ``I think I can speak for most Canadians. We 
are sick of government waste, especially government pensions 
and benefits. It is a total extravagance on the government's part. 
I am 29 years old, my husband is 33, we have three small 
children. My husband works 12 hours a day, six days a week. We 
are sick and tired of the amount of income tax he pays''.
<P>
	An hon. member recently spoke at length on how MPs work: 
``Twenty-four hours a day, sometimes seven days a week''. 
Therefore, MPs deserve this kind of pension. How can we justify 
taking tax dollars for this sort of luxury pension when many of 
our fellow Canadians are barely getting by with no security for 
their future.
<P>
	There are many more letters I could quote from. In one of my 
1994 householders, over one in four respondents spontaneously 
singled out on their own the MP pension plan when asked where 
cuts could be made to put our country's financial house in order. 
That was one in four without prompting.
<P>
	This plan has become a lightning rod for all that is wrong with 
government and drastic change is needed. Sadly, the change 
demanded is one thing the Liberals have left out of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	What surprises me most about this new plan is how little has 
changed between it and the old plan. I received a question and 
answer pamphlet from the President of the Treasury Board, as 
did evey member of this House, and I was shocked at some of the 
responses to the questions asked. Let me quote some. ``Will 
members still need six years of service to qualify for a 
pension?'' The answer: ``Yes. No changes are being made in this 
regard''. ``Will the maximum pension still be 75 per cent of a 
member's best years' sessional indemnity?'' The answer: ``Yes, 
but now it will take members of the House of Commons longer 
to earn their maximum pension''. ``Will the new pensionable 
age affect retired members?'' Answer: ``No.'' In all, it was lots 
of talk but not much walk.
<P>
	There is one change, however, the one time opting out clause. 
By putting this clause in, members now have a choice: either 
accept an outrageous unacceptable pension or none at all. In my 
view, this is a blatantly political move designed to make the 
government look like it is acting when in reality not much has 
changed. In fact, after the next election every new MP will have 
to take the new and improved so-called MP pension scam 
whether they like it or not.
<P>
	The Reform caucus, myself included, view these proposals as 
completely unacceptable, and if they remain as they are it is the 
intention of the Reform Party of Canada to opt out.
<P>
	It is sad to see so few members on the government and Bloc 
sides honouring these same principles. This is not an issue of the 
pocketbook; this is an issue of the heart. This pension issue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12347"> 12347 </A></B>
<P>
points to how we perceive Canada. Is  this a country where we 
express our ideals of hope and prosperity, how our country will 
be now and for our children and grandchildren, or do we just 
grab as much for ourselves as we can while the opportunity is 
here?
<P>
	None of us in the House of Commons came to Ottawa for the 
benefits or for the pay. We came to serve our fellow constituents 
and bring about the kinds of changes needed.
<P>
	As long as we draw a paycheque from the Commons or travel 
on an MP's allowance, we are living off the backs of the 
taxpayers of Canada. Let me repeat that: we are living off the 
backs of the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	Canadians are not saying that MPs do not deserve a salary or 
that we do not deserve a pension. All they ask is that the salaries 
we earn and the pensions we collect be in line with what is in the 
private sector, what they might reasonably expect for 
themselves. This is a call the Liberals have ignored, to their 
shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words about the quality 
of people who come to this place and the quality of people they 
represent.
<P>
	How can the public respect MPs when MPs do not respect 
each other? If there is anything that has come up in this debate in 
the House, it is the haranguing across this floor about MPs and 
their qualities, as if they are a bunch of petty thieves.
<P>
	There have been a lot of good people come into this House. 
Let me tell members that those who are speaking today with 
great purity are not necessarily in that category.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> The Reform Party remarks in the House are 
downgrading public life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I hope I did 
not hear what I thought I heard. I thought I heard the hon. 
member make some remark about thieves and then try to apply it 
to members on this side of the House who had spoken. If that is 
the case, I would ask that the member retract those comments. 
They are absolutely insane and untrue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, I think 
the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster ought to be 
careful after some of the comments we have heard from some of 
his colleagues this morning about pigs to the trough and so on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I will take the time 
to review the blues, to look at the wording and the context of the 
wording. If necessary, I will come back to the House.
<P>
	I have been listening and will continue to listen attentively to 
this debate, which is a very vigorous debate. There is a great deal 
of emotion and some strong views.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that and I thank 
the parliamentary secretary also for his remarks. If the hon. 
member who raised the question had been listening as carefully 
as you had been, he would not have had any need to get up to his 
feet. What I said was that they were talking about MPs in this 
House as if they were petty thieves. I never applied it to anyone.
<P>
	I am only repeating your own words. If you are ashamed of 
them-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Given the nature 
and the strong views of the debate, I continue to intervene for 
members on both sides of the House to please direct all 
comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely correct.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre made reference to the 
chief government whip and called him by name, of course out of 
order, and also made reference to the Deputy Prime Minister of 
Canada and talked about the money they would be making. How 
do you know how much money they would be making on their 
pensions, Mr. Speaker? When it comes down to this, I will 
guarantee you that the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and the Deputy Prime Minister 
of Canada are going to be in this House long after the member 
who uttered that statement is gone and forgotten, and they will 
still be serving Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member was using projected figures, just like the 
citizens' coalition uses projected figures. It is using inflation 
rates, and it does not know what the inflation rates will be in the 
years to come. The same old story that we have heard for years is 
coming out here
<P>
	Where is the decency in all these things? Where is the decency 
from across the way? You do not come to this place, Mr. 
Speaker, just to get a pension. You come to this place because 
you want to serve your country. This whole issue is being used as 
political opportunism.
<P>
	I got a letter the other day asking me to tell these people in the 
Reform Party to get on with the major problems of the country 
instead of always downgrading the public life of this country. 
They do not know what they are here for.
<P>
	Most members who come here are very sincere. Hon. 
members, as I said, do not go into politics to get a pension. If I 
wanted to get a pension I would have stayed out of politics. The 
profession I was in would have paid far more than I will get here. 
I came into this Parliament because I felt I had something to 
offer. I still think I have something to offer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12348"> 12348 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is anything I can do to settle this big quarrel about 
downgrading public life in Canada, I think it is here that we 
should show the public that there is something more to politics 
in this country than hammering one another, being vindictive to 
one another. We should practise some decency on the floor of 
this House with each other. People come here to do something 
useful.
<P>
	It reminds me of the biblical story about the two people who 
go into the temple to pray. One stands there as a sinner and he 
says ``Forgive me, Lord, for the way I have sinned''. Then over 
here you have the publican who was beating his chest and saying 
``Thank God I am not like one of those''. That is the mentality 
and that is the attitude we are hearing from the Reform Party 
today, saying ``Thank God we are not like one of those''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You have it the wrong way around. You do 
not even have your scriptures right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> I have here a good example of the decency. 
This shouting is part of the new conduct they brought to the 
House of Commons. They are sitting over there today screaming 
and shouting at me. Obviously some of these words are getting 
through to them. When they came to Parliament they were going 
to bring decency to this House of Commons.
<P>
	I hope the microphones are sensitive enough to tell the 
Canadian people how these Reform Party members are shouting 
and screaming and disrupting the proceedings of the House. 
That is their new contribution to the decency of this House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for North Vancouver wrote a letter to <I>The 
Hill Times</I> a while ago, saying ``What planet has Hopkins been 
living on?'' I know what planet I have been living on. I know 
where the hon. member for North Vancouver came from, and I 
also have a good idea of where he is going in the life hereafter.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> I have them going again.
<P>
	One of my constituents sent me a day's pay and I felt obligated 
to match that when I gave it to the Minister of Finance for 
Canada. I thanked my constituent for that, but the hon. member 
for North Vancouver wrote a letter saying ``What planet has 
Hopkins been living on?'' As I said, I know what planet I am 
living on, and I appreciate it very much.
<P>
	He said that he has donated 10 per cent of his salary toward the 
deficit. Imagine that. Does he think this is something brand 
new? In come the Reformers and they are going to donate 10 per 
cent of their salary. I can say without any lack of confidence that 
I have given 10 per cent of my salary since day one to various 
organizations, to good organizations, for the good of people who 
are in need. But I am not the publican in the temple who goes out 
on the street corner to say ``I did this, and thank  God I am not 
like one of those''. I do it in my own quiet way and I do it in a 
dignified way.
<P>
	I say to Reform members that if they came here to add some 
decency to Parliament, they might change their attitudes a bit 
and get away from this. They are not the only ones who ever 
thought of doing anything for mankind. My goodness, Mr. 
Speaker, I know that you do a lot for your constituents.
<P>
	The quality of people who come into the House of Commons 
is very high. Those people are here to do something useful and 
they want to do something useful. However, when a debate such 
as this is held and the Reform members come into the House 
saying that they are going to set a new tone for Parliament, they 
are not; they are setting a worse tone for Parliament. Beyond 
that, they are giving the people of Canada no reason whatsoever 
to believe that there is decency in the House. They are giving the 
people of Canada no confidence that the Parliament of Canada is 
working as it should, on their behalf.
<P>
	Let us get on with the real issues of the nation and let us 
practise a little decency on the floor of the House. Only by doing 
that will people realize that there is some decorum in this place. 
The Reform Party has brought anything but decorum to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
difficult act to follow.
<P>
	One thought that occurred to me is that perhaps the hon. 
member should consult with the minister of Indian affairs, who 
has an inside track to a bishop. He often quotes letters from the 
bishop. Maybe the hon. member could get clarification on some 
of the scriptures.
<P>
	It is with some remorse that I stand to debate this issue today. 
That is because I represent the point of view of ordinary 
Canadians who are fed up with the type of thing that has been 
happening with the MPs' pension plan for the last number of 
years. I regret this, because I have a lot of respect for members 
of the House. I believe that all of us, when we decided to run for 
election, did so with high motivation and because we wanted to 
serve our country.
<P>
	I have never been involved politically before. I was an 
ordinary Canadian who dutifully voted, but I had never belonged 
to a political party and I had never participated in an election 
process. It was all new to me. One of the reasons I joined the 
Reform Party, and there were many of them, was because of the 
fact that it was promising integrity in government. It was 
promising integrity, openness, and accountability.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	That appealed to me. When I joined I sent a donation never 
contemplating I would ever run for this office; that came later. I 
was attracted to the party because it believes governments 
should live within their means just like all other businesses and 
all other Canadians. Reformers said back in 1988 in a brochure 
that they  believe MPs should be representing their constituents, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12349"> 12349 </A></B>
<P>
not to be told here how to vote but to represent and to reflect the 
wishes and aspirations of those who elected them.
<P>
	I was also attracted because they indicated a member of 
Parliament should represent and promote the well-being of the 
country and the constituents, not his or her own well-being. 
When I came here and found the pension plan available to 
members of Parliament-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There were a large number of Reformers who listened to what 
the hon. member on the other side of the House had to say. Now 
when a Reformer is speaking we only see three Liberals in the 
House. There are only three members who will listen to this 
speech-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I take up the 
matter of quorum I want to remind colleagues that conventions 
are that reference to the absence of members from either side of 
the House is something we refrain from.
<P>
	Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see a quorum. The hon. 
member for Elk Island.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your encouraging the 
people to hear my words because I do speak them sincerely and 
hope they fall on sympathetic and understanding ears.
<P>
	When I came here I was very sad to see the MP pension plan, 
knowing also the public perception of it as being excessive. 
There were many different terms used to describe it. The words 
obscene and excessive are often used. Being a mathematician I 
did some work on the MP pension plan from a mathematical, 
actuarial point of view. It was with great regret.
<P>
	I am a family man with a wife and children. I am getting old; 
not very old, I am still young and energetic in thought. I am 
approaching that age when I need to think seriously of my 
pension. My wife was always a full time mom and so we have 
always lived on my income. The pension plan I had where I 
worked before accrued at the rate of 2 per cent per year. In terms 
of a possible pension benefit that means when I reach the age of 
65 my deferred pension from my previous institute will give me 
54 per cent of my best years in that place, which means I will get 
a pension of approximately $30,000 per year.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	So there is no question as to whether I am double dipping, I am 
not now receiving a pension. I will be receiving it as a deferred 
pension when I reach age 65. Those are the rules. Had I not come 
here I would have reached my full pensionable age at 61 and I 
would have had 70 per cent by then.
<P>
	However, having left my other employment I no longer am 
able to accrue pension benefits there. I came here and realized 
immediately I could not with integrity face the electors who 
elected me and participate in this pension plan.
<P>
	At the time of our election in the fall of 1993 when I went to do 
all of the book work and fill in all the forms that we had to do as 
new employees of the House, I asked if I could opt out of the 
pension plan. I was told by a very kind person I could not 
because it was controlled by legislation and until the law was 
changed I had no choice.
<P>
	Therefore, against my wishes I was registered into the MPs 
pension plan. I was being forced to pay into the plan 
approximately $590 per month. I do not object to paying $590 
per month as long as I receive a fair pension on retirement, but 
there is a real problem with that pension plan because not only 
do I put in $590 a month but presumably the employers, in our 
case the taxpayers of Canada almost directly, are matching it.
<P>
	What is wrong is this pension plan permits me as a member of 
Parliament to accrue pension benefits at a rate not available to 
other Canadians. The Income Tax Act does not permit the rate of 
accrual even if the person is willing to make those payments into 
a registered pension plan at that rate.
<P>
	However, and this is critical, in the Income Tax Act 
self-employed persons have higher limits for RRSPs. If we as 
members of Parliament were able to get out of the MP pension 
plan and put our investment into an RRSP like other Canadians 
with the same rules and limits we would be able to provide for 
ourselves a pension which would surely be adequate.
<P>
	I have observed most people who serve in the House do so at 
mid-age as opposed to an early age. There are some young 
members here and I commend them for their early entry into the 
parliamentary process. Most already have RRSPs or other 
pension plans started. They will not be dependent totally on 
their earnings from the House of Commons.
<P>
	It seemed to me very unfortunate the pension plan here was 
inadequate because I would like to have finished my 
pensionable years either by staying at my other place of 
employment or by being able to do a comparable program here 
so that the two of them tied together would give me a reasonable 
pension and look after my needs as I enter those years of 
non-productive work, although for me hopefully that will be 
many years hence. That was not available. Hence we began to 
call strongly for the ability to opt out of the plan.
<P>
	I want to address primarily and specifically that aspect of the 
plan. I do not know what words to use because I do not want to be 
unkind. I saw the proposal in Bill C-85 on the retirement 
allowances act for members of Parliament a one time provision 
which states that after it is brought into force all members will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12350"> 12350 </A></B>
<P>
have 60 days in which to indicate their willingness to continue in 
the plan, which is simply a spin on allowing opting out.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I thought this was particularly politically vindictive. There 
are people on this side the House elected by the electors who 
have as much respect for them as every Liberal elected to the 
House. I promise that. Those people are now being told: ``You 
do not have the same rights and benefits as others. We will give 
you back your money and you will have to pay taxes on it''. They 
are basically saying those of us who want to stand on principle 
will pay a very high price.
<P>
	I am not backing down. I am doing this on a matter of 
principle. Frankly, my Reform colleagues and I are taking a 
tremendous economic hit on this. We are doing it on principle 
because it is right. We understand we will receive a little 
interest. Meanwhile members not opting out are telling the 
public their service here, as far as the pension portion is 
concerned, is worth two and half times as much or more.
<P>
	When we calculate this we find if we were to make even 
reasonable assumptions on interest rates and inflation it would 
require an additional deposit of about $2,500 per month per 
member in order to provide the kind of pension these people are 
asking for. Clearly it is a vindictive, very malicious attack on 
those who want to stand on principle. I object strongly.
<P>
	The rules of the House should apply equally to everyone. The 
fault of the government is that it divides people by saying some 
are in this class, some are in that class and some are in another 
class. Consequently there is an increasing amount of rancour 
and bitterness which could be avoided if we were fair with each 
other.
<P>
	I am sorry my time has expired. I would like to speak for 
another half hour given permission. Should I ask for unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will keep my remarks short. I echo the concern 
expressed by my colleague for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.
<P>
	What concerns me most about the debate is it is denigrating 
all of us as members of Parliament. As did the member for Elk 
Island, I ran to become an MP because I wished to serve my 
country. I had idealism and a feeling I could contribute. The 
question of remuneration, be it salary or pensions, was not in my 
mind.
<P>
	However, my colleagues opposite may be interested to know I 
have no pension whatsoever at this time. I would have to get 
re-elected to qualify for any pension.
<P>
	I want to place the debate where I think it belongs. A letter 
was sent to me by a 16-year old from my riding. She comments 
on the debate and feels obviously MPs are basically cheating the 
system. They were all at the trough, to use the expression of the 
member for Medicine Hat, with respect to MPs like me.
<P>
	I resent that because it is an inflammatory remark and gives 
the impression we are not qualified members of Parliament, that 
we are not dedicated to helping fellow Canadians. I will read a 
paragraph because this is where the debate really belongs. It 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have five other sisters and a brother and my dad has no job. About three years 
ago he lost it. He worked at the company for 22 years and now my mom babysits 
an extra five kids to help pay for the groceries. My dad has written thousands of 
resumes and has done about four different jobs but nothing has really stuck.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The issue raised by that child should be the topic of debate 
today. This is what we should be talking about, not denigrating 
politicians, not denigrating members of Parliament. Members of 
Parliament should all be trying to help-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Both 
you and I can see who is not here so I will not mention them but 
we are again short of a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> A quorum is present.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of Parliament in the 
House of Commons should be concentrating on helping 
Canadians like this child whose parents are in need rather then 
engaging in an acrimonious debate that as far as I can see from 
my colleagues opposite is basically an attempt to gain publicity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the issue we are trying to discuss today is important to 
Canadians. As was mentioned earlier by one of my colleagues, it 
is one of the top three or four items listed on correspondence I 
receive from my constituents about abuses of taxpayers trust, 
abuses of taxpayers hard earned tax dollars. They want to see the 
issue discussed and MP pensions properly fixed.
<P>
	It is extremely disappointing that on the government side 
there is no one speaking out in favour of the legislation, talking 
about how proud they are of the legislation, talking about the 
details of the legislation and hoping to convince Canadians that 
the legislative idea has any merit whatsoever.
<P>
	If they were proud of the legislation, if they would go on the 
public record and be counted, I could perhaps believe that they 
actually meant what they were talking about. I do not see that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12351"> 12351 </A></B>
<P>
	Reformer after Reformer gets up and speaks. On the 
government side there are a few words about not talking about it. 
Other than that they just want to plough ahead. If they made 
these comments at a public town hall meeting in my riding 
supporting the MP pension plan, it would be better to have a car 
running and parked behind the stage. By the time they finished 
the speech the tomatoes would start flying and they would be on 
the run. This nonsense from the government side would never 
sell in Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	There are many symbols we are proud of in Canada. We are 
proud of our hockey teams. We are proud of our flag. We had 
reference to the 30th anniversary of our flag recently. We are 
even kind of proud of our winters in the great Canadian north. 
We are proud of our peacekeepers. We like the Calgary 
Stampede. These are positive symbols that Canadians like to 
rally around.
<P>
	However, the MP pension plan is also a symbol. It symbolizes 
waste. It symbolizes why Canadian taxpayers do not trust the 
politicians they put in charge of the public purse. It is symbolic. 
It symbolizes political arrogance that has been inbred after years 
and years of trying to pull the wool over their eyes. They think 
the symbolism of public distrust is somehow okay. It is not okay. 
Canadians in my riding have no stomach for half baked change. I 
will not call it reform. It is an abuse to call it reform.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I sent out a questionnaire in my riding and I would like to give 
some of the results in case members wonder how much support 
there is for the MP pension plan. Most Canadians feel an MP 
pension plan is all right. Eighty-five per cent of the people said 
that there should be an MP pension plan. They do not have a 
problem with that. That does not surprise me. Canadians are 
generous and understand there should be a reasonable pension 
plan.
<P>
	However, listen to the kind of pension plan they consider 
reasonable. In my riding the constituents said that the member 
should be at least 58 years old and have worked at least 15 years 
and that the pension should not be indexed. That is the minimum 
requirement they expect of members of Parliament.
<P>
	What does the half baked change call for? Members still get a 
fully indexed pension after six years of service. They can still 
get 75 per cent of their best earning years. It is still a gold plated, 
feed at the trough pension plan. If I voted in favour of it I would 
be ashamed to go home.
<P>
	There are no speakers on the other side but I cannot believe 
the verbal nonsense they utter. I would love to be invited to any 
Liberal riding in Canada to debate the issue. I will make the trek 
from this place or my place back home to their ridings to debate 
the MP pension plan on the public stage. They would be 
ashamed to issue the same type of guttural nonsense we hear 
from that side in a public forum.
<P>
	Here there is no public to throw tomatoes at them. Here they 
are not answering directly to the voters. That is why they are not 
saying anything. They are not on the public record. They are just 
letting it slide by. They hope we will be quiet so that they can 
slip it through like other pieces of nonsense the Liberals have 
brought forward.
<P>
	There are things other than this wasteful MP pension plan that 
are starting to become symbolic of liberalism. One is the idea 
that they can jump across a huge chasm in two short leaps. It is 
what they did on the budget. They recognized there was a 
problem. They realized that we had to balance the budget. What 
did they do? Instead of taking the aggressive moves necessary to 
get us across the chasm, to give us a game plan to span that 
chasm, they said they would jump halfway across and as soon as 
they started to come down they would try to figure out how to 
make the next jump to get the rest of the way. It is symbolic of 
liberalism. It is a half baked, half hearted attempt.
<P>
	The MP pension plan is probably the most visible and most 
disgusting item. They make a small change, hoping that people 
will consider it to be a real change. They may even pawn it off as 
a reform, which of course it is not, and hope they can cross the 
chasm of MP pension reform in two jumps. They cannot cross a 
chasm in two jumps. They either mean it or they do not. When 
they start to make the jump they had better have in mind whether 
or not they mean it.
<P>
	Time and again I have said there is nothing wrong with an MP 
pension plan. People just want a reasonable plan. They want an 
MP pension plan matching dollar for dollar, one to one, just like 
hundreds of thousands of other pension plans where the 
employer matches one to one. It should not be three or four to 
one. It should not be a special deal for members of Parliament. It 
should be the same deal as everyone else gets.
<P>
	The other day we found out that the mileage members of 
Parliament can claim on their cars is higher than anyone else in 
the private sector can claim or higher than any other government 
employee can claim. Members of Parliament have a special 
mileage rate.
<P>
	I do not mind submitting expenses. By all means it is 
legitimate. I put in my expense form for my mileage, crossed out 
the new rate and put down the old rate. Until Canadian people 
can charge that much I am not going to accept it. However it 
came back stating that I could not do that, that I had to accept the 
new rate.
<P>
	What are they thinking about? Why would we have one set of 
rules for parliamentarians and another set of rules for ordinary 
Canadians? That duplicity, that double standard, has lowered 
Canadians' trust in politicians.

<P>
	It is not what we are saying in the Reform Party. We are 
merely illustrating, highlighting or echoing the concerns of 
people in our constituencies. We are merely pointing them out. 
We are just taking the highlighting pen and showing Canadians 
what the Liberals are doing in case they are interested, and they 
are. That is all we are doing. We are not writing this garbage 
legislation. We did not come up with this kind of half hearted 
proposal. We have come up with an alternative.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River stands to say that she will opt 
out of the program. It is going to cost her $1.5 million. If I wore a 
hat, my hat would be off. I respect someone who stands on 
principles instead of diving into a sea of gravy and keeping 
afloat. I respect the principles she espouses.
<P>
	I issue one more challenge. I will argue the issue with the 
Liberals anywhere they want. I will not be taken up on it. I guess 
it is a cheap thing to promise. In any event I promise I will do it 
if they would like to debate it.
<P>
	I also issue a challenge to the Bloc. All Reform Party 
members are going to opt out of the pension plan because we 
stand on principle and do not swim in gravy. We are going to opt 
out. The Bloc members want to opt out of Canada. My next 
challenge is that I would expect every one of the 53 Bloc 
members of Parliament to opt out of the MP pension plan 
because they do not want to be part of Canada anyway. That is 
the second challenge.
<P>
	First, I will debate anyone over on the other side who wants to 
debate. It is not going to happen but I sure would love to do it. 
Second is an announcement that all MPs from the Reform Party 
will opt out because we stand on principle. Last, I expect every 
member of the Bloc Quebecois to opt out. I would love to see it 
written in the papers. I would like it to happen as soon as 
possible to see if there are any principles over there or whether it 
is another chance to grab the gravy train.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I do 
not believe there is a quorum.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to say a few words about this bill. I would 
like to start by making some comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am really disappointed that colleagues from the Reform 
Party, knowing full well that my colleagues are having lunch, 
would stoop to silly procedural wrangling to embarrass us. On a 
percentage basis they are much less represented than we are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There are only three out of fifty-three here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I see. I am surprised as well that the Reform 
Party did not spend any time talking about what the government 
had promised and what the government had done. The 
government had promised in the red book during the election 
campaign, and it has honoured the promise, to raise the age of 
eligibility. It promised to remove double dipping and it did so. It 
went beyond that. What else did it do? It reduced government 
contributions by 33.3 per cent. That is what it did.
<P>
	It did even more. The accrual rate has been reduced by 20 per 
cent. We have to work 20 per cent longer to get the same amount 
of money. It went beyond even that. It said that it would be 
possible for those who do not want the pension plan not to have 
it. I was really quite surprised that my colleagues from the 
Reform Party failed to mention this. I know why they did not 
mention it. They do not want to be fair. They do not want to deal 
with the facts. They want to exaggerate. They want to attempt to 
excite the passions of people and make them believe they have 
the answer. They do not have the answer. They do not even look 
at the facts.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Let me mention something else I have done in order to assist 
my Reform colleagues. There is a document entitled 
``Commission to Review Allowances of Members of 
Parliament''. My colleagues from the Reform Party like to 
suggest that everyone is young, they will retire young and 
everyone will take home a large pension.
<P>
	If everyone were to retire right now there would be fewer than 
13 per cent of the people eligible for retirement. This means 
there are fewer than 13 per cent who are less than 54 years of 
age.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> One of my colleagues in the Reform Party says 
I am wrong. He should take it up with the commission to review 
allowances of members of Parliament. My colleagues in the 
Reform Party always think we are wrong when we deal with the 
facts from a neutral third party. The commission is not a 
political party trying to take cheap political shots because it has 
no issues or trying to create an issue and going down the tubes. 
This is a neutral third party that is dealing with the facts.
<P>
	It is rather interesting to look at the number of retirees during 
the last decade. Roughly half received retirement allowances. 
The other half did not receive any pension at all. In the 
Parliaments of 1984, 1988 and 1993, that is exactly what 
happened. Do the Reformers mention that? Do they mention that 
roughly half receive no pensions? Of course not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12353"> 12353 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleagues in the Reform Party also like to pretend 
everyone walks out with a huge pension. Do members know that 
over 60 per cent of the 445 people receiving pensions today 
receive a pension that is less than $29,999 a year? They will not 
deal with that. They would rather deal with catcalls and 
emotions. They do not want to deal with the facts.
<P>
	Let me share some other interesting statistics and look at our 
current plan in comparison with other provincial and territorial 
plans. They have a minimum age requirement. For example, in 
Nova Scotia the minimum age is 50. In Ontario it is age and 
years of service which equals 55. In Saskatchewan the minimum 
age is 55. In New Brunswick it is age and years of service which 
equals 60. In Quebec the minimum age is 55. My colleagues all 
know this but Reformers do not want to deal with facts. In 
Newfoundland, the minimum service requirement is two 
elections in five years, Nova Scotia is two elections in five 
years, Ontario is five years, Saskatchewan is one year only and 
Quebec is six years. Is this not interesting?
<P>
	Let us look at the maximum pensionable level. In 
Newfoundland it is 75 per cent, Nova Scotia is 75 per cent and 
Ontario is 75 per cent of as high as a 36-month average. There is 
more.
<P>
	Let us look at the post-retirement adjustment. Does the House 
know that the post-retirement adjustment in New Brunswick is 
indexed to the rise of the CPI?
<P>
	I could share more with members but my colleagues do not 
want to deal with facts. They would rather deal with rhetoric, 
emotion and passion and try to pretend that they would do what 
is right. However, when they were given the opportunity to do 
what is right with the salary cuts only a handful took them. 
When they tried to pretend they were never going to be 
travelling on executive class, of course that did not happen.
<P>
	I have gone beyond the provincial and territorial. I am going 
to go to the international level. We have looked at Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The contribution rate here is 11 per cent. As for the minimum 
age and service requirement, Canadian MPs must have at least 
six years of service; the maximum pensionable level is 75 per 
cent of salary with full indexation to the cost of living.
<P>
	In Australia, the contribution rate is 11.5 per cent, while the 
maximum pensionable level is 75 per cent of salary-the same 
as in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In the United Kingdom, the two Houses have a contribution 
rate of 6 per cent; pensions amount to 67 per cent of final salary 
but are fully indexed to the cost of living.
<P>
	In Belgium, the contribution rate is 7.5 per cent, and the 
minimum age and service requirement is 55 years, or 52 years 
plus 8 years of service. The maximum pension is 75 per cent of 
final salary.
<P>
	In France, the contribution rate is 7.85 per cent, the minimum 
age and service requirement is 55 years, and the maximum 
pensionable level is 84.375 per cent of final salary, indexed to 
the national salary growth rate. And I could go on and on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have proven my point. I have shown clearly that the 
government has gone beyond its two promises to raise the age of 
eligibility, which it has done, and remove double dipping, which 
it has done. It has gone beyond 33.3 per cent less contributions 
from the taxpayers to the pension plan and 20 per cent less take 
home by MPs. Besides, for those who do not want that, they need 
not take it. The government has gone beyond what it has 
promised.
<P>
	In the provincial and territorial scene, the benefits are as good 
or better in a lot of areas. It is the same thing in the international 
scene. The benefits are as good or better in a number of other 
countries.
<P>
	The Reform rhetoric is not based on fact. It is absolute 
nonsense for them to suggest that. They are plummeting in the 
polls and have lost their credibility so they are trying to create an 
issue. That is what they are trying to do.
<P>
	When the leader of the Reform Party went to the press 
conference he referred to the current pension plan as trough and 
to the changes as trough light. I wonder what we need to do with 
respect to the Reform Party's latest suggestion that MPs' 
salaries ought to be increased to $150,000 a year. At a 2 per cent 
accrual rate per year that would give us in excess of what we 
have on pensions as well. Are we supposed to call this trough 
premium plus?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and speak today on Bill C-85, an attempt to 
reform the MP pension plan. Before I do I would like to address 
a couple of comments of the member for St. Boniface who 
attempted to make such an eloquent defence of the indefensible.
<P>
	This really has not been much of a debate. Very few have 
come to defend this so-called reform of the MP pension plan, 
although he did make a feeble effort. He talks about being fair. I 
wonder who we are attempting to be fair to here. I suggest it is 
about time we were fair to the taxpayers who have been paying 
the bill for all of these years for this gold plated pension plan.
<P>
	He also talks about what the provincial governments are doing 
in their pension plans. He forgot to mention the promise of 
Liberal Party in Ontario to scrap its pension plan and put in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12354"> 12354 </A></B>
<P>
something that is more in line with the private sector, as has 
already happened in Alberta and will happen in P.E.I. Those 
provincial  governments have got the message that these gold 
plated pension plans have to go. The federal government has not 
got the message yet.
<P>
	It is obvious from this bill that the members of the 
government still do not understand that what we are talking 
about here is integrity, credibility, and getting a handle on the 
deficit and debt by showing leadership by example.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board said during his opening 
remarks that the pension debate has been discussed here for 10 
years. For the same 10 years it has been cussed in the rest of 
Canada. The voters have been upset with it and have been 
growing more upset. I can assure all members of the government 
that Bill C-85 will not end the discussion or the cussing. It will 
continue because the bill does not address the problems. I can 
assure the House this will be an issue in the next federal election 
because we will be there to make sure it is.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	When we had some limited debate, Liberal comments were 
that the amount of money is small when it is taken in the context 
of the total debt.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Shame. I would like to see that 
statement made to a group of taxpayers. ``Why worry about our 
gold plated pension plan? It is only a little bit of money in the 
whole scheme of things. Surely you do not begrudge us a little 
bit of extra debt''.
<P>
	They talk about what members of Parliament do after they get 
booted out of office. Some of them are unemployable. Based on 
the job they do here I think they should be unemployable. 
Canadian taxpayers should not be funding a lavish lifestyle for 
MPs. I want to hear MPs tell that to the thousands of Canadians 
who are unemployed or under employed because they have lost a 
job through no fault of their own. They were not booted out by 
the voters. I have difficulty finding any great sympathy for MPs.
<P>
	Then I hear some talking about the great sacrifice they have 
made to serve the Canadian people. No one held a gun to their 
heads and made them run for office. We sought the nomination. 
We went out and campaigned. Now we hear the rhetoric about 
the great sacrifice they made on behalf of the Canadian people. 
The only members of Parliament who might even have a hint of 
credibility in that area are those who were nominated. The 
nominated candidates of the government may have some 
justification for remarks like that but certainly none of the 
elected members would.
<P>
	The red ink book promised reform and all we have in the bill is 
window dressing. I recall the comments of the former leader of 
the opposition, who is now the Prime Minister, during the 
election campaign. He challenged the government: ``Recall the 
House. We will deal with the pension plan right away''. It was a 
burning issue with the Canadian people. How times change. 
Once elected to office, it is no longer a burning issue. Eighteen 
months later we get around to dealing with the pension plan but 
it all window dressing. It is a minor tune-up when a major 
tune-up is required.
<P>
	The money and perks are not the incentive for members of 
Parliament to run for office. Anyone who is here because of the 
money and the perks is here for the wrong reasons. I suggest 
there are not many members of Parliament on either side of the 
House who are here for that reason.
<P>
	Canadians would agree there must be a pension but it must be 
a fair pension. The Canadian people are fair. They want the 
pension to be adequate and they want fairness to be part of it.
<P>
	With the gold plated pension plan members are staying in 
office because they see the gravy train and they want to get 
aboard. That is the wrong incentive for people here. As a matter 
of fact, it suggests that perhaps we should be looking at the 
possibility of term limitations to remove the carrot.
<P>
	As the Liberals have a habit of doing, we are mixing apples 
and oranges. They have demonstrated a penchant for it in the 
gun control bill. They are mixing the criminals with the law 
abiding. What are we doing with this bill? We are mixing 
pensions with salaries. They are two different issues and should 
be dealt with separately. There is absolutely no basis to combine 
them. We are here talking about pensions and we keep hearing 
about the salaries of hockey players. That has nothing to do with 
the debate today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Ask Silye what he thought about it; $150,000 
salary, that is what he is talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are 
fair, but that fairness is being abused in the bill. All they are 
asking for is fairness. They are prepared to give it, but they are 
not getting it back now.
<P>
	What are Canadians saying about this? No issue has a higher 
profile. Two years ago during my campaign it came up at every 
all candidates meeting, at every door I knocked on. It certainly 
continues to be brought up at every town hall meeting I go to. 
They ask: ``When are you going to do something about that gold 
plated pension plan?'' That is what Canadians want to know and 
they are asking it from coast to coast.
<P>
	Let me quote from a survey by Environics. Eighty-six per 
cent of Canadians say that the MPs pension plan is too generous. 
Ninety-three per cent believe the federal government should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12355"> 12355 </A></B>
<P>
fundamentally reform the plan before cutting government 
spending, including spending on social programs.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Eighty-eight per cent support bringing the plan into line with 
private sector pension plans. Ninety-three per cent believe that 
the value of the MPs pension plan should have the same limit on 
growth as the private sector plans. Ninety-one per cent believe 
that MPs should only begin to collect their pensions at age 65. 
Sixty-five per cent say that MPs pensions should not be indexed 
to inflation.
<P>
	The government had a great opportunity in this bill to restore 
some integrity to this place and it missed it by a country mile. It 
is most unfortunate. Politics have changed in Canada for the 
better. Canadians are no longer going to be dictated to from the 
top down.
<P>
	The old guard who has been here for a number of years has not 
received that message. I was hoping that the 205 new members, 
many of whom are from Ontario, would have understood that the 
Canadian people are not going to take this lying down any more. 
They will stand up and be heard.
<P>
	Let us look at what the consultants said about this MPs 
compensation package. On eligibility Ernst &amp; Young said that it 
should be age 60 and not age 55 as it is in this bill. On pension 
accumulation, they recommended 2 per cent. What do we have 
here? We have double that. We have 4 per cent. On indexing they 
said only to inflation in excess of 3 per cent. What does this bill 
give us? Full indexing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> What did they say about salaries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> The member opposite is 
missing again. He is talking about salaries. We are talking about 
pensions. There is a blockage over there. We have great 
difficulty getting through but believe you me, we are going to 
keep on trying. There may be some hope down the road. It is 
pensions and not salaries we are dealing with.
<P>
	Seventy-eight per cent of the plans in the private sector do not 
have indexing. Why do we have it? Why are we so special?
<P>
	About the contribution rate, Ernst &amp; Young said it should be 
reduced from 11 per cent to 5 per cent. Bill C-85 instead of 
going down to 5 per cent gives us 9 per cent.
<P>
	There is one good part about this bill. That is the opting in 
clause. I am proud to say I will not be opting in and I am also 
proud to say my Reform colleagues will not be opting in. We are 
out of it and I am proud to stand in the House and say this.
<P>
	It will be a major issue in the 1997 election or whenever the 
next federal election is. These members' replacements, and they 
will be replaced, will not appreciate that they were not given the 
opportunity to opt out. They will waste no time in changing the 
plan. I can assure members of that and we will be here to help 
them do exactly that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I recall 
vividly after the election when we first came to this House in 
January 1994. A party which came from the west promised to do 
politics differently. Its members promised to take the moral high 
ground, if you will. They wanted to make this Chamber work 
more effectively. Sadly, after all this time, we know that is not 
the case. I want to talk about that. It is important that Canadians 
who are watching understand the hypocrisy in the House coming 
from the west and that they have a chance to reflect on it.
<P>
	The debate on pensions was introduced as an opposition day 
motion on November 22. At that time, Reform Party whip 
wanted members of Parliament to be paid $12,000 a month. On 
top of that he wanted members of Parliament to have a 5 per cent 
pension contribution matched by the government.
<P>
	I noticed that since the debate has started once again, it is no 
longer $12,000 a month that the whip of the Reform Party wants 
members of Parliament to have. Now it is $150,000 a year which 
is more than $12,000 a month. It is amazing. If we leave it for 
another six months, he will be asking for $200,000. I have 
answered a number of letters about that issue. I have pointed out 
the hypocrisy of that position.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	When I talk about some of the hypocrisies, let me focus on 
some of the things that have been said by Reform Party 
members. They said that they oppose any assistance to political 
parties from public funds, including any refund of candidate or 
party electoral expenses. Guess what the reality is. They have 
taken the refund for 50 per cent of eligible campaign expenses 
estimated to be between $2 million and $3 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> What did you do 
with yours?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> They are doing politics differently, like they 
promised they would. Just listen to them howling in the back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Talk about 
hypocrisy, look in the mirror.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> In their blue sheet the Reform Party states it 
supports the re-examination of MPs' and senators' expense 
allowances, free services, staff privileges and limousines. The 
leader of the Reform Party has a $31,000 annual expense 
account paid for by the Reform Party which is supported by the 
taxpayers of this country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12356"> 12356 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is hard to speak over the howls 
coming from the would-be preachers down to the left.
<P>
	Let us talk about double dipping. The champion double dipper 
sits on the Reform side. Does any Reform Party member stand 
up to denounce it? Does any Reform Party member stand up and 
say: ``No, this is wrong. We will not do it because there is only 
one taxpayer's pocket''? They do not.
<P>
	He served in the provincial legislature and gets a $60,000 a 
year pension and he sits in the House and collects a member of 
Parliament's salary. Surely even Reform Party members can 
understand the hypocrisy of their position.
<P>
	The fact is we had a red book and we made promises in the red 
book. Have we lived up to those promises? My answer is yes. 
Not only did we live up to them, we have gone beyond them. We 
even had some grudging commendation on that from members 
of the Reform Party, including the Reform Party whip.
<P>
	Let me say for myself and my colleagues in the House, and we 
have to say this often, Liberal members of Parliament do not 
believe that a member of Parliament should be paid $150,000 a 
year, unlike the suggestions by the Reform Party whip.
<P>
	The hypocrisy goes beyond just the pension issue. It goes 
back to the early days of this House when members of the 
Reform Party stood up and said they wanted to do politics 
differently. Having watched the House before, they are not 
doing politics differently. They are taking politics to a new low. 
Talk about political opportunism. They would misrepresent the 
workings of this House for pure, selfish, political gain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I know it is 
difficult to keep the relevance rule going, but I think instead of 
the hon. member talking about the Reform Party we should be 
discussing Bill C-85. I would like the member to describe for us 
the wonderful aspects of Bill C-85 and how it solves the 
problems.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe the member for 
Elk Island is correct. The rule with regard to relevancy is one 
that is at the best of times very difficult for the Chair. However, 
certainly his presentation I think was a matter of debate more 
than a point of order.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I expect the Reformers to keep 
interrupting. Of course they would because they do not like to 
deal with the shortcomings of their position and the hypocrisy 
surrounding it.
<P>
	Reformers promised to come to the House and do politics 
differently. They have not done that. I am saddened by it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Talk about the pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> This deals with the hypocrisy of the Reform 
Party position, if the member must know. Doing politics 
differently certainly has not been their long suit, except to take 
us down a few notches in the public perception. Is it working? I 
suggest it is not.
<P>
	It is not working because the Canadian public sees through it. 
The Canadian public sees through that opportunism. When the 
leader of the third party talks about a code of conduct and talks 
against expense allowances and turns around and collects 
$31,000, then the hypocrisy is clearly pointed out.
<P>
	In terms of being up front and straightforward with the 
electorate, we had a campaign. The reforms were spelled out 
during the campaign. This government has gone further than it 
said it would in its red book. I can best characterize members of 
the Reform Party in the House as chicken littles running around 
saying the sky is falling.
<P>
	Reformers would do the same thing with some of the major 
issues facing this country, which can cause our economy a great 
deal of damage. Instead of dealing with the issues that are of 
great importance and impact on the daily lives of Canadians, 
Reformers choose to sidetrack. The Reform Party, instead of 
doing sincerely what is best for Canadians and the House, has 
reduced itself to rhetoric, from reasoned argument to basic, 
simplistic political games. It is not working. Hypocrisy day 
after day becomes very obvious and it shows.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unlike the previous speaker, I will confine my remarks 
to the bill before us. His comments show the obvious lack of 
confidence in his own party's bill.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to address Bill C-85 which deals 
with the issue of MPs pensions. This issue is of great concern to 
myself, the Reform Party and to all Canadians. This plan was 
indefensible even in the good times when Ottawa's vaults were 
overflowing and the public was feeling generous toward its 
politicians. However, in bad times such as we are now 
experiencing, when many Canadians are suffering and the 
government is hard pressed to fund basic programs, the MP 
pension plan amounts to little more than the great Canadian 
ripoff.
<P>
	When I say I know Canadians truly do want the MP pension 
plan reformed, I am speaking for those individuals who live in 
my constituency of Edmonton-Strathcona. I asked my 
constituents for some feedback on this issue in my first 
householder. The results were overwhelmingly in favour of 
pension reform. I cannot help but believe if the Liberals were to 
ask their constituents the same question, they would find the 
same result.
<P>
	Constituents were asked at what age should an outgoing MP 
be able to collect a pension. Seventy-five per cent of my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12357"> 12357 </A></B>
<P>
constituents felt an outgoing MP should not be able to collect 
until after his or her 60th birthday.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The second question asked regarding MP pensions was how 
many years should an MP serve before being eligible for a 
pension. The results again are staggering in favour of pension 
reform. One hundred per cent of respondents said the number of 
years should be no less than eight. Eighty-one per cent felt the 
minimum number of years of service should be no less than 16.
<P>
	Answers to these questions are a far cry from the present 
situation in place today and also a far cry from the pension 
reforms the government has introduced. It is important to 
illustrate a few facts about MP pension plans, as they will 
clearly illustrate why the constituents of 
Edmonton-Strathcona and Canadians as a whole feel there is 
great need for the present pension plan to be reformed.
<P>
	First, pensions are payable immediately upon retirement and 
only after six years of service no matter at what age the MP 
retires or is not re-elected. Second, payments continue even if 
the ex-MP holds another permanent job, which would be 
defined as double dipping.
<P>
	Third, pensions begin at $23,390 per year and increase 5 per 
cent per year of service to a maximum of 75 per cent average 
salary. Fourth, inflation indexing kicks in after age 60 but is 
retroactive to retirement day.
<P>
	Fifth, MPs pay 11 per cent of their base salary into the pension 
fund. The government matches this amount and covers 
shortfalls, an unfunded liability which cost Canadian taxpayers 
nearly $160 million last year.
<P>
	By no means is this list inclusive. There are, however, a few 
items of concern to me. I have stated in the House repeatedly 
that Reformers have come to Ottawa to make a difference. I ran 
for Parliament to serve my constituents. I did not run for a 
pension.
<P>
	The Liberals state in their red ink book: ``A Liberal 
government will reform the pension plan of members of 
Parliament and put an end to double dipping''. Bill C-85 is a 
poor attempt at addressing the issue of pension reform.
<P>
	We have been sitting in the House for over 18 months and we 
are discussing still the pension issue. Obviously it was not as 
important a commitment to the Liberals. It is also interesting to 
note the current Prime Minister challenged the former Prime 
Minister to recall Parliament if she were was truly serious about 
pension reform. This was just before the last election. I quote the 
present Prime Minister: ``Reforms would pass in a day''. It has 
been over 500 days since he became Prime Minister and still no 
reforms have been passed. I find it ironic the only member of the 
House whose benefits are not reduced by this bill is the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Canadians will not tolerate political injustices. The evidence 
lies with the now defunct Conservative Party. We on this side of 
the House know the government has delayed on the issue of 
pension reform. Perhaps it is because the Liberals are concerned 
about having to adapt to another of the Reform Party's policies 
such as they have done in the past on issues such as the Young 
Offenders Act, parole reform, criminal justice reform, debt and 
deficit reduction, and let us not forget immigration.
<P>
	All this is doing nothing but costing the taxpayer more and 
more money each day. As we know, the National Citizens 
Coalition set aside a day this year and called it national trough 
day in which another group of 52 MPs of all political stripes 
became eligible for this outlandish of extravagant pension plan. 
These new members of the trough club could collectively 
receive $53 million if all of these 52 MPs quit today and lived to 
the age of 75, while at the same time the average Canadian 
citizen must work 35 years to accumulate a pension which is not 
nearly as gold plated as this.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	This gold plated MP pension plan should be renamed from 
pension plan to cash for life rip off of the Canadian taxpayer. 
This plan is perhaps one of the federal government's most 
offensive examples of waste. What strikes to the core of the 
issue is we as parliamentarians have to set an example for all 
Canadians and delaying issues such as pension reform is no way 
to lead by example.
<P>
	I can stand in the House and state unequivocally that the 
Reform Party is different. We want to see changes in the pension 
plan; not just superficial changes, substantial changes.
<P>
	These changes would include a pension plan brought in line 
with pension plans offered in the private sector, an end to full 
indexation, postponing eligibility until at least age 60, ensuring 
the MP pension plan is adequately funded by MPs for the 
benefits they will receive so there will be no shortfalls, allow 
MPs the option to opt out of the pension program and allow the 
flexibility to invest in a private pension plan such as an RRSP 
with a maximum contribution in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	Let us now look specifically at what the Liberals have 
introduced. They have decreased the contribution and benefit 
rates, but only marginally. They have raised the minimum age to 
55 for benefit eligibility. I refer to a survey of my riding in 
which 81 per cent of constituents feel the minimum age should 
be 60. The Liberals claim to have ended double dipping and yet 
benefits will continue to grow under the generous inflation 
indexing provisions. They offer an opting out clause but it is a 
one time deal, as coverage will be compulsory for members of 
future Parliaments. The benefits will continue to be fully 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12358"> 12358 </A></B>
<P>
indexed to inflation from the date they retire. This has not 
changed and that is no big surprise to me or to the Reform Party.
<P>
	We must stop this insanity. We must make real changes and 
real reforms to the MP pension plan now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
tell the Reform Party a little story.
<P>
	In 1975 I was elected to the Ontario legislature and served for 
ten years. Because I was self-employed, when I retired I 
assumed it would be a very simple process to pick up the pieces 
where I had left off and re-enter the career I had left. However, I 
discovered it took four years to regenerate the income level I had 
prior to my retirement from public life. I suggest to members of 
the Reform Party that unless they are farmers the transition back 
to private life will not be nearly as simple as it seems. I say that 
with all sincerity. I say that to defend the pension plan and the 
pension reform.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Why do we have a pension plan at all? We could accept the 
$150,000 a year the member for Calgary Centre is proposing. I 
am sure the people of Canada are not ready to embrace that 
concept. I suppose if all members of the House wanted to accept 
that salary and do away with the pension plan entirely I have no 
complaints. We can do it that way.
<P>
	The pension plan was set up to ease the return to private life, 
and also the severance package members get at the end of their 
service. It was done to recognize we are here generally during 
the highest earning years of our life. The longer we are here and 
the older we get, the more difficult it is to resume the practice we 
had before.
<P>
	We could take this right to the extreme. We could return to the 
old ways when members did not get paid at all, no pension. The 
requirement was that one had to be independently wealthy to 
serve or one had to have a patron. I am not sure the people of 
Canada are ready for patronage of that kind again. That is the 
way it was.
<P>
	The idea of a pension plan was to allow people of modest 
means to participate in the life of the country. It was no longer 
then the sole preserve of the elite.
<P>
	Right now there are approximately 600 former members of 
the House. Approximately 400 never qualified for any kind of 
pension whatsoever. They did not serve long enough to qualify. 
The pension is being delivered to approximately 200 former 
members of the House.
<P>
	The Reform Party criticized the plan on one hand and on the 
other hand some of its representatives, at least one for use, said 
do the same thing another way, in spades, $150,000 a year. It is 
interesting but we cannot walk both sides of the street on this 
issue.
<P>
	I am a strong supporter of pension plans for members of 
Parliament for the reasons I have outlined. Whether the package 
is too rich is a matter of debate. We decided it should be 
modified somewhat. We also decided it was essential to preserve 
it. Sooner or later all of us here will not be here any more. All of 
us will face a new reality as we go on to resume our lives or go on 
to new lives.
<P>
	All the populist rhetoric in the world does not allow us to 
escape from that reality. I know it has been very popular to zero 
in on MP perks, as they are called. I have not found any yet but I 
am still looking. It annoys me to no end. The reality is if 
pensions are done away with the next generation of members 
will make a decision based on whether there is security at the 
end of its tenure. If there is limitation on the availability of 
standing for election the quality of governing will decline 
remarkably.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	It was done for a reason. We have taken a lot of brickbats 
because the pension plan exists. I think that is due to a general 
lack of understanding of the reality. There is even a lack of 
understanding that the pension plan as we have it is 
contributory, that we actually contribute a portion of our own 
salaries to the plan.
<P>
	I support the bill we are debating today. I support the changes 
being made. However, I think we should all very seriously 
consider the realities of life and not just the populism that we 
think everyone wants to hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to speak primarily on one aspect of the bill the 
opting out section. However, I cannot begin until I make a 
comment on the speech of the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
	He made it sound as though we would be destitute without the 
pension and that the Reform Party proposes that there should be 
no pension. We have no problem with the concept of a pension, 
only that it should be a pension that is reasonable and fair, given 
the marketplace and given the economic conditions in which 
Canada and Canadian taxpayers find themselves.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface rose in the House and, 
shedding great crocodile tears, informed us of the hardship of 60 
per cent of the MPs who are retired and who have to somehow 
make do on less than $29,900 a year. My heart really goes out to 
them. That is a real hardship, I am sure, given that we are asking 
Canadian taxpayers who make less than that in total income, 
who are trying to raise their families and pay mortgages, pay 
taxes so that we can then-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My 
comments are being interpreted completely inaccurately. I did 
not say that those people were destitute. I pointed out that we 
were being misled into thinking that high pensions-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12359"> 12359 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I must report to the 
House and the member that is not a point of order. Certainly it 
might be a matter of debate before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will clarify that he did not suggest 
they were destitute, but he did seem to shed some tears for their 
situation. Many of those people who are somehow scraping by 
on less than $29,900 a year are in their fifties, in their forties, 
and some are even in their thirties. Perhaps they have found 
themselves a job and they are able to support themselves.
<P>
	Another comment, which involves the specific point that I 
wish to address, which is opting out, was made at the start of this 
whole debate by the chief government whip. The chief 
government whip used the word hypocrisy. I am really surprised 
to hear him use that word, given the hypocrisy on the 
government side over the whole issue of opting out. The opting 
out is the biggest hypocrisy this government has ever dumped on 
the floor of the House. If the Liberals were serious about opting 
out, they would have offered any conditions that could have 
been offered that did not cost the taxpayers money.
<P>
	Opting out means a refund of contributions. This is what they 
are offering. The majority of that refund cannot simply be 
transferred to an RRSP. Contributions paid by MPs are 
specifically earmarked for retirement. During the period of 
contribution MPs are cut off from an RRSP contribution due to 
the fact that they are participating in a registered plan. The total 
amount MPs pay into the government plan is less than the 
amount they would have been allowed to contribute through an 
RRSP if they were not blocked from doing so.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	If the Liberal Party were really interested in saving the 
taxpayers money, it would make opting out a more attractive 
alternative. Why is it not doing this? If opting out were handled 
seriously instead of punitively, the Liberals may find that many 
of their own members would be opting out, and this would 
embarrass the government. They cannot have that. What is 
more, they would run into a situation where suddenly, with so 
many people opting out, they would have a problem justifying 
continuing the old plan for those few members who remain and 
may be forced to give up the lucrative pension for those who are 
looking forward to this high income for life.
<P>
	What could they have done? What is the alternative? One 
alternative is to create a matching RRSP contribution, pure and 
simple: 50 per cent from the MP and 50 per cent from the 
government. The advantage to this is that it is $1 to $1 instead of 
the old $6 to $1, which has only been dropped by half a point in 
the new proposal. Now they have mixed some accounting magic 
and say that given the number of people who drop off, we will 
not count them and we will not count some other things. So they 
came up with some lower numbers. No  matter how they play 
with it, it is still considerably higher than $1 to $1. That $1 to $1 
does not have the potential of any kind of accounting magic 
whatsoever. It is a real and genuine $1 to $1.
<P>
	The other advantage of this is the cost to the taxpayer stops 
when the service to the taxpayer stops. This would be a pure and 
simple matching during the tenure of the MP, stopping as soon 
as they no longer served as an MP.
<P>
	The very minimum the government would offer if they were 
serious about the opting out would be an amendment to the 
Income Tax Act that simply allows the pension contribution 
made by MPs who were opting out to be transferred into an 
RRSP. This is money that was put aside for the specific purpose 
of retirement. This would not involve any matching amounts, 
but would ensure that money MPs have put aside for that 
purpose continued to be held for retirement purposes.
<P>
	Then there is the matter of the future opting out. There is 
none. If this were a serious thing that we should be considering, 
MPs at any time could either decide if they wanted to get into 
whatever the pension plan was at the time of their election, or if 
they found it as distasteful in the future as Reformers find it now 
then they would have the ability to opt out as well. This is not 
being offered. Once again, the Liberals are afraid that if too 
many people start opting out they may be forced to do so as well.
<P>
	The first speaker today, the chief government whip, started 
with the word hypocrisy. That is the word I will end with. It is 
hypocrisy on the part of the government to offer a facade that is 
really not in the interests of taxpayers. It is only in the interests 
of those high income Liberal MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to speak on Bill C-85 because when I ran for 
election in the 1993 campaign the MPs' pension plan was a 
major concern to my constituents in Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	As a Canadian I was angry about the lucrative plan, which is 
an insult to the Canadian taxpayer. I promised when 
campaigning that I would do everything I could to try to change 
the MP pension plan. Today I hope there is someone in 
government who is listening, someone who cares.
<P>
	I know many Liberals are concerned about the plan. I am sure 
there are others in the House besides Reformers who find the 
existing plan repulsive and have difficulty accepting the plan as 
it is.
<P>
	I hope the government will take a long, hard look at the bill 
and reconsider its approach to rush the bill through Parliament, 
recognizing that the better process would be to allow more study 
on the bill and a lengthy debate.
<P>

	Perhaps one major concern here is that members of 
Parliament make the decisions regarding their own 
remuneration. It is way past the time when MPs should set their 
own wages. The public has no input. By sending 52 Reform MPs 
to Ottawa, our constituents, many in the west, were saying 
among other things that they were sick of the obscene pension 
plan and wanted it changed.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Sometimes when politicians come to Ottawa they forget the 
very people they are supposed to represent, the Canadian 
taxpayers. I really wonder how many of the Liberal members of 
Parliament visit regularly with their constituents.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I am sure they do. I am hearing from the 
opposite side that they do. What do they discuss? Surely 
Canadians in the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and the rest of 
Canada are not happy with the MP pension plan. I find it very 
hard to believe that only Reform constituents are concerned 
about this terrible injustice. How did this pension plan get so far 
out of control?
<P>
	Bill C-85 suggests some changes to the existing MP pension 
plan, but are they really constructive changes? The purpose of 
Bill C-85 regarding contribution and benefit rates decreases the 
accrual rate from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. I understand the 
recommendation was 2 per cent. This is still double the rate of 
most private pension plans. It also lowers the rate at which 
individual members contribute to the plan from 11 per cent to 9 
per cent. If Reform MPs opt out, as they plan to do, how will this 
plan be supported?
<P>
	Bill C-85 proposes a very generous age for retirement, 55 
years of age. I started a new career at 55. I am sure that with the 
hardships in today's society many other Canadians are having to 
look for new routes to follow as well. I believe 60 or 65 would be 
more appropriate to discuss as a future MP retirement age with a 
pension.
<P>
	Bill C-85 eliminates double dipping, although we see benefits 
will continue to grow under generous inflation indexing 
provisions. I am concerned about the opting in clause, which 
requires that MPs who wish to be included in the plan indicate 
this within 60 days of the bill receiving royal assent, but further 
that those MPs can never get back into the plan.
<P>
	Reformers are committed to reform, and reform means to 
change things that need to be changed. If Reformers stick with 
determination and commitment to work to change the way 
government legislation reads at this time and if they should be 
successful in finally bringing about a decent pension plan that is 
comparable to the private sector plans, then why would 
Reformers or anyone else disgusted with the present 
government abuse of taxpayers' dollars who had previously 
opted out of this plan not be entitled to receive a more decent 
pension plan?
<P>
	I am not against pension plans. It is my firm belief that 
everyone who works is entitled to a decent pension plan, one that 
in this case should reflect that government is living within its 
means. Members of Parliament should receive pensions that are 
comparable to those that ordinary Canadians receive in the 
private sector and that meet all requirements for registration 
under the Income Tax Act. This bill clearly does not accomplish 
this. Reform has called for the government to bring their 
pensions down to private sector levels. Clearly they have failed 
to do this.
<P>
	Reformers are average people, with families and mortgages. 
They would love to belong to a reasonable pension plan. These 
so-called reductions to the Liberals' pension plan barely make a 
dent in the cost to taxpayers. According to Treasury Board 
officials, most of the savings we will see are actually due to 
actuarial factors, not the government's changes.
<P>
	Taxpayers are still paying over three and a half times as much 
as the individual members are for their pensions, with $3.50 
from the government for every $1 for the Liberal contributor. 
The taxpayer's contribution is still too much. The only thing I 
like about the Liberals' pension scheme is that all MPs have a 
chance to opt out; in other words, to make a statement. They can 
tell the government to leave this money where it belongs: in the 
taxpayers' pockets. That is what all of the Reform MPs are 
doing.
<P>
	Members in the House are in a very privileged position. As I 
have said before, not only do we make laws and budgets that 
affect all Canadians, we also set our own remuneration, our own 
salaries, our own pensions and our own perks. This is a 
responsibility not many people have, and one that must be 
protected from abuse. Herein lies the problem.
<P>
	Perhaps the most disturbing part of all this is the 
government's attempt to hide just how generous their plan really 
is. They tell us in the public accounts how much each member 
spends maintaining their office or travelling and how much their 
salary is, but they will not tell us the cost of their pension. This 
information must be made readily available now and in the 
future. How else can the public judge the fairness of this 
scheme?
<P>
	In an effort to skirt the issue of MPs' pensions in the next 
election, new MPs elected to the 36th Parliament will not be 
allowed to opt out. The Liberals do not seem to realize that until 
substantive reforms are made to this plan, likely by a Reform 
government, it will continue to be an election issue. The 
government professes to have brought down a tough budget. I do 
not think it was tough enough, certainly not in this area.

<P>
	We cannot keep spending money we do not have. The interest 
payments are killing our jobs and our economy. Watching the 
government cut the benefits other Canadians get and raise taxes 
on necessities like gasoline and utilities, so far it appears the 
only thing the budget has been tough on are taxpayers' wallets. 
It is time to admit we cannot afford to pay millions of dollars in 
retirement benefits to politicians
<P>
	I remind all members how privileged a position we hold. It is a 
position of trust. Not only do we make decisions that affect all 
Canadians, we also establish our own remuneration. Not many 
people have this power and responsibility. We must guard 
against its abuse.
<P>
	The best protection against abuse would be the introduction of 
citizen based powers like initiative, referendum and recall. In 
the absence of these measures it is a pretty clear indication this 
power is being misused when 52 members feel they must opt out 
of the government's pension plan on principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has demonstrated once again it lacks 
the will to get the job done. It cannot balance the budget. It does 
not understand Canadians want concrete and not imaginary 
changes to the justice system and it has failed to introduce real 
MP pension reform. Canadians are tired of making sacrifices, 
tightening their belts and watching the government squander 
their tax dollars.
<P>
	We saw what happened after the government failed to bring in 
a tough budget. Moody's downgraded our credit rating when it 
became clear the government is not committed to eliminating 
the deficit. Likewise, these cosmetic changes to the MP pension 
plan prove the government is not serious about MP pension 
reform either.
<P>
	Canadians have seen the government waste countless dollars 
on study after study, review after review, with no tangible 
results. Bill C-85 is yet another charade with few substantive 
reductions to the extravagant MP pension plan. The government 
knows that due to its lack of hard fiscal policies there will be 
difficult days ahead. It knows if it does not tackle the debt 
Canadians will have fewer social safety nets left at the end of the 
day. Does it care? Obviously not. It is padding its own 
retirement coffers while it ignores a looming financial crisis. 
How serious is it about getting Canadians back to work and 
turning the economy around if it is going to such great lengths to 
protect an exorbitant MP pension plan?
<P>
	With the ever increasing debt, will the Canada pension plan 
survive? With rising debt service payments, will the government 
cut deeper into RRSP savings plans? At the same time as it sets 
ridiculously low targets for tackling the deficit it makes 
taxpayers pay ridiculously high amounts into MP pensions.
<P>
	Young people saving money now may not have enough put 
away to live above the poverty line when they retire. Yet MPs 
will receive fully indexed pensions at age 60, indexed from the 
moment they retire from public office.
<P>
	The government has its priorities screwed up. MPs are here to 
serve Canadians. Canadians are not here to serve the interests of 
MPs. They will not stand for these double standards much 
longer. Canadians will still pay $3.60 for every dollar an MP 
puts into this plan. Why can the government not bring it into line 
with private schemes? Why can it not face reality and realize 
even MPs must tighten their belts?
<P>
	Time and again as we have questioned the Prime Minister 
about excessive MP pensions we have seen him avoid the real 
issues. Time and again we have seen him deflect the discussion 
about retirement plans and begin to talk about MP salaries. 
These are two distinct issues and he knows it. We are discussing 
pensions today, not salaries. I am perfectly willing to discuss 
salaries. Do not confuse an extravagant retirement plan with the 
argument that MPs are underpaid while they hold office.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants to discuss salaries, fine. First he 
can set the wage at what it should be and take away the special 
allowances. Get rid of the tax free allowance and provide an 
equivalent in taxable income. Get rid of the $6,000 travel 
allowance we use to maintain a second residence in Ottawa and 
make sure our income will cover the additional costs we must 
incur. Do not avoid an honest debate on the validity and 
sustainability of the proposed pension plan by throwing up 
smoke and mirrors about the unrelated issue of salaries.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The truth is the government knows this plan is too generous 
and knows the public will not support it if it is debated on its own 
merit.
<P>
	There is a one time opt out clause. Only members of this 35th 
Parliament will ever be able to opt out of the plan. There is a 
significant financial disincentive for the class of `88 to opt out 
because all of the money it has accrued in the pension plan since 
1988 will be returned to its members in one lump sum this tax 
year. Only one-third of it can be rolled into RRSPs or private 
retirement plans and the rest will be taxed this year if they 
choose to opt out.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of how insubstantial the changes 
to the MP retirement plan are, I ask the government why it did 
not consider a mechanism for making some of these changes 
retroactive. Why has the government not included a clause 
which would allow us to buy out the multi-million dollar 
pension packages some of the sitting MPs will be looking at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12362"> 12362 </A></B>
<P>
when they lose their seats in the next election? They will still be 
in their forties but entitled to fully indexed pensions.
<P>
	Is this an admission that spending too long in this place leaves 
one incapable of doing anything else? I notice Reformers are 
opting out and confident of supporting themselves, so perhaps 
this inability to find gainful employment has something to do 
with being tied to traditional parties, reliant on traditional perks 
and privileges.
<P>
	The government does not want MP pensions to come up as an 
election issue next time around, but I have news for the 
government. Until the MP pension plan is brought into line with 
private pension plans it will be an issue at every election. As 
more Canadians realize that despite their best efforts they will 
not have enough to retire on, they will look at retired MPs 
supported by public funds and grow increasingly bitter.
<P>
	Yes, we work long hours in this job. Yes, we frequently work 
seven days a week. Yes, we must make sacrifices and spend time 
away from our families to do our jobs properly, but so do a lot of 
other Canadians. They get paid for the time they put in. They do 
not expect an unrealistic, unsustainable retirement plan as a 
result of their hard work.
<P>
	As a grain farmer I have grown up expecting I will have to 
take responsibility for my own retirement. Farmers know there 
will be good crop years and there will be droughts. We have to 
plan ahead to make sure we can get through the bad years. That 
also means putting money aside for old age.
<P>
	Farmers, like all small business people, do not have a 
company pension to rely on. Small business is the economic 
backbone of the country and the driving force behind new 
employment opportunities, and yet most small businesses 
cannot afford pension plans for their employees and everyone 
must save for their own retirement.
<P>
	It would be nice if all Canadians had a pension plan as lavish 
as that of MPs, but let us be realistic. Why should taxpayers 
support someone so generously just because they held public 
office for six or more years?
<P>
	I never believed other Canadians should be responsible for 
supporting me after age 60 or 65 and I certainly have not 
changed my views since I was elected. MPs are no different than 
other Canadians. We just have a different job. Yes, it carries a lot 
of responsibility but we chose to go into politics.
<P>
	If the government cannot bring the MP pension plan into line 
with private pension plans it is holding MPs up as more 
deserving than other hard working Canadians. I do not believe 
that is the case and that is why I will be opting out.
<P>
	I did not get into politics for the retirement plan. I came here 
to help change things for the better. Maybe that is idealistic of 
me but at least I will be true to my principles. When I look across 
the floor to my hon. colleagues, the vast majority of whom will 
accept this plan, I cannot help but wonder how they can look 
some of their constituents in the eye.
<P>
	In my riding office I receive calls from seniors concerned 
about missing income security cheques. I receive calls from 
people on unemployment looking for work. I receive calls from 
people on disability pensions. These Canadians have a tough 
time making ends meet, even if their cheques are a few days late. 
That is how close to the line they are. Yet the government is 
asking taxpayers to toss almost four times as much as we do into 
our personal retirement funds.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	How can my Liberal colleagues across the way opt into this 
generous pension plan and then turn to help their constituents 
with no shred of shame? I know I could not.
<P>
	If the government had the best interests of Canadians at heart 
it would bring the MP pension plan into line with private 
pension schemes and demonstrate a real commitment to fiscal 
responsibility to ensure all Canadians will be able to retire in 
comfort.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
approach this issue in a slightly different way than my 
colleagues have. I thank the members opposite for providing an 
issue that will guarantee my re-election in Macleod.
<P>
	As I campaigned this was a significant issue. I tried to figure 
out in my community why this had become so symbolic of what 
is wrong with government. I tried to figure out why this was a 
flash point for the public at home for me.
<P>
	I found that during the campaign when the question was asked 
of all the members who were running in my area what they 
thought of the MP pension plan, the incumbent said nothing. The 
Liberal candidate said: ``I will not take the plan''. The NDP 
candidate said: ``I will not take the plan''. I found myself 
aligned with those two individuals.
<P>
	I looked for a different way to say to those potential 
constituents of mine that I will not take the plan. I wrote in 
public a letter to my constituents: ``I, Grant Hill, the Reform 
Party candidate for the Macleod riding, do hereby state that I 
strongly oppose the current MP pension plan. I will not accept 
this pension if I become eligible for it and I will do everything 
that I can do to reform the plan and make it fair''.
<P>
	Then I had the people of my constituency witness it. I went 
around to my public meetings. I am sure members opposite 
would like me to table this document. I am willing to do that.

rise today to congratulate Winnipeg city council for its initiative 
in keeping 1,500 obsolete police revolvers from finding their 
way back on to the streets.
<P>
	The city council was offered $115 per gun as a trade in 
allowance. However, this forward thinking municipal council 
chose to melt down these weapons because the manufacturer 
was to resell them to an American arm's dealer. One can only 
imagine how many of these would fall into the hands of 
irresponsible gun owners and how many tragedies would follow.
<P>
	Because of the actions of this council I am convinced lives 
have been spared. Those who contribute $115 to Winnipeg's 
retire a gun scheme to help offset the lost revenue should also be 
commended.

municipalities to choose. Congratulations, Winnipeg.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week when the House passed the motion by the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, we together affirmed that we regard the 
opinions of grandparents regarding the welfare of their 
grandchildren as important. I hope we assign the same 
importance to their opinions when they speak on the issues of 
the day.
<P>
	This morning a small group of grandparents gathered outside 
the Centre Block to express their views on gun control and Bill 
C-68. In costumes they sang humorous songs in support of gun 
registration which they see as an integral part of civic 
responsibility. It was the Ottawa chapter of the ``Raging 
Grannies'', a nationwide group of grandmothers advocating 
world peace. Its members see our legislation as a logical next 
step in their efforts to ensure a safer social environment for their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	We all understand the special love and dedication 
grandparents have for their grandchildren. We recognized it last 
week. We would do well to heed their advice on all issues which 
affect the welfare of children.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>

	As a mother and grandmother I welcome and support the

<P>
	The tender fruit lands of Ontario delight us with the beauty of 
their blossoms. Its industry, which contributes to our economy, 
is also the source of 15,000 jobs.
<P>
	A severe crisis is facing the industry. Its survival may well 
depend on the implementation of the strategic plan completed 
by the working group on December 19, 1994. Because of 
escalating labour costs, tariff cutbacks under the free trade 
agreement and the deregulation of the industry, growers are 
experiencing heavy ongoing losses.
<P>
	Imports control prices so growers cannot recover cost 
increases from the market and the lands are frozen for 
agricultural purposes.
<P>
	The recommendations contained in the revitalization plan 
may provide workable solutions to the problem.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Labour dismissed out of hand the 
modest constitutional demands of the president of the No camp 
in Quebec, Mr. Daniel Johnson.
<P>
	When asked to comment on Mr. Johnson's remarks that some 
day, Canada would recognize Quebec's national identity, which 
in political terms would translate into new powers, the minister 
answered as follows: ``We will see what that means. This is very 
difficult. Do not ask me to comment. I do not even know what he 
is talking about''.
<P>
	After criticizing the federal government's policies on 
education, health and manpower training, after urging the rest of 
Canada to recognize Quebec as a distinct society, the minister 
has now become the apostle of quiet resignation. Instead of 
representing Quebec in Ottawa, the Minister of Labour willingly 
echoes the federal position in Quebec.

in many ways the healing process will not begin until an ongoing 
public inquiry has done its work and miners' families have 
answers to the most basic questions-why?
<P>
	As a guest in the riding of Central Nova last summer I was 
struck by the enormous sense of community and warmth among 
the people who had to bear this tragedy. The fact that hazards of 
mining are well recognized does not make the tragedy any easier 
to bear.
<P>
	It follows that today our sympathy should be with the miners'

died. We should also recognize the courage of not only those 
who labour far beneath the earth's surface but of those who 
risked their lives in an effort to rescue the survivors of the blast.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our health care 
system is one of Canada's proudest and most envied 
achievements. Every Canadian has a right to receive the care he 
or she needs when sick, regardless of personal circumstances. It 
is an affirmation of Canada's commitment to human dignity.
<P>
	The constituents of Erie were concerned about the future of 
the health care system. Unlike Bob Rae's government, the 
Ontario Liberals have a plan to protect the province's health care 
system.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that today Ontario Liberal Lyn McLeod 
announced her vision of health care for the province, including 
the establishment of a health research and development council, 
a call-in care pilot project, expanded 911 and restoration of 
health care coverage for out of country emergency services.
<P>
	Medicare was introduced and developed by a succession of 
Liberal governments, providing a tangible example of the 
commitment of all Liberals to compassionate public policy.
<P>
	The government also has plans for the well-being of 
Canadians. We will not withdraw from or abandon the health 
care field. We will not accept the notion of a two tier health care 
system, one for the rich and one for the poor, one for the 
advantaged provinces and one for less advantaged provinces.
<P>
	Thanks to the government and the plans of Lyn McLeod's 
Liberals, Erie constituents can put their fears of a Bob Rae 
health care system to rest.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have learned that Ontario NDP Premier Bob Rae is 
campaigning today in my riding of Lambton-Middlesex. I 
imagine Mr. Rae is also continuing with his dialogue of 
misinformation with respect to federal funding for health and 
how this is supposedly resulting in hospital cutbacks in long 
term care and so on.
<P>
	Let me set the record straight. The federal commitment to 
medicare in Canada and in Ontario is as strong as ever. Contrary 
to what Mr. Rae has been spreading, federal EPF health transfers 
to Ontario have been rising over the term of this government. At 
the same time the Ontario government has been cutting the 
amount it spends on health care.
<P>
	By rolling all transfers into one, the Canada health and social 
transfer, the federal government is strengthening its ability to 
enforce the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Liberals do not need to take any lessons from Mr. Rae on 
medicare. After all, Liberals introduced the Canada Health Act 
in 1984. We have always defended strong and reliable funding of 
medicare and we always will.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSFERPAYMENTS">TRANSFER PAYMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in its first budget in February 1994, the federal 
government announced it was cutting an additional $2 billion 
from its contribution to provincial social programs in 1995-96 
and 1996-97. In its second budget, it hit the provinces a second 
time by offloading its deficit in the form of new cuts that will 
total $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Would he 
confirm that according to the distribution formula for the 
Canada social transfer in Bill C-76, the latest budget's 
additional cuts in transfer payments to the provinces will, next 
year alone, result in a shortfall of $650 million for Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, next year, I 
believe the shortfall for Quebec will be about $350 million.
<P>
	In fact, this amount is well below 2 per cent of Quebec's 
revenues. If we consider the cuts imposed on other provinces, 
Quebec has been treated very well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12367"> 12367 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I challenge the minister to deny what I am going to 
say, considering what I just said. Under the item ``transfer 
payments to the provinces'' Quebec's loss, for this year alone, 
will be $650 million. That is what was said, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	And I would ask the Minister of Finance to confirm that over 
the next three years, additional cuts announced in his first two 
budgets will mean, in the case of Quebec, a total shortfall of 
more than $3 billion in funding for health care, post-secondary 
education and social assistance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we have had this 
debate in the House before. I must say the Leader of the 
Opposition is just tossing off figures at random. No decision has 
been made concerning transfer payments for the years after the 
first year in which cuts will be made. It is quite clear that we are 
going to negotiate with the provinces and subsequently reach a 
decision.
<P>
	Now I would like to ask the Leader of the Opposition the 
following question: Is he saying this is the way he wants these 
cuts? That is certainly not how we see it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must say I understand why the Minister of 
Finance is too embarrassed to admit that these figures were 
taken directly from his own budget.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I would refer the minister more specifically 
to page 17 of his budget speech, where he announced that he was 
prepared to fund social assistance the same way the government 
funds transfers for health and post-secondary education, in 
other words, on a per capita basis, as opposed to real need.
<P>
	Consequently, would the Minister of Finance agree that based 
on these criteria, the main victim of the cuts in his latest budget 
will be Quebec, which in 1997-98 will be saddled with 41.7 per 
cent of the cuts or $1.9 billion, and that this is why he refuses to 
discuss these cuts publicly within the framework of a 
federal-provincial conference to be held before the referendum?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, once again, the 
Leader of the Opposition is creating a problem where none 
exists, perhaps because he cannot find enough issues to 
criticize. First of all, I said that I was prepared-and it is my 
intention-to have a federal-provincial conference with my 
counterparts, as soon as all provinces have tabled their budgets. 
The provinces asked us to wait until they had all tabled their 
budgets.
<P>
	Second, the Leader of the Opposition is drawing certain 
conclusions from talks that have yet to be finalized. Yes, we did 
provide overall figures, but it is clear it will depend on the 
outcome of the negotiations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is beyond belief to hear the Leader of the Opposition. Six 
provinces have said that they will have to absorb over 217 per 
cent of the cuts. It is a mathematical impossibility.
<P>
	What amazes me is not that an individual minister of finance 
or premier of a province would fall into that trap, but that the 
Leader of the Opposition would basically say that he has so little 
faith in the capacity of Quebecers to negotiate on their own 
behalf that he would concede the argument beforehand. It is the 
same kind of thing that he has done consistently, that is he has 
conceded that Quebec cannot make it in Confederation. Let me 
tell him as a Quebecer that Quebec can make it in Confederation.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	While the francophone and Acadian communities struggle to 
conserve their rights with exceedingly limited financial 
resources, we discover that, under the 1994-95 budget, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage subsidized the CRB Foundation 
to the tune of $2 million from official language programs in 
order to finance a series of historical vignettes to be broadcast 
on television.
<P>
	How can the minister justify such a substantial grant-$2 
million-to the Bronfman Foundation, which is managed by 
Tom Axworthy, the brother of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, whereas in 1992-93, the last year the public 
accounts recorded a figure, this organization received only 
$200,000, or ten times less?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am the Minister of Canadian Heritage and 
proud to be. I am interested in Canadian heritage. When a group 
is prepared to help put our heritage in a historical context, I 
support it. This Bronfman Foundation project is a magnificent 
one, but clearly of no interest to our colleagues. These vignettes 
have done a lot of good in teaching people about the history of 
Quebec and of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, while the budget of all the organizations receiving 
government support has been significantly cut, are we to 
understand that the more than substantial increase given the

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board is one of the chief 
ministers responsible for fiscal restraint in government. That 
means one of his jobs is to promote the prudent use of taxpayers' 
funds among public servants and the recipients of government 
services.
<P>
	There is no way the minister can do that effectively while at 
the same time promoting and defending an obscenely generous 
pension plan for members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Does the President of the Treasury Board appreciate that for 
him job one in promoting fiscal responsibility is to kill the 
Cadillac MP pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have indicated many times before, the government 
promised during the election campaign that it would deal with 
the issues of double dipping and a minimum age for pension.
<P>
	We have dealt with the commitments, the obligations we have 
made. We have gone beyond that because we recognize this is a 
period of fiscal restraint. It is a period of time we need to get our 
house in order, to get the deficit and the debt down. We have 
reduced the contribution, the members of Parliament 
compensation, by some 33 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister is going to defend the plan he is going to 
have to defend the real numbers.
<P>
	These are the numbers: $2.5 million for the Deputy Prime 
Minister, $3.1 million for the Minister of Health, $3.6 million 
for the minister of public works, $3.9 million for the minister of 
fisheries, $4.5 million for the member for Sherbrooke-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> These are the numbers that the minister should 
admit are indefensible.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board possibly justify 
those numbers to taxpayers or to seniors when the finance 
minister is planning to reduce pensions for ordinary Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party and his entire party, as 
we have seen many times in the past when dealing with 
budgetary issues and pension issues, have a way of extremely 
exaggerating and taking out of context the figures relevant to 
compensation.
<P>
	They sure know how to put forward the Cadillac when it 
comes to increasing the compensation for members. Over a 50 
per cent increase in compensation is what they have suggested 
while the government is reducing it by some 33 per cent. Over a 
130 per cent increase in salaries is what they recommend. That is 
unconscionable.
<P>
	The government does not stand for that. The government 
stands for fiscal restraint.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the principal issue in MP compensation, and everyone 
in the House knows it, is the MP pension plan. What Canadians 
would accept as fair in the plan is one where the government 
matches MP contributions on a one to one basis.
<P>
	What the minister is trying to justify under pressure from the 
Deputy Prime Minister and others is a scheme where taxpayers 
contribute over $3.50 to every $1 that the Liberal fat packers 
contribute.
<P>
	Will the minister do the honourable thing? Will he do the 
prudent thing? Will he do the fiscally responsible thing and 
bring the MP pension plan into line with those available to other 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the standing ovation for me.
<P>
	This exercise is about what is fiscally prudent. That is what 
the government is doing. That is not what the Reform Party is 
doing.
<P>
	The bottom line is what it will cost taxpayers. What we are 
proposing will cost taxpayers less. What they propose will cost 
taxpayers more.

<P>
	At a seminar organized by the Public Policy Forum in March, 
the Deputy Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Jean-Jacques Noreau, opened up to the participants, saying that 
his department's first challenge was to rethink the UI program. 
He even went as far as to state that it might be necessary to 
create a new federal-provincial agency, composed of 
government, business and labour representatives, to administer 
the UI fund.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
his deputy minister's statement, and why does he stubbornly 
refuse to call a meeting of human resources and employment 
ministers right now so that they can discuss this issue?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the present time we are 
looking very carefully at a wide number of proposals that we 
received during the public consultations last fall, the report 
from the House of Commons committee, the special report on 
seasonal work, and the representations we have received from a 
number of businesses, communities and union organizations.
<P>
	We are pulling together all that information to look at what we 
think would be the best form of arrangements for a new 
unemployment insurance program. A number of different 
models are being considered, but no decision has been made yet. 
There has been no policy established. It is now simply a matter 
of putting those different proposals together.
<P>
	As was indicated in the budget speech, we will be presenting a 
new form of proposals some time in the fall. I hope the hon. 
member can restrain her impatience until that time. I think she 
most of all would want us to do the job carefully, with prudence, 
to make sure that everybody's representation is listened to and 
responded to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
minister aware that there has been no federal-provincial 
conference since January 1993, that is to say, since the minister 
has been in charge of this important portfolio, while the 
provinces have been hard hit by the decisions made, especially 
with respect to unemployment insurance?
<P>
	Far from trying to get out of job training, as demanded by all 
stakeholders in Quebec, does the minister not intend mainly to 
make the UI fund bear the costs of training not only the 
unemployed but also welfare recipients?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose various members 
could engage in all kinds of idle speculation and put up their pet 
proposals.
<P>
	If the hon. member is making a representation today that she 
thinks we should be using unemployment insurance money for 
social assistance, we will certainly take that into account. If that 
is something the hon. member feels strongly about, I would hope 
she would have the good grace to write it down carefully and 
give me her arguments and her reasoning. I would be glad to 
receive any proposals the hon. member would like to make.

<P>
	According to an information sheet addressed to the staff of the

set out a series of propositions dealing with the larger issue of 
aging in society.
<P>
	The hon. member, who is a student of that problem and is very

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few years ago CSIS recruited a young man 
by the name of Luke Desilets to spy on the Aryan Nations. 
Unfortunately, since last spring he has accepted the Aryan 
Nations' philosophy and renounced his former ties to CSIS. 
Apparently Luke now spends his time travelling between Aryan 
Nation compounds throughout the United States while his 
parents wonder if their son will ever be normal again.
<P>
	I ask the Solicitor General: Are he and CSIS prepared to take 
any responsibility for the state of this young man's life?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not in a position to confirm the hon. member's 
assertions. In any event, as the hon. member well knows, it is not 
the practice to confirm or deny whether somebody may or may 
not have been a source for CSIS.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians would feel a whole lot 
better and have more confidence in the government if they 
would spend less time using national security to defend their 
mistakes and rather guarded secrets.
<P>
	Charles Scott is a self-styled colonel in the Aryan Nations in 
B.C. Like many of those in the white supremacist movement, he 
found himself often lacking the financial resources to spread his 
message of hate. But once the CSIS source showed up, Scott's 
financial problems appeared to end. It seems that Luke even 
provided Scott with $1,000 so he could attend the Aryan Nations 
congress in Idaho last year.
<P>
	Is this another example of CSIS funding the groups it is 
supposed to be monitoring?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is stating certain assertions that 
appeared in the press as fact. I am not in a position to confirm 
whether or not that is the case. It is not a matter of hiding behind 
national security; it is respecting the law passed by this

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	There is a serious flaw in the Criminal Code. A justice may 
order a suspect or an accused person to undergo a DNA test. 
However, once the test is completed, the results are inadmissible 
in the trial, even in matters of sexual assault or murder.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	In the light of the murder of Tara Manning, would the Minister 
of Justice tell us whether he intends to act diligently and quickly 
introduce amendments to the Criminal Code in order to fill the 
legal void concerning the admissibility of the results of DNA 
tests as evidence?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises 
an important point. I met two weeks ago with the father of Tara 
Manning and spoke to him about the tragedy his family had 
suffered because of her murder and about the need for changes in 
the law to provide, as the hon. member has said, for the 
collection and use of evidence that will help in the detection and 
prosecution of such crimes.
<P>
	We have just completed a consultation with respect to this 
issue. We are reviewing the results now. I can tell the hon. 
member that it is my intention to present legislation in the House 
that will amend the code to provide for the taking of bodily 
samples with a search warrant for the purpose of determining the 
DNA of an accused person and for the creation of data banks 
whereby such samples can be stored and to which resort may be 
made in future investigations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is 
the minister aware that, by delaying such an amendment to the 
Criminal Code until the fall, most likely, he will enable people 
accused of violent crimes to go free for lack of evidence? What 
is the minister waiting for in order to act quickly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not entirely 
right. The courts for the last seven years in Canada have been 
receiving DNA evidence as proof. It has been used by 
authorities to establish the guilt and from time to time the 
innocence of people implicated in alleged crimes.
<P>
	At present, the use of DNA samples is limited to those 
circumstances in which it is found and where the court 
determines that its use is consistent with principles of justice.
<P>
	Our intended changes would broaden the use, both of the 
taking of samples to put it on a regular lawful basis and allowing 
the authorities to stockpile it to have a bank available for 
reference in future investigations.

<P>
	My riding in northern Manitoba suffers from the highest 
unemployment, up to 90 per cent in some communities. The 
services provided by the Canada employment centre in 
Thompson and its satellite offices are absolutely essential.
<P>
	Could the minister assure my constituents that the 
reorganization of his department will not cut human resources 
services in northern Manitoba?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

the very severe unemployment situation in the hon. member's 
riding. It is probably the most serious in the country.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the Pathways budget, which 
provides services to aboriginal and First Nations peoples, has 
been maintained at the same level this year. At the same time we 
are endeavouring to retain the outreach services so that those 
services can be maintained in the remote communities.
<P>
	Let me say something that applies not just to the hon. member 
but to all members. We are reorganizing the department, but I 
made it very clear that the guidelines must be that any reduction 
come from the overhead of the department, not from direct 
services to clients, so that we have much better control and 
discretion of decision at the local level. Decisions will be made 
to tailor programs at the local level and maintain clear 
accessibility for all citizens of Canada so they can get proper 
services to get back to work.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

<P>
	In September 1994, at the 12th conference of the International

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I am happy that IMPA is constantly striving to optimize the 
latest aids to navigation, thus improving safety. Even the most 
modern equipment will not replace the human element, but will 
add to the tools available to the pilot''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the Standing Committee on Transport recommends 
substantially reducing the requirements for pilotage in Canadian 
waters, does the minister intend to convince her colleague at 
Transport to reject the committee's recommendations, which 
increase considerably the risks of an environmental catastrophe 
like that created by the <I>Exxon Valdez</I>?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, obviously, the government will examine the 
recommendations of the Standing Committee on Transport and I 
hope that we will get some suggestions from the people we will 
be consulting with across Canada during the process which has 
already begun in the east.
<P>
	It is regrettable that the hon. member who raised the question 
today did not seize the opportunity to propose suggestions 
which could have been of interest to the committee. He 
preferred instead to raise questions of the kind we just heard, 
which do not really help to resolve the problems with pilotage on 
the St. Lawrence and elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is 
the Minister of Transport aware, does he realize that a reduction 
in pilotage activities will cause a directly proportional increase

Belledune in New Brunswick. Now we find out that in addition 
to the colossal $20 million loan, the expansion project will also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12374"> 12374 </A></B>
<P>
receive an outright grant of $6 million including a grant of $1.5 
million from the Ministry of Transport itself. This expansion 
comes at a time when the New Brunswick ports of Miramichi, 
Bathurst and Dalhousie are on the verge of closing down due to 
overcapacity in east coast ports.
<P>
	Given that no private sector investors have been found for the 
Belledune project and other ports in New Brunswick are capable 
of handling the expanded capacity being planned, why has the 
minister had this sudden $6 million change of heart? Where are 
the so-called sound business decisions he says are so evident?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question put by the hon. member is riddled with 
misstatements. On the basis of what he has said, he does not 
even understand what is happening at Belledune.
<P>
	One thing he did say is that the port of Bathurst, one that he 
says will be affected, is in my constituency. We are aware of the 
need to rationalize ports.
<P>
	The port of Belledune has participation from the province of 
New Brunswick and the municipalities surrounding the port of 
Belledune. We believe it is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to point to other examples anywhere in 
Canada where municipalities, provincial governments, the 
private sector and the federal government are prepared to spend 
money on port expansion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very convenient when the federal government says 
to spend money on this or get nothing at all in what it decides.
<P>
	The minority report produced by the Reform Party on federal 
port reform makes it very clear that subsidies are not the way to 
go in the port industry. They only end up causing excessive 
dependence on the public purse when the people of Atlantic 
Canada are really looking for economic self-sufficiency.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House how Atlantic Canada 
will ever reach economic self-sufficiency if the government 
continues to fund unviable ports like Belledune so that it can 
compete for the revenues of the viable ports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has a very odd way of approaching 
this. He has mentioned the port of Chatham, the port of 
Dalhousie, the port of Bathurst, the port of Belledune. He 
probably knows there are a few other ports in New Brunswick.
<P>
	What we have said as a policy is that in New Brunswick there 
will be two ports, the major port at Saint John which is a very 
important international port and a port at Belledune that was 
built in the late 1950s and early 1960s to handle Brunswick 
Mines which happen to be there. It is there because NB Power 
has a thermal generating plant that happened to be built at 
Belledune.
<P>
	If the hon. member had thought about what he was saying, he 
would understand that rather than have a half a dozen ports that 
need subsidies of all kinds to continue to operate, we will wind 
up in New Brunswick with two viable ports, one at Saint John 
and one at Belledune.

<P>
	Last week the Minister of Transport called some of his

systems a mess. I agree with the minister.
<P>
	There are increasing concerns about the automated weather 
system, the number of layoffs in 26 airports, emergency fire 
response, and the Transport Canada project to install automated 
aircraft and control systems over budget. Surely in the interests 
of public safety the minister should respond to the airlines, the

his government's policy to privatize and automate air navigation 
systems.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the same cup of coffee.
<P>
	The problem with CAATS which was raised by my hon. friend 
last week with respect to the overspending is as a result of the 
system that is in place now. The problem with AWOS is as a 
result of the system that is in now place.
<P>
	If there ever was justification to go to the commercialization 
of the air navigation system where there are the deliverers of the 
service, the users of the service, and the people who pay for the 
service sitting at the table as the operators of ANS, the question 
that was just asked by the hon. member is the best rationale for

AWOS. He will know there are two investigations now of 
crashes where the AWOS is implicated. His department is going 
ahead with the AWOS. I have been to briefings by Transport 
Canada on this system. It is unproven technology.

<P>

CAATS was designed in the current environment. There are

this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I myself did not hear the 
term used. The hon. member in question is here in the House, 
and I will give him the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, the debate in Quebec is 
getting under way, and it is true we have been hearing all kinds 
of comments from the opposition these last few months about 
federalist forces, Liberals, and members lawfully elected in 
Quebec.
<P>
	I admit I did use the term, but not in speaking to the hon. 
member. I agree that in the heat of debate, people say certain 
things. I certainly do apologize for using this term here in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I accept your apologies on behalf of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	I believe there is another point of order. The government 
whip.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I call again to the Speaker's attention an issue that 
occurred today as well as one day last week in the House of 
Commons. It is the rule or the citation of Beauchesne's and the 
customs of this House with regard to anticipating orders of the 
day.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will know that under the heading ``Oral 
Questions'' in Beauchesne's 6th edition, citation 410 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1986 the Speaker put forth further views in light of more recent conditions 
and precedents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was with regard to what could and could not be asked in 
question period. I refer to paragraph (14) of citation 410 which 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questions should not anticipate an Order of the Day although this does not 
apply to the budget process.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12376"> 12376 </A></B>
<P>

<P>
	When members refer to bills that are before the House, unless 
those bills are part of the budget process, they should not be 
raised at question period if they are the subject of the debate that 
day in the House.
<P>
	Not only are we talking about an issue which is listed on 
today's Projected Order of Business as being before the House, 
we are in fact talking about a bill that was the subject of 
discussion in the House only 15 or 20 minutes before it was 
raised by the hon. leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Therefore, it is my submission that not only would it be a 
breach if members raised something which is on today's 
Projected Order of Business, but it is even more true when the 
debate was the subject immediately prior to question period and 
the House is reasonably aware that it will be the debate before 
the House immediately after question period.
<P>
	Therefore, I submit that this kind of question is out of order. I 
ask the Chair to rule it that way in the future.
<P>
	I also want to ask the Speaker about the rule of anticipation 
generally. Citation 512 of Beauchesne's states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The rule against anticipation is that a matter must not be anticipated if it is 
contained in a more effective form of proceeding than the proceeding by which 
it is sought to be anticipated, but it may be anticipated if it is contained in an 
equally or less effective form.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is in reference to a 1936 application of that rule which 
basically states that if there is a more effective method of raising 
something it should not then be anticipated in this way.
<P>
	I want to conclude by suggesting respectfully to the Chair that 
when a subject is discussed in debate immediately prior and 
immediately after question period, to raise it during question 
period under the pretence that it is not anticipating an Order of 
the Day is a flagrant abuse of the customs and traditions of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this matter came up a couple of days ago and we 
responded to the allegation at that time. The question was very 
broadly based. It did not deal specifically with the legislation. 
Today it was obvious that the leader of the Reform Party was 
addressing his question to the minister responsible for the 
Treasury Board in relation to how he justified this on the one 
hand versus what he was doing with the civil service and general 
belt tightening on the other hand.
<P>
	Therefore, it was a very broadly based question purposely 
crafted so it would not be in conflict with the standing orders. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to rule in that respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the submissions made by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster only bolster the point made by the 
chief government whip. The three questions we are saying were 
out of order were directed to the minister  responsible for the bill 
that is being debated in the House all day today.
<P>
	Therefore, for the hon. member to suggest that by somehow 
asking the President of the Treasury Board about his own bill the 
question is in order is utter rubbish. Those questions were out of 
order. It was as plain as plain could be.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	I invite Your Honour when future questions arise concerning 
matters that are before the House for discussion on Orders of the 
Day to apply the strictures contained in Beauchesne, citations 
409 and 410, both of which I quoted to the House in my remarks 
last Thursday when the member for Beaver River did precisely 
the same thing.
<P>
	The citations in Beauchesne are intended to be mandatory 
guidelines directed to the order of question period. If the 
guidelines contained in Beauchesne are not going to be enforced 
and accepted by members, then the only solution is to change the 
standing orders of the House to put mandatory guidelines in 
them that then will be enforced.
<P>
	I do not prefer that option and I am sure you do not, Mr. 
Speaker. There are times when we do not need to have hard and 
fast rules, when it is better to have guidelines which these are. 
They are guidelines. Consistent breaching of guidelines by 
using question period to further the debate on government 
legislation is improper. It has been condemned by Beauchesne. 
It is against the guideline in Beauchesne. It has been condemned 
by previous committees that have helped establish these 
guidelines in consultation with the Speaker.
<P>
	In my submission the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
should be embarrassed that he asked those questions today. I 
invite Your Honour in future to rule such questions out of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is on 
the same point of order.
<P>
	The matter that was raised in question period is about an issue 
that is very topical. The subject matter is of great interest to all 
Canadians. No reference was made to any specific issue that is 
being debated in the House. We cleared this matter with the 
people we are supposed to clear these matters with to get proper 
guidance and proper assurance that we are following the 
procedures.
<P>
	This is nothing more than two bookworms whining and 
complaining about this issue.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to say briefly that after I heard these interventions, it would 
seem to me that they are not being critical of my leader or 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12377"> 12377 </A></B>
<P>
anyone who raised this question, but in fact they are calling your 
judgment into question. I think that is reprehensible.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair takes no offence when points of 
order are raised in the House. I like to get advice from both sides 
so that we can see what is the lay of the land.
<P>
	As to the remark from the hon. member for Beaver River, with 
all respect to her, I want her to know that I take no offence at 
these points of order being raised.
<P>
	When this was raised last week I mentioned to hon. members 
that sometimes we are skirting the rules very closely. At that 
time I asked all hon. members give enough latitude to the Chair 
so we could have the normal give and take that occurs in 
question period.
<P>
	It is true when we are debating a certain bill, I as your Speaker 
listen very closely both to the questions and to the answers. I 
have to wait until a question is asked to know whether I am going 
to make a ruling on it being in order or out of order.
<P>
	I asked hon. members last week to please give your Speaker 
enough latitude to be able to conduct these question and answer 
periods for the benefit of the House. I thank both members of the 
government party for their interventions and all three 
interveners for the Reform Party. What sets questions up, and 
you know this and I know it, is the preamble. I have given all 
latitude to members asking questions and even in the responses I 
have allowed ministers and responders-
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Please colleagues, I am trying to explain this 
for all of us. I give as much latitude as I can so that we can get at 
the facts, whatever they are.
<P>
	If in my opinion a matter does not refer directly to the bill, if I 
feel it is in a general enough area, I will permit the question. I 
caution all hon. members that when we are crafting our 
questions it is incumbent that, if I might say with all respect, the 
Chair should be reasonably comfortable that the question is 
indeed in order. The more your Speaker is pushed to the line, the 
more likely he is to intervene on the questions.
<P>
	I appeal to all hon. members in the crafting of the questions to 
please, if we have a bill being debated on that day, to consider 
that the questions be general enough in nature, which I judged 
them to be today, so that the questions can be asked. If you push 
your Speaker too close to the line, then of course I will 
intervene, as I have in the past.
<P>
	All that to say that the points are well taken on this side. The 
points are well founded. The points made on the other side are 
equally good in the sense that they give a balance to the Chair as 
to where we are going. With your continued support I will see to 
it that the question period is conducted in a civilized manner 
with respect on both sides and all members are carrying out their 
responsibilities in the way they should.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
just arose while we were listening.
<P>
	The whip hollered across: ``You should be ashamed, but then 
again you probably do not know shame''. I ask him to withdraw 
that. Perhaps that would help clean up the level of debate. He 
said it, he knows it. Perhaps you could ask him to withdraw it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I did not hear that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will gladly admit to saying it and I will withdraw 
it, but it is not out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a withdrawal. Remember, tomorrow is 
Wednesday.

ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and on the motion that the question be now put.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has six minutes 
remaining in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reflect 
on the position I took in my town hall meetings. I signed a 
document in front of my constituents saying that I would not 
accept the current MP pension. Those witnesses signed as well. I 
found that to be a different way to handle this issue rather than a 
tired old promise about the MP pension plan.
<P>
	I was lucky enough, and some would not consider it so, to be 
elected to this position. I went to the department of supply and 
services my very first day here and said that I did not want to 
take part in the MP pension plan. I told the young man that I had 
made a promise to my constituents. The MP pension plan was 
not fair and I wanted to withdraw from it. He told me I was crazy, 
that it was a lot of loot. I agreed that it was a lot of loot, but asked 
how I could withdraw. He told me I could not withdraw. I did not 
want to participate so I asked him what I should do. He said that 
the money would be taken from me, but I could sign a document 
saying that I would not participate in the MP pension plan.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12378"> 12378 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	That is what I did. I wrote down that I did not wish to accept 
the MP pension plan and asked that the contribution not be taken 
off my paycheque. The young fellow told me that I was the first 
MP in Canadian history to withdraw from the MP pension plan.
<P>
	I reflected on his comment that I was crazy, that it was a lot of 
loot. Why would a sensible person in my position withdraw from 
the MP pension plan? Am I a bit loony? Am I independently 
wealthy? Can I say this is insignificant to me?
<P>
	In my lifetime I have raised seven children on one income. In 
25 years of practice in medicine I have saved $80,000 toward my 
retirement by putting money into RRSPs. That money is the only 
money I will draw when I retire. I need a pension.
<P>
	I asked my constituents: Do you think that an MP should get a 
pension? Universally they said you bet, but all it needs is to be 
fair. When I asked what they considered to be fair, they simply 
said: ``You put up a buck and we will put up a buck. It goes in the 
pot and when the pot is empty you are done''. That is what 
Reformers are asking for.
<P>
	I ask my Liberal colleagues in their caucus meetings to think 
about the discussion which took place on this issue. New 
members of Parliament faced people on their doorsteps as I did. 
There are 100 brand new Liberals who know they are wrong on 
the MP pension issue.
<P>
	This is not a partisan issue. It is an issue that reflects integrity. 
Why has government lost integrity? I have gone over statements 
that were made over the last 15 years, back to 1976, concerning 
the budget. ``Now that the recovery is well established and 
private spending is rising, it is equally appropriate these record 
deficits should recede''. That was a statement by Donald 
Macdonald.
<P>
	Michael Wilson: ``When the government came to office we 
encountered a debt problem of massive proportions. The buck 
was passed to us. Well, the buck stops here''. On we go to Don 
Mazankowski: ``We will substantially reduce the deficit''. All 
the while the deficit was climbing, going to the ceiling. Finally, 
we get to the government of today which says exactly the same 
thing.
<P>
	Is there integrity in these Chambers? We are told that MPs 
will be eligible for pension at age 55. I got my calculator out and 
calculated the average age of MPs in the House. It is 49.4 years. 
Think of it. We will not have to wait long.
<P>
	I went home and asked the people in my riding, the butcher in 
Pincher Creek, the pharmacist in Blairmore, the grain farmer in 
Vulcan, the housewife in Fort Macleod, the retired doctor in 
Claresholm, the stockman in Nanton, the nurse in High River, 
the barber in Okotoks, the teacher in Bragg Creek, the elder on 
the Siksika Nation: What do you think of the newly reformed 
pension plan. They replied this pension plan is wrong.
<P>
	I started my intervention today by saying I wanted to thank the 
Liberals opposite, and I do. I want to thank them for giving me 
the opportunity of telling my constituents that if I choose, I can 
run in Macleod for the rest of my days on this issue alone. I have 
been given the platform that tells people there is integrity in 
some parts of the House of Commons.
<P>
	As I did for the pension plan when I arrived, I will be 
withdrawing my name from this pension plan, as will my 
colleagues. I wish to say loudly and clearly to the House that I 
would like a fair pension. I would like to be able to look my 
constituents in the eye and say: ``You put up a dollar for me and I 
will put up a dollar which will go toward my retirement''. That is 
fair, that is just, that is equitable, that is proper. I will not take 
this pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In every forum, think of it for the next election. Line up the 
candidates and ask whether they will take the MP pension plan. 
As was said when I campaigned: ``Oh, no''. There is a group who 
will not take this pension plan but will reform it. How will they 
reform it? With 100 more Reformers here, a transmission across 
the floor and then the MP pension plan will be reformed and 
reformed properly.
<P>
	Once again, thanks to Liberal strategists, thanks to senior 
cabinet ministers, thanks to the class of '88, thanks to all those 
who did not listen to the new Liberals, thanks to the old time 
politicians and thanks to the Bloc for making Reformers the only 
individuals in this Parliament with integrity on this issue. Thank 
you very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
questions and comments, I share something in common with the 
previous speaker. Having served more than 15 years in this 
House, the legislation before us does not affect me either. It does 
not affect him because he has not earned a pension. It does not 
affect me because I have already earned one and this law is not 
retroactive and does not take away property and contributions 
we have already acquired.
<P>
	I note with some interest that his constituents have told him 
they will accept a pension plan where the government adds one 
dollar, as the employer I suppose, to every dollar that MPs put 
into the pension plan. I have done some of the calculations.
<P>
	In my own case over 15 years, had the government 
contributed dollar for dollar to my contributions and had we 
been able to earn the kind of interest that is available through 
RRSPs, the accumulated value of those funds at 8 per cent would 
have been more than enough for me to have taken the equivalent 
to what I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12379"> 12379 </A></B>
<P>
am going to be getting if and when I retire at the maximum 
amount forever. When I died my estate would still get the bulk of 
the money.
<P>
	That is with the kind of contributions that were made in the 
past 15 or 16 years. The only difference is that the government 
has not been contributing one dollar each year. Its contributions 
have had to come willy-nilly whenever the fund runs dry.
<P>
	The other factor that most of the public and certainly my 
friends in the Reform Party seem to be missing is that the 
program we were all forced into when we became members a 
long time ago pays for the use of the funds that we have 
contributed. They go essentially to the government to use and 
spend as it chooses. At the end of each year, it allocates 4 per 
cent simple interest for the use of those funds. The funds have 
not been earning market rates of interest. Our pension 
deductions have been used to subsidize the operation of 
government.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We have to pay tax on the 7 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Yes and when we start to collect pension 
afterward, anyone who collects the pension will be paying tax on 
it as the money comes back. When we pay into the RRSP we do 
not pay taxes either and that is the other option available.
<P>
	I understand from the hon. member who just spoke that his 
constituents told him they would accept a pension where the 
member puts in a dollar which is matched by the government 
and is treated like an RRSP. The point I am making to the House 
is had that option been open to older members such as myself 
when we came here, we would have such a large fund 
accumulated that we could take money out at 8 per cent and we 
would be taking a larger pension than we will now be getting 
under this fund.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Our pension contributions have been used to subsidize the 
operations of government, and I think it is not unfair for 
government in those few cases, when those members retire, to 
make up for the fact that it got very cheap money at 4 per cent 
simple interest over all those years of contribution.
<P>
	I think we are saying virtually the same thing. I am in 
agreement with the constituents my hon. friend just mentioned. 
Had we had that option open to us, those of us who have served 
15 or more years would have had a bigger pool of money than 
using the current fund. The proposition he is offering is actually 
a richer form of supplementing people who have served in the 
House of Commons than the old system, and there is leftover 
money in the fund, which becomes the property of the retired 
member and becomes the property of his heirs and successors 
after him.
<P>
	I can understand the proposal that is being put forward by 
members of the Reform Party. It is a very good proposal, 
because it leaves long-term members more money and it leaves 
a fund for their heirs and successors, which the current fund does 
not.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe that the hon. member for 
Mackenzie said he was rising on questions and comments. If he 
did, that would indicate that he thought we were in 20-minute 
speeches. In fact we are in 10-minute speeches, so the House 
will treat his questions or comments as being an intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, being a farmer, I always say that a bin of grain is a bin 
of grain. When I see a pension of $5 million, it is $5 million. It 
amazes me: one member says that if we only put in a dollar we 
get it and another member says that if we put in five or six we 
will get that. What mathematics are correct?
<P>
	I have known a lot of business people and I have known a lot 
of farmers, and for some reason I have not been able to find 
those guys with $5 million pensions. Where are they hiding?
<P>
	It is a pleasure to address this bill. I also like to remind the 
members across the way that during the election campaign one 
of the main issues was that of MP pensions. Canadians clearly 
voiced their opposition to overly generous pensions. They were 
seen as yet another example of the greed and the self-serving 
interests of the government of the day. We heard so much about 
Mr. Beatty's pension during that time, and a few others, and the 
Liberals kept reminding us of those pensions. Now they have all 
of a sudden forgotten about that. Maybe we need another 
election.
<P>
	Even when the Liberals realized that their pensions were 
glorified, they kept harping on them. It reminds me a little of a 
Fordson Major tractor: when you had to start that thing you had 
to really turn the crank, because if it was turned halfway it would 
backfire and break your arm. I think it held the record for broken 
arms.
<P>
	When I looked at the recent Manitoba election, there were at 
least two broken arms on every Liberal. It was the gun 
registration and the pension plan that left them with a little 
toehold of Liberal policy in Manitoba. I would like to emphasize 
that they should remember that taxpayers do have a vote. So far 
we still have that opportunity.
<P>
	The bill establishes a minimum age of 55 for eligibility and it 
eliminates double dipping. Hurray. That is what we wanted. 
That is a good point, but it does not do the whole job. While the 
age limit has been increased, the interest on this well funded 
plan keeps multiplying. When I look at the calculations, I think 
it is something like a 10 per cent decrease if it is calculated out 
to the final end.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12380"> 12380 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	When I look at some of the people and the cuts they have 
taken, especially in western Canada, when I look at the WGTA 
and some of these things, 10 per cent is minimum. I do not know 
how I am supposed to convince my farmer friends, when 48 per 
cent of their income is coming from off farm jobs, that we 
politicians need a $5 million pension. That disturbs me, really.
<P>
	I heard the previous speaker admonish us to be reasonable and 
to address issues the way they should be addressed. We keep 
badgering each other about this pension plan and will not do 
anything about it. That bothers me.
<P>
	A 10 per cent cut over all the time that we debated this issue is 
not enough. When I look at the problems we have in the farm 
community, when I look at the problems we have in the 
undernourished children in our schools and certain places, how 
can I justify this?
<P>
	It is up to us MPs to finally buckle down and make some 
decisions. I was very impressed with the students we have had 
over the last couple of weeks under the forum for young 
Canadians and how well informed these people are, how they 
have started looking at the issues of the day. I was impressed by 
one of the students when she said: ``Mr. Hoeppner, we are 
prepared to take the cuts. We are prepared to take a lower 
standard of living if you somehow give us the opportunity to get 
our feet on the ground to do it.''
<P>
	If I look at the situation today, if we do not make those tough 
decisions and bring that deficit down to zero, these students will 
not have the opportunity to do what they know they should be 
doing. It is up to us to give these students that opportunity. If we 
do not, history will record us as those MPs who did not have the 
willpower, who did not take the opportunity they had to pass on 
the torch to future generations so that they could at least do what 
has to be done.
<P>
	When I look at the past 25 years of government operations and 
see $550 billion passed onto the backs of future generations, I 
am sick when I even think of this pension plan. It is disgusting 
that we have to debate it even, that we cannot take the necessary 
steps to make it honest and to make it accountable. If we do not, 
we will be held accountable. We cannot pass that blame on to 
anybody else. It is imperative that we make this decision, that 
we do not pass on criticism continually.
<P>
	When I heard the hon. member the other day mentioning that 
we as Reformers were now brainwashing teachers and that 
students were writing him letters about this gold plated pension 
plan, I said maybe there is hope. I will take that responsibility 
for having that effect, if we are creating it. It is a must. It is a 
must not because we want to be put on a level playing field, but it 
is a must that we preserve this country. This country is too great 
to let it hit the wall. I have seen countries that have done it, and I 
do not want to have the consequences.
<P>
	When I look today at the Mexican situation, it looked so 
bright just a year ago and then all of a sudden, because of a few 
bad political mistakes, boom, it hit the wall. What is happening 
today? When one looks at Chiapas today, its people are getting 
restless. I hate to think even of what would happen if they start 
revolting.
<P>
	I again urge members in the House to make the decision. Let 
us not fool around. Let us not badger each other. We know that 
$5 million for a pension plan is too much today.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	In the future, some day when we get the country back to the 
prosperity it should have, maybe it is attainable. Let the future 
generations do it because they will have to cope with $5.5 billion 
of debt, which they had absolutely nothing to do with.
<P>
	We should give them that opportunity to use their expertise, to 
use their enthusiasm, and not try to squash that. If we as 
members in this House do not react to their request, we are going 
to be recorded in history as being the ones who squashed their 
incentive, their initiative. I think we deserve to do that much in 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on the motion before us today to move 
this bill one further step along the way.
<P>
	The hon. government whip this morning called for the 
question to be put in order to move this bill on to committee. I 
think that is a wonderful idea. When this bill goes to committee, 
we will be calling witnesses to find out what they think of this 
bill. If we are to call in interested people regarding this bill, 
every taxpayer in the country deserves to be heard with their 
opinion on this bill. Bring them in, bring them all in.
<P>
	The Reform Party would be quite willing in this particular 
situation to approve a travel budget for this committee to go 
right across the country to find out what taxpayers think of this 
bill. All taxpayers have an interest in this bill, not just the ones 
around here, not the special interest groups we normally hear 
from, but the taxpayers, each and every one of them, those who 
have to squeak by and eke out a meagre income and yet pay taxes 
for us, as well the rich and the famous who do not mind paying 
their taxes, but even the small individual Canadians who have to 
be squeezed by Revenue Canada to get that last nickel out of 
them.
<P>
	We have heard how the Minister of National Revenue has said 
that they are going to be aggressive to ensure that tax collection 
policies collect the taxes owing. We expect these people to pay 
the taxes while we sit in the lap of luxury for the rest of lives. 
These are the people we should be hearing from. They want to be 
heard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12381"> 12381 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I think this committee should travel right across 
the country and stop at every little town, village, and city along 
the way to find out if there is a consensus for the government's 
policies it has brought in on this particular bill, if there is a 
consensus in the country to support what it is trying to do. I very 
much doubt it. I do not think there is any consensus whatsoever. 
In fact if there is any consensus it is in total and absolute 
opposition to this bill introduced by the government.
<P>
	I think the motion today is quite appropriate, that we move on 
to the committee stage. Let Canadians speak. Let them be heard. 
We have talked for days in this House on this particular subject. 
There has been acrimony and animosity. Let us find out what 
Canadians, the rank and file, really think about this subject. I am 
quite sure that they support the Reform Party's position, which 
is if you want a pension let it be reasonable.
<P>
	According to the Deputy Prime Minister, we have made such 
great sacrifices. I said before, show me one person in the House 
who has been dragged in here kicking and screaming to serve. I 
do not think there is one, not one. Therefore there is no sacrifice. 
Everyone who sits in this House is here because they want to be 
in the House. That is the reality of it all. It is not the idea that we 
have served so much and we have given so much that we are 
entitled to live in the lap of luxury at the taxpayer's expense for 
the rest of our lives. That is not defensible in this day and age. 
The previous speaker talked about how he would not want this 
wonderful country to hit the wall. Neither would I. We all know 
that is a possibility.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	We are standing here today debating a bill that will make 
legislators rich for the rest of their lives. A few weeks ago we 
debated a budget and looked at the very real consequences and 
possibilities of the country hitting the wall. Future generations 
will ask: ``Where were they when we hit the wall?'' I will tell the 
House where we are. We are debating how we can keep ourselves 
rich.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How we can protect ourselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> How we can protect ourselves so that 
everybody else who has no say in the House except through us 
will have to depend on the decisions made in the House.
<P>
	The economy will rise or fall based on the decisions made in 
the House. We will or will not hit the wall based on the decisions 
made in the House, but we will look after ourselves. We will be 
all right, Jack. They will point the finger at us and say: ``We 
elected you to run the country on our behalf. We wanted 
responsible government. We wanted honest government. We 
wanted a government that would provide jobs for us, education 
for us and a future for our children''. That is why we are here. 
What have we done? We brought in Bill C-85 that will let us be 
rich for the rest of our lives.
<P>
	This brings to mind a famous French queen who said: ``Let 
them eat cake''. We will be eating cake while we expect 
everybody else to get out there to try to find a job that will pay 
them an income so that one bread winner can go out to work and 
the other spouse can stay at home to raise a family. We do not 
even see that in Canadian any more. Jobs of that kind are few and 
far between. Yet there are MPs in the House who expect to retire 
in the lap of luxury and without having to work. Prior to the 
introduction of the bill there was one member who would have 
received $70,000-odd a year. I believe that continues to apply in 
some cases.
<P>
	At age 55, without having to work, they will be able to live the 
rest of their lives in the lap of luxury without having to produce a 
single thing while Canadians will have to work hard, slave hard, 
do without and pay more taxes for us. I cannot justify it. I do not 
think any one of my Reform colleagues could justify it. They 
have spoken one after the other, saying they will not take the 
pension.
<P>
	I will not take the pension. I cannot go back to St. Albert, 
stand before my constituents and say I will opt in, thank you 
very much, I appreciate the money. When they are in my office 
saying that they have no jobs, what am I supposed to say?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Let them eat cake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> No, I cannot say that because my 
responsibility is to lead, to govern and to represent the people of 
St. Albert. I do not think they sent me down here to vote for this 
kind of largess for myself at their expense.
<P>
	The last budget told us that 45,000 civil servants with families 
and children would be laid off. Their careers have come to a full 
stop. Some of them are young and perhaps can get started again. 
Some are middle aged and some are looking at retirement not 
that far away. They say: ``I had a career. I worked hard. I made 
my contribution to the country. I have earned my salary. I have 
made my pension contributions''. The pension they can expect 
is a lot less than half of what we can expect. They made their 
pension contributions and all of a sudden the curtain came down 
and that was the end of it: ``Thank you very much. We do not 
need you any more. You are out on the street and you can look for 
a job''.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Where are the jobs? Where are they? Surely it is the 
responsibility of the House to provide jobs and they are not 
there. There will be 45,000 people with families on UI with their 
self-esteem destroyed and with their careers in tatters and ruins, 
and we are debating Bill C-85 to make ourselves rich.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12382"> 12382 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a very serious problem with Bill C-85. I have a very 
serious problem with members of the government who stand to 
say how greatly we have sacrificed and how much we have given 
to the country. There are tens of thousands of unspoken, 
unnamed Canadians out there who are giving every bit as much, 
even more than we are.
<P>
	The recognition they get is a Canada pension plan that perhaps 
may not even have any money in it to provide any kind of 
pension for them when they retire. We are now talking about 
elevating the age from 65 to 67 while for ourselves it is 55. 
Surely the double standard should cease. That is what we are 
saying. The double standard between those who legislate and 
those who are legislated has to cease. Why do we not start right 
here with Bill C-85, have it withdrawn completely and bring it 
back with a reasonable pension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
very interesting to note that virtually the only people speaking to 
the issue are the people from the Reform Party. It is particularly 
interesting to note because a debate implies there are two sides: 
the good side and the bad side or the up side and the down side. 
In this case it is interesting that virtually none of the Liberal 
members of Parliament are prepared to stand in an attempt to 
defend this pension plan.
<P>
	It is also instructive to take a look at what else is happening in 
the country in legislatures. I think of the B.C. Liberal leader. I 
will quickly read a news release that was put out under his name 
on April 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>B.C. Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell announced today that pensions for 
Members of the Legislature will be eliminated under a B.C. Liberal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Campbell said it's time to put an end to the special pension and tax privileges 
that have traditionally been given to MLAs in British Columbia. ``Elected 
officials should be treated no differently than any other British Columbian when 
it comes to receiving pension benefits from taxpayers. The MLA pension is not 
appropriate for a job that is based on an elected term of five years''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Most people believe MLAs deserve fair and appropriate compensation. To 
ensure that happens an independent commission should be established'', said 
Campbell. ``There should be a single standard for all people of this province 
with MLAs paying the same taxes and having the same choices as other British 
Columbians''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under the current system an MLA can receive a monthly pension if the 
member has served for seven years or more or has served in more than two 
Legislative Assemblies. ``We don't want to penalize people for running for 
public office but we also do not believe there should be special perks''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is interesting because Mr. Campbell is a Liberal. I have 
always felt that a Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal. He spoke of 
the old style Liberal politicians that seem to inhabit this place.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Campbell said that old style politicians set up systems that have isolated them 
from the realities that British Columbians face on a daily basis. ``That's why 
B.C. Liberals say no special pensions and no special tax benefits for MLAs''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I wonder what happens when members like the member for 
Vancouver Quadra or the member for Vancouver Centre or the 
member for Victoria, a cabinet minister, manage to get across 
the mountains from British Columbia. Is there a change in the 
water in Ottawa? Is there a change in the smog in Ottawa? What 
is it that makes the difference for members who come from 
Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia? What happens when 
they arrive in Ottawa that suddenly they seem to be in absolute 
total contradiction to the leader of the B.C. Liberal Party or the 
Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	It is not just British Columbians who seem to have this gross 
failure of understanding, some kind of a short circuit 
somewhere. It would seem as though the Ontario Liberals, 
currently seeking a mandate for their members of the provincial 
Parliament, have seen the light. For some reason it seems to 
completely elude the comprehension of the people who bear the 
Liberal stripe and come to the House.
<P>
	There is a major difference between the federal and Ontario 
Liberal proposals. The difference is a defined contribution plan 
versus a defined benefit plan. These people are calling for a 
defined benefit plan so that the Canadian taxpayer will be on the 
hook and continue to pay and pay and pay for members no matter 
what happens. That is a defined benefit plan.
<P>
	The Ontario Liberals are calling for a defined contribution 
plan, which is precisely what the federal Reform Party is asking 
for. We are simply saying that we should be going to a growing 
industry standard, which is matching dollar for dollar. In a 
defined benefit plan, if the employer and employee 
contributions plus plan investment performance do not match 
the promise made by the employer, the employer has an 
unfunded pension liability.
<P>
	That leads me to members who were in the House in a 
previous Parliament. Some of them are currently in the House. 
Politicians were telling Canadians that there was no problem, 
that their porky pension plan was taken care of. Lo and behold, a 
few years ago Canadians were suddenly told: ``Oops, we made a 
small $110 million mistake. Isn't that too bad? We will make 
sure we are properly funded. We will just take $110 million for 
ourselves from general revenues''.
<P>
	Although that was supposed to have resolved the situation, the 
following year they had to take another number in the tens of 
millions of dollars from the poor, hard working, overburdened, 
much shackled taxpayer. This is absolutely unconscionable.
<P>
	I ask again as I did at the start of my address why it is, if 
federal Liberals are right and we are wrong, that we have 
virtually zero participation by Liberal members of the House in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12383"> 12383 </A></B>
<P>
the issue. Why is it that we have put up tens and tens of speakers 
out of our 52, whereas they have only put up a handful on the 
issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> We are opting out and they are not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That could be. We are opting out and they are 
not. Maybe that says something.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about what is fair for an ordinary 
Canadian to be able to come to the House of Commons. I think of 
myself as a relatively ordinary Canadian with a mortgage and a 
couple of used cars. I live off the salary I achieve through my 
work in the House of Commons. I am not independently 
wealthy. By opting out, the government has seen to it that I and 
the rest of the Reform Party members who are to opt out in good 
conscience will be personally severely disadvantaged 
financially.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It is punitive. All we are asking in very simple terms is a 
defined contribution on the part of the employer, namely the 
people of Canada, a matching of $1 for $1. Instead of that, the 
government is saying: ``Either you come in and share the booty, 
get in on this $3.50 contribution for every $1 that you put in and 
become a millionaire at the expense of Canadian taxpayers or 
you are out without anything. You get no matching funds. You 
get no matching contribution''.
<P>
	I find it exceptionally ironic that members opposite will 
frequently speak up and say that we are taking some kind of 
advantage, that we are trying to take some kind of political gain. 
This is not a case of political gain. This has to do with a 
commitment to the Canadian people on the part of Reform 
politicians that we would listen to them in the same way that the 
Liberal leader in the province of British Columbia and the 
Liberal leader in the province of Ontario have clearly listened to 
the people of their provinces.
<P>
	Justice must be done in this case. Justice is the exposure of 
this obscene plan that the Liberals are trying to perpetrate on the 
people of Canada. Let us take a quick look at how they managed 
to bring the legislation into the House.
<P>
	A couple of Fridays ago there was the Progressive 
Conservative wake in Hull. Knowing that some people would be 
turning up at that thing, the Liberals chose that day to introduce 
their legislation. It was a Friday afternoon. If the Liberals really 
thought this legislation was worthwhile and would be accepted 
by the Canadian people, why would they try to get it into the 
House in the quietest possible manner when there might 
possibly be a diversion across the river?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They are ashamed of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That could be. Maybe they are ashamed of it.
<P>
	Let us look at the events of last Thursday. We came to the 
House to debate. Again, there are up sides and down sides. There 
is good and there is bad. That is what debate is all about.
<P>
	We rose to speak in the debate. One or two Liberals ended up 
speaking rather sheepishly about it. Near the end of the day they 
pulled a bit of a prank. They decided we would be able to debate 
this all night long if we wanted to. They knew full well that what 
they were doing-the people of Canada must understand 
this-was getting the bill into and out of the House so fast it 
would make a lightning bolt look slow. They wanted to slide the 
bill through so quickly that there was no way that anybody 
would see the blur going by.
<P>
	It makes me think of the little mouse that I had under the seat 
of my car one time. I could hear a little rustle when I was driving 
along at night. When I stopped I would still hear the rustling 
going on. I turned on the light and could see a little brown blur. 
Then it would disappear.
<P>
	That is what the Liberals were trying to do with this 
legislation, get it out of the light of the parliamentary channel, 
the light of this process so that Canadians would not realize that 
once again the Liberals had done it to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We are giving you all kinds of time to explain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I will explain it further to the people.
<P>
	The Reform Party found a procedural way around it and the 
whip really went rather ballistic on Thursday night. It was 
something to see.
<P>
	We are exposing the bill to the Canadian people. I for one 
would vote for millions of dollars of travel so that the 
parliamentary committee could take this bill around Canada and 
expose it to Canadians. The government would then be able to 
see what the people of Canada really think of this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not mind 
admitting that on election night in October 1993 my family and I 
were thrilled and proud that I would be coming to this place. 
Now when strangers on aeroplanes ask me the inevitable 
question: ``What do you do?'', I usually tell them, quite 
truthfully, that I am a farmer and a retired engineer. I do not 
ordinarily mention this aspect of my life unless the conversation 
turns to politics.
<P>
	It is not entirely because of the obscene pension plan which 
we are debating today, although that is certainly a major part of 
it. I have stated publicly on many occasions that I will never be a 
party to this daylight robbery, so it is easy to dissociate myself 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12384"> 12384 </A></B>
<P>
from the unrestrained greed which is going to be allowed to 
continue, with minor modifications, if Bill C-85 is passed in its 
present form.
<P>
	It is no great honour to participate in a charade. My colleagues 
and I on both sides of the House know, and the public knows, 
that what we say about Bill C-85 or any other bill is of little 
consequence. A dozen or so people make the decisions and all of 
the debate in the world will not change those decisions.
<P>
	Whenever I hear an articulate and well researched speech in 
this place I think: ``My God, what a waste''. If the argument had 
been presented at a rural municipal council meeting where the 
participants, working essentially without remuneration, 
actually make decisions, the speech would have had great value.
<P>
	I look around me and I see less than a dozen members. We are 
outnumbered by the clerks, the stenographers, the translators 
and the pages who make this place work. Where are the spear 
carriers? Where is the chorus? They are not here because they 
know that their presence is not required. Three times during 
debate on this bill there have been quorum calls. The reason is 
clear.
<P>
	Hon. members on both sides of the House know that it does 
not really matter what we do about it here or what we say about it 
here. Even if government backbenchers and members of the 
opposition were here in great numbers, the ministers, the people 
who we might wish to influence, are almost never here except 
for question period. Then we ask them questions which we know 
will not be answered and the ministers do what is expected of 
them: they do not answer. They and their parliamentary 
secretaries respond like naughty children. The atmosphere of 
this place rapidly degenerates to that of a zoo at feeding time. I 
have to admit that I am as guilty as anyone.
<P>
	Does the role of straight man or straight woman to the inner 
cabinet really merit a pension worth anything from a few 
hundred thousand to millions of dollars? I doubt it. Does it merit 
a pension scheme four times richer than anything available in 
the private sector? I doubt it.
<P>
	The most objectionable features of Bill C-85 have been 
thoroughly explored by my colleagues, but as far as I can recall 
nobody has yet referred to the fact that the bill is silent on the 
question of former members who are dipping into this particular 
goody bag.
<P>
	With the Speaker's indulgence I will read a couple of 
paragraphs from a letter to the editor in last week's <I>Western 
Producer</I> by Mr. Delon Bleakney of Turtleford, Saskatchewan. 
It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think we should deal retroactively with the gold-plated pensions of the MPs 
who voted for them for themselves while systematically bankrupting our 
country over the last 25 years. Somewhere in our civil service there must be 
some financial wizards capable of calculating the contributions (plus interest) 
that our MPs, serving and retired, have made to their pensions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people of Canada might even be generous enough as employers to kick in 
a percentage consistent with private plans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When these calculations are complete, I suggest that we try to borrow enough 
money to issue each of the ``troughees'' with a cheque. (The borrowing shouldn't 
be hard, that is one thing they do excel at.) This cheque can be accompanied by an 
explanation  of the calculations and the advisement ``Here is your pension, you are 
responsible for yourself henceforth''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In this country retroactive legislation to relieve governments 
of contractual obligations or to impose financial obligations on 
citizens is certainly nothing new. The only novelty of my 
proposal is that it would be aimed at politicians instead of the 
public.
<P>
	Saskatchewan did it with the GRIP program. Alberta did it 
years ago in order to tear up royalty agreements. This very 
government did it with the helicopter deal and is now trying to 
do it with the Pearson deal. Our very own Minister of Justice has 
been very busy instituting retroactive regulations to confiscate 
the property of Canadian gun owners without even going 
through the motions of parliamentary democracy. There are 
retroactive orders in council to deprive Canadians of their 
lawfully required property.
<P>
	Defence of the gold plated MP pension plan sullies all of us in 
this place. We should be talking of eliminating them, not 
modifying them. We are all touched by this national scandal 
regardless of the personal stands which we may take in this place 
on this matter.
<P>
	I beg members for the sake of the reputation of us and of this 
place to defeat Bill C-85 so that we can all stand a little 
straighter and walk a little taller.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not supposed to speak in the House 
today. I was not planning to do so but I was touched by a few of 
the arguments of my friends from the Reform Party.
<P>
	One of my friends from the Reform Party said, and I fully 
agree with him, that we the people of the House of Commons are 
getting rich while the poor people in Canada are getting poorer 
every day.
<P>
	First, the goal of the Bloc Quebecois is the sovereignty of 
Quebec. There will be a referendum soon. If we win it, and I 
think we will, all the people from the Bloc will lose their jobs 
and we will have no pension. We are not in the debate for that 
reason.
<P>
	Second, I was also touched by an argument that is often 
brought forward by my friends in the Reform and I fully agree 
with that argument too. Slowly but surely we are hitting the wall 
and it is going to be quite soon.
<P>
	I was reading this morning that a few economists, probably 
Canadian economists, were talking about a possible recession 
not later than the beginning of 1996. I saw a few papers last week 
where a few economists from the United States were talking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12385"> 12385 </A></B>
<P>
about a possible slowdown in the U.S., say in 1997. All these 
things ahead of us are not good news at all.
<P>
	Also we accept the fact that the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> was 
talking of a possible breakdown of Canada from an economical 
point of view. We can look at the budget too. My friends from 
the Reform Party said it many times and I agree with a lot of 
their suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	If we look at the budget we see all the cuts and we very well 
know that despite the billions cut the debt problem will be there 
next year and the year after. We are in a vicious circle and if we 
do not do something, nothing will get us out of this circle.
<P>
	Since the beginning of this Parliament I have been listening to 
the ideas of my friends from the Reform Party. If there is one 
thing I realized throughout all the arguments, I never said it 
before but I will say now, people in the Reform Party came here 
with a certain naive point of view. I say very positively they had 
a new way of seeing things. They wanted to change things in a 
system that has been going on and on forever. We have to have a 
naive point of view to change things.
<P>
	Most people were in a type of profound deception and realized 
today that despite all the good ideas nothing will be changed. Up 
to a certain point I understand their feelings. The Reform Party 
should realize that despite all the good ideas it has, and some are 
effectively good ideas, it will never be able to put them to the 
test because the political situation will not allow it.
<P>
	Perhaps my friends will not like this comment, but the Reform 
Party will never be elected in Quebec. My friends from the 
Reform who were second in many areas in Ontario could very 
well think of winning an election if Quebec were not there.
<P>
	My friends should think seriously about supporting the 
sovereignty of Quebec. Otherwise all the good ideas will stay 
good ideas with no meaning at all because the Reform will never 
be in power to put those ideas to work.
<P>
	I remind my friends we do not want to destroy Canada. We 
fully understand Canada must go through a profound change. 
We think one change has to be a political one. Our friends 
believe and I also believe it also has to be an economic change. 
We are ready to make the first part of the change, a political one, 
to become sovereign, and to take our fair share of the Canadian 
assets and the debt and pay it. Every day we will pay our share of 
the debt and we will go on. Canadians will be able to control 
their country the way they want to and Reform will be able to 
think seriously about getting into power and making the major 
changes it feels it must make. For the moment this is only a 
dream.
<P>
	About three months ago I had a discussion with one of my 
friends from the Reform Party. He told me the only thing Quebec 
wants is more power and more money. My friend is absolutely 
right. What my friend did not seem to understand is that it is the 
federalists in Quebec who that. The sovereignists do not want 
that at all. We do not want more power and more money. We 
want all the power and no money at all. We want to be at home in  
Quebec. We will pay our fair share of the debt and the Reform 
Party will be able to get into power in Canada and make the 
major changes.
<P>
	For the moment this idea may seem strange but it is one to 
think about. I hope my friends will think about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to address the issue today.
<P>
	If one issue has given ordinary Canadians a very sour view of 
politicians it is the grossly over generous MP pension plan. It 
has become a symbol of the elitist mentality that has overtaken 
our politicians when they are entrusted with the strings of the 
public purse.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	It seems when we get there we give people the impression we 
think on a higher level. This MP pension plan has become a 
symbol for that type of elitist mentality. People have become so 
cynical about those who are put in power as their elected 
representatives that they are skeptical that any good thing can 
come out of this place. The cynicism is so widespread they do 
not believe a thing politicians say any longer.
<P>
	When I worked in underdeveloped countries we lived out in 
the rain forest. In our home, besides cockroaches, ants and all 
that other kind of stuff, we had tiny lizards called geckos. My 
wife did not like these things so she ask our son to throw them 
out. If one tries to grab them and is not quick enough and only 
catches their tail, they have the amazing capacity to drop their 
tail. They are not harmed. In one's hand is this wildly wiggling 
tail and the gecko gets away.
<P>
	When I came back to Canada I saw the same thing in our 
political arena. We have an election and when the election is 
done all we are left with is a wildly wiggling tongue. We have 
these politicians who make these promises, their tongues 
wiggling wildly, and they escape to Ottawa. They do their thing 
there. They line their pockets with this over generous MP 
pension plan. The public is outraged at the money being spent on 
this MP pension plan. They think it is a public disgrace.
<P>
	There are some secondary effects to the MP pension plan. 
People are concerned about the millions being paid out through 
the plan. It is a disgrace. It is a plan put in place by the very 
people who will benefit from it. The people here use the 
taxpayers' hard earned money to line their pockets and people 
find that unacceptable.
<P>
	However, there is something else. There are some secondary 
effects to the MP pension plan. The MP pension plan gives 
people the wrong incentive in the performance of their job. The 
plan is totally out of line with what people who are not elected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12386"> 12386 </A></B>
<P>
could realistically expect; a plan so structured that an MP who 
can get re-elected can dip into it. It is structured in a such a way 
that the longer one is here the greater one's benefit so that it 
accrues into the millions of dollars if one can get re-elected for 
several terms.
<P>
	What does that mean? Politicians can come to this place with 
the most honourable of intentions but when they see they will 
make a huge pile of money if they can get re-elected, that they 
can get the equivalent of winning a lottery, they become 
distorted in their vision of the country. They become blurred 
with the dollar signs before their eyes because of the MP pension 
plan. Most people do not realize it is not just the money we 
spend on this, it is the negative spin off effects because of this 
MP pension plan.
<P>
	What is one of the biggest problems before the country today? 
Most people would say it is the economic condition. We have a 
huge debt and deficit. There is a lack of jobs and unemployment 
is way out of line. Our taxes are too high. How did it get that 
way? How did we come to the point at which we have overspent 
to the tune that we have enslaved our children for years to come?
<P>
	Politicians made promises so they could get re-elected. They 
have the incentive built in with the MP pension plan that if they 
can only win the next election maybe things will hang together 
long enough.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Let me propose this. Let us remove this Cadillac pension plan. 
Let us reduce the salary of MPs until they solve our debt and 
deficit problem, until they begin to reduce taxes, until the jobs 
come back into the country.
<P>
	Let us reduce that incentive until it is all fixed. If we were to 
take half of our salary, if we were to do away with the MP 
pension plan until all these problems were fixed overnight we 
would have a wonderful solution to everything ailing us. There 
is no incentive built into the system to make politicians do what 
is right for the country. The incentives are in the reverse.
<P>
	MPs made promises just to get re-elected. They will cater to 
special interest groups and give them promises so they can get 
re-elected. They will raise taxes so they can promise more. They 
will spend more to get votes in their ridings. They will do 
whatever they can to get re-elected and feed at the trough.
<P>
	What is another big problem in the country? I alluded to it 
when I told a little story about the wiggling tail and the wiggling 
tongue. We only have democracy for a very short time every five 
years. Politicians listen to the people only when it is convenient.
<P>
	I see this very clearly in the gun control issue which I have 
been dealing with. Politicians will hide what they are doing. 
They do not even ask the people what they think. Politicians are 
afraid to put democratic reforms in this place so the people will 
have more to say.
<P>
	Why do they not put in referendums? Why do they not allow 
for citizen initiatives? Why do they not allow the recall of an MP 
who does not do their job? It is because those citizens might say: 
``You are putting too much into your own pocket. You are not 
running the country the way we want it run''.
<P>
	There was an old farmer once who was on hard times, as many 
farmers are. He had a donkey. He had a hard time feeding the 
donkey. He thought he would put a little sawdust into his oats to 
make him feel full.
<P>
	The first day he put a little sawdust into the oats. He gave it to 
the donkey and the donkey did not seem to notice. The donkey 
felt full and did not complain. He did it again the next day. He 
put a little more sawdust into the oats and he continued to do it.
<P>
	He thought he was fooling the donkey. The donkey seemed 
fine. To make a long story short, one day he came out after the 
donkey was on a diet of almost pure sawdust and all four legs 
were up in the air.
<P>
	That is what is happening in this country. It will soon have all 
four legs up in the air because people are being fed sawdust, a 
little more every day. The politicians keep adding it to their diet 
and think people do not notice.
<P>
	They can put the MP pension plan in place. They think: ``I will 
put this along and the people will swallow it. They will accept 
it''. At some point people will say: ``That is enough. We really 
have had enough of this sawdust. We might feel full today but 
hard times are coming''.
<P>
	We need to have real MP pension plan reform because it is 
hurting the country. It provides the wrong incentive for people 
to get re-elected or even to get elected. This is supposed to be 
the highest court in the land. That is an absolute joke.
<P>
	We on an average day have very few people here listening to 
the debate, wondering if the legislation is good or not because 
we do not even have a say. The Prime Minister and the few 
people he surrounds himself with control the whole thing. There 
are no free votes in here.
<P>
	The people of this country do not even have any input as to 
what the pension plan will be. The government will ram it 
through. That is why we do not have anybody sitting around here 
listening to the debate. It is because this is not the highest court 
in the land any more.
<P>
	We have made a mockery of this place and what happens here. 
People do not even bother to show up to listen. I came here to 
build up the country and to make positive changes. People want 
to see people in public life there because they believe in sound 
principles, willing to serve their country selflessly.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12387"> 12387 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	The MP pension plan gives people the wrong incentive. It 
gives people elected to this place the incentive to remain here, 
not necessarily just to serve their country.
<P>
	I have lived on the farm. I have raised pigs and I know what 
pigs are like. I wish everybody could see what it is like when 
they get to the trough. They stand there and defend their places. 
The biggest pig gets his snout in there and all the little pigs dare 
not disturb him. The pigs keep their snouts in there until they get 
fatter and fatter. They are pig headed. I wish I had time to 
explain what pig headed is. It is well illustrated when observing 
them. They will not listen to reason. They will do what they are 
bent on doing and will not change their plans in any way.
<P>
	I see that happening in this place. We do not just have our 
noses in the trough; we are also being pig-headed in this whole 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have followed the debate today with great 
interest. I thank my colleagues for strongly debating Bill C-85 
and the massive problems with it.
<P>
	I also thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois who rose 
to speak to the bill. He actually made a number of very good 
points. Of course there were a couple of points with which I 
would vigorously disagree. However, I thank my colleague from 
the Bloc for indicating that we are in fiscal trouble in this 
country and that we do need to see a more responsible approach 
to economic concerns by the government, which is something 
we have not seen.
<P>
	I rise today to again debate Bill C-85. This bill would be more 
appropriately entitled: ``an act to make minimal changes to the 
gold plated MP pension plan''. It is clearly a case of the 
government not being honest with the Canadian public. Its 
overblown pension scheme is nothing more than a back door 
way of increasing MPs' remuneration. It would rather do it 
through the back door with fat pensions and hope that the public 
will not notice or kick up a fuss.
<P>
	I do not understand why this government is fighting so hard to 
hang on to its ridiculous pension. Other jurisdictions have come 
to grips with reality and have done the responsible thing: they 
have reduced or even eliminated their members' pensions.
<P>
	The province of Alberta completely eliminated the pension 
plan for its MLAs as there was such public hostility to the very 
rich compensation plan.
<P>
	In the past week or two, in my home province of 
Saskatchewan, Premier Roy Romanow announced a major 
reduction in pension levels for MLAs, including himself. That 
was done in an attempt to help his cause in the upcoming 
provincial election. He has eliminated the taxpayer ripoff and is 
instituting a matching dollar for dollar pension system for 
MLAs. It seems that  Saskatchewan can set up a pension system 
with a ratio of one to one but 3.6:1 is the best this government 
can do.
<P>
	This is a Liberal government and that is a socialist 
government. I have heard members opposite talk about how 
terrible these socialist governments are. I certainly am not a 
socialist. I never was and I do not intend to become one. 
However, it is quite revealing when even a socialist government 
in Saskatchewan comes forward with a more responsible 
pension plan for its MLAs than this government brings forward 
for members of Parliament.
<P>
	What the public objects to is the fact that the pension plan for 
MPs is not only out of line with other pension plans, but it would 
be illegal if it were not specially protected by Parliament. The 
same government that wants to continue the fat cat pension 
would prosecute any private firm which set up a similar plan. 
How is that for two-tier irony?
<P>
	Reformers on this side of the House have long said that 
members of Parliament should not be treated better than other 
Canadians. Bill C-85 does not bring the compensation package 
for MPs any closer to private sector levels. Rather, it 
underscores and reinforces the differences between private 
Canadians and members of Parliament.
<P>
	This is, after all, the House of Commons where ordinary 
Canadians are to come together and govern themselves. It is not 
the House of Lords, to be filled with aristocracy. I always have 
trouble with that word, probably because I do not fit in that 
class. It is not an exclusive club reserved for the privileged, even 
though the Liberals like to treat it as one. Members of 
Parliament have the means to provide for their own retirement 
and they should do that, the same as many Canadians have to do.
<P>
	Not being part of the aristocracy, I was a self-employed 
farmer before the election. Being a self-employed farmer, I had 
to make arrangements for my future retirement. The only 
pension plan available to me as a farmer was the CPP, which I 
may speak about later if I have time.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians want to move toward the next century with 
enthusiasm. They want the government to be in touch with 
reality. Government members have forgotten that it is 
Canadians they are here to represent. Canadians want the 
government to reflect society's progress into the future. They do 
not want to be dragged back a few decades.
<P>
	The Liberals are unwilling or unable to come up with new 
plans and structures suitable for the Canadian society of today. 
The only new thing this government has come up with is new 
taxes. It seems to think the role of government is to invent new 
ways to take money out of the economy to support old govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12388"> 12388 </A></B>
<P>
ment programs that are out of date and not living up to our 
expectations, including an outrageous pension plan.
<P>
	The government's refusal to really change the MP pension 
plan is a good example of this resistance to the kind of change 
Canadians are demanding. When compared with the massive 
problems with the state of our government, the MP pension plan 
may not seem like a big deal. However, if the government cannot 
solve a simple problem like this when the solution is so clear, 
when do we have any hope it will be able to deal with the big 
questions facing our country?
<P>
	Plain old common sense says that if we take care of the little 
things the big things will take care of themselves. The 
government is failing on the smaller issues, particularly these 
issues of principle. It is no wonder it is way off base when it 
comes to the larger problems facing our country.
<P>
	The issue of early retirement has not been adequately 
addressed. In the private sector if someone takes early 
retirement, benefit levels are lower for each additional year they 
draw from the plan. Private sector pensions do this because they 
believe in being actuarially sound, a concept that seems to be 
foreign to this government.
<P>
	The total national and provincial debt exceeds 100 per cent of 
our GDP. Government programs like the Canada pension plan 
are threatening to collapse because of the hundreds of billions of 
dollars in unfunded liability. The Liberals have never done 
anything on an actuarial basis, but it is high time they started. 
They do not even know how to balance the books. They never 
have and I am becoming convinced they never will. It seems 
only Reformers have the knowledge of how to balance the 
books.
<P>
	How can this government and the Trudeau and Mulroney 
administrations before it explain to Canadians that they have 
ruined CPP, the people's pension plan? They have ruined it, 
thereby jeopardizing the retirement plans of hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions of Canadians. At the same time the 
government worked hard to protect and preserve the MP pension 
plan. It is purely self-interest and nothing more.
<P>
	The Liberal government is putting its own interests ahead of 
the country. Its members are selfish. As the member for 
Macleod so aptly said, they should be described as hypo-grits. 
That is one of the best descriptions I have heard in days.
<P>
	The pensions being drawn by some past members have been 
brought to the attention of the House. Massive, luxurious 
pensions are being given to Perrin Beatty, Ed Broadbent, Joe 
Clark, Brian Mulroney and John Turner. It is interesting that 
John Turner moonlighted while he was here. Not only did he 
collect his MP salary, but he was in business. He was never in 
this place. He collected two salaries. Now he leaves this place 
and he collects a fat pension. Where is the responsibility? Why 
do we not start designing programs that are fair and reasonable, 
not this kind of nonsense. Mazankowski, Wilson, they are all 
receiving their fat pensions.
<P>
	Future recipients will be the member for Yukon, the member 
for Hamilton East, the member for Halifax, the member for York 
South-Weston and York West. Where will this money come 
from?
<P>
	It will come out of the pockets of fishermen with lower 
incomes or perhaps no income at all because there are no fish. It 
will come out of the pockets of farmers who are paying higher 
grain transportation costs. It will come out of the pockets of 
salesmen who are paying an extra 1.5 cents a litre gasoline tax. 
The money will come from the pockets of small business people. 
It will come from the pockets of retired folk who are paying for 
this luxurious pension plan.
<P>
	I am sick and tired of the whining from the members opposite 
about how tough it is for retired MPs. I just received a notice 
from Gowling, Strathy and Henderson in my mail. It is pleased 
to announce that the Right Hon. Ramon J. Hnatyshyn has 
rejoined the firm as a partner. They are having a little party to 
celebrate that and would like me to come. I think I will pass up 
on the invitation.
<P>
	In this so-called pension reform the government has refused 
to stray too far from the old cushy system in this plan. It is 
reticent to cut off its own gravy train no matter what the public 
thinks about it. Despite the fact that the Canadian public 
disapproves of the MP pension plan, the government is 
unwilling to significantly change it.
<P>
	I ask the member for Kingston and the Islands to listen. The 
Liberal frontbenchers are like alcoholics who have tasted the 
booze and want a generous supply. They cannot control it. They 
are pension addicts. To them public money is like alcohol, one 
dollar is too much and a billion is never enough.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals should do the honourable thing and go cold 
turkey. They should opt out of this plan. They want to make their 
backbenchers pensionaholics too, just like they are so that they 
can all cry in their beer together. They have to have trough 
regular or trough lite. They are addicted to the pension and 
cannot walk away from it.
<P>
	Bill C-85 fails to deliver on effective pension reforms in two 
ways. It fails to bring the MP pensions in line with the private 
sector plans available to most Canadians. More important, it 
fails to bring MP pensions in line with what Canadians are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12389"> 12389 </A></B>
<P>
willing to provide for members of Parliament. We cannot lose 
sight of the fact that we work for the Canadian public.
<P>
	I will be opting out of the pension plan. I want to represent the 
wishes of my constituents in this matter. They have told me in no 
uncertain terms that the MP pension plan is totally out of line.
<P>
	I did a survey in my riding and 97 per cent of the respondents 
said that the MP pension plan is irresponsible and they would 
like me to have nothing to do with it. I want to do the right thing. 
I am proud to opt out of this thing. I would much rather take less 
income and have no pension when I leave this place than do the 
wrong thing and be an embarrassment to my constituents and my 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are 
as follows: the hon. member for Mackenzie-agriculture; the 
hon. member for Bourassa-immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to have the 
opportunity to speak on the issue of MP pensions.
<P>
	I represent a constituency where there is a very large number 
of retired Canadians. Part of my constituency is described as 
God's waiting room because of the number of elderly people 
who live there. From the responses I get I can see that the 
make-up of the constituency is changing.
<P>
	There is a lot of concern, not only from the elderly people in 
my constituency but from those in the middle age category and 
the younger people who live there. I take a bit of ribbing from 
my colleagues because I have developed a two way 
communication with my constituents. I often have stacks and 
stacks of letters from them, letting me know what they have to 
say.
<P>
	My latest return had over 2,800 responses. The most 
consistent concern of my constituents is the overbloated MP 
pension plan. In their comments I hear a real contempt for 
members of Parliament and their overbloated pension plan. I 
would like to share some of their comments.
<P>
	One constituent says: ``I think government pensions are too 
early for too few years and too much. We cannot afford it. The 
general public do not get pensions like that''. Another says: 
``MP pensions should start at age 65. MP pension plans should 
be in line with the general public. Cuts to MP pensions are not 
deep enough. They are whittling away at our pensions but are 
still feathering their own nests. We worked hard and long to save 
for our retirement but we might as well have sat in a bar and 
drank our savings. To this government it seems sloth is rewarded 
and hard work and responsibility are penalized. Let the MPs cut 
their excessive pensions before they cut ours.''
<P>
	``Why do government pension plans still totally out perform 
private plans? How can they say they want to increase eligibility 
to 67, yet they are eligible at 55? MP pension plan changes and 
cuts are not nearly enough, in fact are quite inadequate and 
presumably made to prevent rebellion. Your disgusted taxpayers 
are expected to make large sacrifices to help pay off the huge 
debt.''
<P>
	``MP pension changes must be more drastic.'' No one should 
be allowed to have pensions before the age of 60. Changes 
should be retroactive to include all former members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	``The MP pension plan is a joke. The proposed changes are a 
joke. Would Svend and Ms. Copps make well over $1 million 
pulling down a pension from the private sector? Could you, 
Val?''
<P>
	``Government pensions should be equivalent to the private 
sector. On members of Parliament pensions further cuts should 
be made here. Why should MPs receive higher pensions than one 
would receive in private industry? Changes should have been 
more drastic and no pension should be paid out before 55, 
regardless of when the MP started. MP pensions should be in 
line with industry''. I could go on. I took one small handful from 
the stack I have.
<P>
	I repeat, the one consistent message I get from my 
constituents is they will not accept another change to the 
pension plan that leaves it as bloated and as unresponsive to the 
demands of the constituency, that leadership be shown by the 
members of Parliament in the House. They expect if sacrifices 
are to be asked of them there should be like sacrifices from the 
people sitting in the House.
<P>
	Like my associate, I will be opting out of the MP pension plan. 
I have given notice to my constituents that I will be opting out of 
the plan. I have received many phone calls and many letters 
supporting that decision. They do not feel I should be here 
without any kind of compensation. However, they feel the 
pension plan is asking too much from the ordinary taxpayer. I 
have to agree with them.
<P>
	The Reform Party has come up with a very plausible pension 
plan that would make plenty of sense not only to members of 
Parliament but to the people we expect to pay for the pension 
plan. I suggest the government side take a close look at the 
alternatives placed before it from the Reform Party; a plan that 
would be adequate, a plan that would be fair and responsive to 
the years of service MPs put in. That would not be any more than 
what the person in the private sector of the people in my 
constituency can expect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12390"> 12390 </A></B>
<P>
	I hear from some of the seniors in my constituency that many 
of them are retired on $975 a month after 30 years of working for 
the same company. How can I possibly defend a pension plan 
that allows a person to collect after 55, that allows individuals 
who sat in the House for over six years to collect millions of 
dollars over a period of time up until they are 75. How can I 
defend that? I cannot.
<P>
	I ask the House to please reconsider the bill before us now and 
to be responsive to the thousands and thousands of Canadians 
asking the House to show leadership and to show members are 
responsive to what Canadians are asking for.
<P>
	It disturbs me to hear the responses and the comments from 
across the House. They do not seem to feel there are any 
expectations of them to make this kind of sacrifice. It disturbs 
me these people sitting in the House of Commons who have been 
put here to represent Canadians in their constituencies are not 
listening to what Canadians are saying. They are certainly not 
representing Canadian views in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I hope before the debate is over they will get the message from 
their constituencies. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the 
opportunity to share my constituents' concern with the House. I 
hope their message is shared across the country and listened to 
by the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I join the debate with some reluctance. I was very 
proud to be elected to the House and to be a member of 
Parliament. When I ran and became involved in politics I felt 
one of the most important things I could and should bring to the 
House is leadership.
<P>
	I knew then and I know today our country is facing some very 
difficult times. We are into a period of financial restructuring in 
our country which will make what has gone on in the last year or 
will go on in this next year seem like child's play. Sooner or later 
we will have to come face to face with the reality that our 
country is $550 billion in debt and in the hole at the rate of $120 
million a day.
<P>
	If our country did not have this onerous debt then I do not 
think the pension problem would be necessarily as fractious as it 
is. The debate has brought out a level of meanness in the House 
which has not really been here in much of the debate that has 
taken place, even though there have been some very contentious 
issues debated.
<P>
	When we talk about pensions and income we are talking about 
where people really live. When we take the facade off the role or 
the life of a member of Parliament every one of us has exactly 
the same problems and wishes as every other Canadian. Every 
one of us is making a mortgage payment or a car payment or has 
a child in university or has someone else they are looking after. 
Every one of us has financial obligations.
<P>
	Being a member of Parliament does not mean one's life 
automatically magically changes. Many people in the House 
make a substantial financial sacrifice to come to the House. 
What happens is people are making less than they did before 
they were elected.
<P>
	Everyone having been elected knew that before they got the 
job and should not complain about it once they have it. We went 
into this with our eyes wide open. Why should members of 
Parliament be prepared to make the sacrifice? That is the 
essence of the debate.
<P>
	As our country goes into this period of travail as we learn to 
live within our means the people in positions of leadership have 
to exhibit leadership by taking the first hit by leading by 
example. I do not think any Canadian begrudges a fair income or 
a fair standard of living or a fair remuneration to a member of 
Parliament. However, they do not want to see members of 
Parliament living far beyond what is available to anybody else 
in a similar circumstance. Why are there two sets of rules, one 
for the law makers and one for everyone else? That is precisely 
the reason Parliament has brought disrepute upon itself, having 
one set of rules for everybody else and one for Parliament.
<P>
	The basic question is does the remuneration package in any 
way help or hinder the development of good governance in our 
country?
<P>
	In my private life I would ask the question from a business 
perspective. Does the remuneration package offered to people in 
this business help or hinder the development of the business? 
Does it attract and retain the very best people or does it retain 
people we do not want to retain who perhaps should move on 
somewhere else? Does it lead to the very highest ideals or does it 
lead to mediocrity?
<P>
	I will pick up on a theme presented earlier in the debate that 
perhaps because the salary level is low, which has been said by 
the Prime Minister time and time again and others in the House, 
the pension is abnormally high because the salary is abnormally 
low.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I suspect our remuneration package does more to bring 
mediocrity to the House than it does to bring a level of 
commitment and excellence we should all hope for. The pension 
is such a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow any normal human 
being will be affected in their day to day decisions with how they 
can go about getting into that pot of gold.
<P>
	The question is when we come here and make a decision, are 
we making the decisions best for the country in the long run? 
Are we making decisions best for the next generation or are we 
making decisions for the next election? Are we statesmen or 
politicians?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12391"> 12391 </A></B>
<P>
	If our decisions are motivated by winning the next election 
rather than doing what is right for the next generation, I submit 
we are politicians. We will never be statesmen. The pension is so 
rich human nature would automatically cause people to think: 
``How should I respond in this situation? Will it help me or 
hinder me in the next election? Will it help or hinder me within 
my caucus? If I go against this program, am I likely not to get a 
nomination? Am I likely to be pushed out of caucus? Am I likely 
to be dropped from a committee? What would happen to my 
image if I am not a team player?''
<P>
	That is the reason members of Parliament should be fairly 
compensated. They should look after their own pension 
arrangements like everyone else. We should be well paid and we 
should look after our pensions.
<P>
	We should have a dollar for dollar contribution to buy an 
RRSP, just like everyone else. The decisions we make that affect 
us should not hold us harmless from the effect of these decisions 
on the economy as a whole.
<P>
	If we in the House and those who came before us manage to 
mismanage our economy to the point at which 35 cents of every 
dollar collected by the federal government goes to paying 
interest on money we have already spent, should these people be 
rewarded with a pension for life? Hardly.
<P>
	Should people be motivate to be re-engaged to have a 
political life because of the pension, which begs the question 
whether our function as members of Parliament should be to act 
as a board of directors. Should we be micromanaging the 
economy as we are wont to do?
<P>
	Why all of a sudden does Parliament have to sit 180 days of 
the year? Why can we not retain our real lives and come here just 
enough to be a board of directors and have a professional civil 
service actually run the country?
<P>
	I suspect as human nature drives this remuneration package 
none of us on any side of the House is perfect. What on earth is 
the point of the government's hiring outside third party 
arbitrators to make decisions on remuneration for members of 
Parliament and then ignoring the advice?
<P>
	It is a pox on our Houses. How can we be determining what 
our income or remuneration should be? Why can that not be 
done by an impartial qualified third party and accept the results 
that come from that impartial third party? Why should it be done 
internally?
<P>
	I want to close with a spirit of optimism because I have great 
faith in our country. I still have great faith in Parliament. 
Remember, what is done today can be corrected tomorrow, and 
that is the beauty of Parliament.
<P>
	Although the legislation will pass, there will be another dawn. 
There will be a tomorrow. In the closing stanza of ``The Rime of 
the Ancient Mariner'', the poem that says water, water 
everywhere and not a drop to drink, the parable of the story is he 
will rise upon the morn, a sadder and a wiser man.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I suspect that the result of the Liberal government, having had 
the opportunity to do the right thing and taking a half measure, 
hesitant step and calling it an achievement, will rise upon the 
morn and rue the day sadder and wiser at the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
normally it is a great pleasure for me to rise to speak in the 
House, but today I find the need to speak to this bill is not much 
of a pleasure.
<P>
	In 1952 the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent 
introduced the members retiring allowance. He described it as 
actuarially sound and a matter that would operate without any 
further charge on the public funds than the matching of the 
contributions to be made by all members of Parliament. That is 
the way it should work.
<P>
	How in the world did it get so far off track? Today the 
taxpayers contribute 80 per cent and the members of Parliament 
contribute 20 per cent.
<P>
	Only a government with its head in the sand would ask 
Canadians, who have the fastest growing personal tax burden in 
the industrialized world, to shoulder the burden of deficit 
reduction without first putting its own house in order.
<P>
	Bill C-85 tells Canadians that the majority of the people they 
elected to Parliament in 1993 care more about their personal 
financial security than they do about the deficit or the tax 
burden.
<P>
	Canadians will soon learn that while all 52 Reform MPs are 
opting out of the pension plan, only one Liberal MP has the 
fortitude to say no. Canadians will soon realize that the majority 
of members they elected to Parliament do not really care about 
the debt or the tax burden ordinary Canadians have to face. They 
talk the talk, but when it affects them personally, and when it is 
going to affect their retirement, they quickly seek refuge back at 
the trough.
<P>
	Pension reform was a major issue in the last election, and I 
suspect it will be in the next election. When my colleague was 
quoting from ``The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', a line 
occurred to me as well: and like a cross around my neck the 
albatross was hung. This is an albatross the Liberal government 
will have a difficult time getting off its neck.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Maybe we should call an election to find out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Maybe we should. The hon. member suggests 
that there should be an election. I challenge him to call an 
election on this issue. It is an excellent idea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12392"> 12392 </A></B>
<P>
	They even boasted in the speech from the throne that pension 
reform was a plank in their platform. They have made a mockery 
of their own promises.
<P>
	Bill C-85 was not at all what the Canadian taxpayers 
expected. Instead of real pension reform, the Liberal caucus 
agreed to protect senior MPs and youthful cabinet ministers, 
because it knows that when the Reform Party forms the next 
government, and it will, contrary to what my friend in the Bloc 
suggested, the Liberals will not be getting any patronage jobs to 
supplement their incomes.
<P>
	They claim to have eliminated double dipping. However, even 
if they were to get a federal job, their pension benefits would 
keep on growing, thanks to inflation indexing.
<P>
	I am amazed that with only two years left before the 
government has to face the Canadian electorate it would have 
the gall to introduce a bill that would give MPs a pension other 
Canadians can only dream of, especially since it is the average 
Canadian taxpayer who will have to pay for this now silver 
plated pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	How much will they have to pay? They will have to pay 
plenty. For every dollar contributed by all those Liberals and 
Bloc MPs who are rushing to opt into the plan, the taxpayer 
contributes $3.50. It is hard to believe that the government is not 
embarrassed to boast about a reduction of 1 per cent in the 
accrual rate, from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. Wonderful, but it is 
still double what it is in the private sector.
<P>
	Where else but in Parliament could one receive a pension for 
only six years of service and that pension would be indexed for 
life and payable starting at age 55? This is early retirement by 
anyone's standards.
<P>
	In the private sector, only 22 per cent of the pension plans are 
adjusted automatically for inflation. It takes MPs only 19 years 
to qualify for a full pension. A person in the private sector would 
have to work for 35 years to be eligible for anything similar.
<P>
	The Prime Minister attempts to justify this premium pension 
plan by saying that MPs have a difficult time readjusting to 
private life and finding jobs in the outside world. Surely to 
goodness they cannot have that much difficulty. If they do have 
that much difficulty, I fail to see how it could be the taxpayer's 
fault.
<P>
	Often when we ask the Prime Minister to justify his continued 
support for this cash for life scheme he compares MP pensions 
to hockey players' salaries. For one thing, we are talking about 
salaries, as opposed to pension plans; let us get that straight. For 
another thing, I believe the Liberals are skating on very thin ice 
on this one, because in Winnipeg we saw what happened when 
the players demanded too much. The players and those who 
hired them parted company. On the next election day the 
Canadian taxpayers will be telling the players in the government 
they would just as soon part company with them.
<P>
	The provincial legislators in Prince Edward Island and in 
Alberta realized that the taxpayers could not afford to support 
them forever and have scrapped their pension plans. In 
Manitoba, Premier Filmon promised to cancel the pension plan 
and replace it with a registered retirement savings plan 
arrangement.
<P>
	We are not suggesting that members of Parliament should not 
be properly paid for the job we do. We all know that we work 
hard here at this job and that we are eligible and we deserve a 
decent salary for it. But let us separate salary from pensions. The 
Reform Party does not say that members of Parliament are not 
deserving of some sort of retirement benefit as well. Let us have 
a retirement benefit that we can take in good conscience and we 
can look our constituents in the eye and say yes, I contributed 
and yes, you contributed; it was equal and it was dollar for dollar 
and we do not have the feeling that we are taking advantage of 
the people who pay our salary and put us here in the first place.
<P>
	Canadians are being asked by their government to do with 
less. In the vast majority of cases Canadians can accept that. 
They can accept that there is not enough money to fund all the 
government programs that have been created over the last 30 
years. They cannot accept the excuses offered by this 
government to continue to fund a pension plan that Canada 
cannot afford. The government has to get its own financial house 
in order before asking Canadians to support them for life.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign I promised the 
constituents of Wetaskiwin that I would not participate in the 
existing gold-plated pension plan. As a matter of fact, one of the 
first things we did when we got to Ottawa was to go over to pay 
and benefits and sign a declaration there saying that we were 
paying into this pension plan only under duress and that we had 
no intention whatsoever of collecting.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not something we came up with in the last few hours so 
that we could debate it in the House. It is something we signed at 
an early date because we in good conscience did not want to 
participate in a pension plan of this type.
<P>
	On February 24 and during our annual general meeting, when 
I explained to my constituents how meagre the changes in this 
bill were, I told them there was only one acceptable clause in it, 
and that was the one that would allow me to remain outside of 
the pension plan.
<P>
	I question the intention of the government. Perhaps I am 
treading on thin ground here, but I think there was some malice 
in that very clause. It was aimed directly at the Reform Party. 
The idea of course would be that some would opt out and some 
would not and it would effectively split our caucus. I can say that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12393"> 12393 </A></B>
<P>
this has not happened and that our caucus has decided 
individually and collectively that we will opt out of the program.
<P>
	Members have probably deduced by now that I am opting out 
of this plan with its silver lining. I recommend that anybody in 
the House who plans to be here for more than one term follow 
suit and do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the guiding principles of leadership is that the 
leader set an example. People despise double standards, 
especially with regard to leadership.
<P>
	In the past, Canadian governments have been marked in their 
leadership and have been characterized by inaccessibility, 
arrogance, a disregard for the masses, in fact contempt for the 
masses, some corruption, and rule from an ivory tower 
mentality, a them versus us mentality. The proof was in the last 
election, when the government of the day was in no uncertain 
terms turfed from its position in government into an 
insignificant number in the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It will happen again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> What were the 
Canadian people saying in that election? We want democracy. 
We want to be heard. We want fairness, accountability, 
transparency, and above all else we want honesty from our 
elected officials. We want our elected officials to represent the 
people and we want to do for ourselves what we do unto others.
<P>
	The single most objectionable thing that typifies the last 
government and in some ways applies to this government is the 
MP pension plan, this gold plated plan, which is unlike those in 
the private sector.
<P>
	In response to the dogged efforts of the Reform Party, the 
government has finally buckled under and decided to revamp the 
plan. Is that what it truly did? Not at all. It brought out a plan that 
is mere it window dressing. We have seen a lot of it.
<P>
	Yesterday when we spoke in the House on the OAS and CPP 
bill we saw much the same thing. Let me explain why. What 
happens with the new plan? The accrual rate decreases, but it 
only decreases from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. This is still double 
the rate in the private sector.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Income Tax Act says that there can only be a 
maximum of 2 per cent. Therefore, the plan put forth by the 
government and the preceding plan are illegal.
<P>
	The new plan is fully indexed to inflation. Do we see that in 
the private sector? Not at all. In the private sector, 80 per cent of 
plans are not indexed to inflation.
<P>
	What is the new minimum age? It is 55, not 60. That is fine to 
an extent. However there is no decrease in the payments that are 
down if anybody collects before the age of 60. Again I bring 
your attention to the Income Tax Act.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The Income Tax Act says that pensions must be reduced by at 
least 3 per cent per year if collected before age 60. Does this 
occur in the plan before us?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Does it occur in 
the new plan?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> What does this do? 
It is another MP pension plan that contravenes the Income Tax 
Act and is completely illegal.
<P>
	This new plan decreases the contribution rate from MPs from 
11 per cent to 9 per cent. What does that do? It increases the pay 
that MPs take home. This plan is at least two times as lucrative 
as private sector plans and continues to contravene the Income 
Tax Act in at least two cases. Therefore that makes it completely 
and utterly illegal.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party, as all members, have been given the 
chance by the government to opt out. What happened? To a 
person, the members of my party have opted out of this plan. 
When many of us, myself included, were given the sheets to sign 
for our pension plan when we came here in January 1994, we 
wrote on the top that we would not sign out of protest because we 
would not be a part of this plan.
<P>
	It was an election promise we made and one that we keep. It is 
not only we who will opt out of this plan. There are a handful of 
hearty souls from the government side who, under duress and 
intense pressure from their own people, have decided to hold 
strong and represent the wishes of their constituents and opt out.
<P>
	Are the members of the Bloc Quebecois, a group that is 
committed to destroying the country and tearing it apart, to be 
members of this plan? Absolutely. I find it completely 
hypocritical that these members are rushing to be members of a 
pension plan in a country they are running away from. Why does 
this group want to join a pension plan from a country that it 
wants to tear apart? It is hypocrisy. Its members should look in 
their souls and in the mirror when they decide to do this.
<P>
	In this party, we propose not to be destructive but to be 
constructive. We have said all along that we want to be a part of 
the community, to join hands with the rest of the country to make 
it strong. One of the things that we can do is have the same 
pension plan as the people who voted for us.
<P>
	We want to have the same pension plan as the private sector 
and in essence, lead by example. Therefore, we should collect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12394"> 12394 </A></B>
<P>
the MP pension plan at age 60 and decrease the contributions by 
the taxpayer. As one of my friends from my party just said, we 
should make it a one to one contribution. Above all else, let the 
MP control and manage his or her pension plan. It is interesting 
to reflect on this for a moment because it shows the the  
difference in mind set and philosophy that we in the Reform 
Party have to the government.
<P>
	Government members believe they should get their lecherous 
tentacles into all aspects of people's lives from business to MP 
pensions. We in this party and the majority of Canadians believe 
that it is not the government members who should do the 
majority of things in the country, but people, individuals and 
private organizations are the ones who can best deal with the 
problems that affect them. Let government do what government 
does best and what the private sector cannot do and let the 
people and individuals do everything else. Our job is to 
empower the people to do that.
<P>
	One of my colleagues was musing the other day about the 
so-called increase in pay. What he was really doing is trying to 
find ways of decreasing the cost to the taxpayer. He proposed 
abolishing the MP pension plan, abolishing the allowance but 
increasing the salary to compensate for this. He qualified this by 
saying that this does not in any way, shape or form represent the 
will or the wishes of this party.
<P>
	Nobody in this party wants to increase the salaries of any one 
of us. The hon. member for Beaver River started off when she 
was a lone person in the House by voluntarily decreasing her 
salary by 10 per cent. She was the only individual in the House to 
do this. It is important to understand that out of the 295 members 
only one MP at that time did that. That MP was from the Reform 
Party of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Other things we have done that members of the other parties 
have not done is that we took the bull by the horns and tried to 
find out other constructive ways of saving the taxpayer money. 
We saved money on our flights by flying economy. We in my 
office managed to save the taxpayers at least $10,000 to $12,000 
per year by flying economy and on cheap flights. If all of us were 
to do that we would save the taxpayers at least $3 million a year. 
We should look at that because it is certainly something 
constructive that we could do.
<P>
	Many of our constituents have complained about this MP 
pension plan. Many of these people are individuals who fought 
in the last war, which we celebrated this week, and who have 
worked all of their lives only to have pensions of less than 
$1,000 a month. Furthermore, on that amount of money they are 
remorselessly taxed by the Canadian government. It is not 
something I would lay at this government's feet right now as it is 
something that has gone on for a long time.
<P>
	I ask the government to look with compassion on those 
individuals who have made such a significant contribution to the 
backbone of the country. They have worked all their lives to 
make it the safe place that it is today.
<P>
	I implore the government to lead by example. Give the people 
the confidence they need in their elected officials. As we saw in 
World War II, we came together to do great things, to defeat the 
fascism of Nazi Germany. That hope is not lost on us now. In 
1995 we can all come together to build Canada, the greatest 
country in the world, to once again stand on its feet and be the 
middle power that it can be. We can only do that by coming 
together, leading by example and working together for the 
benefit and future of our wonderful country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the election in 1993 I made one promise to my 
constituents. I promised that when I got to Ottawa I would take 
every opportunity to let their voice be heard. Therefore, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity. For all my Wild Rose friends 
out there in TV land or wherever they are, this is for you. My 
Wild Rose constituents say scrap the obnoxious, ridiculous 
pension plan of MPs. I agree with them wholeheartedly.
<P>
	Yesterday school students from the county of Wheatland in 
my riding visited me. Some of my colleagues joined me and we 
had a great visit. I really have a hard time understanding how a 
member of Parliament could stand in front of a group of young 
people in today's times and say to them: ``We have this huge 
debt of $550 billion. It will be $600 billion or more by the time 
this Parliament ends or maybe even more than that''.
<P>
	``Your future does not look too good. It will be very expensive 
to get an education because we are really in trouble financially. 
We are sorry about that. Probably the old age pension, the 
Canada pension and things of that nature which we have grown 
so accustomed to admiring and having in this country will be 
gone when you get my age, but that is just the way it goes. We 
really tried hard. Of course you won't mind, students'', as I told 
them yesterday, ``if I hang on to a pension, would you, that will 
provide me with several thousands of dollars during my old age 
while you will probably have nothing''.
<P>
	The students quickly told me how much they minded. I know 
that same message is loud and clear at any school. If any 
member wants to go to a school and has the nerve to tell the 
students exactly what the situation is and then turn around and 
tell them that he or she is well looked after, let us see how they 
respond back.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="12395"> 12395 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I have a funny feeling there are a lot of members in this 
Parliament that would not even dare do such a thing. That is a 
little too honest. That is a little too much up front.
<P>
	When this Parliament first met the minister of human 
resources would stand up to talk about the one million children 
in the country living in poverty and how we had to address that. 
Eighteen months later, we are still talking about the one million 
children living in poverty. Let us give up our pensions, let us 
feed the hungry kids. Does that make sense? Not if you are 
greedy, it sure does not. If you are a greedy individual, you will 
accept this pension plan. We will hear the minister of human 
resources talk about hungry children again next year.
<P>
	I received a call from an individual who works with the 
Children's Aid Society, a relief society. He asked if I would 
come to the House and encourage the members of Parliament 
who are flying around the country to give that up and donate the 
money to his children in Ottawa. They could sure use the extra 
few thousand dollars that is being spent.
<P>
	Look at news items like: Goods news, MP junkets will not be 
cut. ``We are going to Europe, Asia and Africa. Never mind, we 
are only $600 billion in the hole. We have hungry children all 
over Canada. Never mind, we are going to take these trips''. 
What kind of leadership is that? Where are their hearts? Where 
are their minds?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are greedy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Greedy is right, the exact word. If we were to 
call a consultant to come into Parliament to address this group I 
am sure the consultant would not hesitate to say in order to set 
things in order, we had better start at the top and set an example.
<P>
	Not a member in the House has not received a call from an old 
age pensioner who has said: ``I do not know how I will make it. I 
have had another cutback and I cannot make it''. I really doubt 
there is one member in the House that has never received a call 
like that. I cannot understand how any member can receive these 
call and say: We are doing all we can and in time things will 
change.
<P>
	If we give ourselves pensions like these and then talk to an 
elderly person on the phone about what they are doing and what 
they are getting, we are being hypocritical. Talk about being 
hypocritical. Talk about being two faced. For heaven's sake, if 
you have a caring attitude then go to these communities, stand in 
front of the people on your own two feet and do what you were 
sent here to do. Look after the people of this country. They are 
expecting you to do that.
<P>
	I am sure this consultant would say give up your pensions, it 
would be the smart thing to do. The consultant would probably 
say sell the aeroplanes, that would be the right thing to do. Do 
not go to Europe, Asia and Africa, do not need to; you can do 
without that. Feed the hungry; help the elderly; do your job''. 
That is the attitude demonstrated over there of which Canadians 
are sick. I hope they would call an election tomorrow to 
demonstrate that same attitude.
<P>
	I was the mayor of the town of Sundre back in the seventies. 
The council and I decided we would engage a group of citizens 
to determine what our remuneration should be. We left it in their 
hands. We were pleased with their decision and the community 
as a whole decided that is what we should receive.
<P>
	I challenge the government. I challenge the Bloc Quebecois 
Party, the Liberal Party-I know the Reformers will be more 
than pleased to participate-to find a group of citizens to come 
to this place to determine what our salaries, our pensions and a 
few other things should be. After all, in case they have forgotten 
we work for them, let them decide.

the previous parliament, the former members for New 
Westminster and Mission-Coquitlam, worked tirelessly to 
have this House put research on breast cancer and support 
services for women with breast cancer on the top of its list of 
priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12396"> 12396 </A></B>
<P>
	They helped convince this House to embark on an important 
study regarding the issue in 1992. The same year, the 
Sub-committee on the Status of Women published its 
conclusions and a list of recommendations in a report entitled 
``Breast Cancer: Unanswered Questions''. I have a copy of that 
report with me.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have to conclude that most of the questions 
raised at the time have remained unanswered. The members of 
the sub-committee made 49 recommendations, and I think it is 
important to revisit a few today. The sub-committee 
recommended that the federal government work with the 
provinces and territories to give the cancer research centres 
already in place in each region of the country the designation of 
centres of excellence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The centres of excellence would be a sort of one-stop 
treatment and information centre for women diagnosed with 
breast cancer.
<P>
	I cannot tell the House how many women I have spoken with 
who say they have lacked proper information on treatment and 
on treatment options. There is confusion even on things such as 
breast self-examination and the options generally available to 
women.
<P>
	We need to concentrate our efforts and to pool our knowledge. 
The regional centres idea originally proposed by the committee 
would go a long way in centralizing and co-ordinating 
information.
<P>
	The committee of 1992 also recommended that the federal 
government establish a 1-800 line to provide information to 
women on various self-examination techniques and on new 
research and treatment options. Nothing concrete has been done 
about the plan. I suggest it is worth reviewing and should be 
seriously considered.
<P>
	The Ontario Breast Cancer Support and Research Centre 
currently has an application before the federal Minister of 
Health requesting that such a pilot for a 1-800 number be 
established in Ontario. I hope the pilot, proposed to be jointly 
funded through private funds and public funds, would be 
seriously considered by the minister. It would be an attempt to 
work on the recommendations that took a lot of time of 
parliamentarians and were very clearly thought out. The 
committee heard a number of witnesses as well.
<P>
	There is also an outstanding recommendation for a national 
registry to keep a record of devices implanted in the body. This 
issue is very strongly linked to the motion we are discussing 
today since many women have in the past decided on breast 
reconstruction using silicone implants after they have 
undergone a mastectomy to remove a breast cancer.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	It is also an issue for women who have not had breast cancer. 
It remains an extremely serious and outstanding issue that breast 
implants have not been thoroughly researched or thoroughly 
regulated by the federal government. It is an absolutely crucial 
area in which work must be done.
<P>
	I might add there are a number of self-support groups that are 
trying to work with the government on the issue but receive no 
financial support. There are a number of civil suits pending 
against the manufacturers of silicone gel implants. I urge the 
federal government to play a strong role in support of these 
women.
<P>
	In March 1995 I met with a number of women who had 
experience with their implants. I can assure everyone in the 
House that their problems are real. These problems, in addition 
to causing endless pain and suffering and disrupting family life, 
are a huge cost to the Canada health care system.
<P>
	We are very fond of saying we have to do something to cut 
health care costs. By regulation by the Canadian government in 
the area and by information being available to women about the 
medical devices we could do much to address that health care 
cost with a very minimum of support from the federal 
government.
<P>
	One of the most important recommendations in the standing 
committee's report on breast cancer asked that the federal 
government provide some direct funding for survivor led 
women's support groups. We cannot underestimate the 
importance of the recommendation. That is why my motion 
today deals specifically with it.
<P>
	One reason survivor led support groups can play such an 
important role is that women who volunteer their time have been 
through the process. They are able to empathize with other 
women, to talk about how they have handled the issue, and to 
deal with confusion and fear first hand. It is important for a 
woman diagnosed with breast cancer to have that kind of 
support. For a very minimal cost we could be saving health care 
costs down the line in a substantial way.
<P>
	There is a lot of research to suggest that a positive attitude and 
a strong support network can actually help people fight diseases. 
The support groups we now have in Canada have had a 
tremendously positive effect on the lives of women.
<P>
	This is important in light of the fact that scientific research 
has failed to come up with strong links between the causes of 
breast cancer and the onset of the disease. Despite years of 
research we still do not know the cause of the majority of breast 
cancers. Scientists have identified links like a genetic marker, 
age and a woman's estrogen level, but in 60 per cent to 70 per 
cent of all cases none of the identified risk factors is at play. It is 
incredibly important to look at some of the ways we can help 
women when they are diagnosed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12397"> 12397 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a huge library of research. I have many 
bibliographies in my own office that I would be happy to share 
with members of the House which point to the link between 
self-help groups and improved quality of life in the face of 
illness. Clearly with a minimum of assistance to help 
co-ordinate volunteers and disseminate information we can 
have a positive health outcome. I would suggest it is an 
economic saving as well.
<P>
	Recently American researchers, as an example, released their 
findings from a study of 7,000 people in California. They had 
monitored the people for nine years to see if there was a link 
between strong social and family support networks and 
improved mortality. In every health category people with 
stronger social ties, people with stronger friendships, for 
example, had a lower incidence of illness. When they did get 
sick they stood a better chance of recovery.
<P>
	When we talk about health care costs and health programs we 
tend to think of them generally speaking in a very narrow 
framework. We have to begin to think about how we can enhance 
existing links that provide support for people in these traumatic 
instances. In addition, as the research indicates they also work.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Canadian studies have made the same links in breast cancer. 
There was a study in British Columbia indicating that for women 
with breast cancer, women's friendships, social network and 
employment status had a positive impact on survival chances. 
The link is somewhat stronger for women who have had some 
form of outside support.
<P>
	Over 5,400 Canadian women will die of breast cancer this 
year. An estimated 17,000 Canadian women will be newly 
diagnosed with the disease. That is one in nine Canadian 
women. We have made some advances. I know of many people 
who have successfully fought the disease and have gone on to 
raise their families and to live happy and productive lives.
<P>
	Statistics show it is still a very major health issue. Breast 
cancer is the second most frequently occurring cancer in the 
country. More shocking still-and I have not really seen 
research on why it is-Canada's rate of breast cancer is the 
second highest in the world, second only to the United States. 
There is much we need to do in the area.
<P>
	The obvious question is where do we get the money? It is a 
legitimate one. There are avenues through the health promotion 
and contribution program at Health Canada which has funded 
some projects to help breast cancer support groups 
communicate with one another. As in so many other areas, by 
assisting groups with a small amount of money we can have a 
huge benefit. By spending the funds we have well we enhance 
the links that exist in the community.
<P>
	Federal support for survivor led support groups could assume 
a model, for example the one set up for the AIDS secretariat. It is 
a very good model in terms of looking at how the federal 
government can co-ordinate funding in an appropriate way. 
That model of secretariat does two things. It indicates a 
commitment on the part of government to a serious health issue 
and provides a central source for promotion of dealing with the 
issue both within government departments and throughout the 
country.
<P>
	As much as anyone, certainly the New Democratic Party 
knows there is not a lot of money and revenues are tight. It is a 
question of priorities. It is a question of what we wish to see for 
the population of the country.
<P>
	There are some who would refer to spending $60 million on 
the Senate. I would say save national medicare and sacrifice the 
Senate. There is still not a single support group in Ontario that 
has had help from the Canadian government. I might be wrong 
and could be corrected, but I do not know of any other support 
group in a province or territory that is assisted by the 
government.
<P>
	There is also a related issue which I think is very real because 
again we are talking about priorities, reduced funding and 
choices. The social assistance and health transfer proposed 
under Bill C-76 is now undergoing discussion in committee. 
Seven billion dollars in cuts will only make it more difficult in 
this area of health.
<P>
	As we are looking at priorities in Canada, what it means to be 
a citizen of Canada, a comprehensive system of national health 
care must be foremost. Many groups and individuals are very 
concerned that the bill will simply result in less co-ordination 
and reduce funding in both provinces and territories for the kind 
of groups that are needed and the kind of research that is needed.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In the same recently even the United Nations has expressed 
strong concern about the health and social service transfers, 
saying they could strip disadvantaged groups of their 
fundamental rights.
<P>
	Health Canada is currently funding five pilot projects to 
improve communication between small support groups. I 
commend that. It is a good start on the things that need to be 
done. Funding for these networking groups ends in 1996. I hope 
by then we can say we have been able to extend a helping hand to 
many grassroot support groups working with sufferers of breast 
cancer.
<P>
	I am not talking about a lot of funding, simply an amount that 
will help groups co-ordinate and do their work. One group I 
have become familiar with is the Burlington breast cancer 
support services. This group was the first survivor directed 
support organization in Canada. It started out with assistance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12398"> 12398 </A></B>
<P>
from the government but today it does not receive any funding 
from the government. It is making it on memberships and 
private donations and was fortunate enough to have office space 
donated. It was that little bit of funding that  got it started that 
made the difference in the group's being able to continue and 
establish itself.
<P>
	The group in Burlington receives 155 calls for support each 
month; 57 people drop in to its office each month and in 1994, 
111 people volunteered over 15,000 hours to provide peer 
support and keep the organization running. This is a very clear 
example of how a little assistance can have a very beneficial 
result for people suffering from this disease.
<P>
	Every parliamentarian should have the chance to speak to the 
women who volunteer in these kinds of activities, women who 
have suffered breast cancer or to their families. Obviously in 
this instance it affects many more people than the person who 
has the illness. Parliamentarians would then see the level of 
commitment and dedication and support they give which is 
absolutely crucial to others.
<P>
	Today I presented some of the 2,000 petitions I received from 
men and women across the country, from every province and 
territory, asking parliamentarians for the support I have 
discussed here. I have received over 30,000 signatures, the 
largest number I have received on any petition. Many women 
have called and written to me asking for more petitions. Others 
have written to tell me of their own experiences with breast 
cancer, suggesting new areas where parliamentarians can help.
<P>
	The other day I received a completed petition from the 
member for Calgary Southeast, and I thank her. I believe this is a 
non-partisan issue. I look forward to hearing the views of my 
colleagues in the House on this issue. I hope it will not simply be 
addressed here and then forgotten.
<P>
	The subcommittee of 1992 has not had a lot of action on the 
recommendations. I encourage all parliamentarians, both men 
and women, to become involved in supporting the issue and 
making it a new national priority.
<P>
	The other day I spoke with members of the Canadian heritage 
committee, responsible for the status of women, and was told 
the committee does not have plans to discuss this issue. I believe 
we should look at this again. I also think we should act on it. 
Most women will say: ``Do not do another study. We have had a 
lot of studies. Give us action. We have given you the ideas''.
<P>
	Core funding for survivor led breast cancer services is one of 
the most important, most cost effective ways to address the 
issue.
<P>
	One of Ontario's breast cancer activists said recently we 
cannot ignore the needs of women living with the disease while 
we are searching for the cure.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for 
Yukon for bringing this important issue to the House.
<P>
	We assure her we will co-operate with her and with all her 
colleagues both male and female to find a solution to the 
problem of breast cancer.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to speak to the federal initiatives in the area of breast 
cancer. The Minister of Health, the secretary of state with 
responsibility for women's issues and the Liberal women's 
caucus have all lately addressed the issue of breast cancer, 
talking about wellness, promotion and education, ensuring we 
support our community in the search for the necessary 
awareness and cure.
<P>
	For too long breast cancer has been one of the most silent 
killers in Canadian households. Breast cancer, as the member 
said, is a leading cause of cancer deaths among women. It is 
estimated that breast cancer accounts for 28 per cent of newly 
diagnosed cancer cases in women and for 20 per cent of all 
deaths due to cancer.
<P>
	Members of the House should be aware the chances of 
acquiring breast cancer increase with age. In spite of progress in 
cancer research and improved methods of early detection, 
Canadian cancer statistics 1995 show the incidence of breast 
cancer has been increasing at about 1 per cent annually since 
1983.
<P>
	Mortality, on the other hand, has not increased. Rather, it has 
marginally decreased. About one in nine women will develop 
breast cancer over their lifetime, and this rate has remained 
unchanged. Breast cancer will strike 17,700 in 1995 and kill 
5,400 this year alone.
<P>
	For those affected the disease is often disfiguring and requires 
months of treatment and years of adjustment. I recently 
experienced an exhibition called ``Survivors'' where most 
poignantly those facts were brought out.
<P>
	On June 12, 1992 the Standing Committee on Health and 
Welfare, Social Affairs, Seniors and the Status of Women tabled 
a report entitled ``Breast Cancer: Unanswered Questions''. In its 
response to the report the federal government at the time 
recognized the devastating effects of breast cancer to society as 
a whole and to Canadian women in particular and commended 
the standing committee for bringing to its attention the need for 
a concerted national effort to address this important women's 
health issue.
<P>
	The federal government supported the overall direction of the 
standing committee's recommendations and sought, through a 
number of initiatives, to bridge the gaps in knowledge in the 
areas of prevention, screening, treatment and care. The 
government's response recognized and identified the need for 
in-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12399"> 12399 </A></B>
<P>
creased collaboration to address the health issue and serve as a 
framework to seek effective ways of responding to this national 
concern.
<P>
	Twenty-five million dollars over five years was allocated for 
to establish a breast cancer research challenge fund, to develop 
five breast cancer information exchange projects, to convene a 
national forum, to support an co-ordinate provincial breast 
cancer screening activities, to support actions to foster 
uniformly high standards of care for breast cancer, and to 
support activities to enhance continuing education and training 
of health professionals in the area of breast cancer.
<P>
	In exercising leadership in the area of research the federal 
government committed $20 million to the breast cancer research 
challenge fund and issued a challenge to individuals, 
communities and the corporate sector to match if not exceed 
these funds. The National Cancer Institute of Canada agreed to 
manage the funds accumulated through this challenge. This is 
accomplished through the management committee for the 
Canadian breast cancer research initiative, a partnership 
between Health Canada, the Medical Research Council of 
Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Institute 
of Canada.
<P>
	In the spring of 1993 the federal government issued a request 
for proposals in order to fund existing cancer centres and other 
health care institutions across Canada for the development of 
breast cancer information exchange pilot projects.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	These projects are now a reality and we are very proud of the 
work taking place. They are funded with $2.7 million over five 
years and located in five regions of Canada. They are developing 
specific expertise to disseminate state of the art, user friendly 
information on various aspects of breast cancer. These projects 
have a strong evaluation component and will serve as a model 
which can be used by other cancer centres or health care 
institutions to disseminate information on breast cancer to 
women, their families and health practitioners.
<P>
	The national forum on breast cancer was held in Montreal on 
November 14 to 16, 1993 to determine priorities and directions 
in the areas of breast cancer prevention, screening, treatment, 
care, research as well as address issues relevant to survivors 
support, advocacy and networking. Throughout the event a 
number of common principles emerged, the need for better 
communication, collaboration, co-ordination at all levels and 
for greater consumer involvement.
<P>
	The federal government has also committed $1.05 million 
over five years to the continued support and co-ordination of 
provincial breast cancer screening activities. To that effect 
Health Canada continues to assist with the activities of the 
Canadian breast cancer screening initiative.
<P>
	Representation from the provincial and territorial ministries 
of health, existing provincial organized screening programs, the 
Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, the Canadian Breast 
Cancer Network, the Canadian Cancer Society, the National 
Cancer Institute of Canada and Statistics Canada are all 
involved in the screening initiative.
<P>
	In order to support activities to foster uniformly high 
standards of care a steering committee for the development of 
care and treatment guidelines has been established. It is 
composed of women living with breast cancer as well as 
representatives from organizations and groups responsible for 
delivering and implementing guidelines.
<P>
	The Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Nurses 
Association, provincial health ministries, the National Cancer 
Institute of Canada, representatives of provincial cancer 
agencies or their equivalent, the Royal College of Physicians 
and Surgeons of Canada, the College of Family Physicians of 
Canada, the Federation of Medical Licensing and Authorities of 
Canada and Health Canada are participating on the steering 
committee.
<P>
	Ten specific topics related to the care and treatment of women 
with breast cancer have been selected as the starting point for 
their activities.
<P>
	The point I am making here is that there are many individuals, 
groups and organizations involved in looking for responses and 
answers to the issue of breast cancer. In order to improve the 
scope and content of the professional-patient relationship a 
co-ordinating committee on professional education has been 
established. The committee has brought together professional 
associations and representatives. Survivors of breast cancer are 
a key to any work that has to take place and to all the components 
of the federal breast cancer initiative.
<P>
	Survivors' views and perspectives drive the products being 
undertaken. Each component of the initiative has survivor 
representatives as well as women at risk.
<P>
	It is important to note that survivor driven organizations form 
a key characteristic of the breast cancer information exchange 
pilot projects' overall information dissemination strategy. This 
strategy is built on the concept of collaboration with key 
partners, chief among whom are women at risk, survivors and 
health care providers.
<P>
	I think I speak for everyone on this side of the House in 
addressing this issue and in affirming we want to work with all 
members, especially with the member for Yukon, to eradicate 
this problem in our midst. This issue will not be ignored.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak in today's debate on Motion 
M-376, presented by the hon. member for Yukon. The motion 
proposes that the government should provide core funding that 
would be used to offer women diagnosed with breast cancer 
information on the various treatments available and on services 
provided by support groups.
<P>
	The motion draws our attention to a major health problem for 
women in Quebec and Canada. Breast cancer, the incidence of 
which is certainly not declining, kills many women every year.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Despite the interest in improving the status of women in 
Canada and legislation and policies aimed at correcting the 
inequities women experience, it is a fact that the status of 
women still leaves much to be desired, compared with the status 
of men and that which remains to be done before women enjoy 
the same advantages as men.
<P>
	I am very aware of and concerned about health care. I think it 
is important to remind the federal government that we urgently 
need a health care system that is adapted to womens' needs. The 
latest studies on women's health have made us realize that as far 
as health care is concerned, women's needs differ greatly from 
men's.
<P>
	Financial resources dedicated to research on women's health 
are inadequate. There is a lack of resources for breast cancer 
research, gynaecology and obstetrics, research on chronic and 
degenerative diseases, mental health, violence, professional 
illnesses, the special needs of immigrant women, women of 
ethnic origin, native women, teenagers, elderly women, and the 
list goes on.
<P>
	At the beginning of this session the Minister of Health told us 
how she intended to promote women's health. She described the 
programs her government intended to implement to remedy the 
inadequacies of the health care system in the treatment of 
women.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Since this 
government came to power, funding for health care has dropped 
steadily. This government has maintained a freeze on transfer 
payments to the provinces, which has meant a reduction in 
resources for the health care systems operated by the provinces.
<P>
	In its latest budget, the government went even further by 
cutting $70 million from the budget of its own Department of 
Health, which has seen its general envelope shrink by 3.8 per 
cent.
<P>
	The motion moved by the leader of the New Democratic Party 
reminds the government of the importance of supporting action 
taken to fight breast cancer.
<P>
	Breast cancer is frightening. This disease kills women at a 
rate of one every 12 minutes in North America. During the past 
30 years, this type of cancer has spread like a particularly nasty 
plague, and the only effective remedy remains prevention and 
early detection of the disease.
<P>
	In Canada, the situation is not very encouraging. Canada has 
the highest rate of breast cancer in the world. Every year, 15,000 
new cases of breast cancer are detected. Five thousand women 
will die of breast cancer this year. This is one death every two 
hours. In Quebec alone, nearly 1,500 women will succumb to 
this terrible disease. Every woman in Canada and Quebec has 
one chance out of ten of contracting breast cancer in the course 
of a lifetime. Earlier, my government colleague said one chance 
in nine. There may have been a decline, but it is still too high.
<P>
	The results of a nationwide poll released last Thursday 
revealed that 41 per cent of women in Canada and Quebec saw 
breast cancer as the main threat to their lives.
<P>
	It is high time effective steps were taken to conquer this 
disease. We need a cancer detection strategy that considers both 
genetic and environmental factors. In fact, that is what 
transpired from the final report of the National Forum on Breast 
Cancer tabled last fall. The report recommended immediately 
introducing national guidelines for medical practitioners, to 
inform physicians and encourage upgrading of their skills. So 
far, nothing has been done.
<P>
	Also a public awareness and information campaign would be 
needed to inform and support breast cancer sufferers. This was 
in fact suggested by the hon. member for Yukon in her motion.
<P>
	The best way to beat breast cancer is to invest in research. At 
the National Forum on Breast Cancer, the government promised 
to spend $20 million over five years. We hope it will keep its 
promise.
<P>
	Although we realize that breast cancer is a scourge that has 
been ignored to a shocking extent by politicians and the medical 
community, the Bloc Quebecois must remind the government 
that health care is an exclusively provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	If the federal government decides to support the war against 
breast cancer in some way or other, we remind the government 
that it must do so in consultation with its provincial partners.
<P>
	Many provinces have already introduced effective measures. 
In British Columbia, Ontario and now Quebec, provincial 
governments have launched extensive breast cancer detection 
programs. The Quebec government's plan aims to reduce the 
mortality rate by 25 per cent over seven years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12401"> 12401 </A></B>
<P>
	As long as there are places where a woman's life is valued less 
than a man's, women's health problems will tend to be ignored, 
to the detriment of their own lives, the well-being of their 
families and the development of their country. Throughout 
history, women have shown this extraordinary capacity for 
getting together and hammering out a consensus. Our present 
day societies, which seem to be marching only to the drum of 
economic and cultural globalization, need more than ever before 
what women have to offer.
<P>
	For the sake of soaring profits, society is pushing an 
increasing number of people out to its margins and providing a 
breeding ground for many forms of fundamentalism. Women, 
because they are aware of the problem and of their strengths, 
will have to stand together to fight effectively against poverty 
and extremism.
<P>
	If it is to develop harmoniously, society cannot afford to 
ignore women and the issues and problems they are facing. 
Women's health is one of the factors that has a direct impact on 
the evolution of women's place in our society. I maintain that we 
must take action where it will do the most good, in other words, 
we must invest in medical research now to find a cure for breast 
cancer.
<P>
	We should act now by raising the federal government's 
financial support to the level of the commitments it made to the 
provinces when the Canada Health Act was passed. Women's 
health cannot but improve as a result.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the hon. member for Yukon on her initiative 
regarding this most worthwhile matter contained in Motion No. 
376.
<P>
	This morning the standing committee on health discussed this 
very matter, not in any great depth but with seriousness due to 
the subject matter. It was discussed from the perspective of what 
was being done in research in order to overcome breast cancer. 
We had before the standing committee this morning Dr. Henry 
Friesen, who is president of the Medical Research Council of 
Canada. Dr. Friesen commented that there has not been a cure 
found for this most dreaded infliction, which has indeed touched 
many families right across the country.
<P>
	Perhaps the work being done by the standing committee on 
health can act as a coordinator to assist in carrying this forward 
so that the information will flow in the future.
<P>
	Quite obviously, suffering from any illness brings an undue 
burden on anyone. Compounding it with the problem of lack of 
information is indeed unfair and unnecessary in this day and 
age. The hon. member's motion would ensure that women 
suffering from breast cancer are provided with all the 
information they may need and the counselling they may 
require. I suggest again that in this day in age that is only 
humane. When suffering from any illness, information 
regarding all types  of treatment should be readily available and 
accessible to all. It should certainly be the patient's right to 
obtain any and all information and have immediate access to the 
same.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	It is quite obvious in this case, as in many circumstances, that 
to have a support group, those who may have suffered or family 
members who have suffered in a similar fashion, can comfort, 
assist and indicate what might be expected in future days, 
weeks, and months, and can be a tremendous comfort to anyone 
suffering in this case.
<P>
	Quite obviously a person cannot be expected to make such an 
important medical decision without having weighed all those 
possible alternatives that may be available. We are told that 
Canadians have the second highest rate of breast cancer in the 
world. It has hit, as I have mentioned before, almost every 
family in Canada in recent years, and that suffering continues 
today, day in and day out, from this dreaded disease.
<P>
	The survivor led breast cancer support group would provide 
sufferers with an opportunity for the needed information and the 
support they so often lack. There is no question that this type of 
support group can be most helpful through their own personal 
experiences. It is time to realize that we must take action to help 
women with breast cancer in the best possible way while we wait 
for that cure to be discovered.
<P>
	For this reason I am very happy to support the hon. member's 
motion this evening and I certainly to encourage my government 
to adopt a platform that will ensure that women diagnosed with 
breast cancer are provided with the information they deserve 
and need. We wait and hope for our ultimate goal of discovery of 
a cure to eliminate this dreaded suffering so that we need not 
have a group nor the suffering in the future. To quote from the 
Medical Research Council: ``It is to promote, assist, and 
undertake basic applied clinical research in Canada in the health 
sciences and to advise the minister in respect of such matters 
relating to such research as the minister may refer to the council 
for its consideration''.
<P>
	We are certainly hopeful that through the research council and 
the work done through universities and other labs and tests here 
in Canada a cure for this dreaded disease will be found as soon as 
is feasibly possible. In the meantime, we certainly encourage all 
in the House to support the hon. member's endeavour in this 
particular motion to assist those suffering and to provide the 
assistance and expertise of support groups at the earliest 
possible date.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too am pleased to rise to speak to this motion today.
<P>
	In its simplicity, this motion on breast cancer funding can be 
looked upon as an opportunity to address a topic of specific 
interest and importance to women and of general interest and 
importance to everyone. I agree with my hon. colleague from 
Yukon that we need to address breast cancer as a new national 
priority.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	In the address I will give looking at the whole issue of breast 
cancer, I bring to the forefront of the debate the extent and fit of 
government involvement. This is not simply a question of breast 
cancer funding but of government research funding as a whole. 
Who should regulate it, why and how?
<P>
	Breast cancer is a disease that afflicts one out of nine 
Canadian women, placing Canada as the country with the second 
highest rate of breast cancer in the world. These statistics were 
already cited today but I am going to reiterate them. There are 
approximately 17,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 
5,000 deaths. Breast cancer is the second most frequently 
occurring form of cancer next only to lung cancer. These figures 
emphasize the scope and significance of this disease.
<P>
	Although breast cancer is considered a women's disease it 
afflicts all Canadians in one form or another. We all have 
mothers, sisters, wives, girlfriends, if not ourselves who are 
very possibly at risk and one in nine will be diagnosed in her 
lifetime.
<P>
	I have witnessed the physical and emotional devastation of 
breast cancer. As a teenager I watched a beloved aunt die slowly 
and painfully over a six-year period. Her cancer began in her 
breast and it was unstoppable.
<P>
	Where does government belong in the battle against breast 
cancer? What would be the most effective use of scarce 
government resources targeted to breast cancer funding? I refer 
to the idea of creative productivity. Government does and 
should have a role in the fight against breast cancer. Let us not 
move too quickly to ask big brother to jump in to spend 
dwindling resources without thinking this through.
<P>
	Government funded and operated initiatives have not always 
been the most efficient despite good intentions. We are all too 
familiar with the economic and bureaucratic nightmare of 
exploding costs that some government run programs can create. 
We need just to look at the current state of our health care system 
and its high degree of inefficiency.
<P>
	Funding to breast cancer research has seen a surge over the 
past three years partly from government but more significantly 
from corporate funders and private individuals and programs. In 
1990 less than $500,000 was committed to breast cancer 
research. Since 1992 the federal government has committed $20 
million toward  breast cancer research over five years. The 
Canadian Cancer Society has put up another $10 million. 
Corporate donors are expected to provide another $15 million.
<P>
	In areas of medical research where what we are looking for are 
cures and preventative measures, government does indeed have 
a very important role to play. It already has a hand in regulation 
of scientific research but even here it is not the core funder. The 
private sector has been a much more impressive financial 
contributor to research into breast cancer. Certainly 
government's tardy involvement in breast cancer studies is 
further proof as to why we might want to look for a more 
collaborative effort between both public and private initiatives.
<P>
	In 1986, unable to persuade the Canadian Cancer Society to 
change its policy on targeting funding, a group of Toronto 
women established the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. 
Since its inception it has collected well in excess of $1 million 
for research and education.
<P>
	In 1990 the Canadian Cancer Society agreed to start accepting 
funds earmarked for specific cancer sites. All involved agree 
that it is largely due to survivor groups that the initiative came 
together.
<P>
	Strength and courage are demonstrated by breast cancer 
survivors who, after being told that they have a disease that is 
almost surely disfiguring and far too often fatal, have had the 
initiative to organize themselves into impressive fundraising 
and information gathering organizations.
<P>
	Pressured by women's organizations and survivor groups, the 
funding has grown to an estimated $15 million annually, up from 
$5 million in 1989. This funding is being put into research for 
not only cures but also causes.
<P>
	Research into BRCA1 which is a gene believed to cause 2 to 4 
per cent of breast cancers and studies examining the 
development of a vaccine to stop some kind of breast cancers in 
their attacks by activating the immune system are just two 
examples of current efforts to combat this deadly disease.
<P>
	As of 1994 more than half of the financial resources of breast 
cancer research have come from non-government agencies and 
organizations. According to people I have spoken to within 
these organizations, they are not looking to government for 
financial support. Their argument is that financial support from 
government is all too often attached to government meddling. It 
is also perceived as unpredictable, particularly in light of 
current proposed cuts.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12403"> 12403 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	We must continue to encourage and invite collaboration 
between public and private groups. We would also be wise to 
continue to promote the independence demonstrated by many 
support groups.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member's motion may have missed an 
important step and presumes that more government involvement 
is necessarily better. Would funding not be put to better use if it 
remained in areas of prevention and cure development? Then 
organizations which are already set up to provide support, 
information and education, such as breast cancer survivor 
groups and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, are 
prepared to fulfil their supportive roles.
<P>
	The reality of Canada's debt makes us cautious about inviting 
government to spend more money we do not really have. 
Therefore we encourage more creative means of funding in 
some of these areas.
<P>
	The government is already allocating funds toward cancer 
research. Should we not leave it to those who know where that 
money is best spent to decide where to put it, rather than having 
government make that decision for them? Who better to make 
funding allocation decisions than those who have spent the 
better part of their lives studying and examining the disease? 
That is not to say they should be given a free hand, but once the 
money has been earmarked, then it is up to the scientists and 
researchers to do with it what is most needed.
<P>
	As it stands, decisions on who should get what funding is 
tenuous at best when we see that it is often not necessarily the 
most needy who are getting a fair share of government funding. 
When some diseases responsible for taking less than one-tenth 
the lives taken from breast cancer are getting almost eight times 
the funding, the source of this decision must be questioned, that 
source being the federal government.
<P>
	In 1993 the national forum on breast cancer referred to a 
holistic approach to the treatment and care of breast cancer, one 
that explicitly acknowledges both the non-medical and medical 
experiences for women and their families. It concluded that 
breast cancer has a profound physical and emotional effect on 
not only women with the disease, but very directly on their 
community of family and friends.
<P>
	Let us not give exclusive invitations to government into our 
homes and personal lives. Government does have a role to 
perform in addressing breast cancer, but not at the expense of 
community based networks of support.
<P>
	What we have advocated has been the need for Canadians to 
take charge of their lives and to some degree exclude 
government from the expectation of care. Family and 
community support must be encouraged, but this will not be 
done by making government responsible for providing those 
support groups. Women and families suffering from breast 
cancer and any debilitating disease need supports to give them 
strength together to survive  and in a sense conquer these 
diseases, if not physically at least spiritually.
<P>
	The national forum on breast cancer has also recommended a 
collaborative effort among government and corporate and 
private sectors. Acknowledging that government has neither the 
resources nor the ability to be the sole responsible actor in breast 
cancer initiatives empowers survivors and their families to beat 
this deadly foe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak briefly on the motion moved by 
the member for Yukon:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide core 
funding to ensure that all women diagnosed with breast cancer have access, 
through survivor led support groups, to information on the various treatments 
available in their community and local counselling services provided by peer 
support groups and survivors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I commend the hon. member for this initiative because it is 
time that we acknowledged such a need.
<P>
	Tomorrow a friend of the family is being buried. She died 
from cancer. Only the privacy of communication would 
preclude me from mentioning her name. This woman had 
contributed to the community, to the city of Winnipeg, to 
women's causes, to the university, and I would say to Canada 
and the world. In a sense learning of her death was timely in 
view of the debate on this motion.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	It is known that when a patient suffers from any illness the 
immediate problem is the patient is met with shock. To a woman 
suffering from cancer that shock is even greater. During shock 
one of the best sources of support comes from her peers. Let us 
not underestimate the importance this group of people 
contribute to patient care.
<P>
	We need all the information available for that patient to be 
able to make the informed consent. We equally need the 
counselling that will come from her peers. Norman Cousins, in 
<I>The Healing Heart</I>, emphasized the powerful influence of 
psychological factors in the cure and the care of any patient with 
cancer or other illness. This is now a recognized medical 
phenomenon and this motion calls our attention to that very 
need. I wish Canada had such a centre to study and to focus on 
the role and the importance of psychological counselling in the 
care of any patient.
<P>
	I am told Canada has the second highest rate of breast cancer 
in the world. Let us hope that one day Canada would be last on 
the list. Recently in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine I came across the news 
of a new discovery that we can help to diagnose or anticipate the 
high incidence of cancer among women. If one demonstrates the 
increased density through the particular use of a technology, 
density in the sense that the proportion of the fibrous tissue in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12404"> 12404 </A></B>
<P>
relation to the fat and the glandular elements is more, then there 
is a high propensity for cancer.
<P>
	Day in and day out we are developing technology that will 
allow us to make an early diagnosis, but when a diagnosis of 
cancer is made for any given woman, all resources must be 
provided. It is timely that core funding be given. The least we 
could do is help that individual woman with cancer.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising 
I wonder if the hon. member for Yukon wishes to rise to close the 
debate?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity. I thank members present today for their 
interventions.
<P>
	Today's debate has shown this is not a partisan issue. A 
commitment to prevention and research for women suffering 
from breast cancer is something we must always bring forward. 
This is not just a women's issue as was pointed out by one of the 
speakers. This is an issue affecting all Canadians and all 
Canadian families, certainly my own family. I am sure that 
virtually everyone in the House has experienced something 
similar.
<P>
	We must put action behind the words we have spoken today. 
There is a great need. We have all cited the statistics, but what 
will really address that need is to acknowledge that we must 
work with those who are sufferers of the disease, to help 
them-as I mentioned in my remarks, many people do 
recover-and to present a hopeful and a positive view. This is an 
issue that members of Parliament can seriously address.
<P>
	To the member from the health committee, perhaps this is an 
issue they might wish to explore further in reviewing the 
recommendations of 1992 to see what has been accomplished 
and what yet remains to be accomplished. I thank all members 
for their comments.
<P>

<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple 
of weeks ago I directed a question to the Minister of Transport. 
At the same time I advanced the thesis that since the government 
wished to privatize the CNR part of the railway system in the 
country, he should give consideration to offering that railway to 
the farmers of western Canada to whom the government has 
offered $1.6 billion as part of the Crow benefit buyout.
<P>
	Since the value of the railway appears to be approximately 
that amount, it seemed to be a very good match. It would have 
saved the government a considerable amount in brokerage fees 
and so on. It would have left future prospects for the country 
much better off, given the users would be in control of at least 
one of the national railways and would therefore presumably 
operate it in a manner that permitted and encouraged the 
continued use and export of products over the rail lines.
<P>
	I am aware the government is constrained by a report it had 
created internally by a subcommittee which was set up basically 
to respond to an offer by CPR to buy out a section of the CN track 
through northern Ontario.
<P>
	The committee offered a solution called commercialization to 
which the minister referred in his response. I submit to the 
minister and to his department that the concept of 
commercialization, as proposed in the committee, is terribly out 
of date even though it is only six or eight months old because 
since that time the government has made its decision to give the 
payout of $1.6 billion to prairie farmers. That payout may be 
considerably less than what was required and what should have 
been made under the circumstances of the long term, in 
perpetuity commitment that governments made with farmers 
almost 10 decades ago.
<P>
	However, the parameters have changed. The amount of money 
on the table is equivalent to the value of CNR. It would save the 
government a considerable amount of dollars in brokerage fees 
to perform the switch. Farmers who are not interested due to 
retirement or proximity to the other railway in owning CN 
shares could take them to the market and get rid of them. 
Perhaps other resource users such as the potash, coal, sulphur 
and wood industries would use the opportunity to buy shares.
<P>
	A system of control to the users makes sense, given the new 
paradigm of globalism that has emerged with the various trade 
agreements under GATT, et cetera. If we are to have viable 
industries and viable communities in Canada, this completes the 
all too necessary link of control from farm to port or from woods 
or mine to port that is required. The commercialization option 
that was proposed by the subcommittee of the Liberal caucus is 
out of date and no longer applicable. I urge the government to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12405"> 12405 </A></B>
<P>
abandon it and to look at up to date solutions that will have a 
much better chance of long term viability.
<P>
	I give the minister and his government the example of prairie 
grain elevators during the teens when government elevators 
were purchased. They were all losers. They lost money. The 
government decided to privatize them. The farmers took them 
over as a co-operative. By having control of the elevators they 
have subsequently turned a series of losing operations into a 
winning proposition and now operate two of the largest 
worldwide co-operative grain companies.
<P>
	That same economic ability would apply in the case of the 
railway. CN is now a losing operation. They could turn it around 
and make it useful to the whole of the country.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it sounds to 
me as if my hon. colleague from Saskatchewan is talking about 
privatization if necessary but not necessarily privatization.
<P>
	We on this side do not think that the report chaired by the hon. 
member for Kenora-Rainy River which followed nationwide 
consultations was out of date. We think it was quite up to date. It 
supported full commercialization of CN including participation 
by employees.
<P>
	A range of factors has been considered in the process of 
commercializing CN, not the least of which is that the greatest 
possible value for taxpayer should be generated in the process.
<P>
	I think all members would agree that commercializing CN 
must not impose restrictions on the company that would reduce 
its value or its competitiveness. Ideally it should be placed on a 
level playing field with its competitors and positioned to remain 
a viable force in Canadian transportation, to the benefit of our 
shipping community.
<P>
	As the minister said, the sale of the government's equity will 
constitute the largest share issue in Canadian history. Through a 
public share offering the government, in seeking to generate the 
greatest value for taxpayers and to provide all Canadians with an 
opportunity to participate in this unique opportunity, wants to 
ensure a broad shareholder distribution throughout the issue.
<P>
	Farmers as well as all interested Canadians, perhaps even a 
few people who live by the ports, will have an equal opportunity 
to invest in CN.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 3, 
I questioned the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration about 
the denial of visitors' visas to three Algerian actors, M'Hamed 
Benguettaf, Ziani-Chérif Ayad and Masrah El-Kalâa, by the 
Canadian embassy in Paris. They had been invited by the 
organizers of the Theatre Festival of the Americas, which will 
be held in Montreal  in two weeks. Their play deals with the rise 
of fundamentalism in Algeria.
<P>
	The minister has refused to intervene in this matter. He did so, 
however, in the almost identical case of Hafsa Zinaï Koudil, the 
Algerian filmmaker, whose application was supported by the 
Bloc Quebecois and by many organizations and personalities in 
Quebec.
<P>
	One criticism I must make to the minister is that his policy 
and his decisions are often disjointed, inconsistent and unfair. 
Moreover, I find it unacceptable for immigration officials to 
demand Algerians provide written guarantee of their intention 
not to seek political asylum once inside Canada before issuing a 
simple visitor's visa.
<P>
	I must point out that the vast majority of Algerians settle in 
Quebec and integrate well as a community, making a valuable 
contribution to Quebec society.
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay 
tribute to Club 2/3 of Montreal, an organization for international 
co-operation, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. 
This organization has funded many projects to assist the poor in 
Africa, Asia and South America.
<P>
	We must thank Club 2/3 for all of its work in this area and for 
its decisive contribution to heightening the awareness of young 
Quebecers to humanitarian aid and international solidarity.
<P>
	A few Algerians have obtained refugee status in Canada. But 
the new immigration tax that the federal government imposed 
on February 28 prevented some of them from obtaining 
permanent residence, because they could not raise the required 
$975. In addition, the Department of Immigration refused to 
lend them the money, despite the assurances of the minister that 
this would not happen.
<P>
	In such a context, these people who have been recognized as 
refugees can neither become permanent residents nor bring their 
families over, and that is inhumane.
<P>
	I invite the minister and his government to be more open and 
to be more sensitive to the tragedy in Algeria and to the situation 
of people from that country who are seeking Canada's protection 
and aid.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
times when I weep for the lack of understanding on the other 
side.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration does not have the power or the authority under the 
Immigration Act to overturn a visitor visa application. These 
were individual visitor visa applications, judged on their 
individual merits and on the basis of the information provided 
by the applicants. It is the responsibility of the government to 
facilitate the entry of genuine visitors to Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12406"> 12406 </A></B>
<P>
	A visa officer is required by regulation to refuse a visitor visa 
if he has reasonable grounds to believe the applicant will not 
leave Canada when the visa expires. A visa officer is bound to 
uphold Canadian law and to protect the interests of this country; 
and well my honourable friend knows this.
<P>
	An applicant who is refused may make a new application and 
ask the visa officer to consider any new information they may 
wish to present. I would remind the hon. member that this is 
exactly what happened in the case involving the Algerian 
filmmaker, Ms. Koudil, who made a reapplication after she was 
invited to do so here in this House by both the minister and by 
me. Lo and behold, when the new information came forward she 
was admitted and went to the film festival.
<P>
