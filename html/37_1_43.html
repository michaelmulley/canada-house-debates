received a summary report from a Roots of our Future conference 
on climate change held at Camp Kawartha near Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those present discovered the impact of climate on developed and 
developing countries, on the economy, social life and ecosystems. 
They discussed changes in the Northwest Passage, impacts on 
northern communities and landscape, effects of severe weather 
events and changes in weather patterns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference made recommendations about reducing greenhouse 
emissions by conservation of energy and the use of alternate 
power sources.  They urge the federal government to be strong in 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the House of Commons, I thank them for their

will contribute over $5.5 million this year to support children's

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parkinson Foundation of Canada is a national non-profit

foundation and its affiliated support groups is to find a cure 
through advocacy, education, research and support services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hereby recognize that the month of April is Parkinson's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to note that there has been a significant drop in the 
number of welfare recipients in Quebec over the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solid growth in the economy has encouraged job creation and 
brought about a 7% reduction in the numbers of people on social 
assistance province-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures put in place by the government to battle poverty 
and exclusion have resulted in close to 42,000 people being able 
to get off the welfare rolls.  In all, there are 137,661 fewer 
than in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud to learn that Laval is one of the places 
where the drop has been the most significant.  The number of 
welfare recipients in Laval has gone down 8.4%, and thus Laval 
continues to be the dynamic city in full economic expansion that 
it has always been.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
recent months Canadians have witnessed a most disgraceful 
spectacle in the House of Commons, the spectacle of an 
opposition that is such a sore loser and so lacking in 
constructive ideas or solutions that it has abandoned issues 
that are in the public interest in favour of the relentless 
pursuit of a campaign of personal destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Canadians want to hear discussions of the state of the 
economy, the opposition is obsessed by the Prime Minister's 
personal finances, by a transaction that was carried out from 
beginning to end in total compliance with the spirit and letter 
of the code governing ministerial conflicts of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking refuge behind the legal immunity conferred upon them by 
the House of Commons, they have piled groundless accusation upon 
groundless accusation, spreading crazy insinuations and 
blackening the reputation of the Prime Minister and his family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 33 years ago today a dreamer 
stepped onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, 
Tennessee, was shot in the throat and killed.  On the spot where 
Martin Luther King died, there is a plaque that quotes the Book 
of Genesis.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they said one to another, behold, this dreamer cometh.  Come 
now therefore, and let us slay him...and we shall see what will 
become of his dreams. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dreamer has been slain and now it is up to us to champion 
his dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Martin Luther King should be not just a source of inspiration 
but of wisdom, wisdom in creating a more just, compassionate and 
loving world for all born into it.  Less than 12 hours before he 
was killed, in his second most famous speech, with his eyes full 
of tears, Dr. King said “I just want to do God's will.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. King was a true servant of God and he brought us all closer 
to his will.  His dream, wisdom and vision must not only never be 
forgotten but carried forward with pride, passion and vigour.

City.  On this occasion, the 34 heads of state in our 
hemisphere, with the exception of Cuba, will continue 
negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind closed doors, they will be making decisions that will 
affect the life and future of all the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 34 states deciding the future of the Americas, and therefore 
Quebec, include Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, but not 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without access to the negotiating table, the Quebec nation must 
leave it up to Ottawa to defend its rights and its vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this situation, the need for an independent Quebec is readily

were deeply saddened to learn yesterday of the death of sculptor 
Charles Daudelin.  He held a very prominent position in our 
cultural universe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in Granby, Charles Daudelin was a pioneer in the 
development of contemporary Canadian culture.  One of the first 
sculptors to propose an approach based on the abstract, thus 
distancing himself from traditional sculpture, he became a model 
for other contemporary sculptors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His interest in the integration of art and architecture might 
explain his role in the concept of public art, that is, 
sculptures in public places rather than in buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, and Montrealers in particular, are very familiar with 
his public sculptures.  His work may also be found in Notre-Dame 
basilica and in the Canada Council art bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Daudelin leaves us a rich heritage of his work and his 
influence on visual arts in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government of Canada, I thank Charles Daudelin 
for the work he has left us and offer my condolences to his 
family.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can imagine, my colleagues and I in the NDP know and

medicare and is committed to carrying on the legacy of Tommy 
Douglas.  His appointment today is most welcome and timely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges facing medicare are serious and threatening and 
must be faced head on.  Rising drug costs, nurse shortages, 
waiting lists for diagnostic tests, creeping privatization, gaps 
in community care and shortfalls in public financing are 
worrisome, but most of all, trade deals, like the GATS, strike at 
the very heart of our universal public health system and threaten

we explain the Prime Minister's haste to set up a royal 
commission of inquiry to review health services and operations 
in that sector, when the federal government has no jurisdiction 
over the delivery of these services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that deprived Quebec of $4.3 billion 
in health transfer payments, but when the general election 
became imminent it miraculously found a few billion dollars to 
reinvest in the system. Such opportunism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, several forums have given stakeholders a chance 
to discuss these issues and the conclusion was always the same 
one. Health care spending will grow by 5% annually. The 
provinces need money and the only responsible action that the 
Prime Minister can take is to restore transfer payments to their 
1993-1994 level, with an indexing factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the last time the Prime Minister set up a royal

I have said on numerous occasions, the matter has been debated

</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP has examined the file.  The ethics counsellor has 
testified on several occasions at the request of the opposition

then gets HRD funds, improper loans and immigrant investor funds 
after the Prime Minister intervenes.  The golf course then gets 
$500,000 from somebody who was improperly awarded a $6 million 
government contract.

the taxpayers of Alberta had to pay $700,000 in legal fees, and

sure that $70,000 would go back to the Alliance Party.

as much for his shares in the same golf course.

thereafter bought land from a company in which the Prime Minister 
had a financial interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After donating $10,000 to the Prime Minister's election

everything in case something were to happen, is he telling us 
that Mr. Michaud was afraid there might be an inquiry and that 
he arranged for the Prime Minister's company to pay for his 
lawyers? What interest did the Prime Minister have in agreeing 
to such a clause, if he was not involved? Is he so generous as 
to help anyone who is in trouble? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to inform the hon. member that I read that document only 
when it was tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole transaction was completed by the person who acts as my 
trustee and lawyer. She did not even inform me of the nature of 
the documents. She settled the issue and, as far as I was 
concerned, everything was very simple in that, as of November 1,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has said that the lawyers had provided for everything 
in the September 1999 contract.  They even provided that the 
Prime Minister himself would assume the cost of any inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that, if the Prime Minister agreed to such 
a clause, it was because he was sure there would be no 
investigation, because he is the one who decides in the end? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
had she listened to the answer—because her question was prepared 
in advance—I said that I was not even aware of the nature of the 
document.  My lawyer in charge of the trust settled that and she 
did not inform me of the nature of the documents she signed with 
whomever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
just remind the Prime Minister that he is the one who keeps 
saying the same thing, because he is incapable of proving his 
innocence in this whole matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in ethical terms, the Prime Minister has again put himself 
in a position of conflict of interest, since, by deciding or not 
to hold an inquiry into his own activities, he is judge and jury 
in a decision that concerns him directly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

here.  In March 1996, when the U.S. congress was threatening 
action against Canadian businesses in Cuba, including the Delta 
hotels, a Delta spokesman said “We are confident in the Canadian

Hussein was dying.  In fact on the morning of February 5, foreign 
affairs warned that King Hussein was clinically dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that knowledge, later that morning the Prime Minister 
decided to go skiing instead.  Worse, he blamed his absence from 
the funeral on the Canadian forces.

Foreign Affairs was there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

today pertaining to comments made by the government House leader 
yesterday in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 2668 of <I>Hansard</I>, the government House leader is 
quoted as stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both speakers from the Alliance who have preceded my remarks have 
been sued, both successfully and both for saying wrong things 
about Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of the speakers to whom the minister referred.  When 
the government House leader stood and made that comment he spoke 
about a case he had heard as a member of the Board of Internal 
Economy.  As a member of the board, he had firsthand knowledge of 
the details of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House leader was making a definitive assertion, one not 
in the public domain, it is logical to conclude that there was 
only one place he could have obtained the information, which was 
via his role as a member of the Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As every member of the House knows, members of the Board of 
Internal Economy are bound by oath or affirmation of fidelity and 
secrecy as legislated in the Parliament of Canada Act.  It is my 
contention that the government House leader violated his oath as 
a member of the Board of Internal Economy, the Parliament of 
Canada Act and my privileges as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no public documents or media reports which show that I 
was ever successfully sued.  The court documents show that the 
lawsuit against me was dismissed without cost.  In an October 15, 
1999 Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article, authored by Jim Bronskill, 
there was only mention of an out of court settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government House leader claimed that I was successfully 
sued, he obviously obtained the information from a source outside 
the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Board of Internal Economy, the government 
House leader has firsthand knowledge of the disposition of my 
lawsuit.  In fact, he played more of a role in determining the 
outcome of the lawsuit than I did, as I was not privy to the 
discussions of the BOIE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government House leader stood in the House yesterday 
and said that I was successfully sued, people would infer that he 
knew what he was talking about because he had access to 
information not available to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite taking an oath of secrecy, the minister chose to discuss 
the case in public because it suited his political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Board of Internal Economy finds its authority in the 
Statutes of Canada, specifically the Parliament of Canada Act. 
Subsection 50(5) of the Parliament of Canada Act reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the Board shall, as soon as practicable after 
becoming a member of the Board, take before the Clerk of the 
House of Commons an oath or affirmation of fidelity and secrecy 
in the form set out in Form 3 of the schedule. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Form 3 of the schedule reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I,..., do solemnly swear (affirm) that I will faithfully, truly 
and to the best of my judgment, skill and ability execute and 
perform the duties required of me as a member of the Board of 
Internal Economy of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further solemnly swear (affirm) that I will not communicate or 
allow to be communicated to any person without due authority in 
that behalf any information relating to matters of employment and 
staff relations, tenders, security and investigations in relation 
to a member of the House of Commons, nor will I allow any such 
person to inspect or have access to any books or documents 
belonging to or in the possession of the Board and relating to 
the business of the Board.  (In the case where an oath is taken, 
add “So help me God”). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of the board generally hold their oaths very 
dear because when my case was heard the level of secrecy was so 
high that even I received extremely limited communication from 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for reasons of his own, the government House leader 
chose to ignore his oath, which is the law, and to make a new 
allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under no circumstances should the government House leader or any 
other member of the board discuss in public a case they have 
heard as members of the Board of Internal Economy.  He certainly 
should not have made an accusation that was not in the public 
domain when he had firsthand knowledge of the true facts of the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government House leader's comments were not 
just an off the cuff mistake.  He led the government's opposition 
to our motion yesterday and his attack on me was obviously part 
of his strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader's accusation was also made by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister during debate and 
by the Minister of Industry during question period. 
This was clearly a planned and deliberate act by the government 
House leader.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government House leader's assertion that I was 
successfully sued is true, then he is obviously in clear 
violation of his Board of Internal Economy oath, the Statutes of 
Canada and my privileges as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is even more egregious.  Not only did the 
government House leader talk about a case that he had dealt with 
at the Board of Internal Economy, he chose to deliberately 
misrepresent the facts of the case.  By no legal measure could it 
ever be considered that I was sued successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out that the very next government speaker, 
the Minister of Industry, who was not a member of the BOIE at the 
time in question, presented a more accurate portrayal of what 
transpired and carefully avoided any mention of me being 
successfully sued.  The truth, therefore, was obviously known to 
the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for purely partisan, political purposes, the government 
House leader chose to ignore the truth.  Instead, despite having 
firsthand knowledge of the truth through the BOIE, he 
deliberately chose to present a misleading statement to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated on page 119 of Erskine May's twenty-first edition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commons may treat the making of a deliberately misleading 
statement as a contempt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously mentioned, this was not an off the cuff remark by 
the minister.  It was obviously a calculated strategy devised by 
the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I also refer you to the twenty-second edition of 
Erskine May, where on page 63 it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and 
truthful information to Parliament...Ministers who knowingly 
mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to 
the Prime Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe members of the House will have a great deal of 
confidence in the Board of Internal Economy if members of that 
board believe they can discuss in public the cases they have 
heard.  Certainly there will be no confidence in the BOIE if its 
members are free to not only discuss cases in public but to 
deliberately misrepresent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government House leader made a definitive 
statement about me.  It is either true or false.  If the 
statement is true, the minister has violated his oath as a member 
of the Board of Internal Economy, the Parliament of Canada Act 
and, by extension, my privileges as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the statement is false, and I contend that it is, not only 
has the government House leader violated his oath as a member of 
the Board of Internal Economy, the Parliament of Canada Act and 
my privileges as a member of parliament, he has also deliberately 
misled the House and is therefore in contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you find this a prima facie case 
of both privilege and contempt.  I am prepared to move the 
appropriate motion in that case.

many witnesses would agree with me, privately if not publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe I did that yesterday.  My reference was to 
media reports of a settlement and nothing else.  I will not 
discuss things the board did or did not corroborate because that 
would reveal what I said a moment ago I would not reveal.  I will 
not do so to defend myself or for any other reason because it 
would be inappropriate.  I have not done so and will not do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the title of the bill is an act to amend 
the Criminal Code for theft over $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to do two things.  First, to allow a 
penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment for theft over $100,000. 
Second, to allow the same 14 year maximum penalty for people who 
would bring property obtained through crime into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is long overdue.  This change would encourage police 
officers to carry through on investigations involving white

other theft charges.

the destruction of our flag is particularly upsetting.

We want to be sure that it applies only to taxpayers with 
higher than average incomes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, first time claimants and everyone who receives 
sickness, maternity or parental benefits will also be exempted 
from the clawback provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The well-being of families is a top priority for the government. 
We have therefore taken into consideration those parents who 
return to the labour force after taking time off work to look 
after their children.  In addition, we are extending the look 
back period by four years for parents.  Instead of being treated 
as new entrants into the workforce, these parents will require 
the same number of hours as any other claimant should they lose 
their jobs and need regular benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, the bill makes substantial improvements to our 
employment insurance plan, improvements to benefit workers in 
seasonal jobs, families and many claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we undertook the employment insurance reform in 1996, we 
had promised to monitor the effects of it very closely.  With 
the intent of honouring our commitment, we instituted an annual 
evaluation mechanism to allow us to identify and correct aspects 
not producing the desired effects.  This mechanism is very 
useful.  In 1997, it allowed us to correct certain anomalies by 
launching the short work weeks adjustments projects. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today that same evaluation tool enables us to make other 
concrete changes to help job seeking Canadians even more.  Above 
all, the monitoring and assessment process assures us that we are 
heading in the right direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February, we tabled the fourth annual employment insurance 
monitoring and assessment report, which revealed clearly that 
most of the aspects of the system were achieving their intended 
objective.  On the whole, the system is accessible to workers 
who have contributed to it and find themselves temporarily out 
of work.  In addition, its first priority is those needing it 
most, that is, low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report tells us that 88% of paid workers should be entitled 
to employment insurance benefits if they have lost their job or 
left it for valid reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be pointed out that claimants do not generally 
exhaust their benefits.  On the average, they use about two 
thirds of them.

12.4% moved on to social assistance, a number that is down from 
before the 1996 reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the EI commission, members of the opposition have 
suggested that this bill should have dictated the framework and 
the results of the review of the EI premium rate setting process. 
We believe the bill allows the review to take place in a stable 
and predictable rate setting environment.  Certainly on this side 
of the House, we will not preclude the work of that important 
review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask for unanimous consent to 
split my time with the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member has 
asked for consent.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise 
to speak at third reading on Bill C-2.  The bill was introduced 
by the government to live up to some of the election promises it 
made before the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minor amendments included in Bill C-2 are, at best, 
tinkering.  It is quite obvious after listening to many witnesses 
that the EI act has become so convoluted and confusing that a new 
act is required to treat all employees and employers fairly and 
to clearly define the role and limits of employment insurance in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' misuse of EI has betrayed workers in traditionally 
seasonal employment.  That was made abundantly clear by the 
witnesses we heard from.  The current EI rules discourage 
education and skills acquisition.  It is incumbent upon the 
government to develop a strategy for workers in traditionally 
seasonal employment which, to a large extent, is a rural Canadian 
issue.  It is incumbent upon the government to address that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are many who felt that EI legislation was not the 
vehicle for the government to do that.  The 1996 amendments to 
the EI legislation were to do three things:  one, to make 
unemployment benefits more active, for example, to rely less on 
income support and more on labour market adjustment; two, to 
enhance employment stability; and three, to lower program costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government introduced Bill C-2, it said that these 
objectives had not been met, that in fact the adjustments had 
failed to reduce frequent EI use.  The government bases its 
position on a study that examined the impact of intensity rules 
during the first year of application.  While the professors who 
did the study justified an examination of only one year, another 
professor testifying at the very same time said that one year was 
not sufficient to study a change in behaviour.  Therefore, there 
is some contention as to whether the information the government 
has used in Bill C-2 to rescind changes made in previous 
legislation in 1996 is questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to examine some of the aspects of this legislation which 
we are dealing with at third reading. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal specifically at this time with the intensity 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated that the intensity rule has had the 
unintended consequence of being punitive.  Some industries at the 
committee told us that they had seen their entire workforce, 
subject to the maximum reduction of benefits, going from 55% of 
their salary down to 50%.  In some industries, like the fishery 
industry, the workers pointed out that they were not seasonal 
workers, they just worked in an industry that was seasonal.  The 
government designates the period of time when these fishermen can 
work.  The government determines when the fishing season is open, 
thus limiting the time when work is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the seasonal use of EI has permitted more companies and 
individuals to remain in an industry than is economically viable. 
We cannot escape the fact that by definition the regular use of 
the EI program makes it a wage subsidization program and not an 
insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to the benefit repayment provision which 
is known to most Canadians as the clawback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated that the clawback was being modified because 
it was not properly targeted.  The clawback was introduced to 
discourage individuals with higher incomes from repeatedly 
collecting benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated in her appearance before the committee that 
some affected groups under the clawback provision from 1996 were 
not clearly dependent on employment insurance.  That may be, but 
by exempting individuals who have collected less than one week of 
EI in the previous 10 years from the clawback, it is clear that 
the main point of the clause in Bill C-2 is to eliminate the 
graduated schedule of high repayment rates for frequent claimants 
that was introduced in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-2, an individual who collected two weeks of EI 
benefits in the past 10 years would be subject to the same 30% 
clawback as an individual who collected 200 weeks of EI over the 
past 10 years.  That is taking someone who only collected two 
weeks and treating that person in the very same way as someone 
who collected over 200 weeks.  It is quite clear that the attempt 
is to eliminate the graduated schedule of repayment for frequent 
claimers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think every Canadian understands and appreciates that there 
has to be a limit set and that there has to be a set amount of 
income where an individual no longer qualifies.  I do not believe 
any Canadian would like to see NHL players collecting EI in an 
off season.  I think Canadians accept the fact that there has to 
be a limit set.  The big question is where should that line be 
set?  What is the limit that should be set? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average yearly earning in Canada is currently $31,700.  This 
means that the clawbacks affect only those individuals who 
currently make significantly more than the average Canadian. The 
elimination of the graduated schedule of increased clawbacks for 
high income earners who are frequent EI collectors means that low 
income contributors to the EI fund who never claim employment 
insurance are in effect subsidizing those high income earners who 
frequently claim employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one issue we all agree with is that there was widespread 
support, or opposition to depending on how we look at the issue, 
from both the employers and the union. 
While they had different objectives with the rates, both groups 
strongly opposed the way government was using surplus EI premiums 
in general revenue.  Both the employers and unions objected to 
the cabinet taking over the control of setting employment 
insurance rates.  Clause 9 has been snuck into the middle of a 
bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, Mr. Speaker, for unanimous consent to have clause 9 
struck from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is certainly one way 
to get the government members to join in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was almost unanimous agreement that the government had no 
right to take over the rate setting processes from the 
commission.  There was almost unanimous consent from all parties, 
with the exception of the government side, to removing this 
aspect.  Although the government said that this was a temporary 
measure for only a two year period of time, it is very clear to 
all of us in the House, and to most Canadians, that whenever the 
government takes over control of anything it very seldom, if 
ever, returns that control where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both employers and employees, and I will include the unions in 
this, are very much against the government using the EI surplus 
of $35 billion to balance its books.  They feel that money has 
been accumulated by premiums of both employers and employees, and 
should be used for no other purpose than the employment insurance 
account.  This is just one more example of how the government has 
taken control.  It has taken responsibility, authority and 
control of matters like this and put them into the hands of a 
small group of people in the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to report the position as I heard it from the 
business community.  The Canadian business community was almost 
unanimous in the opposition to major elements of this bill. While 
the business community believes that people in seasonal 
industries need assistance, they do not believe that it is 
appropriate for it to come from the employment insurance fund of 
which they are required to pay 60%.  The business community felt 
the EI fund should not be used by the government to fund social 
programs.  It felt that was a taxation that should be shared by 
all Canadians, not just the business community and the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce viewed Bill C-2 as being 
inconsistent with development of advanced skills or 
entrepreneurial spirit and did not advance Canada's 
competitiveness in a global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
found that between 250,000 and 300,000 jobs went unfilled because 
of a shortage of suitable skilled labour.  It is criminal that 
there would be 250,000 to 300,000 jobs that we cannot fill 
because we do not have a trained, skilled labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also obvious from the witnesses that we heard that this 
bill is a major concern in rural areas of Atlantic Canada and 
Quebec.  Approximately three-quarters of the witnesses 
representing local communities or organizations were from these 
regions.  They talked a lot about the impact the 1996 changes had 
on their communities.  In some cases millions of dollars had been 
removed from the regional economy.  That should be a concern to 
the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to some comments that have been made about the 
attitude of people in Atlantic Canada.  Comments have been made 
that Atlantic Canadians might be considered to be lazy.  Lazy 
people do not work in Cape Breton coal mines.  Lazy people do not 
go out in December to pull up lobster traps in the cold and the 
dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some businesses have complained about being unable to find 
workers, there is little wonder when one considers that the 
maximum weekly employment benefit is $413.  A minimum wage job of 
$7 an hour, seven hours a day, five days a week is only $245. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has to be asked.  Is Atlantic Canada only good 
enough for minimum wage jobs?  The answer to that is no. Atlantic 
Canadians have as much right as any other Canadian to expect to 
get paid a decent wage so they can support their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two generations of Atlantic Canadians have been caught in the EI 
trap.  Witnesses testified that young adults were leaving the 
fishing communities.  The average age of food processing plants 
in Atlantic Canada is 44 years.  It is unlikely that these 
individuals will be writing software in the high tech businesses 
in the near future.  With the way the high tech businesses are 
going in today's economy, those jobs might not be there anyway. 
Atlantic Canada has a burgeoning offshore resource economy.  It 
is vital that the government provide the necessary education and 
training to assist this region in diversifying its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes get into trouble in my caucus when I say this, but 
there is a parallel between Atlantic Canadian fishermen and 
Canadian farmers in the prairies.  While fishermen suffer from a 
lack of supply, farmers suffer from a lack of demand.  However, 
in both instances these are traditional occupations in the midst 
of dramatic transformation.  The government must work with 
stakeholders to reinvent these industries for the 21st century. 
The government has an obligation to make sure that people who 
rely on those industries move forward in the economies of the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who are in situations that do not offer them 
opportunities, government has an obligation to think outside of 
the box.  The government has to look for alternatives for people 
who are working in a seasonal industry area.  One of the most 
important things the government has to show some support for and 
put many resources into is education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people in communities who traditionally rely on seasonal 
employment must be provided with other alternatives.  Education 
will afford them choices that they may not have now.  Individuals 
must be provided with job skills for the workplace in the 21st 
century.  We have to move forward in what we offer for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to provide training so that people who are stuck in a 
seasonal industry can move into another industry that becomes 
available, which hopefully the government will help to develop. 
We must provide people who are presently in a seasonal workforce 
with job training and job skills for the workplace in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we heard was the way the apprenticeship program 
operated and that sometimes it discouraged young people from 
looking at it, or even older people, because of the delay in 
receiving benefits or the two week disallowance for benefits.  We 
feel that anybody who is in job training or in educational 
programs should be covered for those two weeks.  We do not think 
there should be downtime for people who are trying to advance 
their skills so they can move on in the workforce. 
It is important that the government address this in order to 
encourage more young people to continue or enter apprenticeship 
programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government has to address in thinking 
outside the box is that there has to be a long term commitment to 
infrastructure programs in Atlantic Canada, in Quebec and all 
across this country, because only long term infrastructure 
programs will open up those economies to diversification.  It is 
only by building bigger and better roads that material can be 
moved to and from industries and that will open up those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason why the Halifax port did not become the super 
port.  It lacked the infrastructure necessary for it to get the 
product to the marketplace.  It lacked the infrastructure 
necessary to be considered a super port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to make a commitment to those areas where 
there are seasonal jobs.  The government has to commit to opening 
up those areas, to putting infrastructure money into those areas 
and to putting money into job training and skills training so 
those economies can diversify and move forward in the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today in the 
House of Commons in the debate on the third reading of Bill C-2 
in regard to the government's 1996 reforms to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to the content of the bill, I just want to take a 
moment to thank the witnesses who appeared before the committee 
to tell us what their concerns were.  Most of them felt that the 
legislation is inadequate, that at best it is tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that we at least have the government's attention, 
because for the next number of weeks the standing committee on 
human resources development will be taking a broader look at 
labour market issues, with specific attention to be given to the 
EI system.  This is clearly necessary given the depth of concerns 
raised by all sides during our study of Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agreed that what was required was a thorough review of 
the system with a view to how it could be improved.  Whether that 
is what we end up with at the end of the day remains to be seen, 
but at least we have been given the opportunity to try.  All the 
witnesses are to be congratulated for helping us convince the 
government to allow greater study of the EI bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last election Bill C-2 was known as Bill C-44, which 
died on the order paper.  Bill C-2 is designed largely just to 
tinker with a few of the changes made to EI in 1996.  Some people 
have suggested it may even have been part of the government's 
re-election strategy, but perhaps I will say more on that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI act and the EI system have become so convoluted and 
confusing that what is really required is an entirely new act. 
All employers and employees need to be treated fairly and equally 
and the role and limits of employment insurance in Canada need to 
be clearly defined by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal misuse of EI is really a betrayal of workers in 
traditional seasonal employment.  Current EI rules do not 
encourage education, training and skills development.  The key to 
reducing dependence on EI in areas of traditionally seasonal 
employment depends on this.  We absolutely must reform the system 
to provide heavy emphasis on skills development, education and 
training in order to break the cycle of dependence on the EI 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on the government to develop a strategy for 
workers in traditionally seasonal employment, which to a large 
extent is a rural Canadian issue.  The Canadian Alliance is more 
than ready to assist in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the provisions of the 1996 legislation that Bill C-2 
seeks to remedy is the so-called intensity rule.  The intensity 
rule was introduced to discourage repeat use of EI by gradually 
reducing benefits from 55% to 50% over time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has stated that the intensity rule had the 
unintended consequence of being punitive.  Indeed, some 
industries have seen their entire workforce subject to the 
maximum reduction of benefits.  Workers in some industries, like 
the fishery, point out that they are not seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the clawback system are quite complex and 
convoluted.  By exempting  from the clawback individuals who have 
collected one week or less of EI in the past 10 years, the main 
point of the clause is to eliminate the graduated schedule of 
high repayment rates for frequent claimants.  With Bill C-2, an 
individual who has collected two weeks of EI in the past 10 years 
will be subject to the same 30% clawback as an individual who has 
collected 200 weeks of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the worker in the high tech sector who finds himself or 
herself downsized and out the door, only to be gainfully employed 
again in a few weeks?  If this happens twice in an eight year to 
ten year period, is that person a frequent user? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that we will be taking a look at the larger EI 
issue in committee in the coming days and weeks.  Whether the 
government takes any notice of our work remains to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and I will be advocating some of the things I spoke 
of earlier.  We will be advocating skills development, training 
and education, and education for young people in communities that 
traditionally rely on seasonal employment.  We must provide those 
young people with alternatives to seasonal employment or, at the 
very least, something to fall back on during the off season.  We 
must also provide training and skills development for individuals 
currently working in areas with traditionally seasonal 
employment.  We must provide these individuals with job skills 
for the workplace of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing came up during committee testimony.  Apprentices 
should be paid allowances during the two week waiting period 
while taking courses.  Not only would this help employees, but it 
would help employers too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government must undertake a long term commitment to 
infrastructure spending.  The one area where the Liberals should 
be spending money is the one area where they have not.  A strong 
transportation infrastructure will allow regions that rely on 
traditionally seasonal employment to attract more investment and 
greater opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as it stands is a smoke screen at best.  It touches the 
edge of the reforms passed in the House in 1996, but fails to 
recognize what is really required:  an overhaul of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recognizes the need to do more and will hopefully 
come up with a solid set of recommendations for the minister.  We 
can only wait to see if that will translate into legislation that 
is actually meaningful and productive for the millions of 
employers and employees in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-2, now in third reading, is, let us not 
forget it, the same as Bill C-44, which had been introduced in the 
last parliament before the election campaign as an act of 
contrition by the Liberal Party. It was as the party it had said 
“We did reform EI in a way that is extremely hard on the 
workers, the unemployed and the employers. In the end, we more 
or less used the till to fight the deficit. 
We are introducing this bill because we have recognized, long 
after everybody else, that the intensity rule, for example, was 
a low blow and unacceptable for the workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deprived people, most of them with low salaries, of the money 
to make ends meet. We were told that the reduction would amount 
to only $10 or $11 a week, but for the worker who earned $250 or 
$300 a week and lost his or her job, this small amount was what 
was missing to buy butter, to finish paying the rent or things 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party realized that its reform did not make sense. 
but nonetheless, during the election campaign it said that it 
would go further than Bill C-44. The Prime Minister himself said 
that “Major mistakes have been made and EI has major 
shortcomings, and they should be corrected”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the House reconvened, we were very surprised to have 
brought before the House Bill C-2, which is a mere copy of 
Bill C-44. But what is important to mention is that a poisoned 
gift was left in the bill in the form of clause 9. Under this 
provision, the government would alter the legislative 
arrangements for setting the premium rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, after the vote to be held this afternoon, if the 
Liberals maintain their position, the government would no longer 
have to strike a balance between the EI plan and the plan 
requirements. 
It would no longer have to give back to the plan the money it 
used for purposes other than what the EI plan was originally set 
up for. In fact, it would be able to spend the money on any 
government operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that this clause will legalize the 
mismanagement of funds, the theft of the hard earned money the 
government has been taking from the pockets of workers and the 
unemployed for several years now. This is why, right from the 
outset, we in the Bloc Quebecois have said that we would not be 
voting in favour of this bill if that provision was left in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were able to get the consensus of all the other opposition 
parties. We also have the support of the auditor general, 
management and unions. 
Both the CLC and the Conseil du patronat du Québec said they did 
not want the federal government to make sure it can do whatever 
it wants with the money without having to account for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures have been more or less the same for the past few 
years: each year, $18 billion is collected in premiums and 
$12 billion is put back into the plan. This leaves a surplus of 
$6 billion, which is used to cover the government's general 
expenditures, to pay down the debt with money belonging to those 
who contribute to a fund that has become a very regressive 
payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should know that premiums are paid on a maximum annual 
income of $39,000. This means that people earning $45,000 do not 
pay premiums on the extra $6,000 and, therefore, do not 
contribute their fair share toward this portion of the 
government's general expenditures. Those with the lowest 
earnings contribute more than their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, people like us, MPs, and all those who are 
self-employed, such as physicians and lawyers, those who do not 
pay into the plan, make no contribution whatsoever. They do not 
carry their share of the burden, not out of malice but simply 
because the government has turned this into a regressive payroll 
tax, allowing it to dip into the pockets of those most in need. 
And it did not stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 there has also been a terrible tightening up of EI 
eligibility criteria. Fewer people qualify. I heard the 
parliamentary secretary mention 88%. What she is saying is that 
88% of workers would qualify for benefits should they become 
unemployed. The purpose of the EI plan is to provide financial 
support not to those who have a job but to those who are 
unemployed. 
In this case, it is not 88% but rather 40% of the workers who 
really qualify for employment insurance when they lose their 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the reform, thousands of young people pay premiums from 
day one and in the end they never qualify for benefits. Only 25% 
of the unemployed young people qualify. This means that 75% of 
them are paying for nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we had many reasons to oppose the bill. We still 
played the parliamentary game and I think that in the end it 
will have paid off. Sixty or seventy groups were heard by the 
committee. The great majority of them were from Quebec and had 
been recommended by the Bloc Quebecois. 
One after the other they systematically told us that it was not 
Bill C-2 but real reform of the employment insurance system that 
they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about everything that was wrong with the bill. The 
committee unanimously adopted a motion that I brought forward. I 
will read it because I think it is the only message of hope 
we have on the whole employment insurance system. It reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
the Status of Persons with Disabilities report to the House of 
Commons all other amendments to the Employment Insurance Act and 
that this report be tabled to the House no later than June 1, 
2001. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between the November 2000 election and the date when parliament 
returned, the government did not do its homework. Perhaps the 
Liberals told themselves “Let us give it a try. Let us table 
Bill C-2 as if it were Bill C-44. It might work and we will not 
have to give them more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we were there to do our job. We heard witnesses in committee 
and they showed that many more amendments were required. All 
committee members, whether from the Liberal majority or the 
opposition, supported the motion that I proposed. I hope this 
will allow us to finish the job in the coming weeks, so that by 
early June we can have a new government bill that will correct 
the other flaws of the plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things that are unacceptable. Let us begin with 
the creation of an independent employment insurance fund. The 
frustrations of the workers and employers who appeared before us 
had to do with the fact that people contribute to a plan over 
which they have no control. They find this unacceptable. That 
issue will have to be debated again because it is not true that 
people who contribute to the plan will continue to give 33% of 
the money to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either the government will turn contributions into a payroll 
tax—and then we can make a complete overhaul—or we will have an 
independent fund but that issue is still on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other matters that are urgent as well, very important 
ones having to do with unemployed workers' bread and butter, 
such as abolishing the waiting period.  No benefits are paid 
during the first two weeks of a period of unemployment.  This is 
a throwback to the old Unemployment Insurance Act of the 1940s. 
Now that people pay premiums from the first hour, why must we 
still have this waiting period, which no longer exists in many 
countries? It should be abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coverage could also be increased from 55% to 60%.  Unemployed 
workers were among those who helped to pay down the deficit 
but they did not get tax breaks because they do not earn enough 
to qualify for any significant deductions.  One way of helping 
them would be to give them an adequate income between jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our seasonal workers also need a status which is independent of 
economic activity, because a period of growth like the one we 
are now experiencing has a negative effect on them.  We require 
them to work more hours to qualify but we allow them fewer 
benefit weeks when all is said and done, although they are in 
jobs which give them 15 or 20 weeks of work year in and year 
out, economic growth or no economic growth.  They do not get 25, 
30 or 40 weeks of work in forestry or tourism because the 
economy is booming.  They might get an extra week or two but 
not 8, 10, 12, or 15.  This is something that needs to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also discussed the whole issue of self-employed workers, of 
whom there are an increasing number in society.  They represent 
an important segment of the labour force but are not covered by 
any plan. 
It would be necessary to reflect, to make recommendations, to 
ensure people of worthwhile, minimal protection.  We need, 
to take advantage of the present situation since we 
sense that it is possibly going to lead to a downturn, or 
perhaps already has.  Before we get into a recession, or worse 
yet, a depression, we need to have a system in place that will 
provide people with enough to survive on.  I am willing to bet 
that the present system will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all manner of other improvements needed.  There is the 
discrimination toward young workers and women who are new to the 
workforce.  They will be required to have accumulated 
910 hours of work before being eligible for employment 
insurance. 
It has already been shown, although it took three years, based 
on the statistics, that the intensity rule was not having the 
desired results.  This has cost people $250 million since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I requested an amendment to Bill C-2 that would take the 
retroactivity back to January 1, 1997.  The reply from the 
minister, who had to authorize this, since royal assent was 
required, was “We find that is too much money to have to pay 
back to people”.  It was not, however, too much to take from 
them in the first place.  It was perfectly all right to take it 
from the low wage earners.  This is one more thing that needs 
examination and correction as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the whole matter of the older workers. 
We live in a society that has produced people who often have 
worked in a factory or in various sectors where there are 
massive layoffs as they reach the age of 45, 50, 52, 53, or 55. 
These people find themselves without a job and cannot easily be 
retrained for other types of work.  All the active measures 
are in place to help them learn other trades but it is 
not true that a forestry worker can be turned into a computer 
technician overnight.  There is a limit that cannot be crossed. 
There are people like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a society benefiting from gains in productivity but 
the government should have the courage to distribute them 
properly, to create a bridge so that when people 52, 54 and 55 
years of age cannot be reclassified in another job, we can find 
a way for them to carry on until they are entitled to their old 
age pension. 
This too is part of an employment insurance plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples but there are a whole lot of others 
that will have to be corrected by June 1. We must be able to 
make proposals.  In my opinion, the ultimate scenario is one in 
which there will be a number of proposals that could receive 
unanimous committee approval, I hope, and a number of others 
that will not but at least the door would be opened after five 
years' effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think back to 1995-96, after the employment insurance plan 
was tightened up. At the time, we said it was unacceptable. We heard the 
Prime Minister say “The unemployed are beer drinkers”, 
something he apologized for in the fall of 2000. 
The trend has been reversed but we must not stop halfway.  We 
must devise a real, adequate employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that all this is happening when the government is 
grabbing the fund's surplus and no longer wants to comply with 
the act's provisions requiring the system to balance out over a 
single economic cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary of the EI plan has said that a reasonable 
surplus to deal with any economic crisis would be in the order of 
$14 billion. Yet the current surplus is over $30 billion. The 
only way the government has found to avoid meeting its 
obligations is to remove from the EI commission the right to set 
the premium rates. We are faced with a situation that is not very 
pretty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we know why the government has done this, that is 
because the EI commissioners have gone as far as they could. They 
could not, in conscience, go any further and tell the government 
that it was reasonable to leave the premium at $2.25 when the 
plan could balance out with a premium of $1.75. The employers and 
the unions were unable to support the government's policy. 
Therefore, the way the government found was to say “We will 
remove your moral responsibility, we will remove from you the 
responsibility of making a decision and, thus, we will be able to 
do as we please”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this situation, we feel it is obvious that the 
legislation is still unacceptable. I say to all workers, all 
employers and all the unemployed that the representations were 
not made in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tenacity is important. 
A task has been given to the human resources standing committee. It 
has until June 1 to recommend further amendments to the 
employment insurance plan. I think a door is now open and we 
will be able to finally convince the government that it has a 
responsibility in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the finance department and the federal government are 
really intent on grabbing as much money as possible. With that 
money, they can then spend in all kinds of sectors that are not 
under their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witnesses who appeared before the committee and all 
those who have a good grasp of the situation have shown a great 
deal of tenacity. For one thing, they have certainly understood 
that the federal government has diverted their contributions to 
the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deduction on our cheque stub does not indicate general 
government expenses or payroll tax but employment 
insurance premium. For every $3 in premiums, $2 go to the EI 
fund and $1 to other expenses. This, people still find 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign and at the beginning of the debate on this 
issue, the Liberals accused the Bloc of stalling this marvellous 
bill and suggested that those we are supposed to stand for would 
not put up with our attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some checking. I went in the field and asked around to see 
whether ordinary citizens thought we were right to say that the 
bill was unacceptable, because it is not true that the 
government is doing its job by putting $500 million into a plan 
with a $28 billion surplus.  People said to us “Go and say that 
it is unacceptable for the government to help itself to the 
surplus like this.  Try to win other points, try to get them to 
see reason”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work we have done and the witnesses we have heard from are 
proof of people's tenacity.  I am not saying that the battle is 
over and won.  I am saying that we will have a chance in the 
next two months to submit a report through the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities, which will make it possible to finish 
the job and to bring about real EI reform.  I hope we 
finally achieve this result because we will have done our job.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After being told that people chose to be unemployed, after 
seeing something like the intensity rule imposed, we will have 
abolished it and we will realize that it is the same sort of 
situation with young people.  They are not going to work longer 
just because 910 hours are required.  They are going to work as 
long as there are jobs and opportunities and we give them a 
chance.  In this way, we are going to help the regions hang on 
to their resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important point.  For decades there was a social pact 
between Canada's resource regions and its central regions. 
We in the resource regions provided the raw materials: wood, 
wood products, agriculture and tourism.  In return, we had an EI 
plan that gave people a decent income during periods of 
unemployment, particularly during the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new EI plan, this pact has been broken.  Workers have 
seen their income support taken away and have been told to 
manage on their own.  In return, the government has not really 
given them anything to help them diversify their regional 
economies.  One of the consequences has been the exodus of young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in our areas, there are no young people to take over, it 
is a catch-22 situation that must be resolved. One of the tools 
we have to do it—and it is not the only one—is to provide 
reasonable eligibility conditions for employment insurance so 
that the young worker who has accumulated 600 hours is not 
forced to move in order to get the 300 missing hours, never to 
return after all the resources we put into training him. As we 
can see, there are still many things to be changed in the 
employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote against Bill C-2 because the government has decided 
to maintain the misappropriation of the premiums paid into the 
system. I believe that this attitude is responsible and that we 
have the opportunity to transform further the legislation. In 
that sense, I hope I will get the same support during the 
next few months. I also intend to consult the people and ask 
them what their priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well the requirements that should be in the 
employment insurance system.  We can 
negotiate efficiently until June with the government to find out 
what the priorities of the people are.  I will do that during the 
next few weeks.  I will try to ensure that we will be able to 
bring about other changes that will be those that the people 
really want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way, we will be able to carry out our mandate, which is 
to ensure an adequate distribution of wealth by means of a real 
employment insurance system and not a system by which the 
government puts in its pocket money coming from employers, 
employees and the unemployed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to address Bill C-2, not that I am pleased with 
Bill C-2 because it really does not go far enough. The standing 
committee on human resources development heard witnesses from all 
over Canada and more than 60 of them came here to Ottawa. I want 
to thank those who travelled to Ottawa to express their views on 
Bill C-2 concerning employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these witnesses said that Bill C-2 went far enough. 
They focused more on what was 
not in the bill. That is what was worrying them.  I want to 
thank them for coming to parliament and speaking on behalf of 
Canadian workers and even management.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We might look at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, which I have 
accused of not representing the chambers of commerce throughout 
the country. Its representatives were saying that employment 
insurance should not be changed and that it would not encourage 
people to relocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prince Edward Island Chamber of Commerce testified before 
the committee and said that it did not agree with the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce. It does not want people to relocate, it 
wants them to stay home. There are seasonal jobs in Prince 
Edward Island, in New Brunswick, in 
Newfoundland and in Nova Scotia. There are also some in the Gaspé 
peninsula, in Quebec, in northern Ontario and in northern 
Manitoba. 
I am sure my colleague from Winnipeg Centre will be able to tell 
me about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is the same in Saskatchewan, in Alberta and in 
British Columbia. I have travelled to all the provinces. I also 
went to Whitehorse in the Yukon. Everywhere I went, 
unemployment was a problem. Employment insurance was 
created to take care of the unemployed. This system belonged to 
employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the employment insurance reform happened in 1996, 
it was all fine and well at the time for employers to say “This 
is what we must do. We must encourage people to work”. They 
quickly realized that in small and medium size businesses in 
Canada, where up to 74% of jobs are to be found in an area like 
mine—in just one riding—we are losing $69 million in benefits 
every year. 
This means that small and medium size businesses lost all these 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who receive EI benefits do not have any money left once 
they have bought food and paid their debts. Who gets the money? 
The grocery stores and the banks where the car payments and the 
mortgage payments were made. They are the ones who get all the 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People soon realized that it was small and medium size businesses 
that lost the $35 billion that was taken away from workers. With 
all due respect, EI recipients are not likely to have two bank 
accounts with millions in them. Many of them do not have any 
money in their bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prince Edward Island Chamber of Commerce did well in 
representing seasonal workers when it appeared before the 
committee. Its representatives told us that they did not want the 
government to make any more cuts in the EI plan, that they wanted 
to see the plan restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 abolishes the intensity rule. As the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques said, this 
bill does not go far enough. Coverage should be increased to 60%. 
I would even push it further and say it should be increased to 
66%. It should be two-thirds of the salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must accept the fact that there are seasonal jobs in our 
country. We do not have seasonal workers. There is no such thing 
as a seasonal worker. Workers are not the ones who decide on a 
Friday that they will no longer have a job the following week. 
It is not the construction worker who decides. He does not decide 
if there will be construction work for him tomorrow or next week. 
It is not up to him. It depends on the health of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it many times before. They took the cart and put it 
before the horses. The horse has never been able to learn to push 
the cart. That is the problem. They have taken money away from 
the economy to help everybody. That is what the employment 
insurance plan was for in the 1940s. That is what it had been 
created to do, to help those who lost their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is criminal to take income away from people in the middle of 
winter. It is criminal to keep a lumberjack who works hard in the 
woods to make a living from getting employment insurance benefits 
to help provide for his family because his work is seasonal. That 
is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that people working in a fish plant cannot 
provide for their families because the Liberals decided to cut EI 
in 1996.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These same Liberals were saying back in 1992 that if they were 
elected they would eliminate the cuts made by Brian Mulroney. 
That is what they were saying in 1992. We have press cuttings to 
prove that. What they have done to workers and Canadian men and 
women is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the clawback clause. It is unfortunate 
that Canadian Alliance members keep saying that we are always on 
the side of workers who are constantly on EI. The unemployment 
insurance plan does not belong to the government or to a 
political party. It belongs to Canadian workers. It belongs to 
them and not to politicians. This money is not ours. It belongs 
to workers and employers who have contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that workers in the construction or 
automotive industry are laid off for two months, as is currently 
the case in Ontario, while their plant is being retooled to produce 
a new model, for example. It is unacceptable, in this day and 
age, that they do not have an income to meet the needs of their 
family during that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of parliament leave the House of Commons in June 
and come back in September, they keep their salary. 
Why should the salary of a construction worker be cut? Why should 
the salary of a worker in the automotive industry be cut? Why 
should we not treat these people as we would want to be treated? It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we know one thing. After I was elected I said that I 
would support any change to employment insurance which would go 
in the right direction. As far as I am concerned, abolishing the 
intensity rule is a first step; it is better than reducing it to 
45%. I support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the clawback rule, I support abolishing it and 
increasing the limit from $39,000 to $48,000. It is unfortunate, 
however, that the government changed its mind and decided to 
include clause 9 in Bill C-2. I will explain why. In so doing, it 
has made people wonder what the government has to do in an area 
where decisions were normally taken by the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it right from the start, in 1997, and I have repeated on 
several occasions in this House “The government stole the money 
anyway”. This will not stop me today from supporting the changes 
to the intensity rule and this will be my recommendation to my 
caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to ask for one thing from the government. 
With respect to the promises the government made during the 
election campaign—and this is not only about Bill C-2, because 
even the public works minister bragged about putting other 
measures on the table, in Quebec—I hope and ask that, as voted 
in committee, we will be able to make recommendations to the minister 
between now and June 1, and that she and the Prime Minister of 
Canada will show an open mind and that they will not do so for 
electoral purposes only. Real changes need to be made for the 
well-being of Canadian workers.

glad to have the opportunity to join my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst in pointing out some of the many shortcomings of 
Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by saying that I admire the work the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst has done.  He is, probably more than any member 
of parliament, a leading authority on the subject.  He took it 
upon himself to travel to every province in the country, I 
believe 28 cities and communities, to listen to workers and 
employers about EI and other issues.  He then wrote a very good 
report on the subject.  I urge all members to get a copy of the 
report and to listen to what people who really care about these 
issues have been telling us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to add to the comments of the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst.  He quite correctly pointed out that although 
there are some elements in Bill C-2 that we can support, such as 
doing away with the intensity rule and raising the clawback 
provisions to a reasonable level, it fails to address the real 
problem with employment insurance which is that hardly anyone 
qualifies any more. 
The bar is set so high on the eligibility rules that less than 
40% of all unemployed people qualify.  What kind of an employment 
insurance system—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Order, please.  I would 
like to point out to the member that he should ask a question or 
make a comment to the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When you were not in the chair it was decided that I would be 
splitting my time with the member for Winnipeg Centre and that is 
what we are presently doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  It is just that we are 
on questions and comments and I was urging the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre to make a comment or ask a question.  If the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre wants to ask his question, he may now 
go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I misunderstood.  I thought 
we had moved on from questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Acadie—Bathurst expand on one amendment 
that many groups brought to the committee?  These groups wanted 
to know why apprentices, who are in the trade school portion of 
the apprenticeship program, are penalized with a two week waiting 
period.  Would an amendment to Bill C-2 that would no longer 
penalize apprentices for that two week waiting period not have 
been more beneficial? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is something I did not 
address in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government changed the unemployment insurance in 1996, 
it used the argument that the changes were needed to promote 
employment and training programs.  At the same time, it punished 
the apprentices who attended apprenticeship programs at a 
community college by adding a two week waiting period, which was 
not there before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Minister of Finance wanted some extra 
money.  The government did not do what it intended to do.  It 
needed some cash and that is why today the government has $35 
billion in cash that it took away from the workers, which is not 
acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for my colleague for 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the government representative said that employment 
insurance was a social security system. It is not a social 
security system, it is an insurance plan. I would like to hear 
what my colleague has to say about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is right. The government 
would have us believe the EI plan is a social security system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government wants is that retirees who have worked all 
their life pay into a social security system. It wants to have 
people on welfare pay for a social security system. It wants 
these people to pay for the unemployed while we used to have in 
Canada a plan called unemployment insurance. It used to be the 
workers and the companies that were responsible for workers. It 
used to be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government came up with this idea and now the Canadian 
Alliance has adopted it. Out West they say “Cut employment 
insurance”. In Ottawa, they say “Cut employment insurance”. 
They come to our ridings at election time and say “If we are 
elected, we will increase the employment insurance coverage”. 
They have it all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a social security system, it is an employment 
insurance plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
devastating changes that were made to EI back in 1996 have really 
starved a lot of rural communities and ridings like my own, 
Winnipeg Centre.  The changes made to the EI system in my riding 
alone pulled $20.8 million per year of earnings out of my 
community.  That is money that will not be spent in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Acadie—Bathurst pointed out that this has an 
effect on small business.  Every dollar spent gets spent four 
times before it finds its natural state of repose, usually in 
some rich person's pocket, but it gets circulated in the 
community.  This has a huge impact on areas like mine which are 
economically depressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one riding in Newfoundland where the changes to EI 
pulled $57 million worth of benefits per year out of that riding 
alone.  It is no wonder the government is enjoying this 
incredible surplus, this incredible revenue generating machine. 
It is like a cash cow that I think the government has become 
addicted to.  It is like some provincial governments become 
addicted to gambling revenues.  This government has become 
addicted to the revenue generating ability of the EI fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started out by saying that there are two things in Bill C-2 of 
which we approve.  Those are doing away with the intensity rule 
and raising the clawback provision threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government failed to face were the two fundamental 
problems with EI.  One is the eligibility issue.  The bar is set 
far too high to qualify.  The second is the method with which it 
calculates the benefit that a claimant will receive or what we 
call the divisor rule.  It failed to address those two key 
fundamental issues.  As a result less than 40% of unemployed 
people actually qualify for unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of an employment insurance program is that?  What if 
we had a house insurance policy that we were forced to pay into 
but if our house burned down, we would have a less than 40% 
chance of getting any benefit whatsoever?  We would think we had 
just been cheated or hosed by some fraudulent insurance salesman. 
That is what the EI system is doing to unemployed workers today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a gender issue here too.  If the individual is an 
unemployed woman, she has less than a 25% chance of collecting 
any benefit whatsoever.  If the individual is an unemployed youth 
under the age of 25 he or she has a 15% chance of collecting even 
though the person is forced to pay into this insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that if we deduct money from people's paycheque 
for a specific purpose and then use it for something completely 
different, it is a breach of trust because we have developed a 
trust relationship with them when we told the them that if they 
paid into this insurance fund and were unlucky enough to become 
unemployed, we would pay a benefit.  That was the promise that 
was made.  Yet that is only true for less than 40% of Canadians, 
so it is a breach of trust.  In the best light it is a breach of 
trust.  In the worst light it is out and out fraud.  We have 
deceived Canadians into thinking they have an income security 
system in their employment insurance system but we are denying 
them the very benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious about improving the unemployment 
insurance system, it would have listened to the 60 presenters who 
came to the standing committee from all walks of life.  We had 
people from municipalities, chambers of commerce, labour groups 
and employer groups.  All of them found serious flaws in an 
insurance system that generates revenue for the government to the 
tune of $750 million a month, not per year.  Every month the 
employment insurance system pays the government $750 million in 
dividends.  That money goes directly into the general revenue. It 
is not even dedicated for any specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually heard the House leader of the ruling party once stand 
up and give us this logic.  He said that if the employment 
insurance system ran into a deficit, the government would have to 
pick up the loss and pay.  Therefore, when it was in a surplus 
position, the government should keep the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did some mathematics.  We added up all the times that the EI 
system has been a deficit situation.  The total, cumulative, 
aggregate amount of money that was ever paid into it when it was 
in deficit was $13 billion.  The total surplus is now $35 
billion, predicted to be $43 billion by the end of this year. 
Even if we accepted the government's logic, what about the other 
$25 or $28 billion?  Take back the $13 billion that was paid in 
and use the rest for income benefits and maintenance for the 
people for which the program was designed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only two designated uses for EI money in the act.  One 
is income maintenance for the unemployed and the other is 
apprenticeship and training.  We are not supposed to build 
highways with it, or paydown the deficit with it or give tax 
breaks to the wealthy with it.  That is not a designated use as 
contemplated under the act.  That is why I say when money is 
deducted from a person's paycheque for a specific reason and then 
it is used for something completely opposite, essentially that is 
a breach of trust in the very best possible light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst raised another point. Where 
does the government get off claiming ownership of that money at 
all?  In 1986 the federal government stopped paying into the UIC 
program.  That money is solely and exclusively contributions by 
employers and employees.  It used to be one third, one third, one 
third paid by the government.  It does not pay anything into it 
anymore.  Where does it get the proprietary right to any surplus? 
Where does it get the right to dictate what the contribution 
rate would be?

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, the government should have no say whatsoever.  It 
should take a small administration fee for administering the 
program.  The program should be run by those who are actually 
involved in it, which are the employers and the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been enormously frustrating in my whole career, first as 
a union leader and now as a member of parliament, to wrestle with 
a dysfunctional program such as employment insurance and to see 
the failure and mismanagement of a program.  Now it has gone 
beyond mismanagement.  I figure it is out and out abuse because 
it is using it as a revenue generator, which it was never 
intended to be.  It was there to provide income maintenance to 
people who were unfortunate enough to fall into a situation where 
they lost their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole EI program seems to be some kind of a tough love 
attitude now.  We are going to force these people to pull up 
their boot and get back into the workforce by starving them.  It 
seems to be based on the premise that most people would rather 
sit on EI than work.  I find that offensive.  As a working person 
myself, I find that an offensive attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This came up in 1987 when I think the Forget commission toured 
the country looking for amendments to the Employment Insurance 
Act.  It studied the UIC system.  One labour leader came before 
the commission and said that the government was always trying to 
find people who were ripping off the system or who were 
committing fraud in collecting unemployment insurance.  In actual 
fact, there are more federal government cabinet ministers 
convicted of fraud, on a per capita basis, than there are EI 
recipients convicted of fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, I believe seven or eight of Brian Mulroney's 
cabinet ministers were busted, caught and convicted of fraudulent 
activities.  In that same year only 200 unemployment insurance 
recipients were caught and busted for fraud.  Out of a million 
some odd people collecting EI, only 200 people were found to be 
actually committing a crime.   Out of 30 some odd cabinet 
ministers, eight or nine of them were convicted of fraud.  It is 
good to keep it in perspective sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment the government could have made, a very small cost 
factor and a change demanded by industry, was the issue I asked 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst about.  When apprentices 
were in the community college portion of their training, their 
eight-week community college instalment, whether plumbers, 
electricians or carpenters, the government started penalizing 
them with a two-week waiting period, as though they were 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apprentices are not unemployed when they are attending community 
college.  They still have jobs.  They still have attachments to 
the workforce.  They are simply going through the steps of the 
community college portion of their education and training.  Why 
then are apprentices being penalized this two week waiting 
period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the government to consider that at the committee stage. 
I personally asked the minister if she would entertain a friendly 
amendment to the act to give satisfaction to the many apprentices 
who are involved with this.  I even pleaded the case by pointing 
out that a lot of apprentices were choosing not to go on to their 
training component of their education because they could be 
without that two weeks' income.  A lot of apprentices were 
dropping out of the apprenticeship system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just one example of how the government did not listen to 
what Canadians were telling it was wrong with the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a regrettable day.  We are backed into a corner.  We are 
going to vote in favour of Bill C-2 to get through the few 
details that we would like to see go through.  However the 
government missed the mark.  It did not hit the nail on the head 
at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before putting 
a question to my colleague who just finished his speech, I would 
like to get back to what he said about the time when the 
government used to pay a third. It was one-third, one-third, one-third; 
in other words, the employees, the employers and the 
government each paid an equal share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with this bill that is going to become law, we realize 
that the government has stopped paying its share. It has 
completely changed its tune. Today, instead of paying its share, 
it is claiming ownership of the surplus. The government is 
taking 40% of the surplus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us, as individuals—and the trade unions also have 
mentioned it—know what we are talking about. If any group in 
society were caught taking money in this way, it would be 
charged with theft and we would quickly pass special legislation 
to prevent a reoccurrence. Now the government is passing 
legislation to steal from the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my colleague talked about this a bit, I would like to hear 
his thoughts on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member is 
speaking from the heart because he shares the frustration that 
many Canadians feel.  That is the government has no right to lay 
claim to the surplus and to use it for any purpose if it does not 
even contribute to the plan.  All the government does is 
administer the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it would be justifiable for it to charge some 
administrative fee for managing the program, but surely it does 
not have the right to take $750 million a month that should have 
gone to income maintenance for unemployed workers, and use it for 
anything it wants.  It is literally for anything the government 
wants because it goes into general revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government chose to do with the surplus is really 
galling, and I would ask the hon. member to try to imagine the 
optics of this.  It took the surplus from unemployed workers, 
arguably the most vulnerable people in the country, people who 
have lost their jobs, and squandered it on tax cuts for the 
wealthy.  The government chose to invest $100 billion of our 
money in tax cuts.  It is like a perverted form of Robin Hood, to 
rob from the poor to give to the rich. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have the circle that the government draws around areas of high 
employment, but within these areas of supposed high employment 
are pockets of small communities.  The residents of those 
communities are required to obtain the same number of qualifying 
hours to draw employment insurance benefits as those who are in 
the nucleus of the high employment centres.  Perhaps they are in 
small fishing communities where resource dictates and have had 
very little work in recent years.  Because their communities fall 
within the larger areas, consequently they require the same 
number of hours as the high employment centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that is fair and are these people being 
treated fairly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member points out 
one of the many inherent things that are not fair with the 
system.  When an arbitrary line is painted around a geographic 
region, it is not a homogeneous group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Winnipeg Centre is a good example.  The 
unemployment rate for the city of Winnipeg is about 4.9%.  The 
unemployment rate in my riding is 16%.  Frankly, we would be 
disadvantaged because the geographic area for EI would be ranked 
at the 4% or 5% unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of those major irritants that people in economically 
depressed areas feel about the EI system, and it is one of the 
examples of how it is not meeting the needs of unemployed 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to the last question that was put to the hon. 
member.  In southwestern New Brunswick communities that depend on 
seasonal workers are lumped in with bigger communities like Saint 
John, my riding, and Fredericton which have their own 
unemployment problems.  That makes the numbers artificially low 
in areas where they are in fact a lot higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saint John, New Brunswick, they talk about the unemployment 
rate being around 8%.  People in Blacks Harbour, which is not too 
far from Saint John, are lumped in with us.  The unemployment 
rate in Blacks Harbour is 45%, but because it is lumped in with 
us they say the unemployment rate there is 7% or 8%.  That is not 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the intensity rule is being changed in the 
bill.  However there is a great need for other changes in the 
bill that have not been addressed.  Our people need their 
dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of us in the House of Commons is able to go home and 
feed our families.  We are able to dress them.  Some have young 
people going to college.  I wonder if members ever stop to think 
about the people coming into my constituency office who can no 
longer afford to feed their families.  Never have my city and my 
riding been like this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four thousand men worked at the shipyard.  Those men made good 
salaries and contributed to the economy.  Things were booming. We 
had the Atlantic sugar refinery before the government took it 
away from us and closed it down.  Those men also contributed to 
the economy.  We had VIA Rail and those men contributed to the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  And women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, and women as well, the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough reminds me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should look at what it is like today.  It tugs at my 
heart.  A man who worked at the shipyard came to me almost with 
tears in his eyes.  They no longer have EI and they do not have 
another job.  I had never seen this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want welfare.  They want their dignity.  As far as I 
am concerned, if they go on welfare they will have their dignity 
because they will not have done so by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose Bill C-2 and Bill C-44 were designed to make 
significant changes to our employment insurance system, and all 
of us here would hope for the better.  However that is not 
necessarily what has happened.  Most of the debate surrounding 
Bill C-2 relates to what has been called the intensity clause, 
which would see claimants' benefits reduced if they have had to 
seek employment insurance with greater frequency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bathurst, New Brunswick, there was a former Liberal member 
who was in the cabinet.  Do hon. members remember?   I will never 
forget when the government brought in the new EI regulations. The 
people were hurting.  The parish priest, on a Sunday, marched 
down the main street in Bathurst with the people. Never before 
had a parish priest done that.  The hon. member who sat in the 
cabinet told the priest he should have something better to do on 
a Sunday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do hon. members know what happened?  Because of what happened 
and what the government did, the member was not re-elected. 
Nineteen members in the Atlantic region were not re-elected. When 
the Liberals almost got wiped out in the Atlantic region the 
government said it had better do something and take another look.

steel.  Other jobs are created because of all the equipment 
needed for the ships.  We should be dealing with the issue in the 
House of Commons instead of having a press conference.  I am 
really upset about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the peoples' House.  The government should come in here 
with the bills and tell us what changes will be made.  It 
should come in here and tell us if a shipyard will be in P.E.I., 
or Nova Scotia or Saint John, New Brunswick. It should not ask us 
to read about it in the newspaper.  We do that these days with 
everything.  We pick up a newspaper or turn on a TV to find out 
what is happening instead of finding out in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member in the House knows that some men and women must 
take on seasonal work.  Let us look at Newfoundland.  For 
heaven's sake, with the storms it has had do members think people 
there can go out and plant flowers this week like they can in 
Vancouver?  Do members think they can go out and plant potatoes? 
No. They have had snow for the last six months in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  There is a ban in P.E.I. because of 
potato wart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  That is right.  There is a ban in 
P.E.I. and that will have a tremendous effect on its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the changes to the intensity clause and the clawback are 
a small step in the right direction, we will join our NDP 
colleagues in voting in favour of the bill.  However no member in 
the House should think for one minute that we will sit here and 
be idle.  We will work until the government corrects the bill all 
the way and makes it fair and just for all the men and women who 
want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people want to work 12 months of the year.  Do members 
know how much some of them make?  Some of them make $240 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Some get a lot less than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, that is right.  That amount is 
before they pay their EI premiums and clawbacks.  After those are 
paid they make around $200.  How does a family feed a child?  How 
does a family buy Nike sneakers for their child so they can be 
like the boy or girl who sits next to them in school?   How do 
they do that on $200 a week? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for all of us in the House to come together and 
make those men, women and children our number one priority, not 
the large corporations.  I am not opposed to corporations.  They 
create jobs.  However let us be fair and just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How come the government can take a surplus of $35 billion from 
the workers?  It does not belong to the minister or to the 
government.  The hon. member from Newfoundland, who is sitting 
over there blushing, knows that.  He bloody well knows that money 
does not belong to the government. 
He knows it belongs to workers in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. 
The hon. member from P.E.I. knows it as well.  His face is as red 
as an apple.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, indeed.  We will fight for an 
independent commission to look after that money.  There is no way 
it should be used to pay down the debt.  There are men and women 
who need that money.  They paid into employment insurance but are 
not eligible to receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all my colleagues.  We will all vote in favour of 
the bill but we will not let the issue go away.  We need more 
changes.  We need more members to speak out and to work to make 
sure our people have dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe someone out west would say that people in the 
maritimes are sitting with their hands out, that we are lazy and 
that we do not want to work.  I cannot believe anyone would say 
that about our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people from B.C. and Alberta come to the maritime provinces 
they say it is the most beautiful part of Canada and that the 
people are wonderful, kind and gracious.  In Atlantic Canada that 
is how people are.  They reach out to their neighbour.  They help 
each other.  We in the maritime provinces will continue to build 
this country and to make all Canadians equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my colleagues on the government side to please take 
another look at the bill and to lower EI premiums for those who 
pay in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member</B>  And to keep the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  To keep the service, yes indeed.  It is 
important for employers as well.  If employers pay lower premiums 
they can expand and create jobs.  That is what we are looking 
for.  That is what we are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on 
behalf of our people back home and on behalf of all people across 
the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my colleague from Saint John talked about workers who take home 
$200 a week.  Would she comment on the ones who take home nothing 
at all because of the changes to employment insurance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country, which is supposed to be the best country in the 
world, there are people who do not qualify for EI from February 
until May.  They do not make $200 a month, they make nothing at 
all.  It is unfair and unjust.  People have to go on welfare but 
when they start to work again they must pay the welfare back to 
their provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear how the member feels about her part of New 
Brunswick, the province I come from.  It is important that this 
be said here to all Canadians.  In what is supposed to be the 
best country in the world we have people with no earnings at all. 
It is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know what 
happened to the Liberals' values.  I do not know where they went. 
The clawback of welfare is unbelievable.  We are supposed to have 
EI for the dignity of our people.  That is what it is there for. 
However this measure took away the dignity of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little girl came to see me at my riding office and she was 
crying.  She asked me to help her.  She told me her father did 
not have work and that he would need to go to the United States. 
She said she did not want to leave her nanny and grampy and aunts 
and uncles who were there.  There is no way that this should 
happen.  We need to make changes to restore the quality of life 
of Canadians from coast to coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ) </B>moved that Bill 
C-209, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (Public Transportation 
Costs), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague, the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke, for seconding the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the residents of the riding of Jonquière, whom I 
have the honour to represent in this House, I want to say it is a 
real pleasure to speak today to Bill C-209, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act, which was selected as a votable item by the 
subcommittee on private members' business. The bill would 
provide tax deductions to those who use public transit in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might wonder what brought me to introduce this bill. Why 
give tax deductions to the people who use public transit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I have political reasons for doing so. I would like to 
remind members that in 1999 the House of 
Commons passed by a vote of 240 to 25 a motion brought forward by 
Nelson Riis, the former NDP member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys, which asked the government to consider granting 
a tax exemption for the use of public transit.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then the Liberal government has taken no concrete 
measures on this issue. It has taken no action whatsoever, either 
by introducing a bill or a national policy to implement the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many stakeholders believed that the government was going to 
act and lobbied for such a bill to be introduced. To this end, 
close to 40,000 postcards signed by citizens were sent to the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to salute several of them, Claude Bonhomme and 
Georges Gratton of the Société de Transport de l'Outaouais, the 
Corporation intermunicipale de transport du Saguenay, Michael 
Roschlau and Amelia Shaw of the Canadian Urban Transit 
Association, the Centre for Sustainable Development, the David 
Suzuki Foundation, the Canadian Railroad Association and many 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that when employees enjoy the benefits 
linked to public transportation, they have to pay taxes. However, 
most people who are entitled to free parking pay no taxes on this 
benefit. This situation is a major disincentive to using public 
transportation. It must be rectified immediately. As a matter of 
fact, some employers have already started paying for annual bus 
passes for their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This solution is very forwardlooking but it could be improved 
upon. Giving a deduction to all public transportation users is 
desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly a person using public transportation saves a lot of 
money. I will show how. Owning and using a car costs 
around $8,000 a year, not to mention parking costs.  A public 
transportation network pass only costs between $500 and 
$1,000 a year, which is a substantial saving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this comparative advantage, public transit ridership 
dropped significantly in this country between 1990 and 1996, 
which is very serious because the drop in ridership is at the 
root of many problems including increased greenhouse gas 
emissions, increased traffic congestion, increased energy 
consumption, higher road infrastructure building and maintenance 
costs, and decreased quality of life in cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the federal government needs to provide 
assistance to those using public transportation, while respecting 
provincial areas of jurisdiction, in order to encourage greater 
use of these services.  The bill does so by providing tax 
deductions to users of public transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-209 is part of such assistance.  It amends the Income Tax 
Act so as to allow individuals to deduct certain costs incurred 
for the use of public transportation when calculating their 
income tax.  For the purposes of this section, “Public 
transportation” includes a public transportation service by bus, 
subway, commuter train or light rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid abuse, the individual will need to provide 
documentation to support the amounts claimed for public 
transportation. I must point out here that this tax benefit will 
be available only to people purchasing monthly or yearly passes. 
This will make the accounting far easier, while avoiding 
potential fraud. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it will encourage people to buy passes rather than 
tickets and this will substantially improve transport company 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone doubts the appropriateness of my bill, I will list a 
few of the advantages to this method of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first relates to the development of outlying centres and 
areas.  Hon. members may find this surprising but public 
transportation ranks second in popularity.  According to recent 
polls 52% of Canadians in urban areas use it occasionally and 
30% regularly. 
They contribute as well to the prosperity of the downtown core. 
In addition to taking people to work, public transit takes people 
to the shopping areas of the major centres.  It is therefore a 
subtle but very present economic force.  In addition to the 
aspect of economic force, there is an issue of equality behind my 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to employment, education, health care and community 
services depends largely on a quality and accessible public 
transit system.  Public transit is extremely important to 
students, seniors and people on low income who do not have the 
means to buy a car or who decide simply to not have one.  Also, 
to everyone looking for work, public transit is an exceptional 
incentive but it cannot cost a fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my party's critic for regional and rural development, I can 
say that in addition to fostering economic growth in the major 
centres, my bill would foster regional development, in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that the communities' transportation budgets are 
not very high and service to low population density areas is 
especially limited.  Permitting deductions will mean increased 
revenues for the transportation companies, which will be able to 
offer a better service in these areas.  In my riding, I am 
thinking specifically of the municipalities of Larouche, 
Lac-Kénogami, Shipshaw and Laterrière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second benefit goes to the environment.  The environmental 
contribution of public transit is this bill's essential element. 
Members know as well as I do that protecting and improving our 
environment is a major concern for many Canadians and Quebecers. 
In fact, from an environmental point of view, the bill is an 
ideal solution for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, under the Kyoto protocol, the government undertook to 
reduce by 6% domestic greenhouse gas emissions by the year 
2010-12 based on the 1990 level. The situation has only gotten 
worse since. According to some experts, Canada could exceed the 
1990 level by 25%. Others, including the federal Minister of 
Natural Resources, think that this figure could be as high as 
35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While stakeholders' opinions may vary, the fact remains that 
Canada is far from achieving its objectives. Ironically, the 
federal government is boasting about spending in excess of $1 
billion over a five year period to deal with climate changes. 
Also, it is very unfortunate to see that the government is only 
investing that money in foundations that ultimately create 
duplication because such bodies already exist in provinces like 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810
<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of investing $1 billion in duplication, the government 
should take immediate and concrete action. In this respect, my 
bill is a step in the right direction since it proposes a much 
cheaper solution than all the investments made by the Department 
of the Environment in its programs or foundations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, in his last annual report, the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development was very critical of the 
Minister of the Environment. He said that the government has 
trouble putting its words into actions in the fight against smog. 
I extend my hand to the government and to the Minister of the 
Environment. I am providing him with an opportunity to act. He 
should forget about the millions spent in all his bureaucratic 
organizations. 
The measure I am proposing will cost much less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these figures are not theoretical, for there is indeed an 
impact on society.  Let us not forget that as many as 16,000 
Canadians die each year from the effects of high pollution levels 
in major cities.  The number of children hospitalized for asthma 
increased by 23% between 1980 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public transportation is therefore the ideal solution to this 
disastrous state of affairs because a single bus can carry as 
many passengers as 40 or 50 cars.  In addition, its toxic gas 
emissions per kilometre are a mere one-quarter of those 
produced by the cars.  As an example, the air pollution in a 
major Canadian city increased by 20% when public transportation 
services were suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmentally, although it is vital that more people opt for 
public transportation, there is unfortunately no national 
transportation policy that would encourage them to do so.  It is 
therefore clear to me that a tax deduction would have this effect 
and would improve air quality in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally some pettyminded souls will say that this measure is 
costly and hard to monitor.  To them I would say that right now 
the federal government is not putting one red cent into public 
transportation.  In comparison, the United States is investing 
$41 billion over six years in this sector.  The problem of 
traffic jams and excessive fuel consumption continues to be an 
important problem which the bill is designed to correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to all these benefits, there is also a benefit when 
it comes to traffic jams and energy consumption. 
The federal government should not be looking only at the numbers 
when considering this type of initiative.  There are many 
qualitative benefits to be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction of greenhouse gases is only one of many examples 
of these benefits. It could also help reduce traffic buildups. 
Earlier, I mentioned that one bus could carry as many passengers 
as 40 or 50 cars. In large urban centres, 50% of the population 
already uses public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if all STCUM clients travelled by car, they could 
fill, bumper to bumper, a highway that would stretch from 
Montreal to Gaspé. That is over 900 kilometres. One can imagine 
what would happen if public transit disappeared overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the growing popularity of public transit in the greater 
Montreal area, rush hour traffic remains extremely heavy. This 
means that public transit does its share but there is still room 
for improvement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take no more than a simple incentive, like the one 
proposed in my bill, to make public transit not only a way of 
going from place to place but a way of life. This incentive 
should be in the form of a tax deduction for public transit 
users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, with gas prices on the rise, many people would like to 
use public transit to remedy this situation but if they do not 
have access to adequate service in suburban areas they have no 
choice but to use their cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again, Bill C-209 would lead to a huge increase in 
revenues for those transit companies providing the best service. 
My dearest wish would be to see us as a society manage to 
decrease our dependency on fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address the advantages from the 
infrastructure point of view.  The excessive use of cars is 
extremely costly to governments in terms of highway 
infrastructure.  We need to realize that vehicles are hard on our 
roads, so it is our duty as parliamentarians to seek to reduce 
the harm done.  I am sure that encouraging an increased use of 
public transportation will decrease the number of cars on the 
roads of Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may wonder what degree of additional use of public 
transportation my bill would bring about. I wish to inform 
everyone here and those who have the pleasure of watching us 
this evening that in the San Francisco area public 
transportation use rose 31% among those benefiting from a limited 
exemption.  When this was expanded, the figure went even higher. 
It could therefore be estimated that my bill might bring about a 
similar increase if it were passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the purpose of Bill C-209 is to do away with an 
inequity.  Some people have employer subsidized parking, which 
encourages them to use their cars rather than take non-subsidized 
public transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that cars are the principal source of exhaust emissions, 
which are harmful to human health.  We also know that the number 
of children hospitalized because of asthma rose 23% between 1980 
and 1990. 
It costs about $1 billion a year to treat diseases caused by 
noxious gases resulting from automobile emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the best way to lower congestion. If all public 
transit users in the Montreal area were to take their cars, the 
duration of any trip would triple and come to an average of about 
an hour and a half. A single bus keeps 40 to 50 cars off the 
streets and one light rail train replaces 15 cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also provide an affordable alternative to consumers who 
are being gouged at the pumps. If cars are kept off the streets, 
our roads would remain in better shape for a longer period of 
time and we would not have to invest millions of dollars each 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close, I want to point out that the House will be asked 
to vote on this private member's bill in the next few weeks. I 
feel it is important to mention that it will be a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this important issue, I urge all members to keep an open mind 
and vote in favour of the bill to ensure a safe environment for 
their children and grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on 
Bill C-209, introduced by the member for Jonquière. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, the bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to 
permit individuals to deduct an undetermined percentage of their 
public transportation costs.  These costs would include service 
by bus, subway, commuter train or light rail.  To be eligible for 
a tax deduction, individuals would be required to provide 
supporting vouchers indicating the amounts paid for the use of an 
eligible public transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the bill goes beyond or is different 
from what has been proposed by the Canadian Urban Transit 
Association.  Notwithstanding that, this is an excellent 
initiative on behalf of the private member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by emphasizing that this government is very much 
committed to seeking ways to encourage more individuals to use 
public transportation systems in order to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.  In fact, addressing climate change is a priority of 
our Opportunity for All agenda.  Encouraging greater use of 
public transportation could certainly help us move toward this 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the specific option of a tax deduction for public 
transportation costs, I would point out that some important 
fairness and effectiveness considerations should be taken into 
account.  Let me take a moment to explain some of the 
difficulties the bill raises. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is not clear that this measure would result in the 
desired increases in the number of public transit users.  The 
measure does not address the matter of new users and therefore 
we may imagine that it would be current users of public transport 
who would benefit the most from it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the cost of public transit is often a small 
factor in an individual's transportation choice when weighed 
against other considerations such as accessibility, convenience 
and personal preference.  Consequently, if the increase in 
ridership was small, there would be little benefit in terms of 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also consider the fairness of introducing a tax measure 
that would mostly benefit individuals residing in large urban 
centres with extensive public transit systems. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inhabitants of smaller centres and rural areas, where 
accessible and convenient public transport is not always 
available, would not benefit from this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that the tax system generally does not 
make provision for individual costs, such as public transit 
costs, in particular. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it did, it would be equivalent to asking Canadians in general 
to subsidize the personal expenses of other individuals.  This 
would not be fair, as personal expenses vary widely across 
individuals and reflect to some extent the personal preference of 
the individual incurring them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the importance of examining cost 
effective ways of encouraging energy efficiency and renewable 
energy.  The government also believes that building on existing 
initiatives announced in recent budgets would likely achieve 
greater environmental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also take this opportunity to explain some of the 
initiatives the government has already put in place to improve 
our environmental performance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000, the government allocated $700 million over a 
four year period to preserve and improve the natural 
environment, develop new technologies and effectively meet the 
challenges posed by climate change. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this initiative, the government allocated $100 
million to the establishment of a green municipal investment fund 
to provide loans in support of municipal projects in areas such 
as urban transit, energy conservation and waste diversion.  An 
additional $100 million was also set aside for the establishment 
of a sustainable development technology fund to promote the 
development and demonstration of new environmental technologies, 
particularly those aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the environmental initiatives announced in budget 2000, 
the government also earmarked an additional $210 million over 
three years for the climate change action fund, which was set up 
in the 1998 budget to help Canada respect its international 
commitments on climate change.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligible initiatives under this program include those that 
demonstrate the best urban transportation technologies and 
strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In building on 
these investments, in our economic statement and budget update of 
October 18, 2000, the government allocated an additional $500 
million over five years to address key environmental challenges 
such as climate change and pollution.

be consulting with other orders of government and the private

has allocated upward of $2.6 billion to this initiative over the 
next five years.  Urban transit projects will be an essential 
component of this joint effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am sure that all hon. members present today 
share, like myself, a very strong commitment to encourage greater 
use of public transportation systems in order to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.  However, in light of what I have 
discussed, I hope hon. members also realize that providing a tax 
deduction for public transportation costs may not be the 
appropriate measure to achieve this outcome.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise 
this early evening to address Bill C-209, which seeks to amend 
the Income Tax Act and allow individuals to deduct certain public 
transportation costs from the exorbitant amount of income tax the 
government opposite extracts from them each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the hon. member for Jonquière for 
bringing forward an insightful and innovative amendment to the 
Income Tax Act.  The merits of the bill are numerous, not just 
for individuals but for society as a whole, and I am delighted to 
bring some of them to the attention of the House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps before I do, I will just digress for a moment from my 
speech to say that I was very disappointed in the remarks made by 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  It is 
quite obvious from his remarks that the government has decided 
yet again that it will be advocating that all the Liberal members 
vote against this particular legislation, and that should come as 
no surprise.  The government is increasingly reluctant to offer 
Canadians any form of tax relief and of course that is what the 
bill sets out to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seem to have struck a nerve over there because I hear them 
heckling even though hardly any of them are in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the remarks made by the parliamentary 
secretary dealt almost entirely with how the Liberals can shovel 
money out the door in all their grandiose programs and plans of 
how to spend tax dollars rather than offer Canadians tax relief. 
That is indicative of the way the government has operated and 
continues to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the bill itself, the first benefit is the most obvious, 
that is, this amendment to the Income Tax Act would reduce the 
tax burden on Canadians, something the government opposite is 
reluctant to do and something our party has been advocating for 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not go so far as to reduce taxes to the levels we 
have been promising Canadians, but it will nevertheless provide 
relief to some Canadians who so desperately need it.  I am 
referring to the thousands of students, seniors and low income 
Canadians who rely on public transit as their sole source of 
transportation.  For these people, driving their car to work or 
school is not an option since they usually do not have that 
luxury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need look no further than my eldest daughter, who lives with 
me in Ottawa and does not have the luxury of even owning a car. 
She is a struggling student, as so many are in our country, a 
fourth year student at Carleton, and she travels for about an 
hour and a half every day to get to university and then to get 
home in the afternoon or evening.  She spends about three hours 
every day on public transit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not unique to my daughter.  Many students and many 
working Canadians in our country have to face similar long hauls 
on public transit.  Without the public transit system, many of 
these people would be forced to quit their jobs or drop out of 
school.  Without public transit, seniors would be unable to 
access essential services such as health care.  Providing these 
people with a deduction for the expense of public transportation 
will not give them a windfall by any means.  However, as anyone 
who has experienced the struggle of living paycheque to paycheque 
knows, every dollar does count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also benefits to society beyond the immediate benefit 
to the individuals who use public transit.  The implementation of 
this amendment would provide an incentive for commuters to leave 
their cars at home and begin or go back to using public transit. 
Often the cost of driving is only marginally higher than the cost 
of public transit.  Most people usually elect to drive for no 
other reason than the sheer convenience of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics on public transit highlight this trend.  Only 19% 
of Canadians are frequent transit users and 11% of them are 
semi-frequent users while 22% are occasional users.  An 
astonishing 48% of Canadians do not use transit at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment will widen the gap between the cost of driving 
and the cost of public transit, giving public transit greater 
appeal and reducing the number of cars on the road.  This single 
action is where the benefits to society begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the immediate benefits would be to the environment and 
consequently to the air we all breathe.  For every bus we are 
able to fill, we are able to take up to 50 cars off the road. 
This is a critical number when we consider that six of seven 
major air pollutants come from cars and light trucks, which emit 
four tonnes of pollutants every year on average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Canada made an international commitment to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 emission levels by 
2008-12.  Despite the fact that Canada has yet to ratify the 
agreement, there is no reason for us not to at least attempt to 
meet our commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could simply follow the precedent established by our 
neighbours to the south and renege on our international 
commitment because of the downturn in the economy.  However, this 
is not an option for Canada since we are consistently reminded by 
the Minister of Finance that Canada is immune to a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for the environment, this means that the Canadian 
government could withstand the minor tax exemption such as the 
one being proposed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also of benefit to Canadians, which may not be as apparent as 
the immediate benefits to the environment, are the numerous 
benefits that accompany a reduction in the congestion on our 
roadways.  Congestion is very costly to Canadians in terms of its 
impacts on the economy and road infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent studies in Canada, the U.S. and Australia have estimated 
that congestion costs in urban areas are in the order of $1,000 
annually per household.  It therefore stands to reason that if 
businesses are able to move their goods to market more 
efficiently the cost of goods will go down.  This is yet another 
example of how the bill would improve the lives of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The toll that congestion takes on our roads is self-evident.  We 
have all experienced first hand the deplorable state of our 
national highways, the gridlock occurring in our major cities and 
the inability of growing towns to expand their existing road 
systems to accommodate population growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it very clear that it does not intend to 
spend any more than the current 4.1% of the $5 billion it 
collects in fuel taxes on improving our roadways.  If we intend 
to retain the antiques we have, without further deterioration, we 
have to reduce the number of people using them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would hopefully provide the incentive for the people of 
Canada to take action where the government refuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could continue with my praise of the bill, but I would like to 
take a few minutes to make a few comments on the whole issue of 
private members' bills and their place within the House.  Each 
year the members elected to the House bring forward their ideas 
for improving the lives of all Canadians.  More often than not, 
these ideas are allowed to fall off the order paper without 
having been given, in my opinion, due consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been extremely fortunate that in the past two months my 
name has been drawn consecutively in the two private members' 
draws.  This was an unprecedented opportunity for me to select 
and to present two of my six private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first, Bill C-237, was a bill that would have amended the 
Divorce Act to ensure that divorcing parents begin custody 
discussions on an equal footing.  They would start out with joint 
custody and work from there.  The bill was intended to remove 
children from the often bitter battles that accompanied marital 
breakdown to ensure that they could not be used as pawns during 
settlement negotiations.  Put simply, the bill would have put the 
children's interests ahead of the divorcing parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill was not considered important enough to vote on 
by the private members' committee so it fell off the order paper 
after one hour of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second bill, Bill C-272, has not yet been debated but 
regrettably has been handed the same sentence:  a one hour debate 
before it too drops from the order paper.  The bill would have 
allowed adoptive parents a one time income tax exemption for 
expenses incurred during the adoption of a child.  Unfortunately, 
the bill has also succumb to the same fate as my previous bill 
despite the apparent benefits to Canadian families and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate the limited time the House has to consider 
legislation each year, I believe that as elected members we could 
be doing a better job of how we select and debate private 
members' legislation.  An opportune time for us to examine these 
procedures is during the all party discussions on parliamentary 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected members, we owe it to our constituents to find a more 
effective means of bringing bills with merit into law.  I am 
pleased that the process worked in favour of this particular 
private member's bill, Bill C-209, and I am pleased to express my 
support for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up by saying that I really hope the bill passes.  I 
hope that it does not succumb to the same unfortunate treatment 
as my previous bill in the last parliament.  That particular 
bill, after a lot of work and with the support of the majority 
government, the Liberals, was passed on to the justice committee. 
However, in the end, the Prime Minister called a premature 
election and the bill died at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill today, should it pass, would go to the finance 
committee where hopefully it will not suffer the same fate as my 
last bill.  I urge all members to do support the bill and to vote 
for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, after hearing some of the comments from the member for 
the government side, I will alter some of my comments.  It was 
forced upon me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by indicating that we in the NDP support 
the private member's bill put forward by the Bloc member for 
Jonquière.  We welcome the initiative that it shows.  It is just 
one of a number of incentives and initiatives that would go some 
distance to resolving some of the problems we have with the 
burning of fossil fuel and other health and environmental 
problems that arise as a result of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the claims by my friend from the Liberal Party 
about all the things the Liberals have done, let me tell members 
about a personal experience I had in my home riding of 
Windsor—St. Clair because of something the Liberals did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The automotive company, Chrysler at the time, made an 
arrangement with its union, CAW, whereby Chrysler's employees, 
who were members of the union, could purchase a large van at a 
reduced price to be used as a commuter van.  A number of people 
who were commuting to the auto plant lived quite a distance away, 
some as far as 50 to 60 kilometres.  The arrangement was that the 
employees could purchase a van at a reduced amount and that they 
would use the van during the week to transport other employees 
who were also commuting. 
This arrangement reduced the number of private vehicles being 
used by employees to between eight and ten, depending on the area 
of the county they were commuting from.  It really was a 
substantial reduction in the use of private vehicles. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This went on for a couple of years and, lo and behold, the 
employees heard from Revenue Canada.  All of a sudden these 
employees were being attributed a taxable benefit, and it was 
substantial.  In most cases it averaged out to several thousand 
dollars a year and had to be paid back retroactively for the two 
years.  This was a great endeavour on the part of the employer, 
an automotive company, and its employees to reduce the use of 
vehicles, and that was the response they received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another specific issue I want to mention, which has already been 
mentioned by my friend from Jonquière, is the effect automobiles 
have on infrastructure, especially on our roadways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home city of Windsor has a major problem with its roadways. 
As a direct result of the trade agreements and the amount of 
traffic those agreements have generated from Michigan and the 
U.S. generally, our roadways, which were designed to last 20 to 
30 years, will now need to be replaced every 10 years or less. 
This will be paid for by the municipality.  The initiatives we 
have is a great one because it would substantially reduce traffic 
and extend the lifespan of our roadways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make about the trade agreements concerns 
the amount of increased air pollution and the environment.  In 
the last month or two the environment committee, under NAFTA, 
which is based in Montreal, issued a report that specifically 
proved that the amount of air pollution has increased as a result 
of NAFTA,  This is air pollution that has been identified as 
having increased quite dramatically in the Quebec City to Windsor 
corridor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we would be looking for with this type of initiative in the 
bill is to reduce traffic.  If we got the cars off the highway to 
some degree, it would make it easier for trucks to move along. We 
would have less air pollution from trucks because they would not 
be stalled and sitting in any number of locations, as is the 
problem at the Windsor-Detroit border and in a number of places 
along that corridor.  If we could reduce the amount of auto 
traffic, it would make it easier for vehicles to move and would 
therefore reduce the amount of environmental degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in the riding that I do, we often hear accusations that 
if we pursue these environmental type initiatives, which I see 
the private member's bill to be, it may jeopardize the jobs of 
auto workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour movement in this country has developed a transition 
program to deal with the changes that will inevitably occur as we 
move away from the extensive use of automobiles and the burning 
of fossil fuels by automobiles and, more generally, by factories 
and residences.  This program would require government assistance 
and the co-operation of the labour movement, the employers and 
the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one that we will hear much more about over the next decade 
as we shift our lifestyle.  As my friend from the Bloc indicated, 
it will require a just transition type of program to be put in 
place so that retraining will occur in the labour market.  There 
may have to be some tax incentives in other areas.  Compensation 
and assistance may have to be given to municipalities to deal 
with the transitions they would go through, and that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the assistance that comes from initiatives to move 
away from the attachment we have had to the automobile, other 
jobs will be created.  As more public transit is used we will 
have an increase in the manufacture of trains, big vans and big 
or small buses.  There will be more manufacturing of those 
vehicles, which would replace the loss of the manufacture of 
private vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we move to alternate fuels we would be looking at the 
manufacture of wind turbines and windmills.  This manufacturing 
process is quite adaptable to the plants that already manufacture 
automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The just transition program the labour movement has been 
developing analyzes all of this information.  It will not be easy 
but it will be a useful mechanism that could be used to get 
through that transition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in one of those phases, much as we were at the start of 
the last century when we moved away from the use of horses and 
the vehicles they drew.  We will move away from total usage of 
private automobiles.  It is an exciting time to be doing so.  An 
initiative such as this is one of many that has to be followed. I 
urge the government to look at these initiatives and to move 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many questions in the last few days regarding the 
Kyoto protocol.  My friend from the Conservative Party urges me 
to think in terms of not just getting the bill passed and 
ratified but beginning to implement it.  Earlier this afternoon 
the minister was discussing this subject with some media people. 
I feel he is beginning to get the same message: that we have to 
move in that direction.  I will wrap up by acknowledging and 
praising the work done by the hon. member for Jonquière.  Our 
party will support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to have an opportunity to participate in the debate 
this evening.  The overall context of the issue we are talking 
about is how it can improve environmental initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Jonquière is a very strong environmental 
member of parliament.  That is why she has brought forth Bill 
C-209. Thank goodness for her bringing forth an environmental 
issue. The government has been very reticent from a legislative 
perspective over the last seven years to bring anything forward 
respecting the environment. Over the last seven years it has 
passed zero environmental pieces of legislation of its own 
initiative.  There has been the mandatory review of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, but we never saw that proactive 
initiative in the same context as we saw during the Conservative 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The learned member of parliament that you are, Madam Speaker, 
you will recall when the environment really mattered.  The 
Conservative regime negotiated an acid rain protocol with the 
Americans.  It brought forth a principal piece of legislation, 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  It even made 
initiatives with respect to bringing the world community together 
to fight ozone depleting gasses, which became the Montreal 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative ministers Jean Charest and Lucien 
Bouchard had a tremendous record compared to the lacklustre 
condition of today.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supported a very similar initiative brought forth by 
the former member from Kamloops, Nelson Riis.  Our party thought 
that providing Canadians with some tax reduction was better than 
no tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should start rewarding positive initiatives.  If the NDP is 
now advocating tax cuts and tax reductions, hopefully the 
Government of Canada will start embracing those particular 
aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a dilemma here.  Our party critic, the hon. member for 
Kings—Hants and vice chair of the finance committee, has pointed 
out that too often we utilize the tax system to leverage public 
policy.  The downside is that it complicates the taxation system. 
It would be better if all Canadians were provided with broad 
based tax relief and a simpler taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in our party are reticent to support the initiative brought 
forth by the member for Jonquière, but we do support the spirit 
in which she brought it forth.  She is encouraging Canadians to 
use public transit in order to take away the gridlock on our road 
systems and to deter the wear and tear on roads.  Also, it would 
ultimately enhance human health.  Taking more vehicles off the 
roads would mean fewer hazardous emissions.  The congestion we 
see on the roads also leads to more accidents and loss of life, 
so the spirit and the intent of this initiative should be 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus will be discussing the hon. member's bill.  We 
supported a similar initiative when it was brought forth by the 
member from Kamloops, so we will reserve judgment.  I am sure 
that my good friend, the member for Jonquière, will be lobbying 
me heavily in future votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that I have a few minutes remaining, it would be very 
appropriate to discuss one of the issues that we really need to 
think about in a more proactive way than we have over the last 
little while, and that is with respect to climate change as a 
whole.  The government has really done zero with respect to 
reducing greenhouse gases.  It has not begun to try to live up to 
our commitments with respect to the Kyoto protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I was concerned about that was a little 
revisionist, although we are going to reward good behaviour here 
as well.  The hon. member for Prince George—Peace River pointed 
out that we need to reduce greenhouse gases.  I remember the 
debate we had here in 1997 when his party was still challenging 
the science of climate change.  There has been an epiphany at 
some point and that party now understands the consensus that CO2 
clearly has a detrimental effect on our climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party would like to see a number of 
things in terms of addressing climate change.  We should have 
massive tax reductions for the utilization of renewable sources 
of energy.  We should have massive tax reductions for investment 
in energy efficiency initiatives.  We should have massive tax 
reductions for R and D on renewable sources of energy and energy 
efficiency initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should lead by example and allocate a 
percentage of the energy it consumes to renewable sources of 
energy.  We should be negotiating with the various industrial 
sectors as well.  Instead of having voluntary initiatives or 
government from on high by regulation, we would rather negotiate 
with every industrial sector in the country on a sector by sector 
basis and agree to binding reductions as opposed to having 
regulations or doing it through voluntary initiatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry will play its part if it knows what the rules are.  The 
government should establish the rules so that it can reward early 
action by providing further incentives when milestones are 
reached even sooner.  There is a myriad of opportunities that tax 
incentives could provide.  For example, the Danes use tax 
incentives and they have over half their energy provided by wind 
generated power.  The government has to get its act together with 
respect to environmental initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The species at risk bill before the House has a framework that 
can definitely work.  The problem is that it has four or five 
shortcomings that need to be improved.  In order to protect 
species at risk the government should accept the amendments that 
will be presented by members of the NDP, the Bloc, the 
Progressive Conservative Party, and even some learned members of 
the Liberal Party.  We should have a bill that we can celebrate 
as opposed to a bill that we merely have to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative of the member for Jonquière would encourage 
Canadians to use public transit.  Bravo to the member.  It would 
help human health by reducing toxic emissions in our cities and 
would save human life by reducing congestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only concern our party has is that better ways need to be 
found to move the yardstick on public policy.  We should be 
investing in our cities with more public transportation as 
opposed to nickel and diming it this way.  The intent of the bill 
should be applauded.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum (Markham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will begin 
by congratulating the hon. member for Jonquière on her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the government fully supports her bill's objective, 
what she seeks to accomplish.  It is just the method that is a 
problem.  We think that there are alternative ways of 
accomplishing the same thing, but more effectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to comment on how touching it was to hear the 
Canadian Alliance all of a sudden jumping on the green bandwagon 
and wishing to transfer all these funds to seniors and low income 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was touching but a little hypocritical.  If one recalls the 
election campaign, that party had essentially no position on the 
environment.  It had its so-called flat tax or single rate tax 
that would have produced the largest transfer of wealth to the 
rich.  Suddenly the Canadian Alliance has changed its tune on 
this matter, and that is very nice to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fundy—Royal claimed that the government had done 
absolutely nothing on the subject of the environment.  I would 
point out that it has committed $1.2 billion over four years for 
environmental projects.  In the Liberal books, $1.2 billion is 
not nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do further work in this area.  Public transit is a 
hugely important issue, especially with George W. Bush saying no 
to the Kyoto accord.  Achieving environmental success in this 
area is all the more important because we may be more limited in 
areas such as forestry, oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member's basic objective is a laudable one, but we have 
more work to do in investigating alternatives on how to get 
there.  What is the most efficient way of improving public 
transit?  Is it through the tax system or through expenditures, 
for example through direct government support for public transit?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LUMBER INDUSTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to get further clarification on a question I 
raised on February 27 about the softwood lumber issue that is now 
upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the fact that the four Atlantic premiers had written a 
letter to the Prime Minister, asking the government to renew the 
Atlantic accord which gives free trade and protection from 
litigation to the four Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the question because time after time the parliamentary 
secretary and the minister would rise in the House and say that 
nobody wants the agreements renewed, referring to the softwood 
lumber agreement, when in fact four Atlantic premiers wanted the 
maritime accord renewed.  That was the main thrust of my question 
at the time; but now, on April 4, the question is even more 
urgent and there is more support for the proposal to renew the 
maritime accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governor Snowe of Maine supports Atlantic Canada's request to 
renew the maritime accord.  She says it is working and it should 
be renewed.  It is working in the interest of the U.S. and 
Canada.  She wants it renewed.  Here is the governor of Maine 
wanting it renewed and the Government of Canada will not renew 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in the U.S. industry have recognized the unique 
situation of Atlantic Canada.  Their petition to their government 
asks it to increase or to establish countervail duties and 
anti-dumping charges.  The American industry says that the 
petitioners do not allege that softwood lumber production in the 
Atlantic provinces benefits from countervailable subsidies, and 
that this portion of Canadian production should be treated as it 
was in 1991 and 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American industry and the American government say that the 
accord should be renewed.  The four Atlantic premiers say that 
the accord should be renewed.  Even the province of Quebec came 
to our committee and said that it wants province specific 
treatment and that it supports the maritime accord being renewed. 
Now the Canadian industry in Atlantic Canada is unanimous in 
wanting the maritime accord renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the minister is out of step. 
Almost everybody wants the maritime accord renewed.  There is a 
lot of confusion about the government's position in this regard. 
I learned today that some of the Liberals in Atlantic Canada are 
taking credit for the fact that the United States industry 
developed its petition and excluded Atlantic Canada.  Somehow 
some of the Liberals in Atlantic Canada are taking credit for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the confusion in Atlantic Canada is the 
monitoring system which was just extended from the four softwood 
lumber agreement provinces.  Suddenly, in the middle of the night 
on Thursday, the mills got a fax after closing hours saying that 
they now had to be part of the monitoring system as of Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a B.C. industry, one of the leading industries in the 
softwood lumber business, is asking for a 15% export tax.  There 
is a lot of confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree with the Americans, the Canadians and the premiers 
and renew the maritime accord, put that aside, and then deal with 
the other issues across the country.  Let us deal with the 
maritime accord, put it aside, and have that part of it done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to get in step with everybody else.  Again, 
the governor of Maine wants renewal of the maritime accord.  The 
province of Quebec wants renewal of the maritime accord.  The 
four Atlantic premiers are asking for renewal of the maritime 
accord.  The Atlantic Canadian softwood lumber industry wants 
renewal.  Even the U.S. industry wants renewal of the maritime 
accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister stand to say yes, we will begin the process of 
renewing the maritime accord? 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I acknowledge that 
the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester has been quite 
persistent on this file, as have all my Liberal colleagues from 
Atlantic Canada.  We have heard no shortage of concern about the 
maritime accord.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised questions about the Canada-U.S. softwood 
lumber agreement.  He specifically mentioned the letter from the 
four Atlantic premiers concerning the codification of the 
provisions of the maritime lumber accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member well knows, we are now in a situation which would 
be quite acceptable to everybody if the Americans would accept 
it.  We now have free trade under the NAFTA rules for not only 
Atlantic Canada but for all regions.  That is what we want for 
all Canadian regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exchange of letters in 1996 confirmed the procedures for 
U.S. recognition that should a countervailing duty investigation 
be initiated during the five year period the maritimes would be 
considered to have not subsidized.  The U.S. action does not 
target any program in Atlantic Canada.  We think that is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue, as the member asked, to advocate free access 
for lumber originating in the Atlantic provinces as well as free 
access for all provinces as provided by NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, the Minister for International Trade is a 
minister for all Canadians.  He represents all Canadians on this 
file and he has to take into account their concerns.  When he met 
on February 26 with U.S. trade representative Zoellick the matter 
was raised by the minister.  It was one of the first topics he 
raised and the Prime Minister raised it with President Bush.  It 
has had a very high level of attention by our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister put forward the idea of envoys.  At first there was 
no great enthusiasm from the American side.  Now it seems there 
is more interest in it.  That would be very important.  There 
would be wide consultation with the respective governments, 
including all provincial governments.  We will pursue the matter 
of free trade for the Atlantic provinces but we want it for all 
Canadians.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am rising to follow up on a question that I 
asked on March 14 which dealt with the ongoing existing crisis in 
Canadian agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to turn to an incipient crisis, a crisis that all 
Canadians and parliamentarians of all stripes want to avoid and 
to prevent by any means available to us.  I am speaking of the 
potential for the foot and mouth outbreak in Europe to spread to 
this country.  The risk from foot and mouth disease can scarcely 
be overstated. The economic impact the disease could have if it 
were to spread to Canada can scarcely be overrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just looking at the province of Ontario 1996 production figures, 
we see that 24% of all farms in Ontario were beef farms and that 
14% were dairy farms.  Looking at my own riding of 
Lanark—Carleton, 60% of the farms in Lanark county, which make 
up about half the riding, were either beef or dairy.  There were 
130 dairy farms, 364 beef farms and 28 farms described as 
livestock combination and probably included one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the part of my riding that has now been incorporated into the 
megacity of Ottawa, the township of West Carleton, a little over 
50% of agricultural production is in beef or dairy.  A disease 
that affects ruminants would have a tremendously damaging impact 
on my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the 1952 outbreak in Saskatchewan of foot and mouth 
disease, which very fortunately hit only 42 farms before it was 
contained, caused $7 million of damage in today's dollars. 
However things have changed.  The impact of this disease would be 
far more severe if it happened in Canada today because beef is 
such a prominent export for us.  We could expect that borders 
would be shut for exports of Canadian beef. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries, if faced with a foot and mouth outbreak, can 
continue to supply their domestic market, but in the case of 
Canada such an enormous amount of beef is exported that it is a 
crucial part of our industry.  We would see tremendous damage 
done if there were to be an outbreak here. 
As a result I take this issue very seriously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the debate last night and listened with great 
interest to all speakers.  I was involved last week in a press 
conference in which a number of Canadian Alliance MPs spoke to 
the issue.  This week I am running ads in two newspapers in my 
riding on the subject to advise farmers of some of the things 
they can do.  This includes alerting them to the government 
website that deals with taking preventive measures on their 
farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see being done is excellent in terms of slurry mats at 
airports, the turning back of British military vehicles and so 
on.  However I am very concerned with the consistency with which 
these measures are being applied.  We hear reports that they are 
not applied across the board.  That worries me greatly as I know 
it does all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being done to ensure consistency of the application of 
these measures?  Moreover, what is being done to ensure that 
information on measures individuals can take is being 
disseminated to Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague 
from Lanark—Carleton, who is a very successful business person, 
tabled a question about the main estimates.  First I want to 
answer that and hope I have time for the foot and mouth issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said on several occasions since the main 
estimates were tabled that the budget allocated to farm income 
has not been reduced for the year 2001-02.  On the contrary, we 
have increased our funding commitments to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years we have committed to inject up to $3.3 
billion of federal funds into the farm safety net system.  With 
the provinces under the framework agreement of 60:40 cost 
sharing, this amounts to $5.5 billion over three years.  As well, 
on March 1 the minister announced additional funding of $500 
million which provides, along with the provinces cost sharing, 
$830 million more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 was a transition year.  In the 2000-01 main 
estimates Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada had to account for 
both the 1999 AIDA program and the new Canadian farm income 
program, CFIP, for the 2000 tax year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was done in accordance with the accounting practices of the 
Government of Canada which requires departments to recognize 
liabilities in the year the decision was made to incur them. 
Since CFIP started in the 2000 tax year the budget allocated to 
that year of the program was reported in the 2000-01 main 
estimates.  As I stated before, the Government of Canada remains 
committed to helping farmers.  I thank my colleague for his 
confidence regarding the CFIA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a great debate in the House last evening.  In fact, it 
was not a debate but rather input from all sides.  It was an 
opportunity for all Canadians to make a difference and keep the 
country free of foot and mouth disease, as all of us on all sides 
of the House want to do.  I look forward to talking more on that 
subject.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERIES 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise again on a question I 
raised in the House a couple of weeks ago about genetically 
modified fish that are commonly called transgenic fish.  I prefer 
to call them frankenfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has completely abandoned any possibility of 
rehabilitating the habitat of our natural environment so that 
wild fish stocks can come back.  Unfortunately it is aiding, 
abetting and promoting a genetically modified or transgenic fish. 
The only place this is being done in the world is in Prince 
Edward Island and in Newfoundland by a company called A/F 
Protein, an American company, that is using Aqua Bounty in 
Surrey, Prince Edward Island, to promote its product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say that it is done in closed laboratories. 
The fish will not be allowed to be outside the closed labs.  The 
company is now applying to extract millions of salmon eggs and 
move those eggs into the United States for rearing in an open 
pen.  This is a problem for many commercial fishermen and 
aboriginal groups.  They also have other concerns about the 
average aquaculture industry.  There are many escapes from these 
pens.  The aquaculture industry told us that aquaculture fish 
cannot reproduce or survive in the wild.  We now know that to be 
wrong.  They do reproduce in the wild.  These fish are so 
voracious in their appetite that they can overwhelm and overtake 
natural fish. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I and many people in the industry fear is that these fish 
will escape into the wild and destroy the wild stock altogether. 
Since they are a genetically modified or transgenic species, they 
themselves over time will become extinct if there are no proper 
controls.  This is our greatest fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other fear we have is about these fish getting into the 
commercial market.  Consumers who go to a supermarket now do not 
see any salmon there marked “this is farmed salmon”.  I have 
said to the aquaculture industry time and time again that if it 
is so proud of its product then that product should be labelled. 
The industry should let the consumers of Canada know what they 
are buying.  Consumers would not know what they are buying if 
transgenics get into the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aquaculture industry has also said for years that under no 
circumstances would it accept genetically modified or transgenic 
fish.  It has now modified that position and is saying it will 
not accept these species of fish unless the government can prove 
they are safe for human consumption.  The only way that can be 
proved is through very long term studies of at least 20 to 30 
years.  We simply do not have the resources within the government 
or the human resources to do those types of tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Liberal Party will get up and talk 
about CEPA and say what great things the government has, with the 
proper legislation in place.  It is simply nonsense.  CEPA is a 
piece of legislation passed in the last legislature which has so 
many holes in it that it simply will not protect wild species or 
human consumption, and they are what we are greatly concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society of Canada did a report, apparently actioned by 
the federal government.  It did a test study on transgenics and 
came up with some recommendations for the government.  The Royal 
Society of Canada said to place a moratorium on transgenics and 
genetically modified fish or, as I prefer, frankenfish.  The 
Royal Society said to place a moratorium on these fish until 
there is more information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the government needs to do.  This is what my party 
encourages the government to do.  We in the NDP say once again, 
please do all that is possible to protect wild fish stocks and 
their habitat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, for my very 
fine colleague, a hard working member on many committees, I want 
to have the opportunity to present some facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from the regulatory departments are reviewing and 
considering the recommendations of the Royal Society, the expert 
panel's report.  Further, members of the Canadian aquaculture 
industry have publicly stated that they have no interest in 
growing transgenic fish.  However, in the long term the 
technology could prove publicly acceptable and may confer certain 
benefits to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years, DFO will spend $3.4 million in 
research to enhance the regulatory system to control the 
potential risks associated with this new technology.  Until these 
regulations are in force, all applications for the commercial use 
of transgenic fish are subject to an evaluation under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, as my hon. colleague 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, any proposal to move transgenic fish from a 
hatchery to a grow out site, where they mature, or between any 
other locations, is subject to an indepth federal-provincial 
introduction and transfer review under the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
also expressed concerns about what the minister and department 
are doing to protect the interests of commercial fishermen and 
the wild salmon stocks in Atlantic Canada from the potential use 
of transgenic stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the best interests of both the aquaculture industry and 
governments to minimize any escapes.  To address this, under the 
leadership of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation 
Organization, the aquaculture industry met with government 
representatives here in Ottawa in February 2001 to further 
develop a code of containment for salmon culture.  It is expected 
that this code will lessen the chances of cultured fish escaping 
to the wild and will contribute to the sustained growth of the 
aquaculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, no transgenic organisms are being grown outside 
secure containment facilities.  In addition, our policy on 
transgenic organisms requires that reproductively capable 
transgenic fish used for research purposes be maintained in 
secure land based facilities.  As an additional safeguard, all 
transgenic organisms destined for containment in natural 
environment facilities would be required to be sterile if they 
received regulatory approval.
