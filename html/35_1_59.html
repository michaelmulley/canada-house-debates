	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, on this national day of 
mourning, I offer my deepest sympathy to Canadian workers.
<P>
	We all remember friends, relatives or colleagues who died, 
were injured or handicapped for life as a result of work 
accidents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able to say 
that from year to year workplace safety and health have been 
improving and that prevention measures have been 
implemented with a high level of success. Unfortunately this is 
not so.
<P>
	In 1992 for example, more than 700 workers lost their lives as 
a result of work accidents. Although the fatality rate generally 
has declined over the past decade all the parties involved, the 
workers, employers, unions and regulatory bodies, clearly have 
to improve and take more seriously the question of workplace 
safety so they begin to make a difference to all those who have 
lost friends, relatives and family members to workplace 
accidents.
<P>
	Investing in safety and health is investing in people and in 
prosperity and also avoidance of unnecessary tragedies. I am 
very hopeful that step by step we can continue to enhance 
regulations at the federal and provincial levels to increase 
compliance and to improve our performance in protecting 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	To that effect, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health 
and Safety located in Hamilton provides a very important 
service of information, support and resources in protecting 
employees and giving important knowledge to employers about 
workplace safety.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I recently visited the centre, and took that opportunity to 
announce that my government was giving the centre $100,000 to 
help it maintain its toll free emergency phone service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This very important service ensures that there is one central 
place where individuals, employees and employers can phone in 
to get up to date information. It would be my hope in the future 
to continue to enhance and augment the role of the centre. I 
believe it is one of the most important institutions in workplace 
safety in the country.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to members that occupational 
health and safety is a broad international concern. When signing 
the NAFTA labour agreement the three countries, Mexico, 
United States and our own agreed that this would be the priority 
issue. We have established as a result of that meeting a series of 
major conferences on workplace safety, the first beginning in 
Canada this summer.
<P>
	We can now use the labour agreement under NAFTA as a 
venue and a means by which we can both improve knowledge 
and even aid those other countries by sharing information, by 
sharing knowledge and looking at measures in key industries 
like the oil and gas industry, engineering and others so that we 
can begin to provide in a co-operative fashion mutual activities.
<P>
	I am sure that all members join me in remembering those who 
have paid the ultimate price in the workplace. I trust that they 
will encourage their constituents to be more vigilant about 
occupational health and safety. We can drastically reduce the 
pain and suffering caused by accidents to the victims, their 
families and friends if we all are more caring, more vigilant and 
more concerned.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, according 
to the Canadian Labour Congress bulletin on health and safety in 
the work place, one thousand workers die annually as a result of 
accidents in the work place, and another million are injured, 
while thousands more die of diseases caused by toxic substances 
used in the work place or as a result of various other problems in 
their job environment.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, the Official Opposition, wishes to join in 
this national and international day of mourning in honour of 
those men and women who died on the job or as a result of an 
accident or a disease contracted in the work place.
<P>
	Speaking on behalf the Official Opposition, I must point out 
that although the actual number of accidents has declined, the 
situation is far from ideal. In fact, many job related diseases 
have not yet been recognized as such and are therefore not 
included in these figures.
<P>
	It is also true that the work place is changing, and as we have 
seen in the past, each new generation of technologies brings 
with it new diseases and accidents. The same is true today. 
Unfortunately, unlike other periods before the second world 
war, the labour movement is not on the rise and is experiencing 
difficulties in certain areas and even receding in certain cases. 
That is why governments have an even greater obligation not 
only to improve legislation but also its implementation.
<P>
	Because of the pressures of globalization, there is an 
increasing tendency to fragment the work place and have jobs 
done by companies whose labour practices are irresponsible. 
This means that we as parliamentarians must remain alert. Only 
political will and social commitment will be able to stop these 
terrible and unacceptable effects of the job environment. We are 
concerned about the problems of the unemployed, but we cannot 
ignore those who, because of current pressures in the work 
place, must work under conditions that may lead to loss of life or 
loss of physical or mental well-being.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, politicians are well 
known for sitting behind mounds of paper and bureaucracy 
dispensing advice to others. Seldom do they step outside their 
hallowed halls to feel the pain and also the joy of aching muscles 
and blisters from a physical day of hard work.
<P>
	In my view it would be far more appropriate today if we had a 
framer, a mason, a steeplejack, a buggy operator, a labourer or a 
roustabout to offer a tribute in these halls.
<P>
	I personally recall a powerful young mechanic severely 
injured by a propane blast that took his sight in one searing 
instant, leaving him disfigured and blind, his  years of training 
made useless, his life's experiences suddenly only memories, 
his world a shambles.
<P>
	Cliff and his wife never complain. In fact they are happy to 
have one another's love and support. Occupational health and 
safety are important. To Cliff and all his injured colleagues I 
dedicate this national day of mourning. To those less fortunate I 
offer a simple prayer.

<P>
	The private member's bill I have the pleasure to introduce 
today in this House seeks to correct a terrible inequity toward 
Montreal workers and all workers from a community having 
more that 500,000 inhabitants. A laid off Montreal worker is 
eligible to the Program for Older Workers Adjustment only if 
the company laid off more than 100 workers in a single group.
<P>
	But it so happens that, in Montreal, the industrial make-up is 
such that the vast majority of companies employ 20 to 30 
workers. As a consequence, 83 per cent of all applications under 
the OWA program in Montreal have been rejected. This bill 
seeks to change that situation. I hope it will be favourably

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government's lack of action in the agricultural 
sector, which is currently facing the most significant changes in thirty years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague 
from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for seconding this motion. I am 
pleased to rise in this House for this motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government's lack of action in the agricultural 
sector, which is currently facing the most significant changes in thirty years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also ask all members of all parties present here to do the 
same in condemning the government's inaction on agriculture. 
A self-respecting society is one that recognizes the importance 
of its agriculture. A country must first of all ensure that its 
citizens have good food, hence the importance of stimulating 
this crucial sector of our economy. Subject to the whims of 
nature and buffeted by political decisions made here and 
elsewhere, agriculture requires heavy investment, diversified 
technical expertise and constant support from the government.
<P>
	We cannot overemphasize that. Agriculture is a very 
important industry in Canada. Agri-food accounts for nearly 8 
per cent of the gross domestic product and almost 2 million jobs, 
15 per cent of all employment in Canada. It produces some $64 
billion of goods a year. Food processing industries alone gener-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3612"> 3612 </A></B>
<P>
ate $38 billion, which is more than the automobile industry in 
Canada, which generates about $30 billion.
<P>
	In fact, every dollar of agricultural production generates 
nearly $3 in economic benefits.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Agriculture is, therefore, extremely important to Canada and 
to Quebec. It plays a major role in our economy, serves as the 
basis of our society and is an important component of our 
national identity.
<P>
	The 38,000 farms and 1,200 processing plants which make up 
the agri-food industry inject roughly $3 billion into the 
economy in the form of inputs, services and salaries. The 
industry generates approximately 400,000 jobs, or 11 per cent of 
the overall total, and accounts for $11 billion in shipments in the 
manufacturing sector in Quebec.
<P>
	This is nearly three times the shipments of the pulp and paper 
sector. In fact, the agricultural and agri-food sector in Quebec is 
much larger than the province's pulp and paper industry or even 
the automobile industry.
<P>
	Is it not time for our politicians and governments to pay more 
serious attention to agriculture and to stop neglecting this sector 
which provides a source of jobs and economic wealth?
<P>
	What could account for this laxness and lack of action on the 
part of the government? Because there is no question that 
farmers are currently facing serious problems. With the 
upheavals resulting from the GATT and the NAFTA, the 
agricultural sector has undergone over the past few years some 
of the biggest changes in 30 years.
<P>
	No one denies that the GATT and the NAFTA have changed 
the rules of the game in agriculture and it is hard to argue that in 
the case of these agreements, the federal government was truly 
successful in defending the interests of Canadian farmers.
<P>
	The Canadian government lost out on GATT. First, because it 
failed to maintain support for article XI and was unable to 
cobble together a coalition of countries to defend its position 
and ensure that article XI would be maintained. Not only did the 
federal government fail to defend article XI of the GATT, which 
provides for a highly equitable system for farmers and 
consumers, it failed as well to gain a reasonable period of time 
for farmers affected by article XI to adapt to changes in these 
sectors.
<P>
	The agri-food industry needs a reasonable period of time to 
make the transition to a competitive world. However, the 
government failed to win the industry enough time to make a 
smooth transition to the new system.
<P>
	By signing the GATT Agreement, the federal government is 
subjecting the farmers of Quebec and Canada to time frames and 
terms of change imposed from the outside, by their very 
competitors.
<P>
	In fact, the government's lack of action in the agricultural 
sector has been obvious since the GATT Agreement was signed, 
and in its trade negotiations with the United States in particular.
<P>
	Not only did the federal government lose the battle for article 
XI at GATT and give the farmers very little time to adjust, but 
when it signed the GATT agreements on December 15 last, it did 
not make sure our many trade disputes with our main trading 
partner, the US, were settled.
<P>
	Canada has since had to negotiate under pressure the 
settlement of a large number of trade disputes in the agricultural 
sector. Naturally, the United States has managed to drag Canada 
into global negotiations of all issues pertaining to agriculture 
instead of negotiating issues on the merits of each case.
<P>
	In so doing, Canada had once again put itself in a position of 
incredible weakness. The federal government's strategy is one 
of damage control, a mainly defensive strategy. Our negotiators 
keep complaining that the US is acting in bad faith.
<P>
	Canada's position of inaction and passivity is also 
exemplified by the fact it has accepted to negotiate a cap on 
Canadian durum wheat exports to the United States.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Given that Canada is doing nothing wrong under NAFTA, why 
allow to be penalized with respect to durum wheat exports when 
we know that the problems are on the American side?
<P>
	There is a very long list of cases resulting from agreements 
signed at GATT and from NAFTA in various agricultural areas 
across the country which show how weak and soft this 
government's administration of agriculture is. But we will have 
the opportunity to discuss this in greater detail later on.
<P>
	Canadian agriculture is faced with a serious problem, and the 
government has not done anything to deal with it: that is the 
considerable decline in the number of Canadian farms.
<P>
	In Canada in the last 20 years the number of farms has fallen 
by nearly 25 per cent or almost one-fourth. We lost close to 
100,000 farms. This means that 170,000 men and women who 
used to farm no longer earn a living as farmers. Even among 
those who still farm, almost 40 per cent, and in some sectors 
over 50 per cent, need a regular job elsewhere to survive as 
farmers.
<P>
	In other words, in Canada not only is the farming population 
diminishing but it cannot even earn a decent living from farming 
alone. Rural people need our support; rural communities are in 
decline but everything we say on this subject seems to fall on 
deaf ears. So far the government has not come up with any 
proposal to improve rural communities and the fate of family 
farms.
<P>
	Our farmers are among the most sophisticated in the world in 
several areas. Despite farmers' meagre income and reduced 
numbers, average productivity has grown by  2.4 per cent a year 
since 1981, which puts them in first place in Canada, far ahead 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3613"> 3613 </A></B>
<P>
of the manufacturing sector with a growth rate of only 1 per cent. 
The excellent performance of farmers must be pointed out.
<P>
	Canada comes first in the world for its capacity to feed its 
citizens at the lowest cost. How would you like to live in 
London, England, and spend 24 per cent of your salary on food 
in Tokyo and spend 33 per cent or a third of your income to feed 
your family, when Canadian consumers only spend 13 per cent 
of their income on premium quality and surprisingly varied food 
products? In spite of its problems and the lack of government 
support, the agricultural sector does its job well.
<P>
	We are losing our farmers at an alarming rate. Our 
countryside is emptying and unemployment is going up. In 
addition, farmers are getting older: 42 per cent of them are over 
55 and they are hard to replace because farming requires an 
enormous investment. Return on investment is low and working 
conditions are hard and totally different from those experienced 
by other workers in this country.
<P>
	Who among us would be willing to start a business, invest half 
a million and, in return, have to work 80 hours a week, as is 
sometimes the case, without any vacation and for a salary which 
only represents 80 per cent of the average income of the rest of 
Canadians? The problem is not that there are no young people 
willing to take over, it is that the current policy is conducive to 
the dismantling of family farms.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Right now a person who wants to transfer his farm to his child 
must make great sacrifices. That person must be prepared to 
accept a substantial reduction of the value of his farm, often on 
the order of 50 per cent. In other words, it is the person who 
worked hard for over 40 years, reinvesting all his earnings in the 
farm to improve it and make it more efficient and profitable, and 
who always deprived himself of all those little treats which 
ordinary citizens take for granted-vacations, free evenings, 
sleeping in, etc.-who must, when the time to retire comes, 
sacrifice his pension fund to allow his offspring to take over the 
family operation. Farmers should not have to subsidize the new 
generation taking over. If we want an abundant and steady 
supply of food items, the government must take its 
responsibilities and initiate a farm transfer program. When will 
the government do that?
<P>
	The loss of a farm is a tragic event which accelerates the 
deterioration of rural zones. We must put a stop to this terrible 
pattern. We must do something to keep rural populations from 
constantly decreasing. A healthy rural community is essential to 
the well-being of our society. Losing a farm often means losing 
a concession, a road, a post office, or a store. It can also lead to 
the deterioration of our rural communities and massive loss in 
investments, knowledge, money, training, expertise, research 
and subsidies. Our rural communities are full of  dynamic and 
intelligent people who deserve better than what the government 
is proposing. The time has come for our distinguished 
colleagues opposite to introduce a rural policy that includes 
farm transfers.
<P>
	Besides worrying about who will take over from them, 
farmers are concerned about their farm income which, as was 
mentioned earlier, does not get them very far. How many of us 
would be ready to spend our evenings, our weekends and our 
holidays holding down a second job, because our boss does not 
pay us a decent salary? In 1992-93, government subsidies 
accounted for 42 per cent of the total net income of farmers. This 
represents a significant decrease, since direct federal subsidies 
dropped by $113 million in 1993. Things are getting better, 
slowly but surely. However, these figures clearly indicate that 
the government contribution is crucial to the survival of our 
agricultural industry. Farmers need some support from the 
government.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food has a budget of 
some $3 billion, which represents less than 2 per cent of the 
federal government budget. This is not a huge amount of money 
when you consider the importance of this sector. Unfortunately, 
the money is not always well spent. Take for instance, 
agricultural research. In 1992-93, $300 million of taxpayers 
money were spent in this area, which provides 3,000 jobs. At 
first glance, this seems like a good investment. However, the 
money may not have been spent efficiently.
<P>
	The Auditor General said: ``The Department does not have in 
place a system to monitor the use of the technologies it has 
developed and transferred, with the exception of tracking the 
usage of new seed varieties. Without an effective monitoring 
system, it is not possible to determine how successful the 
Department has been in improving the adoption of technology 
by Canadian producers and processors''. Since 1986, the 
department has known that until a responsibility framework has 
been defined and implemented by means of fiscal systems and 
performance evaluation mechanisms, it will be unable to 
highlight effectively the connection between resources and 
anticipated results on the one hand, and expenditures and actual 
results on the other hand.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Wasted money, ineffective research, much could be said on 
the gathering of market information and the gathering and 
compilation of statistical reports. It is incredible how 
Agriculture Canada fails to meet farmers' needs. Information 
does not always include conclusions, forecasts and data on 
market opportunities, and I quote from the Auditor General: 
``Dissemination of market information/intelligence is too slow 
and fails to meet the industry's needs for timeliness''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3614"> 3614 </A></B>
<P>
	Although rather small, Agriculture Canada's budget is not 
managed effectively. The system has several deficiencies and it 
is about time we do something about it. In 1994, there will be a 
thorough review of the department's programs as a result of the 
signing of the GATT and NAFTA agreements.
<P>
	In the past, these programs were not well controlled. Again I 
quote the Auditor General: ``Some key aspects of the 
agreements, such as objectives, responsibilities, cost sharing 
and accountability, are not clearly defined''.
<P>
	So much money and effort has been spent to provide a service 
that does not meet the producers' needs. There is waste also in 
the duplication of programs, be it farm credit, food inspection, 
income support, market development or marketing. These 
duplications entail costs for the taxpayers, for such things as 
staff, services or office space. The respective tasks of the federal 
government and the provinces in trade exploration are poorly 
defined. As for the information gathered by various 
departments, when it is passed on to farmers, it is often too late 
for them to take advantage of it.
<P>
	There has been progress, of course, but there is still much 
duplication between the federal and provincial levels, not only 
in programs but also in data, as we can see in this blatant 
example. According to Agriculture Canada data on hog exports, 
the figure for 1992 was 72,000 for Eastern Canada; but 
according to Statistics Canada, the figure for the same year and 
the same region was 125,000, that is twice as much. This is at the 
very least very bad data compiling, and it is very embarrassing 
to see such nonsense.
<P>
	The Chair is indicating that I have one minute left, but a 
minute is not enough. It is unacceptable, all the more so since I 
was getting to the core of the subject.
<P>
	Beyond these many difficulties for farmers, the waste and the 
many administrative duplications, there is something even 
worse in the agricultural sector. There is a very serious inequity 
problem in Canada between the west and Quebec, an inequity 
that shows up in many ways and that has been going on for a long 
time. There are numerous instances: milk, research, rural 
diversification, transportation and GATT. For example-and to 
sum up quickly since I do not have time to extrapolate-since 
1980, the federal assistance share of the prairie provinces, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, has grown from 42 per 
cent to 64 per cent of the federal budget, whereas financial 
assistance for Quebec has decreased from 30 per cent to 10 per 
cent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Since the hon. member 
for Québec-Est is the first member to participate today in this 
debate on a matter of great importance to the whole country, I 
wonder if there would be unanimous consent to allow the 
member to conclude his remarks so we can start off debate on the 
right foot.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Would there be unanimous consent, seeing that the member 
for Québec-Est is the lead speaker on this opposition day in this 
very important debate on the subject of agriculture?
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope the member does not need more than two or three 
minutes to conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> I need five minutes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Five minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member is asking for unanimous consent to extend his 
intervention by five minutes. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> I thank all hon. members for their kindness.
<P>
	I wanted to deal with the inequity of the situation in 
agriculture because it lies at the heart of the problem, at least 
from the Quebec viewpoint. There are numerous examples of 
inequities between Quebec and western Canada.
<P>
	Grain transportation is a case in point. Grain traffic on the St. 
Lawrence seaway is constantly being eroded and diverted to 
west coast ports. Since 1984, the volume of grain moved through 
the seaway has been halved, dropping from million 12 to 6 
million tonnes.
<P>
	In 1993 the volume of goods shipped through the seaway was 
32 million tonnes, a 50 per cent reduction compared with 15 
years ago. Glen Stewart, the chairman of the St. Lawrence 
seaway authority, says the Western Grain Transportation Act 
encourages producers to ship their grain through Pacific coast 
ports. That stands to reason since we have more buyers in the far 
east, but why is it that millions of tonnes of grain shipped to 
Africa and Europe also move through West coast ports and 
Panama?
<P>
	The dice are loaded because westbound grain shipments are 
subsidized all the way to the Pacific coast whereas subsidies for 
eastbound grain stop at the lakehead, which is still thousands of 
kilometres from the Atlantic ocean. Would it not be normal that 
such subsidies apply a mari usque ad mare, from coast to coast?
<P>
	Why should western Canada get better treatment than eastern 
Canada? Right from the beginning, Canadian agricultural 
policies were developed mainly to meet the needs of western 
grain producers and worked against the interests of farmers in 
Quebec. To make up for the deficiencies of their policies and the 
unfairness of federal transfers to Quebec, we Quebecers have 
had to develop our own programs adapted to Quebec's realities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3615"> 3615 </A></B>
<P>
	It goes without saying that this situation is very costly for 
Quebec's taxpayers. The taxes paid by Quebecers for agriculture 
have mostly benefited western farmers. As I already said, the 
prairies' share of federal funds rose to 64 percent from 42 per 
cent, while Quebec's share diminished from 30 per cent to 10 per 
cent.
<P>
	Of course the federal government spent money to help the 
west diversify. In the last five years, hundreds of thousands of 
dollars were spent to diversify western agriculture, while the 
federal government never contributed anything to the 
diversification of Quebec's agriculture.
<P>
	There are a vast number of cases in which we can very clearly 
see that the federal governement is less and less interested in 
Quebec's agriculture. Maybe this is good for Quebec's 
producers because they are very well organized. In fact, I 
believe they will benefit in a big way from sovereignty.
<P>
	This may be good but let us take the example of UHT milk 
made in Quebec, a high quality product which held 40 per cent of 
the market for this kind of product in Puerto Rico, where the 
Americans tried to block Quebec exports of UHT milk and 
succeeded. We are not selling any more UHT milk in Puerto 
Rico. In this case, the federal governement did nothing to 
protect this $40 million production. However, at the same time 
in the beer dispute between Ontario and the USA the federal 
government intervened very rapidly.
<P>
	I mentioned diversification of agriculture, but there is another 
example, the railways. In the west we maintain close to 25,000 
kilometres of railway lines for the sake of national unity, while 
we are abandoning thousands of kilometres of lines in the east, 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Here is another example. New Brunswick potato growers 
know that their production is subsidized. Transportation for 
their potatoes is subsidized at 50 per cent.
<P>
	No other producers are subsidized at 50 p. 100 for the 
transportation of their potatoes, so New Brunswick producers 
can sell their potatoes in Quebec cheaper than Quebec 
producers.
<P>
	The same goes for Prince Edward Island, and there are more 
examples like that one. It is as if the government wants to crush 
Quebec. Once again poor negotiation strategies at the GATT 
talks have contributed to scaring Canadian producers. We have 
the feeling that the federal government does not want to protect 
farmers, but rather create a very serious instability in quota 
production. And here we have that crisis in the Ontario chicken 
market where production is being considerably increased, 
jeopardizing all quota production in Quebec.
<P>
	I will conclude with these very brief words. I am convinced 
that Quebec's farmers will be the first to benefit from Quebec's 
sovereignty, because when Quebec recovers the money that it is 
paying to the west to subsidize agriculture, that money will go 
directly to the regions and toward social and economic 
infrastructures, schools, education and services. That money 
will reinforce Quebec's regions, promote agriculture and even 
enlist Quebec into a democratization process, which is what we 
wish for everybody.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did appreciate the hon. member's comments because I 
come from a rural-urban riding mix as well and have a great 
support for the agriculture sector, in particular dairy agriculture.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member of two points that this government 
has done. In the SEED program, which is summer employment 
for students, a program that has just recently been introduced, 
approximately one-quarter of my student applicants have 
applied for jobs in the farm sector. I would challenge the hon. 
member that the farm sector is still a vibrant sector in this 
country, that our young people are returning to the farms and 
that a nation that cannot feed itself is not a strong nation. I 
believe Canada is going in the right direction.
<P>
	The second point I would remind the hon. member of is that 
with our budget in February of this year we retained the 
$500,000 capital gains exemption for small business and farms. 
Therefore farms could be passed on to the second generation or 
provide a strength of security for the farm family in the older 
days of their lives.
<P>
	We have not done everything that we may, but we are going in 
the direction to preserve the family farm and to maintain a 
source of strong, excellent and healthy food supply for this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the extra time 
you gave me. I would now like to answer my colleague's 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously Agriculture Canada has not done everything 
wrong, I would not go as far as that. There are some things it has 
done right. Certainly the $500,000 capital gains due to the 
Minister of Finance is good, there is no doubt about it, and also 
the encouragement for young people to return during the 
summer months to work on the farm.
<P>
	All sorts of things that Agriculture Canada does are worth 
underlining, there is no doubt about it, but overall no, this 
government is not going in the right direction for agriculture and 
it shows. There are a great number of issues that could be 
brought up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3616"> 3616 </A></B>
<P>
	The loss of the number of family farms is an example. The 
government is not doing anything to counteract this 
development. I suspect that Agriculture Canada encourages 
inefficient producing farms or family farms and is in agreement 
with the American attitude in respect to agriculture. That is to 
say it encourages well integrated systems, large farms which 
will make it such that farmers will no longer be farmers. They 
will become employees in large farms. Maybe they will make a 
better salary, who knows, but personally I do not think that is the 
right direction in respect of the family farm.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I think the government could use more structural moneys to 
help redress this. One could go on and on about just this one 
issue. We could encourage large agricultural businesses situated 
in Saskatoon or Quebec City, but what about the rural areas? 
How do you encourage a population to occupy its rural area if 
you do not encourage the family farm?
<P>
	Agriculture is fundamental for that. The agricultural 
population is not different from us. It needs all sorts of services 
such as schools, education, hospitals and so forth.
<P>
	In losing the farmers in the rural areas and losing all the other 
services, these rural areas are abandoned and that is a big price 
to pay for a country like Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make 
a couple of comments to the member opposite who has been 
chatting with us this morning for a little while.
<P>
	The last part of the motion refers to the agri-industry which is 
currently facing the most significant changes in the last 30 
years. I would agree with that but I would like to have him 
recognize, which I think if he were very straight with the House 
he would, that these changes are also opportunities.
<P>
	Yes, there are challenges there. At no time in the history of 
Canadian agriculture has the agri-food industry starting with 
the primary producer, the farmer, going right up through the 
whole chain, had the opportunities before it as the industry has 
at the present time.
<P>
	The opportunity is there to meet the challenges that are there. 
It is like everything in life. Those challenges are not always 
simple and easy, taking a snap of the finger to get them, but 
those opportunities are there.
<P>
	I would suggest to the member that he recognize that this 
government has only been in power for the last six months. He 
should look at what this government has done with regard to 
trade initiatives, protecting the family farm, our success in 
getting the tariff levels in place at the GATT talks, and I could go 
on. Work is being done on the pesticide review and with regard 
to the whole farm safety net program.
<P>
	I remind the member that we have done a lot in the first six 
months. He had better sit back and wait because we are not done 
yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, there has been an awful lot of 
talk and a lot of studies. Even the parliamentary secretary for 
agriculture is involved in one of these studies. However, there 
has been very little action.
<P>
	The little action the government has taken has been backward 
in some respects, forced upon it by the earlier government, for 
example in the case of GATT. We are dealing with the 
consequences from GATT. I am not sure or convinced that this 
agreement was advantageous for farmers in Canada.
<P>
	I think we broke in, we broke down, we did not negotiate fully 
or effectively. Now we are caught in a situation in which we are 
having to give away an agricultural system, the supply 
management system, which was an excellent system, the 
world's best system. We are forced to give it away.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	The agricultural community which was directly under the 
supply management program now is forced to readapt very 
quickly, in six years, for example. This is not an advantage to 
those farmers. Farming is not like producing dingy bells or post 
cards. You do not change agriculture from one day to the next. 
You need long term planning and structural investment. You 
have to know where you are going and this government does not 
seem to know where it is going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, coming from B.C. the subject of grain is not a big issue 
in our area. However, I want to make a couple of comments to 
the member about some of his statements regarding his concern 
about the lack of grain or the decrease in grain passing through 
the St. Lawrence seaway.
<P>
	Clearly the member realizes that there has been a huge market 
change in the demand for grain in the world. Europe, for 
example, has gone from a net importer to a net exporter of grain. 
This is a predominant factor in grain shipments throughout the 
east coast ports.
<P>
	I sit in the House every day and listen to the members from the 
Bloc crying about how hard done by the province of Quebec is 
and how things are so tough and they are being penalized so 
much. The member should realize that for so many years the 
pendulum swung the other way toward the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We talk about the supply management system. Today in the 
domestic market the province of Quebec enjoys a huge 
protectionist advantage for shipping things like cheese and milk 
products and some of the other items in the domestic market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3617"> 3617 </A></B>
<P>
	In our province, for example, because of the supply 
management system we are restricted to pretty much a local area 
for selling our product. The member is once more bringing up 
the hard done by Quebec issue and I think that his facts are not 
exactly correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec certainly is not winning 
by any means in this. For example, with milk definitely we have 
a certain advantage in Quebec over the west, that is for sure. 
Now obviously with the change in the GATT, Quebec is going to 
have to realign itself and develop new markets.
<P>
	In terms of grain transportation it is obvious that there are 
millions of tonnes of grain going via Vancouver. It is not 
because I do not want it to go via Vancouver but it is rather 
illogical to transport grain to Vancouver ports in order to get to 
Europe when the line is more directly toward the St. Lawrence 
seaway. There is a very clear tendency there that seems to want 
to favour it. I do not know why.
<P>
	This is in line with the whole subsidy program. Why, for 
example, are there many tonnes of grain that are subsidized 
going to Thunder Bay and then back down the line to get to the 
United States? Grain transportation is subsidized in such a 
way-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know this issue, 
as I mentioned earlier, is of great importance and I am sure that 
members throughout the day will want to raise these issues.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my 
colleagues, the minister, the hon. Ralph Goodale, and the 
parliamentary secretary, Mr. Lyle Vanclief, it is with pleasure 
that I open the debate on the opposition motion relating to a vital 
sector of the Canadian economy, that is to say agriculture and 
the agri-food industry.
<P>
	I would like to start by commenting briefly the wording of this 
motion that I find absolutely ridiculous. I must tell you that I 
was stunned-I could not believe my eyes-when I read this 
motion. Just think, our colleagues opposite are asking that this 
House denounce the government's lack of action in the 
agricultural sector. The government's lack of action, nothing 
less.
<P>
	Ironically enough, while we are fed such cliches, while we are 
criticized for our alleged inaction, my colleague, the minister of 
agriculture, happens to be abroad on a mission to promote 
agricultural trade.
<P>
	In fact, that is why I am replacing the hon. minister here 
today. As we speak the minister of agriculture is leading a trade 
mission in the Asia-Pacific region. This region is an economic 
zone undergoing phenomenal growth, one that looks like a 
promising export market for our agri-food products and know 
how.
<P>
	The minister is accompanied by a delegation of 15 leaders of 
the Canadian agri-food industry representing most areas in that 
industry. After stopping off in Japan and Korea, they are now in 
China and from there are headed for Hong Kong.
<P>
	As recently as last Monday, the minister of agriculture left 
Korea with a signed contract to sell wheat to Korea as well as 
interesting prospects for the sale of pork meat and animal feed. 
If that is called lack of action, there is something wrong with the 
definition of the word. As a matter of fact, I am convinced that 
not only the Bloc Quebecois critic for agriculture but also my 
hon. colleague the critic for finance, a prominent agricultural 
economist, will approve of the objectivity and capacity to 
promote agriculture in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	How can one dare talk about government lack of action when 
this government has been praised by the industry for reacting 
both quickly and firmly to the American decision to renegotiate 
customs duties on wheat under article XXVIII of GATT? Our 
government made it clear that we do not want a trade war with 
the United States. We would rather negotiate. But we will go to 
war if we have to. As the hon. minister indicated, no deal will be 
made with the Americans unless this deal benefits the Canadian 
agri-food industry as a whole as far as grain products, 
processing and supply managed commodities are concerned. 
Canada will not give in on one point to get more on another. We 
refuse to play one group or region off against another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Inertia my eye. This government takes great pride in the 
exceptional work that our Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food has been doing since taking office in November. I 
would congratulate my colleague, the parliamentary secretary to 
the minister, for his intervention five minutes ago when he 
talked about the positive things that we as a government and as a 
country are bringing to this, one of the most important sectors of 
our economy.
<P>
	In the last five months the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food has travelled widely in an effort to meet all of the 
pertinent players around the world, in Canada and in Quebec. He 
has met with industry associations and stakeholders. He has met 
with provincial and municipal governments as well as 
American, Mexican and now Asia-Pacific agriculture and trade 
officials.
<P>
	These meetings were held in a spirit of co-operation and 
consultation which has been the hallmark of this government's 
approach to making Canada's agri-food industry one of the 
strongest in the world.
<P>
	The Canadian agri-food industry is a major employer. It is a 
major exporter. It accounts for 8 per cent of Canada's GDP and 
15 per cent of our jobs, three-quarters of which are found 
beyond the farm gate. In fact, it represents work for more than 
1.5 million Canadians on the farm, in processing plants and in 
the food distribution chain. It also provides Canadians with safe,  
nutritious food at reasonable prices. Agri-food exports are a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3618"> 3618 </A></B>
<P>
significant source of income for Canada. In 1992 exports were 
worth $13.7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Our platform, the famous red book, says that our sector has 
unique opportunities for growth and places great emphasis on 
security for Canadian farm families. It recognizes that Canadian 
farmers want that security to be built on the development of 
solid domestic and international markets, on staying at the 
forefront of innovation, on stewardship of our natural resources 
and in the confidence consumers have in the safety and the 
quality of our food.
<P>
	I would like to take some time to review the work that we have 
done to live up to our commitments, to follow up perhaps on the 
intervention of the parliamentary secretary some minutes ago.
<P>
	I would like to begin by reaffirming as a government our 
commitment to research and to innovation. This is an area where 
our government feels that the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food can work closely with other government 
departments to build a framework that will make it easy for 
firms in the agriculture sector to bring products successfully to 
the marketplace.
<P>
	Successful agriculture is a knowledge industry. Studies have 
shown that the return on investment in some key areas of 
agri-food research can exceed 50 per cent. This is one area 
where Ralph Goodale is very keen to see government continue to 
emphasize-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
Minister of Finance. I just want to remind us all to refer to each 
other by our titles or positions, such as the minister of 
agriculture or minister of this, unless of course that member is 
no longer in this Chamber, which is always regrettable. For all 
those of us here in this 35th Parliament I know it is a tradition 
that we will want to maintain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am suitably 
admonished. It is just that I am so enthusiastic about the work 
the minister of agriculture does that I sometimes get carried 
away.
<P>
	In any event, this is one area, that is to say agri-food research, 
in which the government is very keen to see us place even more 
emphasis. Therefore, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will 
give a very high priority to innovative research and to 
collaboration with private research partners.
<P>
	In our agenda for creating opportunity we have endorsed the 
idea of providing matching funds for research proposed jointly 
by the public and the private sectors. My colleague is looking at 
a variety of options, collaboration with the private sector and the 
public sector, including a plan to work with industry for 
additional co-operative investment funding.
<P>
	As for trade, which the critic discussed, from the day we took 
office it has been our top priority. The focus of our government's 
platform has been economic renewal, growth and jobs. A 
number of the initiatives so far have been aimed at encouraging 
small business, stimulating innovation in research and 
development, providing stability for the future and in particular, 
restoring confidence and stability in the agri-food sector.
<P>
	In pursuing these goals we have set out two priorities: 
concluding the trade deals and getting absolutely the most out of 
new trade opportunities. That again is what the parliamentary 
secretary referred to. Let us not only look at the problems but let 
us look at change as something that will provide a very dynamic 
agricultural sector with the opportunity to develop new products 
and create new opportunities.
<P>
	We hit the ground running by negotiating a successful GATT 
agreement that will bring fairness and predictability to 
international trade which Canada is so dependent on.
<P>
	On January 1 we saw the introduction of the North American 
free trade agreement which will provide an even greater 
opportunity for our industry in North America. A more secure 
trading environment will over time provide better stability for 
our farm families and for our agri-food entrepreneurs. Our 
challenge now is to take the utmost advantage of the 
opportunities presented by these agreements.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	We already have a commitment from industry to work toward 
the goal of exporting $20 billion in agri-food products by the 
year 2000. That is a considerable leap from the $13.7 billion we 
are now realizing. I am confident, as are the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the government, that we can do 
it if we all work together. I would ask the opposition to join us in 
that great effort.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food is reordering 
its priorities to increase support for export initiatives. We have 
placed agri-food specialists in selected embassies abroad to 
provide better service for our exporters. The first ones are in 
place in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The response 
we have had to their work has been very good.
<P>
	To further consolidate our trade efforts in Mexico, we will 
soon open a Canada business centre in Mexico City to promote 
our exports and to offer trade related services to our new NAFTA 
partners.
<P>
	Canadian farmers are very supportive of this focus on trade. 
They want to earn their incomes from the marketplace, not from 
the high subsidy levels that have prevailed over the past few. 
years. They repeatedly tell us that they do not want subsidies, 
that they just want a decent price from the market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3619"> 3619 </A></B>
<P>
	The producers continue to need some protection from the 
vagaries of the market and from external disasters. Our platform 
promised to review all existing support programs to develop 
farm income stabilization programs based on the concept of the 
whole farm, a user friendly safety net based on income from the 
whole farm.
<P>
	We see farm income security as a consequence of the 
marketplace more than as a result of government support 
programs.
<P>
	Development of the new whole farm income support program 
has been a key part of our plan to create security for farm 
families. We launched in Winnipeg at the beginning of February 
a consultative process on refurbishing Canadian farm safety net 
programs which will draw on the expertise of farm leaders from 
across the country, as well as federal and provincial government 
officials.
<P>
	What emerged from that Winnipeg meeting was a strong 
consensus to make a whole farm program available to all 
commodities. There was also agreement that some sort of 
additional support or companion programs would be needed to 
deal with specific regional or commodity problems as they 
arise. This will be part of our overall approach to safety nets.
<P>
	We have already taken a few big steps toward safety net 
reform. The first was establishing a national safety nets 
committee made up of government and industry representatives.
<P>
	The membership of the committee was established to ensure 
that the agri-food industry had input in the policy and program 
activities that will lead to the establishment of a renewed safety 
net regime. The membership is charged with ensuring that the 
input of all interested producers is brought to the table for 
consideration. They are to ensure that the deliberations and the 
conclusions of the committee are disseminated around the 
country.
<P>
	We need to develop a program that is GATT consistent, 
market neutral, financially sound, affordable and effective. We 
need to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in the most 
efficient way: to improve the industry's ability to adapt and to 
compete while not distorting trade. We would like to be ready to 
begin its implementation in 1995.
<P>
	While not strictly a safety net issue, the question of interest 
free cash advances must be considered when we are thinking 
about safety nets, because there is only one source of funds for 
agricultural programs. As the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food recently told several farm groups, our government is 
quite prepared to move on our campaign promise to improve 
these programs but first he wants to get the opinions of all major 
farm groups.
<P>
	It is important to note that the budget of the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food for all income support and safety net 
programs is currently about $850 million. Historically interest 
free cash advances have cost us $50 million to $75 million. If 
$75 million is used for cash advances it means that much less is 
available for other things. If we hear a consensus from producers 
that it is the best way to spend that money, our government will 
proceed.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois may tell his 
colleague, the agriculture critic, that he does not think money 
should be spent on agriculture. However we are going to do it 
because we believe in Canadian agriculture.
<P>
	We are asking farm groups to look at the basket of programs 
we have in place, the new initiatives that may come out of the 
safety net discussions, and the amount of money available to 
support these programs, to tell us what is the best way to spend 
our limited resources, our scarce resources. I know the financial 
critic for the Bloc will support me in this effort.
<P>
	Is the commitment to fully interest free cash advances the best 
use of these funds? Are there ways to make cash advance 
programs more effective at lower costs? That is the debate we 
must have in the House.
<P>
	Another element of security for farm families consists of the 
programs in place to help farmers manage. There are a number 
of them. Some are being questioned; others are aimed at helping 
farmers adapt to changes in farm financial situations which the 
critic raised in his remarks.
<P>
	In some cases the provinces have programs similar to our 
own. We need to assess these programs. We need to ask 
ourselves what types of programs might be considered 
companion programs and how they are best going to meet the 
needs of the future. How can we eliminate duplication among 
different levels of government? How can we provide 
straightforward service to farmers? We will be looking at all 
federal programs in this context.
<P>
	Tied into the issue of security for farm families and 
agricultural communities as a whole is the question of rural 
development. A healthy rural sector is an important part of 
ensuring a prosperous agriculture industry and vice versa.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has asked the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food to promote and facilitate rural renewal using the 
resources of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. As a result the 
minister announced that a rural renewal secretariat was being 
established within his department to provide leadership and 
co-ordination.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3620"> 3620 </A></B>
<P>
	This secretariat is working with other departments, with 
provincial governments, industry, communities, organizations 
and grassroots stakeholders to address the challenges facing 
rural Canada.
<P>
	The key to this effort is partnership, the co-ordination of the 
business of government, the vigilance and the political will to 
ensure that rural people and rural issues get the careful attention 
they need around the cabinet table and in the conduct of 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for supply management, the new GATT agreement will 
certainly require adjustments on our part, but we must 
nonetheless recognize that substantial gains were made. We 
have ensured that tariffs will be reasonably high, applied for a 
reasonable length of time and combined to clear access rules so 
as to allow product sectors to get by.
<P>
	In co-operation with the provinces and the industry, we are 
developing a supply management system which will be both 
sustainable and responsive to the new market conditions. A 
federal-provincial-industrial working group will be holding 
consultations and developing a strategy to get the most out of the 
new trading context.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many agri-food enterprises are small or medium sized 
businesses. A key part of our platform is directed at helping to 
unleash the job creation potential in small and medium sized 
businesses. We will provide one stop shopping for business. We 
will provide the market development support necessary to 
succeed in today's global markets. We will continue to cut red 
tape and unnecessary regulation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Change is now the order of the day. This Parliament must also 
work in co-operation toward ensuring the prosperity of our 
agri-food industry.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Our government has not been twiddling its thumbs, whatever 
the opposition says. I call upon its common sense and spirit of 
co-operation to bring about positive change within the industry. 
All Canadians will benefit from this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe the farmers and business people of Canada recognize 
the contribution the agri-food sector brings to the Canadian 
economy. We all look forward to making the most of what I 
know will be a better future for all Canadians.
<P>
	In conclusion, that is why we on this side of the House 
welcome this debate. This House is a dramatically changed 
House from the previous one. On our side, as was evident in the 
intervention of my colleague, there is tremendous interest and 
expertise in agricultural matters. There is a very strong rural 
influence running through the Liberal caucus.
<P>
	As I look across the House, the Reform Party brings with it a 
great deal of knowledge and understanding of western 
agriculture. The agriculture critic for the Bloc Quebecois is an 
acknowledged expert in the area, as indeed is its finance critic an 
eminent and renowned economist in that sector.
<P>
	There is an opportunity in the House to marry the tremendous 
knowledge, desire and enthusiasm for Canadian agriculture 
existing in the government with the sincerity of the opposition 
parties. It is for that reason we are delighted to participate in the 
debate today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I take note of the interest 
of members who want to participate in questions and comments 
with the Minister of Finance. I will attempt to recognize as many 
as possible in the 10-minute period available to us.
<P>
	I encourage members to keep their questions brief and the 
minister to respond in the same fashion so that I may 
accommodate as many members as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you very much for this opportunity to address the Minister 
of Finance. I had no idea that he could speak so eloquently about 
farming.
<P>
	Speaking for the minister of agriculture, the Minister of 
Finance stated earlier that I supported a reduction in farm 
subsidies. Given the enormous upheavals that the agricultural 
sector in Quebec and in Canada is currently experiencing, I 
would never have said such a thing quite the contrary.
<P>
	The government should continue to support the agricultural 
sector and perhaps even increase that level of support, not only 
to the primary sector but to the processing sector as well so as to 
improve the industry's current performance and prepare it to 
face the challenge of global competition.
<P>
	When we speak of the government's lack of action, here is 
what we are talking about. Since 1986 and as far back as 1982, 
when I was working for the federal Department of Agriculture, 
there has been a great deal of discussion, at the federal level at 
least, with the provinces and farmers.
<P>
	Since 1986 discussions have involved the Conservatives 
primarily. The current Minister of Finance says that he deplores 
the fact that no decision is ever taken. Why is that? Because the 
very same thing is happening today. Senior officials want to 
implement agricultural policies across the board and coast to 
coast. I have often questioned the minister of agriculture about 
income security programs and the negotiations currently taking 
place between his officials and market growers. His answer has 
been to leave everything in the capable hands of his officials 
whose job it is to deal with these matters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3621"> 3621 </A></B>
<P>
	My question, therefore, is to the minister of agriculture. 
When will real policies be drafted to give Canadian farmers the 
ability to meet the challenge of global markets and when will the 
government show some backbone in the face of constant trade 
dispute threats from the Americans, as is presently the case with 
respect to tariffs on Canadian durum wheat?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly 
the first to admit that I am not personally known as an expert on 
agriculture, except that I should tell my hon. colleague that I am 
a farmer.
<P>
	I have a farm where I raise beef in the riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi; it is one of the most beautiful parts of 
Quebec and I invite him to come and visit my farm and really see 
what it is to work the land.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I also invite the agriculture critic of the Bloc Quebecois. I can 
talk to him as to a Quebec farmer and I can certainly tell him 
that, for me, as a Quebec farmer, not only the provincial 
government is important, the federal government is important 
too.
<P>
	They ask when we will confront the Americans. It has been 
done. I was in Washington two days ago. I met the Treasury 
Secretary there, I raised the issue of the debate that we are 
having here and I can assure the House that we will hold our 
ground in these discussions with the Americans and we will win 
because we are right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the Minister of Finance speak 
to the issue of agriculture. I appreciate his presence here 
because a lot of the decisions affecting agriculture have a dollar 
attached to them.
<P>
	His speech was rather a motherhood one. I am sure that if you 
glance through <I>Hansard</I> you would see similar speeches made 
by agriculture ministers and finance ministers since time 
immemorial both at the federal and provincial levels.
<P>
	There was really nothing of substance that I can take back to 
my rural riding and tell my constituents that I heard this from the 
government and it would give them hope or at least help them to 
prepare for the decisions they have to make to manage their 
farming enterprises.
<P>
	A crucial question we would like to have clarification on from 
the Minister of Finance is-I am not talking in broad 
motherhood terms-when federal financial support for 
agriculture is justifiable.
<P>
	Reform has very clearly stated the basis on which we feel 
support is justifiable. I can mention eight areas. What about 
countering international trade wars? What about transportation 
issues? What about natural hazards? What about regional 
disparities in agricultural sectors? What about variations or 
instability in the marketplace returns from agriculture produce? 
What about sustainability of rural Canada? What about research 
and development? What about environmental and conservation 
measures?
<P>
	Specifically, does the government support funding for 
agriculture in these definite areas because I am not sure there are 
enough dollars to cover all of them. We need to know the 
priorities of the government. Because the minister went to great 
lengths to say that the federal agriculture minister was so 
wonderful I am sure they have had considerable consultation 
and have an action plan in place.
<P>
	I would like to know what the priorities of the federal 
government are with regard to consolidating federal programs. 
The minister said it is an issue they may pursue. We want to 
know what programs are going to be consolidated in the 
agriculture sector. What can we expect from the government?
<P>
	We also wonder if it would pledge to cut down administration 
but retain funding in real dollars for actual agricultural 
programs, except perhaps if savings could be accrued through 
reduction or de-escalation in the trade war.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 
I dealt quite extensively in my remarks with exactly the points 
that were raised by the opposition critic.
<P>
	Our position on the trade war is very clear in terms of our 
absolute preparedness to go to the wall to protect the Canadian 
farmer. Indeed the agriculture minister has made that very clear. 
We are right and we are going to win and let there be no doubt 
about that.
<P>
	I dealt with research and development extensively in my 
remarks. We believe that if you look at the development, the 
evolution of Canadian agriculture over the years, it is in fact 
because we have invested heavily in research and development, 
have developed new hybrid forms of grain, as an example, in the 
area from which the member comes that we have been so 
successful in world markets.
<P>
	We have stated very clearly that the agri-food industry is an 
essential part of the growing Canadian economy. It is one that is 
worthy of support in world markets.
<P>
	The minister is now on a tour of the Asian markets which are 
crucial to the future of Canadian agriculture.
<P>
	We have also said that the department of agriculture, as 
indeed other government departments, will be cutting back on 
the heavy cost of administration that we have inherited in order 
to have more money to put into programs to support Canadian 
farmers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3622"> 3622 </A></B>
<P>
	That is part and parcel of the philosophy of the government in 
terms of agriculture, in terms of defence, in terms of industry. 
We believe that the huge government apparatus ought to be 
scaled back so that scarce resources can be put on the front line 
where the battles are being waged.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Yes, I did talk very enthusiastically about the minister of 
agriculture, about the work he is in the process of doing. It is an 
essential pillar of the economic philosophy of the government, 
that Canadian agriculture not simply survive but that it grow. 
That is because as the parliamentary secretary said, we see in 
Canadian agriculture not only problems as do the opposition, 
but tremendous, tremendous opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
agree perfectly with what was said previously. We enjoy having 
the Minister of Finance talk about agriculture. He is a very good 
speaker but primarily it is a lot of talk. That is very much in line 
with the minister of agriculture, a lot of talk.
<P>
	Take GATT for example. Canada lost out on GATT. In fact, we 
are in this position because the federal government was not 
strong enough in those negotiations. Take the export of wheat 
now. Why accept a limit to the export of wheat to the United 
States? This is what is being negotiated. If Canada really 
respected itself it would not accept any limit. We would be 
dealing according to free trade with the United States.
<P>
	As far as the minister of agriculture's trips to China and so on, 
of course that is a good trip for him. Hopefully it will be good for 
Canada. All of these measures are really like motherhood; that is 
to say it falls within the norms of what we expect from 
Agriculture Canada and the federal government. However, we 
expect a little more, not just the bare minimum. We expect more 
and better ideas in terms of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said in my 
remarks, as did the parliamentary secretary, that in the program 
set out by the minister of agriculture, we have been very specific 
as to the actions we intend to take.
<P>
	Yes, there are areas where we have said we are going to 
consult because we think it is an essential part of the democratic 
process that we go out and that we talk. Surely the members of 
the Reform Party would agree that you go out and talk to 
Canadians, talk to those who are involved.
<P>
	I cannot believe the Bloc Quebecois members do not share the 
same view that what government must do is consult with the 
stakeholder before coming down with the final program. We 
have nailed our colours to the mast. We have said what we are 
going to do.
<P>
	The final remark I would make in response to the critic's 
remarks is with regard to what he said about GATT. I watched 
the evolution of that negotiation. When this government came 
into power we were dealt a very late hand. A previous 
government had not faced up to the tremendous demands that 
were out there; a previous government had not owned up to the 
Canadian people about what it had said, and a previous 
government had misplayed its hand very badly in Geneva. 
Nonetheless, having been dealt that hand, we were able to snatch 
tremendous victory from the jaws of defeat because of the 
negotiating skills of the government.
<P>
	The net result of GATT which could have turned out so badly 
for Canadian agriculture is that in fact it has turned out to be a 
tremendous victory. It has turned out to be a tremendous victory 
because as a government we knew exactly what we wanted. Our 
negotiators went over to Europe, sat down at the the table and 
did not leave the table until they got it. I am sure that in the 
private moments of his home the opposition critic knows that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the whip of the Reform Party I would like to advise 
the House that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) our speakers on 
this motion will be dividing their time with your concurrence.
<P>
	I am really enthused about the hon. minister's speech this 
morning. I would like to direct a few remarks to him before I go 
into the details I want to present to the Liberal government.
<P>
	I started farming because of farm programs like FCC and 
MACC. I was guaranteed a low interest rate for 25 years which I 
really appreciated. It was the only way I could acquire land and 
continue to farm and later retire as a farmer.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Why did the Liberal government in the 1970s change the farm 
credit regulations to do away with those programs and allow the 
banks to take over the financing for young farmers? Also during 
that period, why did the Liberal government allow interest rates 
to go to 24 per cent and force thousands and thousands of 
farmers off their land?
<P>
	I am so glad to hear the hon. minister is prepared to do some 
fence mending on those issues. I hope he gets the fences built a 
lot stronger in the west because they are getting very thin. If 
something is not done for the farmers there could be a charge by 
the big western farmers right down here into Ottawa to demand 
some changes. However, I appreciate his comments and I hope 
he will take them into account.
<P>
	I am not going to be quite as critical of the government on the 
issues of farm problems as my friend in the Bloc was. However I 
would like to address some of the problems we farmers are 
facing. I hope the hon. members in the government will take 
them to heart, look at them and give us some help with them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3623"> 3623 </A></B>
<P>
	My speech is mostly going to be directed toward 
transportation. I would like to point out some of the problems we 
are having today. We feel the car shortage on the railway system 
is not due to something that has happened overnight.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the government that in a letter 
dated November 15, 1993 the Thunder Bay Harbour 
Commission Port Authority warned the Minister of Transport at 
that time that the rail car shortage problem had been some time 
in the making and was due in part to the policy of dispersing the 
rail car fleet into trades and routings outside its original 
purpose.
<P>
	In an October submission to the National Transportation 
Agency, one of Canada's railroads confirmed there was in 
existence as early as May 1993 an extreme car shortage 
affecting its ability to supply cars. To be sure the terrible 
situation we find ourselves in today was not without warning.
<P>
	What did the railroads do? They chose to chase business in the 
United States without first making sure they had enough cars to 
handle the Canadian grain requirements. That makes money for 
the railways but it certainly left the western agriculture 
community high and dry.
<P>
	Under the Western Grain Transportation Act brought in by the 
previous Liberal government the railways are supposed to be 
subject to sanctions if they do not meet targets for unloading 
grain at Canadian ports.
<P>
	However, this recourse proved useless when the senior grain 
transportation committee decided not to pursue those sanctions. 
I wonder why. Who sits on that senior grain transportation 
committee and whose best interests do they have at stake? 
Apparently it is not farmers.
<P>
	I look at the people on that agency: They represent elevator 
companies, terminal operators, the railways, everybody but 
farmers. An article in the <I>Western Producer</I> states that elevators 
shipped the wrong grain to the port of Vancouver just recently. 
Why? They have all the stats and all the figures on trade at their 
fingertips. They know what they need. Is the system so 
inefficient that they cannot even load the proper grain?
<P>
	Mr. Minister, I hope you look into that because it seems 
ludicrous. It almost seems as if there is a conspiracy to shut the 
system down.
<P>
	William Stinson, chairman and chief executive of Canadian 
Pacific Ltd. received a $448,000 bonus for losing less money 
than the previous year. CP is trying to negotiate with two unions 
right now and is asking for cuts and labour deterrents so they 
will not go on strike, but this gentleman is given an extra half a 
million dollars for losing $2 billion. How does he expect to get a 
settlement with his unions?
<P>
	It is imperative that the government start to look at these 
issues and address them. One of these days we are going to have 
a civil war if this is the system we are going to allow to go on. A 
million and a half dollars for management and 50 cents an hour 
for the workers. Is that fair, Mr. Minister?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was just wondering. For 
one moment I thought maybe I had been forgotten.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Well, you know-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> One moment, please. We 
can only speak one at a time. While I am standing I would 
suggest that the member take a moment to sit down. I know 
people feel very strongly about all issues and this one is no 
different from any other we debate on the floor of this House. 
But I must encourage the member and I must ask the member to 
direct his comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I apologize for that, Mr. Speaker. Seeing the 
minister was so impressed with the farm issues, it got to my 
heart. I hope to simmer down a bit.
<P>
	The railways are required by law to move these grains 
according to the Western Grain Transportation Act. Why do we 
not see them doing it? It amazes me when I see stats that the 
turnaround on a hopper car today is actually a little longer than 
was required in 1923. Is this today's modern system that is 
supposed to help farmers survive?
<P>
	With the negotiations having gone on for over a year, this 
government failed to pass legislation to order the west coast 
strikers back to work. We lost 12 days. Not only that, I was told 
that during the Easter holidays there was again a four day 
shutdown. There are 40 ships sitting in Vancouver drawing 
demurrage charges on grain that cannot be shipped. When is this 
government going to take action on this?
<P>
	That has dealt a tremendous blow to the farm sector in western 
Canada. Shipping $100 a tonne feed wheat to the U.S. which 
takes twice as long as putting a car to Vancouver with $500 a 
tonne canola just does not seem to make sense. When are we 
going to get the right type of direction from some of our farm 
organizations or our government to solve these problems? 
Farmers need that cash to put in another crop. Farm programs 
cannot look after all these requirements. We have to ship that 
grain. We have to get our money out of that grain. I appreciate 
that the hon. minister is listening and I hope that something can 
be done about it.
<P>
	The other serious issue coming out of this whole system of not 
delivering grain is the lost sales. Japan today is encouraging 
Australian farmers to plant more canola because the Canadian 
system cannot deliver the product after it is grown. How long 
can our economy continue to exist in western Canada if we do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3624"> 3624 </A></B>
<P>
not start supporting the farmer who produces more efficiently  
every year and then is not allowed to sell to get the funds out of 
it?
<P>
	It amazes me sometimes what modernization, with all the 
computer technology and the efficiencies we have built into our 
systems, has done to us. I will give one little example of an 
experience I had. This is not with grain transportation.
<P>
	Being a farmer I like to save as much money as I can because I 
know I will need it. Just before I came back to Ottawa two 
months ago, I got a telephone bill for $27.65. I wrote the cheque 
for the due date on the bill. I said to my wife: ``Would you please 
drop it off at the telephone office so it is there directly and I can 
save myself the 45 cents''.
<P>
	Lo and behold, a month later I got a returned cheque with a 
notice on it saying ``insufficient funds'', charging me a $15 
service charge for a $27 telephone bill. It is a provincial utility. I 
went to see the banker, furious as can be. I have never had less 
than $2,000 in that bank account.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Somebody had punched the wrong figure and it showed there 
were insufficient funds. To hide their mistake, they wrote out a 
little slip which said: ``Due to insufficient funds''. It took me a 
month and probably $30 worth of telephone calls to find out 
where the problem was. Is this progress?
<P>
	I said to my wife: ``I know what I am going to do with the next 
telephone bill. I am going to put a stamp on it, mail it in Morden 
because it will take the postal service at least six months to 
figure out it is supposed to be delivered to Morden. It will travel 
all across Canada. They will cut off my telephone before I get 
back. Then at least I will have peace and quiet this summer with 
Stats Canada phoning me every month wanting to know how 
much grain I have left in my bins''. There is a way of getting 
around this system, but how long can we continue to do it?
<P>
	I apologize for the problems I caused you, Mr. Speaker. 
Forgive me. I hope the hon. minister does listen to this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
fully agree with what the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette 
said.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
I agree with the criticisms he made regarding agriculture and 
those he addressed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance underlined the fact that Agriculture 
Canada is in the process of consulting with farmers. Again, it is 
a delay tactic. The farmers know what they want but this 
government does not deliver.
<P>
	In the GATT negotiation for example, the farmers wanted to 
maintain article XI but the government did not deliver. When it 
comes to grain transportation, again it is a crying problem in the 
west. There are incredible delays but the government does not 
deliver.
<P>
	There may be ways to improve delivery of grain via the St. 
Lawrence seaway, but that is not being taken advantage of. The 
minister of agriculture has gone to Korea and China to sell more 
grain but my goodness, if we cannot get the grain out of Canada 
now when we have surpluses and markets across the globe that 
we are losing because of our inefficient system, why go to China 
to sell more grain?
<P>
	We have a great deal of programs to improve in Canada. The 
member for Lisgar-Marquette certainly does have reason to 
criticize this government in its lack of initiative in setting up 
better programs to serve farmers in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out a report 
that was given to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food the other day to back up some of my figures, just 
kind of arguing the point with the hon. member about going 
through Thunder Bay.
<P>
	When we had the PSAC witnesses on grain transportation, 
they pointed out to us that in a two week period of officially 
weighing grain which is done for Agriculture Canada, it was 
detected that 341 rail cars would have gone through the system 
with the wrong car numbers, putting the wrong grain to the 
wrong customer. One hundred and sixty-nine had the wrong 
initials on them, bringing the total to 510 cars in two weeks that 
they had to correct.
<P>
	In the same period, there were 26 mixes between different 
railways, 45 mixes that were prevented by weighers and 
assistants. Grain was left in receiving hoppers 10 times, 12 
spills, overweight as much as 25 tonnes on a boxcar or on a 
hopper car or underweight in some cases.
<P>
	The total was 1,173 cars that were under the wrong procedure 
in two weeks out of a total shipment of 13,000 cars. Almost 10 
per cent of the cars that were directed to Thunder Bay had been 
marked incorrectly by elevator companies. How can you have a 
system deliver our grain under those circumstances?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	This is why I say we have a disaster. We have a calamity in the 
transportation system. If this government does not correct some 
of those problems we will never be able to survive on the farms 
by becoming more efficient and producing more. It is senseless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I open with the question that I hear most in my riding of 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre. Farmers ask me why they have not 
heard anything about agriculture from Ottawa through the 
newspapers or on television. I have to be honest and tell them we 
are not talking about  agriculture in Ottawa. Sometimes it is very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3625"> 3625 </A></B>
<P>
difficult for me, being a farmer, to admit that we are not talking 
or spending very much time on agriculture. That is the question I 
hear most often in my riding.
<P>
	I want to talk about two subjects today, safety nets and the 
farm debt problem.
<P>
	First, in many cases over the past years we have seen safety 
nets that have been ill conceived, open to abuse, and poorly 
planned. I do not believe there is a farmer in this country who 
wants federal or provincial government agriculture subsidies. 
All farmers want is a reasonable chance to make some sort of 
decent living in this country. I do not care which part of Canada 
they come from.
<P>
	We have been in the situation over the past number of years 
where we have been looking at world trade problems, weather 
related problems and various other problems. That has shifted 
the focus in many areas so governments have been trying to give 
financial aid to farmers in poorly planned ways.
<P>
	We have had safety net programs for many years. We have had 
GRIP, crop insurance, FSAM, the grain stabilization program, 
and any number of ad hoc programs, as many as we all care to 
remember.
<P>
	We have spent billions of taxpayers' dollars on agriculture 
subsidies, and yet I still see farmers in Saskatchewan, and I 
know this is true right across this country, who are losing their 
farms. I ask myself how we justify spending billions upon 
billions of dollars and whether there is any effect or any good 
reason to pour dollars into farm subsidies when there is no 
reasonable chance of hope for success.
<P>
	In most cases the programs we have seen are open to abuse. 
They encourage very poor farming practices. They lack 
continuity. As I mentioned before, we have jumped in and out of 
all sorts of different farm programs on almost a yearly basis.
<P>
	That is generally the problem I see with those kinds of 
programs. In all cases they are bureaucratic programs, 
developed by bureaucrats for bureaucrats. They have done very 
little talking to farmers, listening and hearing what farmers are 
saying across this country. That is something we need to change. 
That is the area we need to move to.
<P>
	As I have said many, many times, farmers are the people who 
know what programs will work and what programs will not 
work. They know what is the best way to market their grain. In 
many cases they know the best way to transport their grain.
<P>
	I am not being particularly critical of this government. It has 
been governments of all stripes in the past. We have seen it from 
all governments.
<P>
	I generally like the idea of the whole farm concept of some 
sort of farm insurance. The concept is realistic. The question I 
have is, what process will be used to develop this program? Will 
it be bureaucrats again, as we have seen so many times in the 
past, or will it be consultation with farmers? If it is consultation 
with farmers in the grassroots area, I am all for that.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I just returned from a meeting of the standing committee on 
agriculture this morning and we had a group of people in from 
the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities. They did 
a provincial summary in Saskatchewan last year listing some of 
the problems they see with the GRIP and the NISA program.
<P>
	I will quote the report: ``Declining support levels, premiums 
are too high, not bankable, lack of producer consultation, 
payment processes too long''.
<P>
	When they talk about NISA they say it is too complicated, the 
forms are too lengthy, it is poorly administered. They do not 
trust government with their money; it does not cover all 
agriculture income and is not suitable for young farmers.
<P>
	Those are some of the comments the farmers in Saskatchewan 
are making to groups in Saskatchewan, the problems they have 
with farm safety net programs.
<P>
	The second area I want to spend a couple of minutes on is the 
farm debt problem. In Saskatchewan we have over $5 billion in 
farm debt. That is Saskatchewan only. In the rural municipality 
of Craik which is very close to mine, over 50 per cent of the 
farmers have gone through the farm debt review process. In 
other words, they have been in serious financial difficulty.
<P>
	The largest municipal taxpayer in Saskatchewan is the Farm 
Credit Corporation and the second highest taxpayers are the 
chartered banks. That gives an indication, a bit of background to 
the kinds of problems and how serious the debt problem is in this 
country.
<P>
	A few years ago we were all witness and subject to many 
different farm rallies, most of which were held in western 
Canada, because of the farm debt crisis. We have not seen many 
of those in the past year or 18 months.
<P>
	People will say that perhaps the farm debt crisis is over, 
perhaps it is no longer a problem. We see that cattle prices have 
gone up. We see that prices for special grains have gone up. 
Perhaps the crisis is over. I do not believe that.
<P>
	I believe that the debt crisis is still there and it is still as big as 
it was before. I think the difference now is that farmers in this 
country have come to realize if they are going to solve the 
problems of debt, the problems of marketing and so on and so 
forth, they will have to do it themselves.
<P>
	Farmers have to take the initiative to help solve their 
problems. They are no longer looking for government support 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3626"> 3626 </A></B>
<P>
way they did five or perhaps ten years ago.  They realize the way 
to solutions is to open up the process and let them handle their 
own problems.
<P>
	I believe farmers have decided they will take matters into 
their own hands. That is why we see things such as the huge 
influx of new crops in our country, specialty crops, crops that we 
would not have believed we would grow five or ten years ago. 
We are now growing them. We see a great increase in the cattle 
industry. We see value added industry. In my own riding we have 
a good number of various value added industries that are going 
to be successful because they are farmer owned, they are farmer 
controlled and they do not depend on government subsidy.
<P>
	We see a huge increase in off farm jobs, off farm income. A 
recent survey in Saskatchewan said that as high as 50 per cent of 
the farmers in Saskatchewan have off farm income. I often 
humorously say as a farmer that my wife teaches school to 
support my farming habit. It is a fact of life out there. It is just 
the way it is. I think that is good. People are starting to realize 
they have to take matters into their own hands.
<P>
	I want to spend just a minute talking about the Farm Credit 
Corporation. It has a new lend-lease program, initiated this 
year. The comments I have received from my riding, the initial 
comments, are that it is a good program. Some of the negative 
comments might be that the term of six years is probably too 
short and should be increased to 10 years.
<P>
	The other comment I get about the Farm Credit Corporation 
which I want to finish with is that it has been very difficult, very 
bureaucratic to deal with in its history. Many farmers in my area 
have turned back their land or voluntarily transferred it back to 
the Farm Credit Corporation over the past few years and it has 
been very difficult negotiating, coming to terms.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that farmers are now 
preparing for their spring seeding. Right across this country they 
are busy. They are on their tractors. They are listening to the 
radio. I think more than anything else they would like to hear on 
their radios as they are working this spring that there are some 
specifics, that somebody will stand up and say this is the 
program, these are the details. That is what they want to hear.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I believe that agri-policy must be developed by farmers for 
farmers. There is no other way in this country that we can solve 
some of the problems we face in our industry other than by full 
consultations with farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take note of the 
comments the hon. member and his colleague made in the last 
few minutes.
<P>
	I would like to assure the previous speaker that as far as the 
whole farm and the safety net program are concerned we do have 
a 17 person national committee. By far the majority of people on 
that are farmers from across Canada. I do not think anyone can 
say that in the development of the whole farm program in 
Canada the farmers do not have a voice. We are consulting. I do 
not know how we could consult any more on those types of 
things.
<P>
	In response to the speaker just before him, I would like to 
announce to the House we know in government that we do have a 
lot of problems at the present time with grain handling in 
western Canada.
<P>
	A number of us have spoken to the minister in China this 
morning. The minister has asked me to announce that tomorrow 
he will be inviting a number of key people from the grain 
industry to meet with him immediately, as quickly as the date 
can be arranged upon his return from China, to talk about all 
those issues, all those problems and all of those challenges in the 
grain handling situation in western Canada.
<P>
	I hope the opposition will be pleased with that and will have 
input for us as members on that matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am obviously well aware of the 
national committee on the safety net programs. I do applaud the 
government. I do believe there are some very fine people on that 
committee.
<P>
	However, by the same token and having said that, I also 
believe we have to take it one step further. We have to have full 
consultation with every farmer in this country. That has been the 
problem in the past. We have had a select group. They have been 
good people but they cannot always get the feeling of what each 
individual grassroots farmer wants. We have to have the process 
and take it right to the end. That is the way we will find success 
in the program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to the MP for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, he made a lot 
of good comments which I applaud.
<P>
	For example, the problem with newspapers, information in 
the media in terms of agriculture, is big. It is probably one of the 
elements we so quickly ignore or forget. There are not enough 
specialized newspaper people dealing with the issue of 
agriculture. Maybe it is because agriculture is not as sexy an 
issue. In spite of the fact there is a lot of sex in agriculture, it is 
not sexy enough to really draw a lot of attention.
<P>
	The people from the west should at least be reassured by the 
fact that there are a lot of newspapers and newspaper reporters 
covering agriculture in the west, in Quebec and in the east. The 
fact is they have decreased considerably over the past few years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3627"> 3627 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of farm debt in Quebec, it is quite high and quite 
serious. In terms of revenues as well, the percentage of farmers 
who have to have revenue outside of the farm is quite high.
<P>
	As a last comment about the bureaucrats in Agriculture 
Canada, my goodness there are too many who are not farmers. 
The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is not a farmer. The 
deputy minister and a lot of the other deputy ministers are not 
farmers. One suggestion I would make to at least resolve the 
problem of bureaucrats in Agriculture Canada would be to make 
sure that over 50 per cent if not 75 per cent of the people who 
work in Agriculture Canada are farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to very briefly state that I 
think the hon. member has a valid point in the fact that in many 
cases farmers in Quebec certainly do not understand the western 
Canadian agriculture and vice versa. I do not think there is any 
question about that.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The media does play a very important role in our industry. We 
certainly have enough media in our part of the world but, as I 
mentioned before, sometimes it is misunderstood between 
regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief.
<P>
	My colleague and neighbouring member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre referred to safety net programs and the 
ongoing problem. I am hearing in my riding of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster that in spite of all this consultation 
there is not the foggiest idea of what program will be replacing 
GRIP which is currently being discontinued.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has had the same problem in his 
riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely. There is no question. 
Given the fact that Saskatchewan will be opting out of GRIP 
after this year, we are in a very short time span. By next spring, 
one year from now, it is imperative to people in my province that 
we develop something that will work. Certainly that is a major 
concern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very happy to speak today on the agricultural sector and to 
debate the motion of my colleague, the Official Opposition 
critic on agriculture.
<P>
	I had the opportunity and the honour to work for a long time 
for the farmers of Quebec and I can tell you that, since 1986 in 
particular, the significant changes occurring throughout the 
world, the GATT negotiations, North American free trade, et 
cetera, have occupied a lot of their thoughts and forced them to 
act in co-operation to deal with these changes.
<P>
	They know where they want to go and what they, their partners 
and governments should aim for. All that is left to do is make the 
federal government move toward the clearly expressed goals 
they set for themselves.
<P>
	In February 1991, when the Farmers Union started a 
reflection process called the rural summit 
conference-incidently, I want to pay tribute to Jacques Proulx, 
who until very recently was president of the Farmers Union. He 
acted as a great leader in involving not only agri-food partners 
but also rural partners in this wonderful rural summit 
conference. Today I pay tribute to this great leader, Jacques 
Proulx, former president of the Farmers Union.
<P>
	What resulted from this? A strong desire on the part of 
farmers and all rural stakeholders to take control of their own 
destiny.
<P>
	They talked about co-operation between local and regional 
partners, about protecting and renewing rural resources, and 
especially about redistributing political powers from the top 
down.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means a modern day approach to 
managing agricultural and rural development policies. It means 
decentralization, a word the people opposite do not know and 
have never recognized, for better efficiency.
<P>
	This exercise continued at the Trois-Rivières summit in 1991 
where stakeholders in the Quebec agri-food sector met to decide 
on a number of policies and commitments.
<P>
	The decisions included, among other initiatives, more 
research, as well as the transfer of new technologies, as part of a 
strategy to conquer markets, because we have really developed a 
liking for conquering new markets and making gains in the 
context of globalization.
<P>
	The various players in the agri-food industry also made very 
firm commitments. Again, under the leadership of Mr. Jacques 
Proulx, the former UPA president, commitments were made to 
establish a more efficient link between research, technology 
transfers and production, as well as better co-ordination of 
research activities conducted by governments and private sector 
universities.
<P>
	Some very serious commitments were made. I am not talking 
about meaningless speeches such as the one made earlier by the 
Minister of Finance on behalf of the minister of agriculture. I 
mean real commitments.
<P>
	For example, it was decided to approve, upgrade and support 
human resources training.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	A commitment was made to ensure the continuity, 
development and growth of agri-food industries through the 
identification of particularly promising sectors, not only at the 
domestic level, but also internationally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3628"> 3628 </A></B>
<P>
	Several commitments were made and, in particular, it was 
decided to work hard at readjusting income security programs in 
the agricultural sector so that they comply not only with 
NAFTA, but also with GATT.
<P>
	A commitment was made by all those involved in Quebec's 
agri-food industry, including farmers, processors, distributors 
and even exporters, to promote financing and self-reliance of 
agricultural operations by ensuring the most efficient and 
inexpensive transfer of farms to the new generation. Indeed, we 
must not forget that to be productive a farming operation must 
have a very high capital available as well as very modern 
equipment. In short, farmers often have to borrow huge amounts 
of money to be productive and more and more competitive on 
the national and international markets. To promote and improve 
programs aimed at encouraging young people to take up farming 
is another commitment made at the Trois-Rivières summit, 
which was an historical Summit according to all the key players 
involved in the Quebec agri-food industry at that time.
<P>
	From all the considerations, commitments and principles the 
partners in the Quebec agri-food industry came up with, I 
developed four avenues that the stakeholders should use and the 
governments should support.
<P>
	First, we should promote the autonomy of farming enterprises 
and processing plants by supporting their efforts and not by 
taking their places. We should make sure the government, for 
example, support their efforts to help them adapt to the new 
market requirements. When we talk about markets, we are 
talking about the taste of the consumers who are becoming more 
and more sophisticated and are asking for overprocessed 
products, what we call high quality, flawless products.
<P>
	The idea is also to promote the autonomy and performance of 
enterprises trying to access new international markets. That is 
the new creed. We cannot simply talk about globalization and let 
the stakeholders down by saying the free market will take care of 
things. We must organize and co-ordinate our efforts. The 
expansion of our farming industry must be based on better 
co-operation between all those involved in the agri-food sector.
<P>
	Second, we should consider farmers to be entrepreneurs and 
support regional entrepreneurship. In order to face the new 
realities of the 1980s and 1990s like globalization farmers had 
to get into management in a big way. I say this because I have 
met quite a few farmers in my time, starting in 1982 when I was 
with Agriculture Canada and especially between 1986 and 1991 
when I was employed by the Union des producteurs agricoles. 
Agriculture is a high risk sector. It is a sector in which it is very 
difficult to perform well. Any farmer who wants to make a 
decent living faces a number of factors that are beyond his 
control, including often unpredictable weather conditions.
<P>
	Operating in a high risk sector while also coping with 
globalization and increased competition from outside Quebec or 
Canada requires exceptional management skills. I want to pay 
tribute to our 47,000 farm producers in Quebec for what they do 
every day, because it is not easy to work for about 14, 15 or 16 
hours a day to support a family, and I think we should respect 
these great artisans of modern farming.
<P>
	These great artisans also need ongoing professional training 
because, when we talk about globalization, internationalization 
and increased competition, these skilled managers must be 
capable of keeping up with the increased competition, 
especially since after the signing of the GATT agreements there 
will be less and less protection at the border in the years to come. 
In other words, there will be more and more competition from 
food imports from the United States, Mexico and Latin America 
generally, from Europe and even from new countries like 
Ukraine, which at one time was, and may well again become, the 
world's bread basket. Not Canada but Ukraine is, or at least was, 
the world's bread basket until 1990, when the bureaucracy did 
its work, as bureaucracies will do-and we are seeing today in 
the federal government-and took over and made Ukraine lose 
its position as the world's bread basket.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	There is a third option we should explore if we want 
consistent programs to deal with today's challenges, and that is 
decentralization.
<P>
	As I said earlier, there is unanimous support for 
decentralization in Quebec. When we talk about bringing 
government closer to the grassroots, this also applies to 
agriculture. There is a consensus in Quebec that has grown since 
in 1989 at the annual convention of the Union des producteurs 
agricoles a resolution was passed by 99.3 per cent of delegates 
from all over Quebec and from every sector of the agricultural 
industry that the federal government should cease its 
involvement in the agricultural sector in Quebec. They said also 
that we should repatriate all of the levers and budgets, but only 
after these budgets are redressed and made more equitable.
<P>
	As my colleague said earlier, the fairness of federal 
interventions in the area of agriculture is certainly not going to 
choke the federal government, for it certainly has not during the 
last 15 years. Federal interventions have always been unfair to 
Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, decentralization and repatriation of powers and 
public funds in support of the farmers' efforts is a third 
possibility we must look upon favourably since these elements 
are not sufficient, given the new realities to which we have to 
adjust.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3629"> 3629 </A></B>
<P>
	The fourth avenue is support for the transition toward 
sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture will protect and 
help regenerate the resources used in the production of 
agricultural goods while at the same time satisfying the 
advocates of economic performance. Not only is sustainability 
vital, it is also serves to promote agriculture, as does food 
quality or safety.
<P>
	Agriculture in Quebec, as in the rest of Canada for that matter, 
will be competitive only if we can offer products that are not 
only as good as those of our trading partners but even better. We 
must increase support for the trend toward sustainable 
development that Quebec farmers adopted a couple of years ago; 
it is not easy for them to go from conventional farming or 
breeding techniques to increasingly environment friendly 
methods, but it pays. When it comes to adapting to a new world 
order, I would say that it is a promotion tool without equal which 
could rapidly be recognized as such by our trading partners.
<P>
	I will give, as a recent example of this, the growth hormone 
called bovine somatotropin, which produces a 15 to 30 per cent 
increase in milk production, depending on the study. My 
colleague will correct me if I am wrong but according to the 
public hearings held by the committee on agriculture, we will 
get a moratorium, and already American processors have been 
telling us that if we do not use the bovine somatotropin in the 
coming year we could benefit from it since it is being used by 
American producers. Take lactose products for newborns, for 
example; the use of a growth hormone such as somatotropin can 
be detrimental to the image of companies such as Global and 
other firms involved in the manufacture of that kind of product.
<P>
	Therefore, the payback could be great for Quebec and 
Canadian dairy farmers, for instance, if their products were 
more ``natural'' and retained a healthier image.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	All the commitments from the agri-food stakeholders in 
Quebec and across Canada and their boundless dynamism and 
energy are confronted with the government's lack of action and 
its laissez faire attitude, as mentioned in the opposition motion.
<P>
	I listened to the Minister of Finance say a few minutes ago 
that the government had received everything it wanted from the 
GATT negotiations. Really, there is no better example of the 
government's lack of action to help support the growth and 
development of the agriculture sector in Quebec and Canada 
than this one. We did not get anything in these negotiations. As 
soon as the GATT agreement was signed, we were told that 
Canada had won on all fronts, but it was all a show. The truth is 
Canada lost section XI(2)(c)(i) of the GATT.
<P>
	I repeat, we do not blame the government for losing article 
XI(2)(c)(i). What we are blaming it for is trying to dupe the 
farmers of Quebec and Canada by telling them that we have won 
on all fronts. Over the last six years farmers have become 
experts in trade negotiations, they are experts on GATT.
<P>
	Do not insult their intelligence by telling them that we won 
everything. Please let us show some respect for the farmers of 
Quebec and Canada. They are willing to adapt; they do it 
constantly and they have demonstrated their resilience. They 
will adapt to this new situation, but enough of these triumphant 
speeches on GATT and agriculture. Canadian negotiators under 
the direction of the new Liberal government won absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	The same is true for export subsidies for our colleagues, the 
grain farmers of western Canada. The main objective of the 
Uruguay round, which started in 1986, was precisely to 
eliminate export subsidies, the source of many problems in the 
grain sector since 1978. Instead, we are talking of a 36 per cent 
reduction in subsidies over the next few years. These subsidies 
should have been eliminated altogether.
<P>
	There is another example of this government's lack of action, 
again in the grain sector. Look at the way the government 
behaves when faced with threats of American action against 
durum wheat. Western grain producers, the first producers of the 
best quality durum wheat in the world, are threatened daily and 
unfairly with trade retaliation by the Americans. They are not 
more subsidized than their American counterparts. Policies like 
the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement relating to western grain 
transportation are being criticized, while the Americans have 
the same subsidies for grain transportation on the Mississippi.
<P>
	Why does this government not defend itself by saying no way, 
there is a limit? You are telling us that our durum wheat is 
subsidized, you want to threaten us with export quotas on the 
U.S. market while you are subsidizing your grain producers 
perhaps even more than Canadian grain producers. I say perhaps 
because only a study would demonstrate it.
<P>
	That too is another example of the inertia of this government 
toward agriculture in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We can also talk now about bilateral negotiations between 
Canada and the United States. Admittedly, I am concerned with 
the new tariffication coming out of the GATT negotiations, one 
that is supposed to apply to milk and farming industries. The 
Americans are claiming since the beginning, since December 15 
of last year, this new tariffication which will replace import 
controls under article XI must be subject to the provisions of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, which provides for the 
elimination of tariffs over the next 10 years. Even with a tariff 
protection of 343 per cent for butter, contrary to what the 
Minister of Finance was saying, we have gained nothing yet. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3630"> 3630 </A></B>
<P>
are still negotiating and the Americans are very tough in  these 
negotiations. Canadian negotiators, led by the present 
government, have been behaving like pee-wees since the 
beginning of the trade negotiations.
<P>
	I see that my time is running out, but I think that I can give a 
few more examples of inertia.
<P>
	I look at what is happening in the chicken industry, in the 
poultry industry in general. The bickering between Quebec and 
Ontario is destabilizing the industry as a whole and is 
jeopardizing the normal development of that industry, as well as 
the implementation of measures allowing it to face world 
competition. I see the lack of leadership in that issue.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The minister of agriculture should show a little more 
leadership, deal with the matter and act as a conciliator instead 
of not giving a darn about it and letting people fight.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable and you can understand 
much better what is meant by government inaction in the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	It is the same thing with all the discussions going on about the 
new income security programs in the agricultural sector.
<P>
	I asked the minister of agriculture a number of times, as I 
pointed out to the Minister of Finance this morning, to show 
responsibility and to instruct his officials who are negotiating 
the new income security programs, especially in the 
horticultural sector, to proceed with the negotiations so that a 
new income security program can be put in place for market 
farmers in Quebec and Ontario who agree with that and to stop 
buying everything senior officials say.
<P>
	Unfortunately, those people will not show any leadership. 
They go along with anything senior officials say during 
negotiations and discussions.
<P>
	I find that in the present circumstances it is very dangerous to 
have leaders like that, political leaders who do not take their 
responsibilities and who show no accountability whatsoever, 
given the enormous challenges facing the agricultural sector in 
Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	In closing, I wish that in the forthcoming months farmers in 
Quebec and in Canada will be better served by their federal 
government because they deserve to be supported for the 
tremendous efforts they have been making for the past years to 
meet the challenges of globalization, in particular.
<P>
	As for Quebec producers, we are proposing to them, through 
sovereignty, to take up the great challenge they talked about 
during the discussions held over the past years, that is to give 
Quebec an agricultural sector that would be strong, 
environmentally friendly but above all that would provide a 
living for farmers, men and women, in Quebec and in Canada as 
well.
<P>
	We are giving all those farmers, especially those living in 
Quebec, a chance to take part in the agri-food program of their 
own country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure that the hon. member for Québec-Est will 
straighten his colleague out when he gets a chance to talk to him 
a bit and explain a few facts.
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec-Est surely knows that the 
United States of America did not challenge a single tariff 
established by Canada.
<P>
	It had until April 15 to do so. I have the list in front of me, 
page after page of tariffs.
<P>
	Therefore, this is the final list for agricultural tariffs and not 
one was challenged by the United States. Did the hon. member 
opposite know that? According to the comments he made 
previously, I would say he did not.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member talked about durum wheat. Does he 
know that Canada won four times over that issue? If you will 
allow an expression used in hockey, and we talked about hockey 
last evening in this House, it is four to nothing. We have won 
four to nothing.
<P>
	The United States took us to the GATT and we have won four 
times to date. If we were successful four times in a row, one need 
not be a lawyer from Baie-Comeau to understand that we will 
win a fifth time. The Canadian government is protecting 
Canadian farmers, it is doing all it can for them. Therefore, to 
describe the situation in such a way and to refer to sovereignty as 
a means to end the debate is something else. Members opposite 
may mix sovereignty with ice cream or with wheat, or even the 
three together when it suits them, but the truth is a bit different.
<P>
	We are talking about the loss of article XI of the GATT. I have 
before me an article published in a francophone paper of my 
riding and I call upon the hon. member to give an answer to all 
this.
<P>
	If what he is saying is true, how does he explain, for instance, 
that according to some agricultural journals, and I will quote 
only the title since time is running out: ``Despite the loss of 
article XI of the Gatt, Canadian supply management programs 
are safe''? I could read one quote after another from agricultural 
journals stating that our quotas are safe. How does he explain 
that quotas are protected in the opinion of the agricultural 
community but not in the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois? Could 
it be that the Bloc members do not support quotas?
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start with the last question 
because as usual the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has gone too far. He said that in 
spite of the loss of article XI, supply management sectors would 
survive, and so forth. I never said they would not. I said: stop 
deceiving Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3631"> 3631 </A></B>
<P>
producers by saying that you won on all fronts. Producers are 
now adjusting, and I can assure you that these are very  talented 
and ingenious people. They will adjust. They will get through 
this rough spot, but I don't think you will in the next election.
<P>
	We say stop deceiving the producers who know everything 
there is to know about GATT articles. They know perfectly well 
that article XI has been replaced by a tariff that will be reduced 
gradually. It will not be easy to adjust, but they will. Nobody 
said supply management was dead in the dairy sector and the 
agricultural industry. You only hear what you want to hear.
<P>
	I also think we should stop underestimating the intelligence of 
farm producers regarding another issue raised by the hon. 
member opposite. In referring to tariffs, we said that today, 
negotiations were taking place between the United States and 
Canada, and if the hon. member denies the existence of these 
negotiations, he is contradicting what was said by his minister of 
agriculture, his Minister for International Trade, his Minister of 
Finance and his own Prime Minister.
<P>
	On December 15, a Canadian task force was appointed by the 
Prime Minister when the GATT agreement was signed. On the 
American side, an American task force was appointed by 
President Clinton to examine the implications of the GATT 
agreement and the corresponding section of the North American 
free trade agreement. How do we manage both?
<P>
	The first thing the Americans said was that NAFTA took 
precedence over the GATT agreement as far as tariffs were 
concerned. In other words, the new tariff designed to protect the 
agriculture and dairy sectors should come under NAFTA, which 
provides that in ten years' time, tariffs will be phased out. If he 
does not have the facts, I think he should stop talking nonsense.
<P>
	Incidentally, last week I was reading a report from the <I>Prairie 
Pool</I> and the <I>Western Producer</I> which said the Canadian 
government should stand firm on the durum wheat issue. These 
are not my words but those of western producers and editorial 
writers. If the hon. member thinks we only read about what 
happens in Quebec, he is wrong. We take our responsibilities as 
the Official Opposition very seriously, and to us it is clear 
Canada is not doing its job to protect western grain producers in 
the case of durum wheat exports to the United States. That is the 
subject of today's debate. I realize the truth may not be 
palatable, but above all, I wish the hon. member would stop 
talking nonsense. When one does not know the facts, one 
refrains from commenting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious that the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
does not really know the agricultural sector, because when he 
says that no tariff was disputed, he forgets that negotiations are 
under way right now with the Americans, mostly concerning ice 
cream and yogurt. That is mainly what these negotiations are 
about. That is where we will really suffer. They want to reduce 
tariffs by 200 per cent in these two sectors. It is criminal.
<P>
	They really do not know what they are talking about. Huge 
amounts are involved. It amounts to about 14 per cent of the 
whole industry. If they think they won in the GATT negotiations, 
why is the Ontario chicken market in a crisis? Why are farmers 
subject to quotas in a state of panic? They raised their 
production by 30 per cent. They are at war. They do not respect 
the Canadian council's recommendations regarding chicken 
production. Why? Because the federal government did not do its 
job in the GATT negotiations. Because it did not win. It was able 
to reach an agreement which seemed very generous for farmers, 
but when they examine the facts in various fields and sectors 
such as ice cream, yogurt or poultry, farmers soon realize that 
there is no real guarantee of good revenues, on the contrary.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	For the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to 
maintain that we won at the GATT table and that there is no 
change considered concerning tariffs in some sectors subject to 
quotas, I must tell him that I do not agree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that 
negotiations were ongoing on yogurt and ice cream, as my 
colleague mentioned a few minutes ago. It is a very important 
sector for Quebec since it absorbs around 48 or 49 per cent of 
industrial milk, that is to say milk used to make yogurt and ice 
cream.
<P>
	On a national level, it is more like 15 per cent. Forty per cent 
of the total Canadian yogurt production comes from Quebec, 
that is why this sector is vital for the future of the dairy industry 
in Quebec. I forgot to mention these negotiations, but I am quite 
sure that the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell did not 
even know about them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
take part in the debate today. The pleasure will be to try to 
educate, either in my comments or in answer to the questions 
afterward, members across the way who obviously do not know 
the facts about what is going on in agriculture today.
<P>
	I have read the motion and have commented earlier today. I 
say to members opposite that in one way I agree with what they 
are saying in their motion. The agri-food industry is going 
through some of the most significant changes in 30 years. 
However, as I said before, those changes are positive. They are 
challenges. They are offering things to the industry that were 
never offered to that extent before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3632"> 3632 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not inertia; it is just the contrary. A tremendous amount of 
activity is going on. As we go through life there are challenges. 
We have to prepare ourselves to meet challenges head on, to 
manage those challenges that come before us. This is a time of 
opportunity; this is a time of vision.
<P>
	The government should be commended. I respect and agree 
with some members opposite who have spoken today about 
some of the good things the government has been doing in their 
view. We have only been here for six months. We had to take the 
hand that was dealt us, as the finance minister said earlier this 
morning, in the agri-food industry as well as in many other 
sectors and try to make the best of it.
<P>
	We are well into the process of taking stock of what is going 
on. We are consulting constantly with the players, all the 
stakeholders. I remind members of the House and anyone who 
might be watching today about the size of the agri-food sector in 
Canada. There are 225,000 farms in Canada, plus or minus, 
depending on the definition of a farm. There are about 425,000 
or 430,000 people working on farms.
<P>
	I remind the House of the title of the department. It is the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food. The agri-food system 
in Canada employs over 1.5 million Canadians or about 15 per 
cent of the Canadian working population.
<P>
	When we look at its value, the $10.5 billion in input costs of 
primary producers or farmers each year to start the system 
evolve into about $13.5 billion in exports of either bulk or 
processed agri-food products. In addition Canadians spend at 
the purchasing or retail level. This does not include the cost of a 
restaurant meal but the cost of the food that the restaurant 
operator will buy. That $10.5 billion of input that primary 
producers make each year multiplies to over a $70 billion 
agri-food industry in Canada. In terms sometimes used in 
agriculture, that is no small potatoes. That is a big industry.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I have been involved in the agri-food industry all of my life. 
At no time have I seen a coming together of the players in the 
agri-food industry like we in this government have been able to 
make happen in the short time we have been here.
<P>
	We are bringing this with a tremendous amount of 
co-operation, and a tremendous amount of reflection around the 
situations that are there today. They are coming around the 
table. They are sitting down together to talk about how we in the 
industry, everybody, all the stakeholders, can collectively do 
what needs to be done so that we are all successful as we go 
down the road.
<P>
	I wanted to make those comments. As well, I want to 
congratulate those in the agri-food sector for the way they are 
meeting these challenges. As has been outlined by some other 
speakers today, it is not easy. It is not easy in any sector in 
today's economy.
<P>
	It is not easy in the agri-food sector as well, whether one is 
out there today seeding, whether one is out there with one's 
livestock or whether one is further along as a further processor 
or wholesaler or retailer or whatever.
<P>
	It is not easy but they are meeting those challenges. That is 
because that industry is made up of people who are very capable, 
highly educated, very well trained in the use and management of 
technology and use and management in general, in marketing, et 
cetera.
<P>
	I praise them and congratulate them. We look forward in the 
ministry and in this government to continuing to work with 
those people to meet those challenges. I want to also remind 
everyone today we in government realize that we are an 
exporting nation. Agriculture for every dollar, that is farm gate 
dollar we talk about, about 46 to 50 cents of that in the end is 
derived from export.
<P>
	It is important that as a government we have taken the 
initiatives we have concerning the trade opportunities out there 
for us. We know this government was involved in the GATT deal 
in the last seven weeks of what turned out to be a seven year 
round of negotiations which was supposed to be completed in 
four.
<P>
	We also found that maybe the previous government had not 
been forthright with the industry in telling it about 24 months 
before we got there as a straightforward and straight shooting 
government that many of the supporters for supply management 
had long left the table. The previous government had not 
explained that as forthrightly as it could have to Canadians and 
to the industry.
<P>
	We had a choice. We made the responsible choice. We could 
have walked away from the table and let the rest of the world 
shape the destiny of the Canadian dairy, egg and poultry 
industry, but that was not the responsible way to go. We took the 
choice of sitting down and making the best deal we possibly 
could.
<P>
	We made a deal. Yes, it is tariffication. There is no deal, 
whether it is a GATT deal or whether it is a contract to do 
something else, with which everybody walks away from the 
table happier. Yes, we would like to have had an article XI that 
was there and firm, but I issue this challenge to everyone: If we 
had got that strengthened and clarified article XI, whatever that 
might have been, I would also think we would have to be honest 
enough to say that it too probably would have been challenged 
down the road.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3633"> 3633 </A></B>
<P>
	As we go about in the world today, we know the advantages of 
freer trade in the world. We have been successful in putting in 
tremendous amounts of protection for the dairy, egg and poultry 
industry that still and by the year 2001 will have tariff levels at 
85 per cent of where they are at the present time.
<P>
	That is only a reduction of 2.5 per cent per year for the six 
years after the GATT deal is implemented, be that January 1, 
1995 or July 1, 1995. That decision has not yet been made.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere did we work as diligently than on that trade issue. 
Without question we got the best deal we possibly could for 
Canadian producers because as I said before fundamentally we 
are a trading nation. On those negotiations and even now on the 
negotiations on some bilateral issues with the United States we 
have put forward our position very vigorously.
<P>
	In the bilaterals with the United States that include wheat and 
a few other products there will be-and we promise this to the 
Canadian producers and to Canada totally-no deal unless it is a 
good deal for Canada. That means a good deal for the grain 
sector, a good deal for the processing sectors and for the supply 
managed sectors.
<P>
	We will not trade off one sector against another as some 
people think we should. We say we will not because we should 
not. There is no reason. We are negotiating and talking about 
different issues at the table, but we are not talking about them 
interconnecting with each other.
<P>
	We have been steadfast and strong on our position. This is 
emphasized by the fact that these bilaterals have been going on 
now for many months. There have been three face to face 
meetings and many meetings with officials in conversations 
over the telephone by the ministers, the minister with the 
secretary of state for agriculture in the United States, and we 
have stood firm and we will continue to stand firm on those.
<P>
	With the trade agreements that we have, especially with the 
GATT agreement, we now have a set of trade rules that all 
countries will have to abide by. We have the World Trade 
Organization that we can go back to, any country can go back to 
if it thinks it is being mistreated or mishandled or accused of 
something by another country. One must never be so naive as to 
think that challenges will not continue to arise.
<P>
	When we think someone is not treating Canada properly we 
will use the measures available to us to challenge that and to 
question that. We also have to recognize that the reverse may 
very well be true.
<P>
	As the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell just 
outlined, in the durum wheat issue with the United States the 
score is four to zero. As we speak today the International Trade 
Commission in the United States is having another hearing on 
that and we are confident it will be five to zero when this is over.
<P>
	What we are doing here in Canada is playing fair. We are 
following the rules. We have been playing fair. We continue to 
play fair and we will continue to win as we play with those fair 
trade rules.
<P>
	We recognize as well that we just cannot focus. It is very 
important because if the primary producer is not economically 
viable its chain is not going to pull. If the processor is not 
economically viable, if the further processor, the wholesaler and 
the retailer are not economically viable, we recognize that the 
chain will not pull. We know full well that in all those different 
stakeholder areas in the sector the efficient producer, the 
efficient operator, must be economically viable for the sector to 
be successful.
<P>
	In light of that, if I could refer to the supply managed sector, 
the opposition today is saying there is inertia, inaction. That is 
far from the case. The minister of agriculture has given me the 
opportunity to lead a task force in that industry. Some of the 
opposition members are saying today that the stakeholders are 
not involved which is far from the case.
<P>
	In the supply managed sectors we have put in place five 
commodity committees made up of primary producers, 
processors, grocery products manufacturers, further processors, 
all of the stakeholders. We first put together the list of the issues 
and the process is in place to deal with them. Now those people 
who work in that industry every day, not bureaucrats, are sitting 
down together and deciding how we can best take advantage of 
the opportunities that are now before us under the new rules of 
GATT and under the new trade rules we have.
<P>
	I do not know what more could be asked than to have that type 
of participation.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	We have made great strides as well in meeting the challenge 
the ministers have put forward, provincial and federal. As far as 
knocking down interprovincial trade barriers, we know that is a 
tremendous challenge. It is just like everything else. Too often 
people agree with it in principle and then when it comes time to 
do something the walls start going up. We have to knock those 
walls down.
<P>
	We have to meet the challenge and we are forging ahead in 
many different areas to meet the challenges as far as $20 billion 
of export trade by the year 2000. The industry collectively with 
federal and provincial governments says we can do that and is 
welcoming the challenge.
<P>
	As far as the inertia some people talk about, obviously they do 
not know and should become more aware of what is going on in 
this government. They need to do a little more reading. They 
need to follow a little closer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3634"> 3634 </A></B>
<P>
	I have talked about supply management. I have talked about 
the bilateral discussions with the United States. I announced a 
few minutes ago in the House, and I will comment on it again, 
that some of us have been talking with the minister in China this 
morning. We fully realize, could I say, the confusion and the 
problems and the challenges in the western grain movement at 
the present time.
<P>
	The minister will be officially announcing tomorrow that he 
will be bringing together as soon as he possible can on his return 
from Asia a small group of key players in the western grain 
sector. They will put their heads together around the table and 
see what they can do to fix those problems out there and will 
then go on from there to look at all of the issues out there in the 
western grain industry, the Canadian grain industry. It is not just 
a western problem. It has come to a head in the western area 
right now, but it is a problem right across the country which we 
recognize.
<P>
	We have made some changes already according to our 
platform. We have announced some changes in the Farm Credit 
Corporation. We have probably made more strides with 
pesticide regulation and the registration process in the last 60 
days than the previous government did between the time it 
tabled that study in December 1990 until fortunately it was 
replaced here in Ottawa with the present government.
<P>
	As well, we have placed some extra people in trade office 
positions around the world, namely in Mexico, Japan and 
Taiwan, and they are giving us good results. We have established 
a new branch in the department called the market and industry 
branch to work with producers, producers groups, processors 
and the industry as we go about the world with the new 
opportunities and challenges to market further processed 
products.
<P>
	We have been fairly successful, but not as successful as we 
might like to have been in Canada in the past by selling bulk 
products. The way we have to go now to create the jobs and to 
take advantage of value added is to value add and further process 
those here.
<P>
	The minister, as we know, is spending a number of days in 
Korea, Hong Kong and China not only talking about grain but 
about beef, dairy and pork, reaffirming the connections and the 
strategic alliances we have there. We know, and this is straight 
from the World Bank, that it is saying between now and the year 
2000, 50 per cent of the increase in world trade, including 
agricultural trade, will take place in that part of the world.
<P>
	That is not very long, between 1995 and the year 2000, 50 per 
cent of the increase. That is because 50 per cent of the increase 
in the wealth in the world is going to take place in that area and 
we need to be there. We are working with everybody in the 
industry in order to collectively take advantage of that.
<P>
	One of the goals and the platforms this government ran on last 
fall which we will fulfil is the agri-food industry. We want to 
ensure financial security. We want  to ensure food safety for 
Canadians. We want to reassure Canadians that we will maintain 
and improve the sustainability of the resources that mean so 
much to all of us. We will do that by having adaptation and 
development programs and consultation processes with 
everybody in the industry. We will promote that growth through 
market responsiveness and value added initiatives. I am proud to 
say that we will do that while at the same time maintaining fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I am going to close with one comment that I always like to 
close with and remind people of. Yes, we have a lot of important 
sectors in the Canadian economy. Maybe it is because I was born 
and brought up on a farm and maybe it is because after my 
family my first love is the agri-food industry, but I want to 
remind everybody in Canada and remind this House-and we, 
the minister and the department are fully aware of that-as goes 
agriculture so goes the economy of any country.
<P>
	We are going to make sure, with the co-operation of 
everybody, that agriculture goes well and therefore the economy 
of this country will go well as a result of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief to the hon. parliamentary secretary. You 
mentioned the breaking down of interprovincial trade-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to remind 
members to direct their questions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Could the hon. member specifically and briefly give me a 
couple of examples of interprovincial trade barriers that the 
government is working on that would begin to allow western 
producers to have access to the Ontario and Quebec markets? 
Are there one or two specific trade barriers he is working on at 
the present time that would allow that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, because a number of these are in 
the negotiation area and because, as I said, it seems to be a 
delicate area that everybody agrees with in principle, when the 
ministers get together they talk about different things.
<P>
	The last time the federal and provincial ministers met 
together they gave the officials very firm instructions. I had the 
opportunity to be at that meeting. There were very firm 
instructions to get together again and to continue their meetings 
with each other to find some of those initial ones where we can 
start to show that type of activity can work.
<P>
	There has been some work done and some successes as far as 
honey and some different things in the last few years. However 
there are more major ones that I know we need to look at, 
unfortunately not only in agriculture. We have too many trade 
barriers between provinces. It seems that the will is there now 
and the recognition is there more than ever. I guess like anything 
else, the first thing you have to do to conquer something is to  
recognize that you have a problem. I think there is more 
recognition now than there ever has been and that is a big first 
step.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the government member that, in final 
analysis, the energy that exists in the agricultural sector must 
come from its leadership.
<P>
	However, it is well known that the problems do not come from 
farmers, they come from the inability of the government to 
defend them. It could not protect article XI and similarly, 
protectionism is disappearing. The only argument I was given at 
the Bélanger-Campeau Commission by the person who is now 
Minister of Foreign Affairs was the Canadian system will 
protect milk production in Quebec, but if you leave Canada you 
will lose this protection.
<P>
	This argument is no longer appropriate, because we now are in 
a much larger market. Does the hon. member not agree that in 
the North American economy, in the Canadian economy, eastern 
and western agricultures have interests so different that trying to 
defend them simultaneously brings about important problems 
and situations almost impossible to reconcile? I will give an 
example. In lamb production there were rules to control disease. 
In my riding a sheep farmer had a problem because of a disease 
in his flock.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Previously, stricken animals were slaughtered and that was 
the end of the problem. Now, under pressure from the 
Americans, we have changed our procedure. We do not slaughter 
the animals anymore, because they have such large herds out 
West that the Americans insisted we change our procedure. In 
Quebec where the herds are small, we must abide by 
nation-wide guidelines which are not realistic for small flocks 
of pure bred sheep.
<P>
	We thus place in opposition eastern and western farmers even 
though in this case it was not just to please western farmers, it 
was under pressure from the Americans, and this is a problem 
for Quebec.
<P>
	I took this example to show that in the future the interests of 
Quebec farmers and those of Canadian farmers will be difficult 
to reconcile. Our interests are different and in the past we have 
often been on the losing end. I think that in the near future 
Quebec farmers are going to make a choice that will allow them 
to work out more concrete solutions in the larger economic 
market we now have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to the specific 
example of lamb producers the hon. member is referring to, I am 
not familiar with that. I would be interested if he would explain 
and chat with me about that. My guess is there is more to what is 
being said. I am not accusing the member of not giving the 
whole story.
<P>
	I can give the example of what we in Agriculture Canada did 
for our industries when we found the-and I cannot get my 
tongue around the big full name-the mad cow disease. When 
one cow died in Alberta last year because of that we sought out 
and destroyed all of the animals from coast to coast in this 
country that we thought ever had a chance of coming in contact 
with it. We did that in order to protect the beef industry, and I am 
sure we will take similar actions as far as the lamb industry is 
concerned. I would be interested to follow that up.
<P>
	As far as the protectionism in article XI, I just do not buy that. 
There are concerns. I ask the member to consider this: If the 
dairy industry and dairy producers are so concerned about their 
future, I would ask him why they are paying more as far as 
purchasing quota to have the opportunity for the right to 
produce. I simply cannot understand if somebody is convinced 
in their mind, as they are, that the industry is going some place 
in a hand cart why so many people want to be in the cart.
<P>
	It is very interesting. When we talk to producers, the dairy 
farmers of Canada, we find it did not go exactly the way 
everybody wanted it to go. We look at the level of protection, the 
very slow rate.
<P>
	What we have in the supply managed sector for the next six or 
seven years is the opportunity to prepare to meet the challenges 
of the market, the challenges of that very, very slow rate of 
reduction. I remind members opposite that even in the year 2001 
the tariff rate protection for all of those will still be very close 
to, if not over, 200 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government is indeed lacking in leadership. That is very obvious 
because there has been lots of talk since this morning, and even 
some mistakes made by certain members, including the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture has 
just told us that the government is doing the best it can, in spite 
of the split among farmers. However, even when farmers agree 
completely with consumers, as is the case with bovine 
somatotropin, what does the government do? What action has 
the government taken in response to a unanimous 
recommendation from the Agriculture Committee with which 
some members of this House are quite familiar?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask this question of the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of agriculture. What is the government 
doing? Does it plan to comply with the agriculture committee's 
recommendation that a one-year moratorium be imposed on the 
sale of this hormone, a move which is endorsed by all farm 
agencies in Canada and by all consumer organizations?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3636"> 3636 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> As usual, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is uninformed. Therefore, I will 
put the question to the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, I challenge the member opposite 
to have a one to one debate on agriculture sometime with the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I would suggest that 
he be very well prepared before he enters into that debate.
<P>
	As far as the government's response to the recommendations 
of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
regarding the bovine growth hormone or BST or whatever term 
you want to use-we know the product he is talking about-the 
member knows full well because he is a member of that 
committee and was there I understand when the 
recommendations were put forward.
<P>
	The government has 150 days to respond to those 
recommendations. I know that the government, the officials, the 
minister and I are already discussing those recommendations. 
The member can be assured this government will respond well 
within the 150 days in a very responsible way to the 
recommendations made to the government by the standing 
committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry has the floor. I would 
ask him to help out the Chair by indicating whether he will share 
his time or take the full 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was just about to tell you. We will share our time 
pursuant to Standing Order 43(2).
<P>
	I would like to move on to the motion before us today, a 
motion on agriculture.
<P>
	The term ``lack of action'' was mentioned with regard to the 
government opposite; I totally agree with the notion of ``lack of 
action'' and I would like to add another term: inequity.
<P>
	I think that in the last several years Quebec farmers have been 
treated inequitably by the Canadian government; that is 
unacceptable, in my opinion.
<P>
	I dug out a few figures to support my arguments and to have 
the word ``inequity'' included in today's non-confidence 
motion because, when we look at government spending on 
agriculture, it is clear that for the federal government 
agriculture is limited to western Canada.
<P>
	I will start by giving you an example. In 1980, Quebec was the 
beneficiary of $300 million in federal agricultural expenditures, 
compared with $1 billion in western Canada.
<P>
	In 1987 Quebec received $410 million, compared with over 
$4 billion in Western Canada. I think adding the word 
``inequity'' to today's motion would be neither superfluous nor 
inappropriate.
<P>
	Another thing I discovered is that Quebec's share of federal 
spending went from 16.4 per cent in 1980 to only 7.7 per cent in 
1987, which amounts to half of Quebec's share of farming 
revenues in Canada or 15.6 per cent.
<P>
	On the other hand, western Canada's share of federal 
agricultural expenditures went from 55 per cent in 1980 to 76 
per cent in 1987.
<P>
	Between 1980 and 1987, Quebec's share fell while Western 
Canada's increased. It went from 55 per cent in 1980 to 76 per 
cent in 1987.
<P>
	Once again, I emphasize the terms ``unfairness'' and 
``inequities'', all these expenditures to which Quebecers 
contributed a big share through their taxes of various kinds; they 
know very well that the federal government gets a lot from them.
<P>
	We calculate that about 25 per cent of the taxes collected by 
the federal government comes from Quebec, which means that 
this money which Quebecers send to the federal government is 
redistributed unfairly to our detriment, especially in agriculture.
<P>
	From 1980 to 1987, federal spending on agriculture increased 
one sixth as fast in Quebec as in the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	During that period federal spending rose by 192 per cent. I am 
glad that federal spending on agriculture rose by 192 per cent 
between 1980 and 1987. The federal government thought it was 
important to increase its spending to help agriculture. I come 
back to my word ``unfairness'', and we will see how this 192 per 
cent increase in federal spending on agriculture was distributed.
<P>
	Spending increased 37 per cent in Quebec, compared with 340 
per cent in Alberta, 292 per cent in Manitoba and 285 per cent in 
Saskatchewan. Again I come back to the word ``unfairness''. 
Such glaring differences are outrageous. An increase of 37 per 
cent in Quebec when Alberta got 340 per cent, Manitoba 292 per 
cent and Saskatchewan 285 per cent is unacceptable. I repeat 
that a lot of this money, at least 25 per cent, comes from 
Quebecers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3637"> 3637 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1990, the federal government spent almost half, 50 per 
cent, of its whole agriculture budget on research. I do not know 
if it is by chance, but most of the agriculture research budget was 
invested in grain production. We know that more grain has been 
produced in Quebec in recent years, but nevertheless it only 
accounts for 6 per cent of all our agricultural production in 
Quebec. We were shortchanged in the distribution of the 
research budget of the department of agriculture, considering 
that the department invested half its budget in research on grain 
and grain is only 6 per cent of Quebec's agricultural production.
<P>
	When the time came to do research in three other sectors 
where Quebec is much more active, namely the dairy, poultry 
and pork industries, it only contributed 24 per cent. Yet, these 
industries account for 59 per cent of Quebec's production. 
Again, you can see the inequity. Ten per cent of the research 
budget is allocated to the dairy industry, while the production of 
this sector represents one third of the total. Quebec was also 
penalized regarding research and development in agriculture, 
since more than 50 per cent of that budget was spent in western 
Canada.
<P>
	Federal government policies unfairly benefit western 
producers and adversely affect Quebec producers' 
competitiveness, particularly regarding grain and livestock 
production, as I just mentioned.
<P>
	These unfair federal policies force Quebec to make greater 
financial efforts to support the agricultural industry. Let me 
explain how, because the province does not get its fair share 
from the federal government, the Quebec department of 
agriculture must rely on provincial taxes. In 1987, the Quebec 
department of agriculture, fisheries and food had to allocate 
$569 million to the agricultural sector, whereas the federal 
government was only contributing $410 million. In other words, 
the Quebec government spends more on its agricultural sector 
than the federal government.
<P>
	The injustice lies in the fact that Quebecers have contributed a 
lot more to support agriculture in other provinces than in their 
own province. In 1987, Quebecers contributed $1.3 billion to 
agriculture in the other provinces. We paid for 25 per cent of all 
federal expenditures in agriculture, which totalled at that time 
$5.3 billion, twice the Quebec budget for agriculture. In other 
words, we use Quebec taxpayers' money to spend $569 million 
on our own agricultural industry and to send $1.3 billion to 
Ottawa to support other Canadian provinces. That also is unfair. 
I really want to stress that point. I want to show how utterly 
unfair Canadian policies were to Quebec policies.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	There is a double standard in the federal agricultural policy, 
and I want to give you some examples. Between 1983 and 1987, 
federal subsidies reached an average of $32 a tonne for Western 
grain, compared to $12.34 a tonne for Quebec grain. Why $34 in 
the west and only  $12 in Quebec? What was that all about? We 
pay taxes like evernyone else. Why do we not get our fair share?
<P>
	Pursuant to the act, the Canadian Wheat Board must, at the 
time of delivery, pay to western grain producers an initial 
payment set and guaranteed by the federal government. If sales 
revenues do not cover the payments made, the federal 
government makes up for the deficit. This system resulted in the 
following: between 1985 and 1988, the federal government 
spent $344 million to cover the difference between the sales 
price asked by the Canadian Wheat Board and the payments 
made to the producers. We ended up with a $344 million deficit 
which the federal government covered with our taxes. The worst 
of it all is that Quebec grain producers are not eligible for that 
program. We pay for the rest of the producers, but we are not 
entitled to these benefits.
<P>
	In 1991 and 1992, under the western grain stabilization 
program, western grain producers were guaranteed a net income 
equivalent to their average income over the five previous years. 
The federal government paid for three quarters of the 
contributions for this program, and the producers paid the rest. 
Western provincial governments did not take part in this 
program. When came the time to implement the program in 
Quebec, the federal government asked the province to pay for a 
third of it. Why did the western provinces not participate in it? 
Was it strictly between the producers and the federal 
government? When the time came for Quebec to take advantage 
of this program, Ottawa told the province that it had to pay for a 
third of it.
<P>
	Western grain transportation support is a real scandal. Since 
1983, the federal government has been paying an indexed $658 
million every year. In 1991-1992, it paid railroad companies 1.1 
billion to transport western grain, whereas Quebec producers 
were once again not eligible for that program. We pay taxes and 
with our taxes, the government promotes farm production in the 
west at the expense of eastern producers. It is in that sense that I 
would like to add the words ``lack of fairness'' to the words 
``lack of action'' in our motion. If I had more time, I could give 
you more examples, but my allotted time is running out.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, but the 
member's allotted time has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised 
at some of the comments from the member on the other side. He 
is certainly playing with numbers.
<P>
	One of the principles in the country is that in times of need we 
share in helping each other out of our difficulties. In terms of the 
payments to the west, I remind the member that there was an 
international grain price war. We had an obligation as a country 
to support western Canada and that is what we did. By the same 
token, when there were low prices in the hog industry and in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3638"> 3638 </A></B>
<P>
beef industry, which is more located in Quebec, the country 
supported those industries.
<P>
	The member opposite should understand that one of the 
programs Quebec benefits from probably more than any other 
province is the supply management system. Quebec has 
benefited greatly. Its dairy production is somewhere around 46 
per cent to 48 per cent of the total dairy production in the 
country as a result of our great Canadian supply management 
program.
<P>
	I have a question for the member. If his party were successful 
in moving toward separation, which I do not believe it will be, 
what would that do to dairy producers in the province of Quebec 
in terms of the loss of the great Canadian supply management 
system we operate under?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could have given you other 
examples, but I think that the presentation I made just a moment 
ago clearly showed that the level of Quebec's participation in 
agricultural tax revenue, taxation money sent to the federal 
government and reinvested in Canadian agriculture is I repeat, 
unfair; we realized that numerous programs were unfair.
<P>
	In reply to my colleague's question, I would say that if 
Quebec were to separate and become sovereign, we could keep 
all that money, that is approximately $28 billion in various taxes 
sent to Ottawa each year, and redistribute it through our 
different agricultural programs without being subjected to 
federal inequity and discrimination. We would then offer our 
own farmers many very profitable programs. I think, in that 
case, we could be much more aggressive on the international 
markets and carve our own niche for milk, poultry, eggs, grains 
or anything else we would chose to produce in Quebec.
<P>
	I think there would be no problem whatsoever. On the 
contrary, sovereignty would solve a problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak the motion denouncing the 
government's lack of action and its inequity, as the hon. member 
said.
<P>
	The government does not seem to have a specific policy for 
agriculture, especially considering the post-GATT situation. 
However, in line with the Quebec development model, several 
years ago the agricultural industry in Quebec started to organize 
and conduct round table discussions involving all players in the 
industry.
<P>
	The <I>États généraux du monde rural</I> held in February 1991 in 
Montreal was attended by all Quebecers involved in regional 
development and the agri-food industry. This exercise produced 
a series of guidelines for future action. Here are some examples: 
letting the agricultural community take charge of its own future; 
respecting and promoting regional and local values; focussing 
on local and regional concertation and co-operation; 
diversifying the regional economic base; protecting and 
regenerating  resources; and achieving a better balance in 
political decision-making from the bottom up.
<P>
	As part of this process of consultation and co-operation, 
Quebecers in the agricultural industry organized and looked for 
ways to pool their resources. Round table discussions were 
organized on a sectorial basis, including the dairy industry, the 
pork industry, and so forth. At the summit in Trois-Rivières in 
June 1992, these discussions produced a consensus on what 
should be done to promote the development of the agri-food 
industry in Quebec.
<P>
	The Trois-Rivières summit, an unprecedent exercise for 
Quebec, produced a series of commitments which included the 
following: to increase research and technology transfers as part 
of a strategy for acquiring new markets; to recognize, promote 
and support the need for human resources training; to guarantee 
the continued existence, development and growth of agri-food 
businesses; to revamp existing income security programs based 
on production costs by emphasizing risk sharing, productivity of 
farm operations, sustainable development and an awareness of 
market signals; to develop income security programs 
compatible with the rules of international trade; to promote the 
financing and transfer of farm operations in such a way as to 
prevent massive debt; to consider assistance for non-viable 
operations that could be reoriented within the industry and help 
farmers who retire from the industry.
<P>
	After this consultation process, what the industry needs now 
is the right vehicle to make the new strategy for agri-food 
development in Quebec operational.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	People in the Quebec farm community know what they want. 
They do not need the federal government to come in and impose 
policies which do not coincide with the priorities and the paths 
they have set for themselves. These people want to be able to 
make the decisions in the areas which concern them.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is a massive decentralization 
from top to bottom. Is this something the federal government 
can offer? Is the government willing to give Quebecers the 
means to make their projects come true?
<P>
	The agri-food sector needs a reasonable period of time to 
reach international competitiveness. Unfortunately, the federal 
government did not do a very good job of defending Canada's 
interests and Quebec farmers during the Uruguay round of 
negotiations under the GATT. It was totally unable to preserve 
article XI which afforded some protection to egg, poultry and 
milk producers, concentrated mostly in Quebec. Despite 
repeated promises by the Liberal government, last December, 
federal negotiators were not able to rally enough countries to 
defend and preserve article XI.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3639"> 3639 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the present import quotas will be replaced by high 
tariffs which will gradually diminish over time, the 
disappearance of article XI will seriously shake the Quebec 
farming community.
<P>
	By accepting to sign the GATT agreement, the federal 
government submits farmers, in Canada and Quebec, to a rate 
and mode of change imposed from outside by our competitors. 
The agri-food industry must change very rapidly in order to be 
able to face the new international competition.
<P>
	The GATT agreement reduces by 36 per cent the amount used 
to subsidize exports of farm products. This is a step in the right 
direction, although it is rather modest. Each year, Canadian and 
Quebec taxpayers will have to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars merely to compete on international markets with heavily 
subsidized grain exports from the United States and the 
European Union.
<P>
	While grain exports remain heavily subsidized, the GATT 
accords have forced the government to review its overall 
domestic farm support policies.
<P>
	Clearly, the agreement negotiated in Geneva on December 15 
last was not the best possible deal that the federal government 
could have obtained for Canadian and Quebec farmers. The 
biggest threat to the interests of Canadian and Quebec farmers is 
the outcome of Canada-U.S. trade negotiations in the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	The federal government is being taken for a rough ride by U.S. 
negotiators over the question of tariffs on products subject to 
quotas-eggs, poultry and milk-products concentrated 
primarily in Quebec and Ontario, and over the question of 
durum wheat, yogurt and ice cream exports to the United States.
<P>
	Government spending in agriculture does not promote 
structuring. The government should be evaluating the 
cost-effectiveness of its actions. Agriculture Canada is now 
involved in the analysis, organization and dissemination of 
information on agri-food markets. However, the Auditor 
General notes that the information collected does not 
necessarily correspond to user needs. The Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food should strive to develop a closer 
relationship with its clientele in order to avoid wasting public 
funds.
<P>
	The government must further define its action areas to ensure 
that there is no overlap onto provincial initiatives. In Quebec, 
industry and government have been working together for several 
years on implementing various market strategies. Since 
developing new markets seems to have become a federal 
government priority, it is essential that Ottawa bear in mind the 
priorities set by Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government should contribute financially to the 
efforts of stakeholders in the Quebec agri-food industry, 
particularly research and development efforts, to ensure that 
new market challenges are met.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The idea is not just to spend the taxpayers' money, but to 
invest it so as to promote industrial restructuring while 
maintaining the family farm system which is pivotal to 
Quebec's farm economy.
<P>
	Producers and processors are working together to develop 
new markets and adapt their products to consumers' tastes. In 
the agri-food business, competition is fierce and the industry 
must react quickly to diversify production, all the while making 
sure it has access to the best suited technology. This means 
keeping in step with the rapidly changing technologies used by 
foreign competition.
<P>
	The government must do more than make funds available for 
research and development. It must ensure close co-operation 
between its departments, the private sector and the research 
community. We hope the government will take positive steps to 
make sure the money spent meets the priorities imposed by 
market developments. Also, when it intervenes, it should be fair 
and give the same importance, relatively speaking, to each areas 
of the agricultural industry.
<P>
	One of the best solutions for Quebec farm producers, it seems, 
would be the decentralization of the decisions making process 
and related budgets. In a word, it is another good reason for a 
sovereign Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
note in the member's speech that he recognizes the benefits of 
the supply management system that has been designed in the 
Canadian context.
<P>
	I again come back to a question I asked his colleague 
previously. The principle that the program of supply 
management operates under is basically managing supply to 
meet effective domestic demand. Given the fact that Quebec has 
46 per cent to 48 per cent of the Canadian production, how is the 
member going to explain to his producers under his proposed 
separation that they will be able to have in place this system that 
he so admires?
<P>
	The member mentioned the trade discussions we are having 
with the United States. I think we have to recognize that the 
ministers are taking a tough stance in the interests of all 
Canadians. I certainly say to the hon. member opposite we on 
this side would welcome a statement of support from his party in 
terms of that tough stance our Canadian ministers are taking in 
those negotiations in all of Canada's interests.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I endorse the reply my colleague, 
Mr. Lavigne, gave our friend opposite. I would like to 
emphasize that the crux of the problem for the people of Quebec 
is really inequity because from where we stand we get the 
impression that the government's attention with regard to the 
Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3640"> 3640 </A></B>
<P>
agricultural industry is centred on the western part of the 
country.
<P>
	I would also like to mention a few things my colleague did not 
have the time to mention earlier. Regarding lamb production, 
Quebec has been unable to keep up with Western Canada, with 
its livestock increasing by 8 per cent from 1981 to 1991, as 
compared with 33 per cent in western provinces. Based on all 
that has been said so far in this debate in this place, I think we 
have one more reason to become sovereign in Quebec, to get the 
legislative tools we really need for things to run smoothly in our 
future country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
for milk production in Quebec, the question was raised-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-at least two times. Of course under the supply management 
system Quebec has been advantaged in terms of milk 
production. It is the only advantage in agriculture Quebec has 
had under the present system.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Because of the fact that the federal government has been inept 
in maintaining article XI, supply management is the thing of the 
past as the hon. member knows. The farmers in Quebec, 
organized as they are, better than any other agricultural 
organization in Canada, are positioned to make such that the 
milk production will be sold in other countries. We cannot work 
any more in the supply management sector, only because the 
federal government has not.
<P>
	One other thing about inequity in terms of the expenses of the 
federal government is it is not as though people in Quebec are 
not generous people. We recognize the principle that when one 
province is poorer than the other we try to be generous. That is 
not the issue. The issue is disloyal competition.
<P>
	This form of inequity which has been going on for decades in 
Canada has disadvantaged Quebec in a disloyal way. That is to 
say, in those areas where Quebec has had a marked advantage 
like in pork production, moneys were being used by the federal 
government to develop industries competitive to Quebec in 
other provinces.
<P>
	That is not a question of simple inequity. It is disloyal 
competition. That has been one of the problems with the farmers 
in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the colleague of the 
hon. member for Québec-Est, the hon. member for Champlain, 
want to add anything to his colleague's comments before we 
move on to comments? The hon. member for Champlain has the 
floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
members of this House often think that we cannot see beyond 
Quebec but I think we are able to include western Canada in our 
discussions. We must, however, point out this great inequity 
toward Quebec in all areas.
<P>
	We do not want to sound like whiners but we have discovered 
so many inequities at Agriculture Canada that it must be pointed 
out today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I take this opportunity to speak to the House about 
the accomplishments of our government with respect to farm 
income and safety nets.
<P>
	As a western Canadian representing a large farming 
community with both supply management and wheat farmers, 
the debate today is of particular importance. I welcome debate 
from members of both the Reform Party and the Bloc on these 
matters.
<P>
	While the previous government's plan for safety nets was 
simply a piecemeal approach, our government looks at farm 
income and safety nets in a much more comprehensive 
perspective. In our campaign commitments, this government 
called for the development of a strong whole farm support.
<P>
	Our approach is based on simple but effective principles. 
Farmers and their families need a comprehensive set of 
programs that will provide income security as they move to 
adjust and take advantage of the new international trading 
regime and to generate economic growth in rural communities 
that is badly needed in this country.
<P>
	Our government wants to provide farming communities with 
the tools they need to succeed in the years and the century ahead. 
I am pleased to report to the Chair that our minister is doing an 
effective job in that regard.
<P>
	As we all know, the system of safety nets in Canadian 
agriculture is a tripartite approach involving producers, 
provinces and the federal government. There is tremendous 
diversity and need out there.
<P>
	We recognize there are different needs in Quebec, different 
needs in Atlantic Canada, different needs even within Manitoba 
in the northern and southern parts of the province. My hon. 
friend from the Reform Party for Lisgar-Marquette will attest 
to that, being a farmer from that area.
<P>
	The approach taken by the minister is very open and 
transparent. Soon after the election the minister established a 
safety net conference for all players to air their views and 
concerns. This is the approach we want to take with respect to 
the whole farm support program. We do not want to have one 
separate program in Quebec, one separate program in British 
Columbia and one separate program in Prince Edward Island. 
We are looking at a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3641"> 3641 </A></B>
<P>
comprehensive national approach. We are meeting with Quebec 
leaders.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I want to refer, for example, to the GATT discussions that 
were raised. Our minister spoke to dairy farmers in Quebec and, 
if I am not mistaken, received a standing ovation. I also want to 
say that the Liberal government brought in supply management 
which benefited Quebec farmers greatly for the past 20 years. 
On the question of loyalty I think we have been very loyal, very 
representative and fair in our approach to all farmers.
<P>
	We want the kind of safety nets that will benefit all the needs 
of our partners. Taxpayers want programs that are financially 
sound and transparent. Our objective, therefore, is to develop a 
whole farm support program which will provide equitable 
support for all commodities, all producers and all provinces; 
which will not distort based on market signals; which will not 
influence production decisions; and which is less vulnerable to 
trade actions. Certainly people in the wheat industry in western 
Canada know all about trade actions, particularly those invoked 
most recently by the U.S.
<P>
	Farmers have seen tremendous safety net changes in the last 
five years. Some have been good, and we acknowledge the good 
work, but others have failed due to hasty implementation and 
because there was no producer acceptance or understanding. 
The government is committed to full consultation and 
agreement on an approach that works.
<P>
	The accomplishments since the safety net conference clearly 
show that our comprehensive and consultative approach is 
working. This is not an easy process. People need to talk through 
their differences. We acknowledge again that there are 
differences. The parliamentary secretary acknowledged we have 
to sit down at the negotiating table to work out these differences 
in the best interests of all Canadian farmers.
<P>
	The work of the committee over the next six months will be 
critical in shaping the industry's economic position. To seize 
opportunities presented by trade accords and growing 
international markets we need stability and confidence at home. 
The importance of this point has been impressed upon us 
particularly again in western communities because of the 
possible trade war with the U.S.
<P>
	Stability does not interfere with our capability to be 
innovative and market responsive, stability that allows us to 
preserve our resources, stability that works with fiscal realities.
<P>
	During the electoral campaign our government promised to 
reinstate interest free cash advances to strengthen the farm debt 
review process. The minister is consulting with farm groups and 
has asked the sector to come up with proposals. This is an 
important issue.
<P>
	In the committee on banking, for example, we have heard 
from the farming industry of Quebec, Atlantic Canada and 
western Canada. These farmers tell us that they cannot get 
access to capital. Young men and women in Canada cannot buy 
farms, their parents' farms, because the banks are not willing to 
do business with them. That is why we as a federal government 
have stepped into the process through agencies such as the Farm 
Credit Corporation to open up avenues of resources to young 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	The agriculture and agri-food department is currently 
reviewing the farm debt review board program, along with other 
programs, to ensure they meet today's needs in the sector. Again 
I want to emphasize that we are consulting with the people.
<P>
	Our government is comfortable with the idea that safety nets 
help industries stabilize income and ensure against risks the 
banks are not willing to take on the Canadian farming industry. 
However more money is not necessarily the answer. At home 
and abroad value added and niche markets represent big bucks 
for those who seize the opportunities. This is precisely what our 
industry is trying to do.
<P>
	The GATT has created new possibilities for the Canadian 
farming community. I want to respond to my hon. friend's 
comments about the GATT. Our Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food stood in the GATT negotiations to fight for the dairy 
industry. I have dairy farmers in my riding who I know were 
pleased with the outcome. I also know that tariffication levels 
almost as high as 300 per cent will protect dairy farmers in 
Quebec and those in my riding of Provencher.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious the government has accomplished a lot since it 
took office last fall. When we consider all the players involved 
in the safety net design, the complexity and the diversity of our 
agricultural industry, we realize the government is living up to 
its commitments.
<P>
	We brought everyone to the table. Our process of developing a 
new safety net package is on a tight schedule. We want to 
implement it by 1995. It will be a key item on the agenda for the 
next federal-provincial meeting of agriculture ministers. Our 
minister is planning to present it to the House soon after that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Provencher for his speech. I point out 
to him that the cash shortages, the financing problems, are 
severe.
<P>
	If he had read the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> last night he would 
realize that one window manufacturing company in Winnipeg 
got a $370,000 interest free grant. This is the kind of money the 
FCC needs to help farmers solve some of their problems. I 
would appreciate his attention to that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3642"> 3642 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for those 
comments. Although I have not read the <I>Free Press</I> to respond 
accurately to that suggestion, I just want to advise the hon. 
member that in both his riding of Lisgar-Marquette and my 
adjacent riding of Provencher the federal government has made 
a number of investments in terms of the farm community.
<P>
	He will recall that only two or three weeks ago I had occasion 
to visit his riding under the PAMWI agreements. I am pleased to 
report that we made an investment of $3 million under a 
tripartite agreement, with the federal government contributing 
$1 million out of its agricultural program to the good people of 
Winkler.
<P>
	In keeping with the theme of my friends in the Reform Party, 
the policies of the federal Government of Canada are equitable. 
If we give something to a window manufacturer in Winnipeg for 
a tax break, we certainly have given the same opportunities to 
the people of Winkler, the town in which my hon. friend resides.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member said that efforts have been made since they came to 
office. Having travelled to the west and being from the east, I 
can say that they are two different worlds. Lands in the west are 
much bigger and look very different to easterners, especially to 
someone from the Gaspé Peninsula. Sons cannot afford to buy 
their fathers' lands.
<P>
	In my region of Matapédia, we do not even have our own 
slaughterhouse; producers have to send their animals 100 or 150 
kilometres away. I would like to ask the hon. member what 
concrete measures, not only plans to review the situation, they 
have taken since they came to office to help farmers' sons who 
want to follow in their parents' footsteps. What are you doing to 
help us slaughter our animals in our own communities instead of 
200 or 300 kilometres away?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
observations and questions. He referred to dairy farmers in his 
riding and I want to tell him that I have dairy farmers in my 
riding.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I also point out what I think is important for the purposes of 
his question. The dairy farmers in my riding are concentrated 
largely in French communities, primarily French speaking 
communities. The dairy farmers in Provencher, the southern 
part of my French communities, are very similar to those in his 
riding. The operations in 1993 are much the same. I would never 
suggest that the operations in my hon. friend's riding are 
somewhat further ahead or further behind those in mine.
<P>
	I point out again that dairy farmers in Canada, including those 
in the hon. member's riding, have done quite well in the past 20 
years under a Liberal program of supply management. Just to 
provide the hon. member with ongoing assurance, the 
government will continue to express that loyalty to the people of 
Quebec, to provide help for them and to stand up for the dairy 
farmers in Quebec.
<P>
	On the second point about slaughterhouses, I am working on a 
similar kind of proposal with my provincial colleagues in the 
southeast corner of Provencher. We are anticipating that our 
exports in the hog and cattle industry are going to double over 
the next 10 years. We are looking at capitalizing on that in terms 
of value added.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to have his membership convey 
their interest in terms of entering into secondary processing with 
value added to bring benefits to the community. I welcome that 
kind of interactive process. I can assure the hon. member we are 
doing everything in government to ensure that young farmers in 
his area and in my area have the same opportunities as their 
fathers and grandfathers did under a Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated hearing the hon. member for Provencher 
speak to this issue.
<P>
	As he is no doubt aware, a very divisive issue in western 
Canada has been that of the recipient of payments under the 
Western Grain Transportation Act. Should those funds be paid to 
producers or paid to the railways as they are currently being 
administered? Does the hon. member favour the status quo of 
paying the WGTA to the railroads? Would he favour paying that 
transportation subsidy to producers? Or, does he have a new 
initiative that he would prefer to see undertaken?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his 
question. As he probably knows a payment panel has been 
studying the issue for some time. The Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food is awaiting the response from the panel to have a 
look at the proposal.
<P>
	I assure him that my position is in the best interests of grain 
farmers in my area. If they tell me they would prefer to use the 
current system then I will believe them. If they tell me they want 
to change the system and have a direct cash payment then I will 
support that.
<P>
	Just to provide some context, farmers even within my own 
riding have different views on the issue. Different farmers in 
close proximity to one another will have different views on what 
is in their best interests with respect to the payments they 
receive.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member and the whole House that our 
minister, as I said in my opening comments, will study the issue 
in detail. We want to hear everyone's view on it. We want to do 
what is in the best interests of western Canadian farmers.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
take this opportunity to speak out against corporal punishment.
<P>
	I believe corporal punishment is an inhuman form of torture 
that should not be accepted by civilized government. I was 
appalled to learn that a provincial court judge has recently 
spoken in favour of caning as an appropriate punishment for 
young offenders.
<P>
	In Singapore caning involves victims being lashed on their 
bare buttocks with a thick bamboo rod by a martial arts expert. 
These victims bleed after the first lash and are scarred for life. 
Recent events in Singapore have drawn the world's attention to 
this colonial form of justice. We could not advance as a civilized 
nation if we were to practise archaic methods of punishment 
such as caning.
<P>

inflicting violence against individuals.

	How can the minister denounce provincial governments

<P>
	How can the provinces maintain the quality of health care

<P>
	Each of these Alberta municipal governments told me that it 
is operating in the black and has varying degrees of reserves to 
draw upon if necessary.
<P>
	What a novel idea. Money in the bank, no interest payments, 
no out of control debt, no threat of bankruptcy and a credit rating 
which is indicative of good fiscal management and 
responsibility. Only in Alberta they say.
<P>
	I commend the mayors and councillors of these Alberta 
municipalities. When asked how they managed to run a debt free 
operation, they shared with me their closely guarded secret. 
They said they never spend more than they bring in.

	The ambitious project has been aptly kicked off with the Club

evidence of the important role that Club Roma plays in the

benefited from the club's generosity, including every hospital in

	Club Roma is also an integral part of the rich multicultural

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the absence of the Prime Minister, I will direct my 
question to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Reacting to the federal government's intention to reopen the 
drug patent law, the Quebec minister of industry accuses Ottawa 
of creating a climate of instability by threatening investments in 
Quebec. He says that a drug company established in Quebec has 
already postponed a $50-million investment in research and 
development because of the federal government's intention to 
review Bill C-91.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3647"> 3647 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the minister if he admits that the government's 
announced intention to review this law is already hurting  
high-tech investments. Does he confirm that, for lack of 
assurance from Ottawa about the law, a drug company 
established in Quebec has postponed a $50-million investment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say that the government has already announced its 
intention to keep our international commitments, as we signed 
the new GATT agreement and NAFTA.
<P>
	Moreover, I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition of 
the provisions of C-91 which he supported. These provisions 
include a clause to review this legislation. It is already in C-91. 
The Bloquistes supported this bill. It is more than a little 
hypocritical for the Leader of the Opposition to say now that the 
bill is being reviewed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The word ``hypocritical'' is somewhat 
inflammatory. I would ask the hon. minister to withdraw this 
word ``hypocritical''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would be rather difficult 
to understand if I did not use that word. I would never want to 
give the impression that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is a 
hypocrite.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would just like the hon. minister to take back 
that word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Certainly, Mr. Speaker. I withdraw that word.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the main thing is to determine whether or not this 
government will reopen the law before it is due for review.
<P>
	I have here in front of me a Canadian Press article published 
in <I>La Presse</I>, according to which the minister said on April 26 
that he would review the drug patent law. We know very well 
that this law is not to be reviewed until 1997. We in the Bloc are 
very proud to have voted for a law that will give Montreal an 
extremely important pharmaceutical research centre-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> -prouder no doubt than the Liberal Party, 
which waged a fierce battle to prevent a real pharmaceutical 
research centre from being created in Montreal.
<P>
	I ask the minister to tell us today in this House if he does not 
think he should reassure the pharmaceutical industry and if he is 
considering announcing once and for all that he will not call into 
question the 20-year patent protection, whereby a drug 
developed and patented by a company cannot be copied by 
others. I ask him to make that commitment here in this House 
today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
just said, we are very aware of our commitments under GATT 
and NAFTA. That is the basis of our position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to make perfectly clear to the House and to Canadians 
that this government is not going to be blackmailed by threats. 
We made one simple commitment during the election campaign 
on Bill C-91 and that was that we would review it.
<P>
	As I explained yesterday both here and to the media, that 
review consists of looking at the impact on prices of 
prescription medications and on looking, second, at the 
fulfilment of obligations made to the previous government with 
respect to investment and research and development.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition considers it to be 
inappropriate for governments to monitor performance 
resulting from the passage of important pieces of legislation like 
that, why does he not get up and say that companies no matter 
what kind of companies they are can do whatever they want? We 
believe that the best interests of Canadians need to count first. 
That is what the government is endeavouring to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing worse in politics, as in other fields, 
than ambiguity, and I would like to give the minister the 
opportunity to clarify specifically any ambiguity there might be.
<P>
	Bill C-91 contains a statutory requirement for a review of the 
provisions and application of the law in 1997; a statutory review 
is planned for 1997.
<P>
	I understood the minister to say that he will reopen the law 
before the 1997 deadline. If so, let him tell us clearly: Will he 
wait until 1997 or will he review it before then by a decision of 
the Liberal majority in this House?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Leader of the Opposition seems to be very nervous about this. At 
least he is now acknowledging that he supported a review of the 
legislation. It is indeed as he says scheduled to take effect no 
later than the fourth anniversary of the passage of the bill which 
would be the spring of 1997 as he indicates.
<P>
	I think it would be fair to say that it is appropriate for the 
government to monitor the results in the areas I have mentioned 
in the course of performing this review. Perhaps we will have a 
look at the results of that monitoring and will be able to give a 
precise answer to his question later on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3648"> 3648 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me say this as well. If anyone wants to talk about what is 
causing instability in the investment climate in this country, one 
does not need to look beyond the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, we gather 
from the Minister of Industry's response that he intends to 
review the legislation immediately and that is why he has made 
that announcement. That is what his response leads to believe.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
You will get a chance to respond. Just hear the question, then you 
will get to answer it.
<P>
	Reacting yesterday to remarks made by the Quebec minister 
of industry and commerce, Mr. Gérald Tremblay, who was 
outraged to see the federal government create a climate of 
instability detrimental to Quebec, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said that, instead of getting all excited, Mr. Tremblay 
should have contacted him and he would have put his concerns 
to rest.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	In light of the statements made by the minister of industry and 
commerce, should the Minister of Foreign Affairs not take this 
opportunity to make a reassuring statement in this place for all 
of Quebec and Quebec's pharmaceutical industry to hear?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every time I hear a question from the hon. member for Roberval 
it calls to mind the words from <I>Macbeth</I>: ``a tale told by an idiot 
full of sound and fury signifying nothing''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would appeal to all hon. members to sort of 
lower our tone in the questions and also the words we use.
<P>
	I would appeal to all hon. members both in the questions and 
the answers to please tone down our voices and possibly not 
crank up the rhetoric. I would appeal to all hon. members so that 
we can get the questions and answers in today.
<P>
	I take it that the hon. Minister of Industry is finished with his 
answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the public 
can see for themselves. These proceedings are televised and 
widely broadcasted. They know what we are getting at. We know 
why the Minister of Industry is nervous. He has nothing better to 
do than to respond by insulting Quebec's legitimate demands.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put his question 
through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are concerned to 
see the Minister of Foreign Affairs answer out of order and then 
fail to respond when questioned. Can the government, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Industry or the 
Minister of Finance, one of the them, respond and tell us why the 
people of Quebec should trust ministers of the government that 
guided Bill S-31 through the House, a bill which tied the hands 
of the Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund and curbed 
Quebec's growth? Why should we trust these people? We want 
an answer from the minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
must point out that it is impossible for the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs to answer questions on matters that do not fall under his 
administrative responsibility. He could easily provide an 
appropriate answer, but the Standing Orders of this House do not 
allow him to respond.
<P>
	I could add that the three ministers referred to by the 
opposition leader have demonstrated that they have obviously 
been working and will continue to work in the best interests of 
Quebecers and Canadians in general. And this work will 
continue to be positive and to promote the interests of 
Quebecers and Canadians. That has been clearly demonstrated, 
and the opposition's questions are not disproving anything.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since you permitted a quotation from Shakespeare I am sure you 
would permit one from Edmund Burke that says: ``Just because a 
few grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their 
importunate chirping, whilst thousands of great cattle repose 
beneath the trees chew their cud and are silent, please do not 
believe that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of 
the field''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> If I may quote one of the great Speakers of the 
House of Commons, would the hon. member please put his 
question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the 
Minister of Health. Yesterday the Prime Minister acknowledged 
that there are serious problems in Canada's health care system, 
but in the same breath he refused to consider the most obvious 
measures to help our health care system to survive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3649"> 3649 </A></B>
<P>
	My question for the health minister is this. If the federal 
government cannot maintain its financial support of health care, 
and if it will not amend the Canada Health Act to allow the 
provinces more flexibility in paying for health care, how then 
does the minister propose to solve the problem of financing 
health care in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. It gives me the 
opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	Actually the best news of the past budget was the fact that 
transfer payments in health care were not cut. It was the one area 
that was not. We guaranteed stability over the next few years. As 
matter of fact transfer payments will be allowed to grow 
somewhat over the next few years.
<P>
	In light of the fiscal problems we are facing, that should send 
a very positive message to all Canadians, that our health care 
system is one we value above all else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	I thank the minister for her reply. However it does not take a 
brain surgeon to figure out what is at the root of the financing 
problems of health care. The total health care bill in Canada is 
now over $70 billion with the provinces paying 46 per cent of 
that bill, individuals and private insurance companies paying 
about 28 per cent and the federal government now paying about 
23 per cent. The federal government is no longer the senior 
partner in health care financing. It has become a junior partner.
<P>
	Will the minister today admit that health care transfers are 
now insufficient to permit the provinces to meet the demands of 
the Canada Health Act? Will she commit to amend the act to give 
the provinces the flexibility they need to finance the major 
portion of the bill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
hard working Canadians who live by the rules, who pay their 
taxes, gave us a very strong message during the last election. 
They believe in the health care system as it is governed by the 
Canada Health Act. That is our mandate and we will maintain it. 
There is a role for the national government.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to tell all Canadians that 
there is someone here, there is a government, that will make sure 
they get health care not based on the size of their pocketbooks 
but based on the fact that they are sick.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one further supplementary question.
<P>
	The minister's answer leaves Canadians wondering what it 
would take to convince the government that health care 
financing and the Canada Health Act need to be reformed. How 
many more hospitals have to be closed down? How much longer 
do the waiting lines have to become? How many more 
Canadians have to go to the United States for health care?
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	How much further does the health care system have to 
deteriorate before the government will agree to reform the 
Canada Health Act and the financing of health care in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of most Canadians 
that the health care system is one of the best. It is far better than 
what you find south of the border.
<P>
	Not only is it one of the best but it has given us a great 
economic advantage. We will not reopen the Canada Health Act 
in the short term. We are here to make sure that what we value as 
a party, as a country, is maintained.
<P>
	There will have to be some changes, and change is always 
difficult. But it does not mean we have to let go of the principles 
we really believe in.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance who 
is also responsible for regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	The red book emphasizes the importance of developing 
companies in high-tech sectors. The Liberal Party has promised 
to increase incentives for leading-edge industries. We were 
therefore amazed to hear that the government plans to revise 
and, in effect, weaken Bill C-91, the drug patent bill.
<P>
	My question is this: How can the minister co-operate with the 
Minister of Industry on a strategy that will have a disastrous and 
devastating impact on brand-name manufacturers in the 
pharmaceutical industry who invest massively in research and 
development and are mainly located in the Montreal area, where 
the Minister of Finance has his riding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
Bloc members are having a hard time understanding the answers 
to the questions. As I just said, first of all, we are very much 
aware of our commitments under GATT and NAFTA. Second, it 
is very important for us to review the performance of companies 
on the basis of their commitment to invest in research and 
development, and we also have to-
<P>

Speaker, a supplementary for the Minister of Finance and 
minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, and I hope he will give me an answer. I 
would like to point out that the minister, unlike his Liberal 
colleagues at the time, did not vote against Bill C-91 because he 
knows how important it is for Montreal, and I commend him for 
that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the minister whether 
he will finally speak for Quebec in Cabinet and defend this 
important industry in the Montreal area by rejecting out of hand 
any changes that would weaken the patent legislation. Will the 
minister take a stand to defend the interests of Quebec and 
Montreal against his colleagues or will he remain silent and let 
the ministers from Ontario go ahead and undermine Quebec's 
interests?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question should be addressed to the 
minister having the administrative responsibility for a 
particular dossier and I go to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is a continuing campaign of confusion and obfuscation by the 
Official Opposition. The member's question implies that this 
issue simply divides along the Ottawa River. This is simply not 
correct.
<P>
	The brand name pharmaceutical industry is as important in 
the province of Ontario as it is in the province of Quebec. In 
addition the generic industry exists in the province of Quebec as 
it does in the province of Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, Canadians in all parts of the country are 
profoundly concerned that governments look to the companies 
involved in this industry, first of all to live up to the obligations 
that they entered into. Second, Canadians in all parts of the 
country are concerned about the impact of drug prices on our 
health care system.
<P>
	If members of the Bloc Quebecois are not interested in these 
things, that is for them to say. However, as to the commitment of 
the government to an innovative economy, that is clear and will 
be pursued by this government with vigour and determination 
across Canada.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. I can assure 
you, Mr. Speaker, that our health care system is sick and the way 
to find out is to go to a hospital.
<P>
	Recently in my province of British Columbia the Prince 
George Regional Hospital had to close one-third of its beds. 
Vancouver General Hospital has closed 108 beds. Calgary 
General Hospital is being closed down and the lights are being 
turned out on Calgary's children's hospital, all because of a lack 
of funds.
<P>
	Because of the Canada Health Act rules and regulations, the 
only solution to the health care problem the minister has offered 
to the provinces is to withhold health care funding to rationing 
and bed closures.
<P>
	Does the minister offer any other alternatives to health care 
funding in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, no 
doubt there have been problems in transfer payments. We have 
had a different government. Now we are back to protect the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	There are many new techniques nowadays which often mean 
we do not need to use all the hospital beds. To go out and spread 
fear among the population is wrong. We still have a very good 
system. We are going to work together to make it better and to 
renew it. That is why we are going to have a national forum on 
health.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a physician and surgeon who works in hospitals, if 
you are sick and need a hospital bed and cannot get it, that is a 
tragedy that does not belong in this great country.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister told the provinces she is going to 
withhold $750,000 per month in transfer payments for health 
care. That is $750,000 less to treat the people of British 
Columbia which means longer bed closures, less care for the 
sick and the elderly and people are going to die.
<P>
	We must get our heads out of the sand. What is the minister 
going to do and what alternative does she have to get health care 
and Canada on firm financial ground? It needs immediate care 
now. What is she going to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have the law of the land which is very specific. If a previous 
government chose not to follow the law, then that was wrong.
<P>
	This Minister of Health and this government take our 
responsibilities very seriously. We will follow the letter of the 
law. We will also send a message out that extra billing is wrong. 
It is wrong because it hurts those who need help. Believe me, I 
will fight to make sure that people who are sick get treatment 
based on their illnesses, not based on the size of their wallets. 
Any extra billing is a tax on illness and that is wrong.

	As the hon. member knows full well, both the federal 
government and the Quebec government have received a 
business plan and we are prepared to consider it as part of a 
long-term plan for the commercial viability of MIL Davie.
<P>
	However, I have no doubt that the hon. member agrees with 
the following statement: ``I hope that this policy, which calls for 
the rationalization of shipyards, will adhere to the fundamental 
principle which the government has always defended, that is the 
principle of free enterprise. Any other approach would only lead 
to  lame duck solutions, and this would be to the detriment of a 
shipyard that already enjoys a competitive position''.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Health.
<P>
	In my home province of Alberta there are some creative 
alternatives to the problems of the health care system. For 
example, the world renowned private Gimbel Eye Clinic 
provided cataract surgery to 3,500 people last year. That is 
one-quarter of the cataract surgery done in Alberta.
<P>
	In her zeal to enforce the three-decade old Canada Health Act 
does the minister propose that 25 per cent of cataract patients 
line up in a longer line?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me set the record straight here. When people go to the Gimbel 
Eye Clinic they pay a facility fee. It costs approximately $1,000 
for a person to go there.
<P>
	What this means is that a person who has money can get the 
cataract surgery ahead of others, but the person who really needs 
it and probably does not have the money has to wait a lot longer.
<P>
	What does that $1,000 do? Does it add to hospitals? Does it 
help the system do a better job? Does it foster better utilization 
of what we have in place? No. It allows someone to get richer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me debunk the 
myth that these are wealthy people going to the Gimbel Eye 
Clinic. These are senior citizens, citizens who cannot see, 
cannot watch television and cannot read. They are not rich. They 
are poor.
<P>
	The message the Minister of Health is giving us is that she 
cares more about the law of the land than the health of the land, 
and that is wrong.

	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, do you not think that the 
minister should realize that he is going against the commitment 
made by the Prime Minister on Tuesday that his government 
would respect Quebec's election law and that his attack is petty

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Four years ago a young offender by the name of Danny 
Perrault was convicted of manslaughter in youth court and 
received a three-year sentence. Last year he was transferred to 
minimum security in an adult provincial institute to serve a 
sentence for being unlawfully at large from the youth detention 
centre.
<P>
	Mr. Perrault walked away from the minimum security facility 
and before being arrested he committed a brutal sexual assault. 
Earlier this year he received a 14-year sentence for that crime, 
which he is appealing on the grounds the judge gave undue 
consideration to the protection of society.
<P>
	Will the minister send an unequivocal message to the 
Canadian legal profession, as well as to the Canadian public, 
that the protection of society is a primary concern of the 
criminal justice system?
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are three points in 
response.
<P>
	First, as the hon. member knows, because I have said as much 
in the House, we propose to bring forward specific changes to 
the Young Offenders Act within the coming weeks as we 
undertook to do during the election campaign in order to deal 
more effectively with crimes of serious violence. The steps we 
will propose will be intended in great part to meet the concerns 
addressed by the hon. member in her question.
<P>
	Second, as to the facts of the specific case, I ask the hon. 
member to bear in mind that while that issue is raised in the 
appeal, the statute as it exists at present provides expressly that 
protection of society is one of the governing principles of the 
Young Offenders Act and is to be taken into account.
<P>
	Third, we do not think for a moment that violent crime is 
going to be resolved in this society by tinkering with statutes or 
changing acts. The fact of the matter is that the criminal justice 
system itself is not going to end violent crime. It only deals with 
the consequence of underlying social problems. It is crime 
prevention that must have at least the equal focus of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Solicitor 
General.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3653"> 3653 </A></B>
<P>
	It was recently reported that despite the fact Danny Perrault 
has twice terrorized the greater Vancouver area by being 
unlawfully at large, current parole legislation  would permit him 
to go on unescorted day parole as early as December this year.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to change the parole legislation to 
ensure the Canadian public that protection of society is a 
primary concern of the criminal justice system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have already indicated to the House and to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs that I intend to bring

The priority will continue to be the protection of the public.

Development-Quebec on the off-chance that he will have 
something to say today.
<P>
	The government, which told us yesterday that it has already 
spent $6 million on studies regarding the high-speed train, is 
hiding behind some future study to avoid taking position on the 
HST project, or even approving it in principle. The government 
showed its lack of interest in VIA Rail's proposal.
<P>
	How can the government, which claims to make job creation a 
priority, show so little interest in a major project that could 
create some 120,000 jobs in a high technology sector?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the member's question 
with regard to VIA, yesterday the Prime Minister as well as the 
Minister of Transport indicated to the House that the $6 million 
report that is awaited and being done by three levels of 
government, the Quebec, Ontario and federal governments, is 
due some time this summer.
<P>
	At that point the government will study the opportunities and 
the alternatives available to it to look at the very intriguing 
project of high speed rail.
<P>
	We are not discarding anything, but it would be premature to 
say anything at this point until such time as the study was 
complete. Then we would be willing to work with all members 
of the House to see whether or not it is viable and feasible for the 
country.

considering the type of equipment required and the type of jobs 
created, fits perfectly in a strategy for the reconversion of the 
military industry, which is a commitment made by the Liberal

we are looking at closely with the governments of Quebec and 
Ontario, and this is why these studies are necessary. 
Consequently, if we are to follow the advice of the Bloc, we 
should wait for the results of the studies and review these very 
carefully. As the member for Windsor, I can assure you that I 
have a real interest in this issue.

<P>
	It was reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that the government 
paid out $440 million in unemployment insurance benefits due 
to fraud, abuse and mistakes in 1993. An internal investigation 
and control audit identified a study which pointed to a better 
focus on who abuses UI, but the use of this focus was prohibited 
because it contravened the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Will the parliamentary secretary confirm that the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, which was set up to protect law abiding 
Canadians from abuse by government, is once again being used 
to protect criminals at the expense of ordinary and law abiding 
Canadian citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training

side of the House are the architects of the Charter of Rights and

which the minister has taken action. Of course everything we do 
upholds the charter. The full weight of the charter stands.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I fully understand your desire to ensure that all 
members of this House enjoy the same privileges. I raise this 
question because I believe my privileges as a member of this 
House were breached during Question Period.
<P>
	As House Leader for the Official Opposition, the member for 
Roberval should be familiar with the Standing Orders and 
should know that these prevail during Question Period. The fact 
that he would put questions to a minister concerning a field for 
which he is not responsible is not, in itself, an abuse of his right 
to ask questions since another minister, the responsible minister, 
may answer the question.
<P>
	Where I feel my privileges were breached during Question 
Period, and I would think the same was true for the Minister of 
Finance, was not when opposition members rose and put 
questions to us, knowing full well that we could not answer them 
because they were not related to our ministerial responsibilities. 
Other ministers simply took it upon themselves to answer the 
questions.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	I feel my privileges were breached when, in the preamble to 
their questions, both the member for Roberval and the member 
for Laurier-Sainte-Marie made some gratuitous statements to 
the effect that as a member and a minister from the province of 
Quebec, I was avoiding answering the question and leaving this 
task up to another minister from the province of Ontario.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable to allege dereliction of duty on the 
part of a member of this House. By making such an allegation, 
the members for Roberval and Laurier-Sainte-Marie were 
hoping to cast in a negative light my work as a minister and as a 
member of this House who defends the interests of his 
constituents.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask that you reflect upon this situation and 
review the questions put earlier by the opposition. I think it is 
important that you check the blues. As the saying goes, when 
you lie long enough, the lie becomes the truth.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question of privilege and a point of order.
<P>
	If I may, I will start with the point of order since it is directly 
related to what has just been said.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to have your opinion, which is part 
of your mandate, because my colleague raised the question of 
privilege in reference to comments made by a government 
minister. I admit that he may not have been speaking about 
something which falls within his area of responsibility but that 
is not my problem. I can question as I see fit, and my colleagues 
can also question any comment made by a member of the 
government because they are supposed to act responsibly. If 
they do not, that is a different problem.
<P>
	I would like you, Mr. Speaker, to rule on this, and take the 
time to do the necessary research, so we can know whether the 
Opposition is allowed to question in accordance with Standing 
Orders any member of the government who has made a public 
statement, even if this statement is not directly related to his or 
her department.
<P>
	I would like to have your opinion on this at your convenience 
and, if I may, I will now move on to my question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will make enquiries. I will get back to the 
House and give you my opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the breach of 
privilege committed in this House has to do with the industry 
minister's comments, which I find totally unparliamentary, 
unworthy of this House and unacceptable. In his comments, the 
minister tried or seemed to criticize my attitude or the way I 
phrased the question or the way in which he perceived me.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I find it totally unacceptable that, within the framework of the 
parliamentary game, a government minister's only way of

asked in this House is to try to humiliate, discredit and or be rude 
to a member of this Parliament.

without further ado. That is what I demand.

<P>
	There are many traditions in this House. You, Mr. Speaker, are 
the master of the rules of this House and you rule. I do not think 
this is a point of privilege but perhaps a point of order that is 
being made.
<P>
	Surely we deprive this House of a great deal if it becomes 
inappropriate for a member of Parliament to recall a famous 
quotation from the Bard himself in response to a situation that 
arises.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will take under advisement the interventions 
of members of both sides. I am not sure we have a point of 
privilege but I will treat it as either a point of privilege or point 
of information.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise in the House this afternoon to speak 
against the motion by the hon. member for Québec-Est.
<P>
	Part of that motion talks about the government's lack of action 
in the agricultural sector. I find this an insult to our agricultural 
sector. I do not believe that farmers have the intention of coming 
here with their hands out looking for favours from our 
government.
<P>
	I would like to talk about my riding, the riding of Durham, 
which is a large agricultural sector. It includes Uxbridge, 
Scugog township, Bowmanville and Orono. These places are 
well known for their agricultural background and indeed not 
only in the riding but throughout Canada. They show their cattle 
at the local royal agricultural fair and compete with some 
farmers from Quebec.
<P>
	In my riding agriculture is the second largest industry, second 
only to General Motors.
<P>
	My years of living with these people and acting as an adviser 
to them and farming myself has taught me of their great 
independence and integrity. They do not depend on government 
to run their local every day operations. Today I am sure that 
many are out on the land cultivating and preparing for their 
spring crops.
<P>
	What is the role of government and how does it interact with 
our farming community? What has the government actually 
done to foster this development?
<P>
	I would like to talk about three basic areas. One is trade. As 
some will know, we have just recently culminated our trade 
negotiations in GATT in which we have had a change in our 
system from the supply management system to a tariffication 
system. We spent a great many days and hours in this House 
debating these negotiations. Indeed, our agriculture department 
has been involved on an hourly basis dealing with this.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	This even continues after the culmination of GATT as we try 
to get side agreements with the Americans dealing with some of 
our problems with durum wheat and so forth. In fact, the 
government has been committed to representing the interests of 
farmers. I can assure members that the farmers in my riding that 
I have talked to are indeed happy and proud that our government 
has stood up for their interests. They realize they did not get 
everything they wanted from the GATT negotiations.
<P>
	Having said that, I go back to my original premise. They are 
proud and independent people. They look at the GATT 
negotiations and the new trade opportunities as great challenges 
for Canadian farmers. They look at things like NAFTA and new 
markets created both in the United States and now in Mexico.
<P>
	Only last week a number of farmers attended at my office. 
Their promotion was not that they were upset with the actions of 
the government, indeed not. They wanted to attend a trade 
negotiation in South America. They wanted to find out more 
about bean farmers in South America. I am happy to say that I 
transferred those comments to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food who is considering this.
<P>
	Another of these farmers had realized the great opportunities 
presented by the North American market and developed a food 
processing plant. Many of the farmers in the area got together to 
support this. This production facility which basically fast 
freezes vegetables ships 100 per cent of its output into the 
American market. These are great opportunities that our farmers 
are realizing.
<P>
	I would like to speak of another area to do with research and 
development and our government's commitment to Canadian 
farmers in the areas of research and development. Our ability to 
innovate depends on a commitment to research. Agri-food 
research has produced some exceptional economic gains for 
Canada.
<P>
	Perhaps the best example is the development of canola. From 
humble origins as rapeseed grown during the Second World War 
to produce a marine lubricant, canola has become one of our 
most important export crops worth almost a billion dollars.
<P>
	The Cinderella story of canola is well known but it is still 
worth noting that researchers at Agri-Food Canada used 
selective breeding to reduce or eliminate undesirable aspects of 
the oil and produced a high quality oil substitute for human 
consumption.
<P>
	There are many other good examples of innovative thinking in 
agri-research. For instance the research centre in Lennoxville, 
Quebec has adapted a technology that helps detect a generic 
mutation in pork that reduces quality. This technology will help 
pork producers sell their products into lucrative markets but also 
very selective markets in Asia.
<P>
	I should interject at this point to note that as we stand here the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is in southeast Asia 
promoting new markets for Canadian agricultural producers. I 
am proud to say that I have taken some of those initiatives to 
heart in my own riding and suggested to some of our dairy 
producers who export cattle around the world that they should 
also be focusing on southeast Asia.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would like to mention that CIDA has an 
agricultural dairy operation testing in southern China at this 
very moment. We hope that some of the benefits  that will flow 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3657"> 3657 </A></B>
<P>
out of that are increased cattle production and shipment to 
China.
<P>
	Carrying on with research and development, the Saskatoon 
Research Centre has developed a new type of sunflower called 
sunola that is heat and drought resistant. This crop can be grown 
further north than regular sunflowers and produces a healthier 
oil. Contract production began in Saskatchewan in 1993 on 
about 100,000 acres.
<P>
	The department is also a major player in the development and 
application of biotechnologies like natural pest controls for the 
improvement of agriculture and agri-food products.
<P>
	In these times of fiscal restraint expanding our budget for 
agri-food R and D is just not possible. But the minister has made 
a firm commitment to maintain current research funding levels 
by absorbing administrative costs in other parts of his 
department.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time the department is ensuring that research 
priorities are driven by market opportunities. Better focused R 
and D is critical to global competitiveness and economic 
growth. It is now increasingly important for us to develop low 
cost processes and the new products we need to capture new 
markets. The future holds great opportunities and potential 
gains for biotechnology and from value added non-food 
products such as ethanol.
<P>
	Canada is not alone in this field. Our agri-food sector has a lot 
of competitors. While Canada has a strong record on public 
investment and R and D our competitors invest more overall, 
that is public and private sector research and development, than 
we do.
<P>
	The main challenges the government faces are to keep R and 
D funding at least at current levels to ensure that research 
priorities are driven by market opportunities, to stimulate 
industry investment, to look into ways of increasing the 
accessibility of venture capital for new products and 
development, to ensure that the right technologies get to the 
right people as quickly as possible.
<P>
	R and D unlike other expenditures cannot be turned off like a 
tap. It requires careful planning. Because of inadequate support 
for research in the past, Canada has already missed the 
advantages of leadership in some areas. They will change 
policies that act as disincentives to the private sector in 
investment in agri-food technologies.
<P>
	I would like to go on to a further section and that is to deal 
with our taxation policies. In Canada we have a very favourable 
tax policy toward farmers. It is called cash basis accounting. It 
means that you can buy cattle and so forth and write them off for 
tax purposes. This has existed in Canada and indeed Quebec for 
many years. It allows our farmers to build up big inventories of 
cattle and livestock without paying any income tax. This 
program of course is being continued by our government.
<P>
	I look also toward the last budget. There was much talk about 
losing the $500,000 exemption for farmers. I am proud to say 
that our finance minister has listened very well to the needs and 
concerns of farmers and kept this in place.
<P>
	I note also that we are debating through the finance 
committee, of which I am a member, the GST. One of our major 
concerns is to reduce and to avoid taxing farmers and try to make 
that tax simpler for farmers so that they do not have to get 
involved with the accounting and so forth for it.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, almost everything the 
government has done has been for the best interest in advancing 
the best interests of farmers.
<P>
	I would like to go back to where I started and that is that this 
motion is inconsistent and makes farmers feel they have to be 
dependent on government for everything. This is just not the 
case and it is unworthy of Canadian farmers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's remarks. Today's motion does not 
really deal with research and development in Canada, but with 
the department of agriculture's lack of spine, its lack of 
leadership, and the lack of direction in agriculture.
<P>
	It is quite true that in the R and D sector, scientists across 
Canada are making all kinds of discoveries, and that is good. 
Developments regarding new varieties of wheat and seeds are 
desirable. As a matter of fact, we would like the government to 
find more funds to support R and D. As the hon. member 
mentioned, the opening of new markets depends first and 
foremost on R and D.
<P>
	The government is lacking initiative even when it comes to R 
and D, the member admitted it himself; investments in that area 
have been frozen. If it really had the interests of farmers at heart, 
the government could at leat increase its funding of R and D for 
agriculture. I repeat, the motion does not deal with Canadian R 
and D, but with the government's lack of leadership and 
initiative. We could give you many examples of this lack of 
initiative such as the negotiations with the United States for 
which some Liberal members tell us that the government has 
taken a tough stand, when we know that in fact they are 
completely caving in.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his comments. I am as sure as we breathe here today that 
Agriculture Canada is undertaking research and development. 
The hon. member is probably correct in the sense that we cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3658"> 3658 </A></B>
<P>
increase funding and many aspects of our government have been 
curtailed. That is just the way it is.
<P>
	I can assure the member that research and development 
continues as we breathe today. Indeed I find it very hard to 
accept this concept of lack of initiative. As we stand here the 
minister of agriculture is in southeast Asia promoting new 
markets for agriculture in Canada. It seems unbelievable that the 
member would think this way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my distinguished colleague across the way who just 
gave us this very excellent discourse is an accountant by 
profession. Obviously he knows how to count things well and 
proper.
<P>
	I wonder how he can reconcile for me the Bloc Quebecois 
policy whereby on the one hand it is saying today that we must 
reduce the number of specialists in agriculture and hire-as the 
member for Quebec-Est said this morning-more farmers to be 
in the agriculture department. A couple of hours later it was 
saying hire more scientists in agriculture, which is the opposite 
of the previous argument.
<P>
	I wonder if he can also tell us what he thinks as an accountant 
of a party that asks us to decrease overall budgetary 
expenditures and at the same time today is telling us that we are 
not spending enough.
<P>
	Can he reconcile that kind of accounting for us, because I am 
having some difficulty. Perhaps the professional judgment of 
my colleague across can help us understand this Bloc Quebecois 
modern math.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. Of course I do not know if the math in Quebec is 
different from that in the rest of Canada. It appears that perhaps 
it is.
<P>
	I do not know how it balances things from one hand to the 
other. It seems that it lives in a different world than we do. It 
must be a great place to be, it must be a tremendous fairy land in 
some ways where you can have your cake and eat it too 
constantly. I find that very hard to believe. I think we have to 
have a more honest approach to these problems. I am sure 
farmers in all of Canada want a more honest approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
welcome this opportunity to speak on this very important issue 
of agriculture.
<P>
	My family and I are actively involved in operating a 1,100 
acre grain farm in northern Alberta and so agriculture is very 
near and dear to my heart. Agriculture is important to my riding 
of Peace River as well because it is a very large industry. No one 
has any doubt that agriculture is crucial to Canada.
<P>
	Although Canadian farmers have been hard hit with a trade 
war that has lasted many years, in 1992 alone we still managed 
to export over $12 billion of agriculture commodities. Wheat 
and other cereals are our leading exports, with principal 
destinations being China, Korea and Japan. Live animals, meat 
and meat products are also important, with exports bound for the 
United States and Japan. Oilseeds, mostly canola, go mostly to 
Japan in raw form and to the United States in the form of 
processed oil.
<P>
	In 1991 a total of 867,000 people resided on farms in Canada 
and total receipts from those farming operations came to $23 
billion. We also know that agriculture has one of the highest 
spinoffs in terms of job creation.
<P>
	Today we are being asked to condemn this government for its 
inaction with respect to the agriculture sector which is presently 
being confronted with the largest restructuring it has faced in the 
last 30 years.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Restructuring is something that agriculture and farmers are 
familiar with and has happened since Canada has been 
inhabited. My response to this question is yes, the government 
can do more. However, in the area of trade we have made a very 
good start even though it is only a start.
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation. One out of every four jobs in this 
country can be linked to trade. Therefore we must push for trade 
liberalization both at home and abroad. This means moving 
beyond what has been negotiated at the first phase of GATT. We 
must work within the World Trade Organization to lower 
remaining trade barriers at a faster pace so that those sectors that 
have natural advantages can compete and win markets without 
the support of the treasuries of those countries.
<P>
	We welcome the agricultural trade rules that GATT has 
brought us. Let us examine some of those rules.
<P>
	Number one, overall tariffs on agriculture goods will be 
reduced by 36 per cent with a minimum reduction of 15 per cent 
for each specific product. Implementation will take place 
between 1995 and the year 2000 in six equal annual steps.
<P>
	Number two, countries will be compelled to reduce internal 
support of their agricultural industries by up to 20 per cent over 
six years where such support has the effect of distorting trade. 
Countries will be committed to reducing export subsidy 
expenditures by 36 per cent and reducing the volume of 
subsidized exports by 21 per cent over the next six years.
<P>
	Supply managed products will now be subject to tariff 
barriers instead of quota restrictions. It is true that the supply 
managed sectors need protection for a time to adjust to the free 
market conditions. I would think that 10 years should be quite 
enough time for that adjustment process to take place.
<P>
	It was evident at the GATT negotiations that Canada had no 
support for article XI. The world has moved  beyond that. We are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3659"> 3659 </A></B>
<P>
looking for liberalized trade throughout the world and Canada 
simply could not sustain any argument for article XI support.
<P>
	My concern is that having set our tariffs for certain products 
at excessively high levels, we are inviting challenges from our 
trading partners. Let me give members a run through on a quick 
list. We have set our tariffs on eggs at 192 per cent; yogurt, 279 
per cent; chicken, 280 per cent; milk, 283 per cent; ice cream, 
326 per cent; and butter, 351 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to elaborate a little on that last tariff. The 
domestic price of butter in the United States is $1.54 per 
kilogram. Once transportation and the 351 per cent tariff are 
added and the American dollar is converted to Canadian, that 
same kilogram of butter will cost $10.15 in Canada. That 
compares with the Canadian support price of $5.32.
<P>
	The tariff makes American butter almost twice the price of 
Canadian butter. Is this not overkill? Is this not a reeling 
example of overtariffication? Obviously the tariff is way out of 
line. It is obvious we will not see any trade in butter for many 
years to come. Yes, let us help the supply managed sector move 
toward becoming a self-sustaining industry but let us be fair and 
not jeopardize the trading opportunities of those agriculture 
sectors that are competitive by suggesting blatantly high tariff 
rates for dairy and poultry products.
<P>
	I suspect the true test of these high tariffs may come from our 
own Canadian consumers. Why should they stand for 
excessively high prices? Furthermore, high tariffs seem to be a 
contradiction to the spirit of the North American free trade 
agreement whose benefits Canadian consumers are eagerly 
awaiting.
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit about the grain industry which I 
believe will see slow but steady improvement. Here we must 
push for a faster action to reduce overproduction, subsidies and 
import quotas worldwide. As an example, western durum wheat 
farmers are now facing restrictive import quotas from the 
Americans who accuse us of subsidizing our wheat exports.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The truth is that on four separate occasions a binational panel 
has dismissed these allegations by the United States. It is the 
American's own export enhancement program which 
encourages exports of Canadian wheat to other countries which 
is at fault. This program has left the Americans with shortages 
which Canadian wheat fills. Now American farmers are crying 
that Canadian grain has filled their terminals.
<P>
	This is the exact type of program that has so devastated the 
agriculture industries in countries like Australia, Argentina and 
Canada that had the small treasuries and cannot back their 
farmers up to the degree that they do in Europe and the United 
States.
<P>
	I believe governments must move quickly to free trade. 
Otherwise the initial optimism of the GATT signing will be lost. 
The big challenge for the new World Trade Organization which 
replaces the GATT in January will be to define what happens at 
the end of the first six years. I say that our goals should be to 
strive for a no subsidies, no trade barrier situation in a total time 
frame of 10 years.
<P>
	Unfortunately there is no time to address other important 
issues in detail. I know that my colleagues here are going to be 
speaking about some of those issues, although I do want to touch 
on them briefly.
<P>
	However, we have to have a responsive, deregulated 
transportation system in Canada. I also believe the Canadian 
Wheat Board should have a democratically elected board of 
governors and a system that is market driven.
<P>
	Canadian farmers are hard working, proud people who would 
rather receive their income from the marketplace than from 
government subsidies. Our farmers offer the Canadian public a 
quality product and the security of a reasonably priced food. 
Canadian farmers have a worldwide reputation for supplying 
quality products.
<P>
	What do farmers want from our government? They expect 
protection from unfair trade practices of our competitors. They 
want the protection of fair trade rules throughout the world. 
They want our government to push to reduce subsidies 
worldwide so that they can benefit from free trade. They want 
governments to live within their means which will lead to lower 
taxes and lower input costs. Finally, they want governments to 
reduce regulations and unnecessary programs.
<P>
	I believe Canadian farmers can compete anywhere in the 
world, given a fair opportunity. I believe our Canadian farmers 
will adapt and prosper under the new trade environment. I 
believe they do not need more than 10 years to make these 
necessary adjustments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the 
hon. member's remarks but I have questions on two issues that 
he raised.
<P>
	One is the deregulation of transportation which he has been 
advocating. I wonder what the arguments are in favour of doing 
that given our experience this past crop year in shipping into a 
deregulated market, namely the United States which is 
relatively deregulated in transport. Our hopper cars hauling 
wheat and durum into the United States have a turnaround time 
of something in the order of 40 days or more before they are 
dumped and returned in a deregulated system. In Canada under 
regulation the turnaround time is 13 to 15 days.
<P>
	I wonder if he would comment on the advantages of 
deregulation given that experience. Would he also explain a 
little further why he was so critical of the proposed high tariffs 
on butter and dairy products between ourselves and the United 
States and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3660"> 3660 </A></B>
<P>
other countries. In reality most of the likely trade in dairy 
products will be between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	Given the fact that it is impossible for us to export anything 
into the United States by way of dairy products, the reality is 
that its tariffs will be as high or higher than ours given that it has 
had a GATT waiver all these years on dairy products.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	This is one of the reasons that Canada was very loathe to 
implement the GATT ruling that the U.S. got prior to these last 
negotiations forcing us to open our markets to its yogurt and ice 
cream. The facts of the situation are that if we had opened the 
border we could have bought ice cream and yogurt, put it in the 
freezer or fridge of our motorhome in order to go down to 
Arizona and hit the border only to find that we could not take 
those American products into the United States because it was 
absolutely illegal to take dairy products the other way.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would tell us about deregulation and if 
he does not recognize that there may be some fairness to the high 
tariffs on dairy products.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for 
Mackenzie has put his 14 years of experience to good use today 
and I would ask the member for Peace River to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
for Mackenzie for those questions.
<P>
	First of all I believe that deregulation in the transportation 
industry is necessary. We have to have a very practical solution 
to movement of products. They should move by whatever 
method is the cheapest form and they should move in whatever 
route is the most direct and cheapest.
<P>
	I think when he talked about the hopper cars going into the 
United States and the turnaround time, part of the reason for that 
is the very regulated system we have with the crow rate where 
we have seen grain going as far out as Thunder Bay and then 
back into Saskatchewan and crossing the border. That does not 
make any sense at all.
<P>
	I believe we have to look at practical solutions to problems so 
that Canadians can face the reality of the nineties and adapt to 
the new trade environment.
<P>
	In terms of high tariffs and why I am critical of the high 
tariffs, I believe these tariffs are put in place as an adjustment 
process to let our industries adapt over a reasonable period of 
time from a system of supply management with a lot of 
regulation to free trade. I think that can be done fairly quickly. 
These tariffs are set probably high on both sides of the border, 
but that does not excuse either side.
<P>
	It is in our interests when we have just signed a trade deal with 
the United States and Mexico that says we want to move to free 
trade among all three countries in a short period of time to phase 
these out very quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege and a very great interest of mine to be 
involved in a discussion in this House on agricultural issues.
<P>
	Coming from the riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster where 
most of us make our livelihood either directly or indirectly from 
agriculture, myself included, I feel it is a very important issue 
and I appreciate the chance to speak to it. I have chosen to 
address the problems that many farmers face in the marketing of 
their produce and the federal agency responsible for prairie 
grain marketing, the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board should more appropriately be 
called the prairie wheat board, as its mandate limits the board's 
activity to the three prairie provinces and a small part of British 
Columbia in the Peace River area. There is a similar 
organization in Ontario called the Ontario Wheat Board. I find it 
is one of the best kept secrets across the prairies that in fact the 
Canadian Wheat Board is not a national board but a regional 
board. Many producers I am finding in my part of the world did 
not even realize there was an Ontario Wheat Board.
<P>
	This Ontario Wheat Board is rather interesting. It was 
established in 1958 by a vote of Ontario wheat producers. It 
operates under the authority of the Ontario Farm Products 
Marketing Act. There are 18,000 wheat producers in Ontario and 
the Ontario board is run by 10 directors who are elected by the 
producers. The board operates on a one producer, one vote 
system. Each of the 10 directors represents a geographic district 
within the province. Each district elects one delegate to the 
annual meeting for each 250 producers within that district. The 
directors are then elected from among those delegates.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board on the other hand has 137,000 
producers or permit book holders, compared with the 18,000 
farmers who control the Ontario board. Many opponents of a 
producer control system claim that the government will not 
guarantee initial prices for a depoliticized organization like the 
Ontario Wheat Board.
<P>
	However, the realities are that the initial payments are 
guaranteed for both the Canadian Wheat Board and the Ontario 
Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The wheat board act limits the Canadian Wheat Board's 
activities to wheat and barley grown for human consumption. 
The Ontario Wheat Board is mandated by statute to limit its 
activities to wheat production and marketing within the 
province of Ontario. This demonstrates that there are some 
differences and some similarities in the scope and the influence 
of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3661"> 3661 </A></B>
<P>
producer directed organization compared with one which is 
government run.
<P>
	The single biggest difference between the two is that the 
Ontario Wheat Board is democratic and the Canadian Wheat 
Board is run by a panel of three to five commissioners who are 
appointed by the governor in council. This means that the 
minister is usually the one who recommends the names.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a crown corporation and its 
commissioners are political appointees. Nevertheless, 
producers pay for all of the operations of the board through the 
amount subtracted from the final payments for the producer's 
grain. In fact, most agriculture marketing agencies, including 
those in the supply managed sector, include producers in the 
decision making and managerial process. The Canadian Wheat 
Board is the odd man out, being a top down, government run 
corporation.
<P>
	Many farmers in western Canada are not happy with the 
actions of the Canadian Wheat Board and the way it is run. Far 
too much time and energy is spent in all places, from the courts 
to the coffee shops, trying to determine what the powers of the 
board should be, what commodities should be added or left out 
of the wheat board's mandate, should farmers be selling their 
grain on a contract basis or under the quota system or both, and 
in that case what proportion for each.
<P>
	There is much discussion about the board's monopoly power 
versus the principle of marketing options. Perhaps one of the 
biggest irritants today is the wheat board's involvement in grain 
car allocation. My hon. colleague from Lisgar-Marquette 
discussed that situation from the aspect of the western grain 
transportation authority as well. There are many fingers in the 
pot here. It seems like the end result is that the service is not very 
good.
<P>
	What sticks in the craw of so many producers is that these 
complex issues to which there are no easy solutions require 
solutions, but the producers have no substantial say as to how 
these problems are to be solved.
<P>
	Another great disadvantage to the Canadian Wheat Board 
being an arm of the government is the way that new wheat prices 
or final payments or price changes are announced. It was 
common in years past for ministers of agriculture to play 
politics with the announcement of either price increases or 
decreases. Farmers were used as pawns, waiting for the right 
kind of announcement so that the minister could get as much 
political mileage or minimize the political fallout from grain 
price announcements.
<P>
	We as Reformers have been quite clear on the direction of 
marketing reforms. It is paramount that the Canadian Wheat 
Board be democratised. It must be accountable to the producers 
it serves and producers must have the ability to change or update 
the mandate of the board when they feel their interests could be 
better served.
<P>
	Producers must have control over how their grain is marketed. 
We must remember that it is after all their grain. If producers 
decide through a democratic process that the mandate of the 
board should be expanded to cover other grains and oilseeds 
then the act should be changed to respect the wishes of 
producers. If this is done they may choose to provide opting out 
provisions for niche markets. The purchase of grains on a cash 
or pool basis might be considered to improve current marketing 
arrangements. We would like to see the expansion of producer 
contracts if farmers so desire.
<P>
	Once the board is democratised the decision will be up to 
producers to make, but we feel that the Canadian Wheat Board 
should maintain its responsibility for initial payment shortfalls. 
Government loan guarantees for export sales should also be 
continued for as long as other nations do the same.
<P>
	We have a responsibility to recognize that change is required 
because present realities in the agriculture industry are different 
from when the Canadian Wheat Board was brought into 
existence.
<P>
	My father was a pioneer. When he first delivered his wheat he 
had to hitch up a wagon and a team of horses and haul that wheat 
26 miles to a small community called Waldeck, Saskatchewan. 
When he got there he did not know what the price was going to 
be. He did not know what the grade of that grain was going to be. 
There was a requirement for change in the way our products 
were marketed and we saw improvements to the system which 
enabled him to have some protection in the marketing of his 
product.
<P>
	Today's situation is different with modern transportation and 
modern communications. In fact, we cannot maintain a system 
that was intended for 30, 40, 50 years ago. We must be prepared 
to look to new and innovative means of marketing our products.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	We know from the Ontario example that a producer controlled 
system is possible. That particular organizational model may or 
may not fit on the prairies, but I feel that the principle of a 
producer directed process does. If we give farmers the chance to 
design, control and continually update their marketing system a 
much more effective, fair and cost efficient Canadian Wheat 
Board would result. As legislators we would give it the freedom 
to act.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for this 
time being allotted for a discussion of agriculture. The 
government seems to have put a very low priority on agricultural 
issues. On behalf of all the farmers of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster and all of Saskatchewan, I am 
grateful for the opportunity to try and solve some of the very 
important issues facing rural Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am having 
difficulty sorting out where the hon. member is coming from 
relative to the Canadian Wheat Board. There is no question that 
this government showed leadership during the campaign and 
since the campaign.
<P>
	I would quote out of the red book what we said on the 
Canadian Wheat Board and that is what we were elected on: 
``Canada's agri-food industry needs policies and programs such 
as supply management, the Canadian Wheat Board and 
stabilization programs to minimize the impact of market price 
fluctuations''.
<P>
	We ran on a campaign of strong support for the wheat board 
and we are continuing to show that. I recognize there is a debate 
taking place in the west. I have been inundated lately with 
petitions asking to strengthen the Canadian Wheat Board and 
expand its powers.
<P>
	The member wants some components of the wheat board it 
seems, but not its all. I am wondering if he has anything to 
comment on in terms of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory 
committee. The Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee is 
the legitimate, elected producers who act in an advisory 
capacity to the wheat board. Clearly, during the last election 
eight of the eleven were very strong, orderly marketers.
<P>
	I am wondering what the member's thoughts are relative to 
the Canadian Wheat Board advisory which is calling for us to 
maintain the powers of the wheat board, that it is the sole seller 
of export wheat and barley.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to the 
hon. member for Malpeque. I feel some affinity knowing that he 
also has provided for his livelihood. He also chews gum like I do 
and he forgets to do up his jacket like I do. I do feel some affinity 
for the hon. member.
<P>
	I am also very happy to respond to his question because I think 
living in western Canada I am closer to some of the issues that he 
is talking about. I would like to just remind the hon. member that 
you cannot have it both ways. I know that his government was 
committed to a referendum or a producer vote of whether there 
should be a continental barley market. I favoured that when he 
favoured it. That was before the decision was made that there 
not be a continental barley market.
<P>
	The hon. member and his government have changed their 
minds since the court ruling has been reversed. In fact, the 
continental barley market was ruled illegal. I have not changed 
my mind. Neither has my party. We still believe that producers 
should be in the driver's seat and make these decisions.
<P>
	The hon. member on the other side is saying that as long as 
things are going the way my personal philosophy dictates, I am 
happy to put producers in the driver's seat. But as soon as my 
own views and the views of producers begin to differ, then I want 
to have control. I want to politicize this thing. I do not want to let 
go of the administrative control of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I am saying to the hon. member that he cannot have it both 
ways. You are either going to trust producers or you are not 
going to trust them.
<P>
	I would also tell the hon. member that I spoke recently to an 
organization with which I know he is quite well acquainted, the 
local chapter of the National Farmers Union. We discussed the 
advisory council and it was of the same opinion as I am. In fact, 
this advisory board is a rather useless organization because it 
has no impact whatsoever as long as the wheat board is 
controlled by the Government of Canada and the political 
process rather than the producer, grassroots, bottom up process.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his questions. I hope I have shed a 
little light on where we are coming from on this side of the 
House in trying to solve the problems of producers by trusting 
them rather than taking over the decision making process from 
them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate 
in this debate. I want to draw the attention of this House to the 
policy and initiatives of the government regarding an important 
sector of the Canadian economy. I am referring to the 
agricultural and agri-food industry. More specifically, I want to 
talk about the dairy, poultry and pork industries, for which 
quotas are in place.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as the member representing the riding next to 
mine, I am sure you will agree on the importance of quotas in the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	The main objective of the Liberal government's agricultural 
policy is food security for Canadians and decent revenues for all 
our farmers. Supply management, which is a system put in place 
by a Liberal government almost a quarter of a century ago, 
confirms the merits and the success of this policy.
<P>
	You all remember former Liberal minister Eugene Whelan. I 
know that the hon. member for Québec-Est knew him well, 
because I think that at one time he worked in his office. Mr. 
Whelan's daughter is now a member of this House and she also 
does a very good job of representing the interests of farmers, as 
do the hon. members for Haldimand-Norfolk and Prince 
Edward-Hastings, and also the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	As I said, in the early seventies, the Liberal government of the 
time put in place regulated marketing programs for the dairy, 
poultry and pork industries. This system is based on two basic 
principles: domestic production quotas and, of course, efficient 
control over imports to protect the quotas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3663"> 3663 </A></B>
<P>
	Supply management stabilized farmers' revenues, and 
ensured the supply of top quality and healthy food products to 
Canadians, while also providing an important regional 
economic development tool.
<P>
	For the benefit of opposition members I would like to mention 
again the considerable accomplishments of this government 
regarding supply management. Less than six weeks after being 
elected, the government had already negotiated an agreement 
under GATT which is acceptable to the agricultural sector, and 
which ensures that supply management will enable us to meet 
the challenges ahead and take advantage of the opportunities 
provided by GATT. This is what we call effective and concerted 
action.
<P>
	I would like to quote from an article written by Mr. Pierre 
Glaude and published in the December 20, 1993 issue of 
Agricom, a newspaper in my riding: ``The goal is the same'', 
said the new chairman of the Union des producteurs agricoles du 
Québec, Mr. Laurent Pellerin, ``only the means to reach it have 
changed. The organization is trying to reassure its members. 
Under the new GATT agreement, supply management programs 
will be maintained through tariffs''.
<P>
	In other words, contrary to what some members opposite have 
said, the spokespersons for the Quebec agricultural community 
consider that the measures taken by our government were 
successful in protecting our quotas.
<P>
	Not only in Quebec do farmers and their representatives make 
such statements. In my riding, people agree. Representatives of 
the farm industry maintain that the new tariffs will protect our 
quota systems.
<P>
	This may be the best argument I could use to show how much 
Canadian farmers still have confidence in our quota system and 
why members opposite should not try to undermine that. The 
confidence of our farmers is what enables us to maintain the 
value of our quotas. Quotas have increased in value since the 
GATT accord was signed. What does this tell us? It tells us that 
the agricultural community is confident and takes position that 
supply management will be around for a long time. After all, 
people do not buy quotas, and certainly not on credit, when they 
expect these quotas be phased out very shortly. The agricultural 
community believes, as we do, that quotas will be around for a 
long time and will be protected by the new tariffs negotiated 
with other countries.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Speaking of tariffs, I have here, as I mentioned it this 
morning, a list of the tariffs tabled by our government at GATT, 
and I want to point out that the United States raised no 
objections to these tariffs. We must have tabled hundreds of 
pages of agricultural tariffs in Marrakesh, but no objections 
were raised by the United States. In the dairy sector, tariffs of 
around 300 per cent were mentioned, and I disagree with the way 
the Reform Party  Member calculated the price of those tariffs. 
In any case, these tariffs will be reduced by 15 per cent over a 
period of six years, not 15 per cent annually but 15 per cent over 
six years.
<P>
	In the Liberal red book, and especially in the policy paper on 
agriculture, the government was committed to staunchly 
defending our supply management programs at the GATT 
negotiations. That is what the Liberal government did, and it 
succeeded. It managed to obtain a tariff system under which we 
will be able to maintain our marketing boards and supply 
management and everything that entails. As a result, the impact 
of fluctuating prices will be kept to a minimum and farmers as 
well as food processors will be guaranteed a decent income.
<P>
	During the Uruguay round, the Liberal government did 
everything it could to defend Canada's supply management 
system. We should remember that the position of the Canadian 
government during the weeks leading up to the GATT agreement 
was established in consultation with the agricultural sector. 
Furthermore, the minister of agriculture worked very hard with 
colleagues and senior officials to ensure that all sectors in 
Canada's agriculture industry would not only survive GATT but 
also be able to take advantage of the opportunities provided in 
the GATT agreement.
<P>
	Earlier, the Official Opposition's finance critic said that 
everyone in the agriculture industry had lost at GATT, but 
nothing could be further from the truth. The agricultural 
industry made major gains at GATT, and all members opposite 
know that perfectly well. They know about the US farm bill 
which dates back to 1985 and which the United States used to 
subsidize its agricultural industry and thus harm our exports.
<P>
	Some US $70 billion were paid out during the first five years 
of this American farm program, and we know that the purpose of 
this program was to take away part of the market share held by 
other countries, especially countries in the southern 
hemisphere, but of course Canada was also affected by the U.S. 
Farm Bill, though it was not the main target. The United States 
wanted to react against overproduction and the fact that other 
countries, after the crisis in Afghanistan, had tried to sell wheat 
and other products to the Soviet Union and thus take over part of 
the so-called traditional market share of the Americans.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The members opposite know this, just as they know that our 
farmers could no longer continue receiving large farm subsidies, 
given the major losses experienced in the sector. Some members 
opposite even admitted as much a while ago. That is why the 
government had to work with other countries for the good of the 
entire agricultural community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3664"> 3664 </A></B>
<P>
	First, it had to work to strengthen the laws governing supply 
management. As we know, there were problems with some of 
these laws. You may recall the incident with ice cream and 
yogurt, following the adoption in 1988 of the free trade 
agreement, which moreover was endorsed by the current Leader 
of the Opposition. Hon. members will also recall that the FTA 
led us to lose our case with respect to quotas on ice cream and 
yogurt. These were restored with the GATT agreement.
<P>
	With respect to the grains sector, some of the subsidies from 
other countries have been reduced, thereby allowing us to 
market our products. New markets have been found for 
Canadian products. Our ministers have worked hard and so has 
the parliamentary secretary. The agricultural sector has been 
well treated by our government and we have just begun our 
work. We have only been in office for six months and we have 
already accomplished a great deal. And we will accomplish even 
more in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
sometimes wonder if the hon. member who just spoke is really 
from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and not an extra-terrestrial 
being from the moon, because it is abundantly clear from his 
remarks that he does not understand what effect the GATT 
Agreement had. And he does not seem to believe the farmers, as 
if they had not figured out what happened with GATT.
<P>
	For example, to say that quota values had increased following 
the signing of the agreement, or that the quota system will be in 
place for a very long time, that is ridiculous. Especially since 
farmers are aware that the quota system is under attack due to 
tariffs and they may not be confident in what has happened, as 
witnessed by the Ontario chicken producers. Why did they 
increase their production by 30 per cent if not as a clear 
indication of their lack of confidence in the system? They know 
how the market works.
<P>
	You have to do more than tell farmers that all is well, that 
everything is perfect in Canada, to make things work. Farmers 
understand very well what is going on. It is the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who, sadly, does not understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite tells us 
that quotas will not survive. For 1995, the tariff for fluid milk is 
283.8 per cent minimum and, by the year 2000, it will be 241 per 
cent minimum. Does the hon. member mean to say that these 
tariffs are too low? If so, how can he be so out of touch with the 
agricultural community?
<P>
	Let me tell you what André Chabot, the president of the 
Franco-Ontarian Farmers' Union, had to say. I referred earlier 
to what the leaders of the Quebec agricultural community had 
said. I will now address the situation in Ontario. The hon. 
member for Québec-Est is a Franco-Ontario, just like me. Mr. 
Chabot's letter reads: ``Canadian farmers agree that Canadian 
supply management systems are in no way threatened by the  
new GATT rules. Some even see this as an improvement over the 
situation under article XI''. Certainly a Franco-Ontarian like 
my chum across the way can understand that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, politics is a funny business. If the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell were sitting in the opposition, I 
am sure his comments would be very similar to those of the hon. 
member from the Bloc who has been speaking on agricultural 
issues. It seems like the government has quite a different view 
now of what has happened with regard to the GATT negotiations 
it was involved in.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I tell the hon. member and the House that Reform reviewed 
the GATT situation two years ago. The same sources should 
have been available to the hon. member. It became very clear 
that article XI would become indefensible. We were quite frank 
and honest in admitting that.
<P>
	At the same time hon. members on the other side had not done 
a reality check. They were trying to tell supply managed 
industries that article XI was safe and could be preserved, and 
that they would be the agent that would preserve article XI. 
Reform on the other hand said it was obvious that article XI 
would be gone and that tariffs would have to be put in its place.
<P>
	Because of that attitude supply managed industries undertook 
a very expensive advertising campaign involving millions of 
dollars to try to speak to political parties and politicians and to 
encourage them to take a strong position in defence of article XI 
which was a hopeless cause. I would hope some members on the 
other side would apologize for that action because these dollars 
were hard earned and should not have been spent on useless 
advertising campaigns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not apologize for standing 
up for dairy farmers in my riding. It is not that article XI was 
indefensible. The member has it wrong. That is not what 
happened. If he thinks that is what happened he is mistaken.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member and all hon. members that article XI 
was clearly defensible. It was a very good system. We gradually 
lost the supporters we had among other nations. That does not 
mean the system was bad, but we ended up on the very last day 
with 115 to 1. We were the only country that still wanted it. That 
does not mean it was bad. It was still good. We were trading with 
other nations and 115 of them were saying that it was no longer 
there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3665"> 3665 </A></B>
<P>
	It is like the National Hockey League deciding that every 
team except one is to disband. We could wish the league to exist 
but if it only had one team it would no longer be there. That is 
easy for anyone in the House to understand, particularly after 
last night's debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say 
to the hon. member that I too will not apologize for standing up 
for supply managed commodities and for standing up for 
farmers in my constituency. I do not need to apologize.
<P>
	I was one who stood more than any member in the House and 
fought for supply management. I know what I told my 
constituents during election time. I made no promises that I 
could save supply management. I told them, though, that I would 
fight damned hard for it. That is what we did in this party.
<P>
	I am proud of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. The 
Minister for International Trade with whom I have had 
differences on this matter in the past stood up in Geneva and told 
the world. Unfortunately, as my colleague from 
Glengarry-Prescott- Russell said, in the end we could not do 
it.
<P>
	It is easy for the Reformers. They spend half their time in the 
agriculture committee-and Mr. Hoeppner over there will know 
he is not one of them-crapping on supply management.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know members 
on both sides of the House feel very strongly, but I think a 
moment ago the member was probably wanting to identify the 
member for Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was looking for his name. He is 
the same guy within that party who has been unfortunately 
knocking supply management. It is easy to say now, after the 
fact: ``We knew, we knew'', but it would have been better to 
have that party support us on this when the Americans were 
fighting us. They were saying: ``Your party over there doesn't 
want the wheat board, doesn't want any of these subsidies. 
Members from Alberta don't want subsidies''. We kept arguing 
that supply management was not a subsidy.
<P>
	On the issue of subsidies I want to look at what Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada spends province by province. These 
members from Alberta keep saying: ``We can do it ourselves''. It 
is funny how much agricultural spending actually goes into the 
province of Alberta. In 1993 figures the amount was 
$536,315,000. That was well over the percentage of farmers that 
they have. If I were as provincial as some members in the House 
pretend to be and if I were just fighting for the province of 
Ontario instead of for the country, I would argue that Ontario 
with about 25 per cent of the farmers in the country is not getting 
its fair share. However I understand some of the problems we 
have in western Canada so I will not do that.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In my speech today I want to talk about a few issues, one of 
which is trade. Many of the problems we are having in 
agriculture today and many of the problems the Reform Party 
has in its own ridings are because of actions brought by other 
countries. In a lot of cases it is the United States against Canada. 
I feel they are very unfair actions.
<P>
	If we are talking about the wheat issue, Mickey Kantor, the 
international trade person in the United States, said before the 
Senate committee last week that Canada was taking advantage 
of a window of opportunity that had been created. The reason the 
window of opportunity was created was frankly because of 
something called export enhancement that the United States 
uses. It is a two-price system which, by the way, we would like 
to have in this country. However the Reformers fought us 
against it and we do not have it now. It is a two-price system that 
has been responsible for wheat going out of the country.
<P>
	As a result Canadian producers have been shipping wheat and 
have shown U.S. millers that we have high quality wheat that is 
graded and will do exactly what it says it will do. As a result U.S. 
millers have said: ``I like that better. I know and I am 
guaranteed, because of the Canadian system of distributing 
wheat, that I will get that wheat and it will do what it says it will 
do''.
<P>
	The U.S. has been complaining that some actions we take with 
regard to wheat in western Canada and its shipment were unfair 
subsidies. That is not the case. The U.S. International Trade 
Commission found in 1990 that transportation subsidies were 
not a factor in the competitiveness of Canadian wheat. The U.S. 
General Accounting Office found in 1992 that there was no 
evidence of unfair wheat board practices. Again in 1992 in a 
unanimous decision of a binational panel, including a former 
U.S. Attorney General and former Chief Justice Dickson, found 
fault with the U.S. contentions.
<P>
	However the panel recommended that an audit be done, which 
results were released last month some time. That report found 
that 102 of the 105 durum wheat contracts between 1989 and 
1992 were fully in compliance with the provisions of the free 
trade agreement. Clearly the U.S. has no strong position on this 
matter.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for 
the tough stands he has taken. Over the years I stood in the 
House and watched the previous government negotiate with the 
Americans. I always felt that somehow we were doing 
something wrong in this country. I always felt as a farmer that 
somehow Canadian farmers were not being fairly represented by 
their government. I was very pleased at the GATT, with the stand 
the minister took in Geneva, and with some of the tough stands 
he has taken in terms of putting Canada's agriculture position 
forward very strongly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3666"> 3666 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to go back to the Bloc Quebecois now and the member 
for Québec-Est, a very good member of the standing committee 
who represents the views of his party well on the issue. I take 
exception to the fact that he is denouncing the government for 
lack of action in the agriculture sector. He sat around that table 
with us in the agriculture committee, as well as Bloc members, I 
might add, who add to the sense of the committee; it worked 
very well. In recent weeks we have looked at some of the stuff 
Agriculture Canada is doing. As one on the other side of the 
House who criticized some of the actions of Agriculture Canada, 
I recognized over the past little while that in fact a lot of those 
actions have changed substantially. They have changed 
substantially because the government has changed. We have 
given a new direction to Agriculture Canada. That direction can 
be found in the red book. It outlines clearly the direction we 
want to take agriculture into the next century.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Looking at the money Agriculture Canada is spending in 
Quebec-and the hon. member asked for this 
information-$371,723,000 have gone into the province of 
Quebec. According to the chart, Quebec ranks behind only 
Saskatchewan, Alberta, and a bit behind Ontario in this regard. 
Obviously with the problems they are having in western Canada 
with respect to wheat prices we can understand why a lot of this 
money has gone there.
<P>
	I really do take exception to the hon. member's contention 
that we have not done anything. Frankly it has been six months. I 
do not want to use that as an excuse, but we have made some 
significant changes in those areas that particularly affect 
agriculture. I have mentioned some of those in trade and the 
good work the minister of agriculture is doing in standing up for 
trade. I also want to talk about some of the stuff we have been 
doing in rural development.
<P>
	I come from small town Ontario, as you do, Mr. Speaker. 
What we have found to be happening over the past few years, 
especially in an area like mine that has been hit hard because of 
certain commodities grown there, namely tobacco. In small 
town Ontario unemployment rates have been rising. There has 
been a loss of business in stores and other areas that help 
farming communities. We are finding a bit of a drifting because 
there are no jobs, with a lot of small town people moving to the 
cities.
<P>
	I was very pleased when the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food came forward with a plan to deal with rural 
development. He indicated very clearly that rural development 
was a top priority. This means rural development not only in 
Ontario and Quebec but in the west also where small towns are 
literally closing up in some places.
<P>
	There is no huge pot of dollars; there is not a lot of money in 
this promise. Frankly there is not the money there. Instead of 
money the minister plans-and we had the department before 
the committee today-to organize  those parts of government 
that are specifically directing their efforts toward helping small 
towns and infrastructures. We are co-ordinating the machinery 
of government.
<P>
	It really is a grassroots participation. That is the final point I 
want to make. The government and the minister have taken a lot 
of time talking to ordinary Canadians, talking to ordinary 
farmers. The development of the small town initiative, the rural 
initiative, will be through the communities themselves.
<P>
	That is one of the things I am proud of. We have done very 
well to make sure that before we make any decisions Canadians 
are consulted and that the views of farmers are heard. We will 
continue to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Haldimand-Norfolk is an excellent chairman of 
the agriculture committee. He does an excellent job.
<P>
	However today there are three points I would like briefly to 
correct or bring to his attention. Basically the discussion today 
is about the lack of leadership in government regarding 
agriculture. What he said would indicate even more the lack of 
leadership with respect to agriculture in government. For 
example, he mentioned rural development, which is of course 
extremely important, saying how the government minister 
indicated that it was his top priority but he did not put any money 
in it. What sort of top priority is that when you say it is really 
very important and you do not put any money in it?
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Another example is trade. He mentioned that there are many 
initiatives with regard to trade. Of course, the minister has gone 
to China to sell wheat. However, in the negotiations that are 
going on with the United States right now there is a problem that 
was created by the Americans by their export enhancement 
program and other issues. Of course Canada profited from this 
situation. Of course Canada profited from free trade with the 
United States, but why suddenly is Canada giving in to 
American pressure and putting a cap on durum wheat to the 
United States? It is lack of leadership.
<P>
	Another example, again in dealing with trade with the United 
States, which really is a big item, is instead of dealing sector by 
sector so that we get the maximum for our bucks for Canada we 
put it all in one lump package. This is what the minister of 
agriculture is trying to deal with the United States, instead of 
dealing sector by sector so that he would get the maximum for 
his bucks. Lack of leadership. The examples were given by the 
MP for Haldimand-Norfolk who is a very good president of the 
agriculture committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe that is one of the differences 
between this party and the party of the hon. member for 
Québec-Est. We feel that within government if we are going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3667"> 3667 </A></B>
<P>
make changes that really directly affect Canadians, in this case 
farmers, changes that will  work in their best interest, that 
throwing a pot of money at them is not going to solve the 
problem.
<P>
	We think that by taking the money we have there and spending 
it more wisely and making sure that money is not directed for 
overhead or administration but is directed into the hands of 
Canadians is probably the better approach.
<P>
	In terms of his question on the cap on wheat, I am sorry I 
missed the announcement. I have not heard that there was an 
announcement on a cap on wheat. In fact if the hon. member 
might be more honest with it he will know that in fact there is not 
a cap on wheat yet. However, there is a question of whether or 
not we should negotiate a settlement.
<P>
	If anyone in this House thinks that world trade is fair they do 
not have a clue on how the world trade system works. In fact it is 
not a fair system. Canada represents a very small percentage of 
trade done in the world. In relative terms it is important to us in 
terms of our gross domestic product and its importance to 
Canada but we are a small country. To suggest that we could 
stand at a table one on one with the Americans, they do not have 
to play fair, frankly.
<P>
	The former Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Whelan, who used to 
sit in this House used to constantly say: ``The Americans never 
agreed to a GATT decision because they didn't have to''. It is not 
a fair decision. One of the points that the minister was making to 
them was this. He said very clearly and he said it in this House a 
number times that we are not prepared to trade one part of the 
country off against another part of the country. We are not 
prepared to trade one sector of this country off against another 
sector of the country.
<P>
	In fact, if you remember both the comments by the Prime 
Minister and the Minister for International Trade, they were not 
prepared to deal with this in one lump sum. They were going to 
go sector by sector by sector. We feel we have a strong position. 
We feel that the Americans will in the end give in on this because 
they have to and because they are wrong. We are prepared to 
stand forth and fight on behalf of Canadian farmers to make sure 
that point of view is put forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bloc 
members are very concerned with rural issues, especially 
agriculture. I could not say the same about the members 
opposite. My Bloc colleagues have succeeded in demonstrating 
the inequality among the provinces and the federal 
government's lack of action on Quebec's behalf.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In particular, I will try to describe the situation that exists in 
some rural ridings of the Gaspé Peninsula, where I am from, and 
the lower St. Lawrence region. In the lower St. Lawrence region, 
as in most rural areas of the country, agriculture should play a 
very important role in regional development. There are 400,000 
hectares under cultivation, over 260 agricultural enterprises, 
and sales in the order of $190 million a year.
<P>
	Our dairy products alone bring in 75 per cent of farm income 
and account for more than 50 per cent of agricultural 
enterprises. We also have 16,000 head of meat cattle, 20,000 
sheep, and 30,000 pigs.
<P>
	This translates into more than 7,500 permanent jobs and 
thousands of seasonal jobs. Forty-eight per cent of the 
workforce are under 40 years old.
<P>
	Despite this profile, figures available for the Matépédia 
Valley alone show that between 1981 and 1991, farmlands 
declined by 22 per cent. In the same period, the number of farms 
fell from 420 to 285, a decrease of 32 per cent. The main cause of 
this reduction is the same as in other sectors.
<P>
	Our regions produce raw materials for major centres, which 
process them before selling them back to us. When are we going 
to understand that, in order to grow, resource rich regions must 
equip themselves with the infrastructure they need to process 
and market their raw materials? It is much more important to us 
than a few sidewalks and a little road paving.
<P>
	Processing and marketing also mean jobs, which we do not 
have unfortunately. Processing creates economic activities that 
give confidence to people and encourage them to start their own 
businesses.
<P>
	We, for example, have the potential to develop beef 
production. But Quebec, unfortunately, is still behind in this 
area. Our cattle farmers must export their production outside the 
region without processing it. They even export calves at lesser 
cost without being able to finish them on site.
<P>
	Over 100 valley producers have decided to spend more than 
$160,000 of their own money to build a slaughterhouse so they 
can process in their own region the animals they breed. Can you 
believe it, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	That is a laudable initiative from the farmers themselves. 
Such an enterprising attitude must be encouraged.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	In my region people got together and are now ready to act.
<P>
	After a wide ranging consultation with those concerned, the 
regional co-operation and development council targeted five 
bio-food development priorities: processing and upgrading 
bio-food products; diversifying crops; consolidating produc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3668"> 3668 </A></B>
<P>
tion; developing human resources; developing and marketing 
regional products.
<P>
	The people of Matane, Mont-Joli, the Matapedia Valley and 
our regions know what they need to develop and know how to 
succeed.
<P>
	Centralized decisions and programs that apply unchanged 
throughout the country are surely not the way for the 
government to boost agriculture in our region. On the contrary, 
decisions must be decentralized. Programs must be 
decentralized and adapted to regional realities. Trust the men 
and women who actually produce what people in the cities need 
to live. Economic development takes place in the field, not in 
the offices of senior bureaucrats.
<P>
	I will give you a demonstration of this unhealthy incoherence, 
which is demoralizing for the farmers in my region. In March 
1995, the federal-provincial agreement which included a testing 
and experimentation component will end. This program is the 
most visible of those from the federal government. With the 
funds it provided, this program helped farmers launch 
productive activities with significant benefits for our region. 
Ending this program will really hurt us and I say to the Minister 
of Regional Development that he must take a stand as soon as 
possible on extending it.
<P>
	The regions must be given the wherewithal to do what they 
decided to do to deal with technological change and changing 
markets. To overlook the resource regions is to overlook what 
we are: human beings who need to feed ourselves and live in a 
healthy environment so that we can develop properly.
<P>
	Another point that I want to raise immediately is 
transportation subsidies. Most of them cause unhealthy 
competition between the regions. They pay transportation 
companies to send unfinished products to urban centres, instead 
of encouraging local processing and helping people develop.
<P>
	This shows the government's neglect. By wanting to 
centralize everything, it hinders development. By wanting to 
centralize everything, it makes people dependent. By wanting to 
centralize everything, it kills any initiative from local people.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	When you know that, for almost a decade now, Western 
Canada has been receiving ten times more than Quebec from the 
federal government, you can ask yourself some questions. I 
want agricultural producers from my region and all of Quebec to 
get what they are entitled to, nothing more but nothing less.
<P>
	Quebec farmers are striving to reach food self-sufficiency. To 
that end, they have decided to: first, consolidate and develop 
their potential; second, make full use again of agricultural land; 
third, process their products themselves, to the extent possible.
<P>
	These people, who generate over $4 million in annual 
revenues, have the right to be considered job creators and major 
contractors, like any multinational company which finances the 
old political parties.
<P>
	It is not because we live in rural areas that we cannot benefit 
from collective prosperity or that we should be overlooked by a 
system which favours big business.
<P>
	Producers from the lower St. Lawrence are entitled to the 
same support as others. They need that help to consolidate their 
business, transform their products and make a profit with the 
added value. They have the right to hope to expand as they deem 
appropriate. They need help to be able to do so.
<P>
	I will end with this. When game became scarce, man turned to 
agriculture for survival, and nothing has since replaced the food 
obtained from that activity. This is why rural regions such as 
ours need help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate what the hon. member said, when he 
explained some of the problems of the farmers in his riding 
which is in such a beautiful part of the country.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member opposite. If we forget 
the partisan comments which are of course part of the 
parliamentary routine, and part of our job, I think he must admit 
that for the past 20 or 30 years, Canadian agriculture has enjoyed 
unprecedented growth.
<P>
	I am sure he also realizes that for instance in Quebec and 
Ontario, in my own riding, which is right on the border with 
Quebec, we see outstanding farm operations which exist thanks 
to the system introduced by Mr. Whelan, the former boss of his 
colleague from Québec-Est, other Liberal agriculture ministers 
and, of course, by ministers of other political formations as 
well.
<P>
	Does the hon. member acknowledge the tremendous progress 
which has been made in the agricultural industry, in terms of the 
use of technology on the farm, the standard of living of our 
farmers, and especially in supply managed sectors and other 
sectors? And will he at least, with his usual eloquence, 
acknowledge the excellent job done by the former boss of the 
hon. member for Québec-Est?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree that a number of 
things have been done, but it is also true that many, many farms 
have disappeared.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	To expand, some farmers bought big farms adjoining their 
own land. They modernized their operations and they used 
technology, of course, but I say this is not necessarily a good 
thing for rural communities. In a parish of 3,000 souls, if there 
are now only four farmers when they used to be 40, this is not 
necessarily a good thing. It may be the modern way of doing 
things and perhaps this is inevitable. That means rural 
communities will gradually disappear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3669"> 3669 </A></B>
<P>
	If they do, small towns will disappear as well. Anyone who is 
familiar with our part of the country will notice that, starting at 
Mont-Joli, it is very hard to keep rural communities alive, 
because most farmers have left the area, and although dairy 
production has increased or remained stable, people are not 
there any more. I think agriculture should be compatible with 
rural communities, and I have no answers right now, although 
there must be a solution and we must find it. I am sure that, when 
we become a sovereign nation, we will find it more readily.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Lévis-Manpower Training; the hon. member 
for Brome-Missisquoi-Hyundai Plant in Bromont; the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden-Trade; the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-Military Industries; the hon. 
member for Matapédia-Matane-Unemployment Insurance 
Reform.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the honourable member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today during the first day of 
debate in this House on agriculture. We will have to remember 
that the official opposition is responsible for this first day of the 
35th Parliament devoted to the subject of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We have the hon. member for Québec-Est 
to thank for this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Indeed, the originator of the motion is the member 
for Québec-Est. In the past, he worked for a former Minister of 
Agriculture, Mr. Whelan, but he came to realize during this 
time, and probably because of his experiences, that Quebec had 
no future in Canada, particularly where agriculture was 
concerned. Moreover, you will recall that this Minister of 
Agriculture had the good fortune of being sprayed with milk by 
Quebec farmers because he could not grasp what they were 
trying to tell him. The only way they could get their message 
across to him was by spraying him in the face with milk.
<P>
	On a more serious note, let them say what they will about 
sales and milk production figures of all other sectors. The fact of 
the matter is that rural communities are dying. The population of 
our villages has been declining for a number of years. When it 
has come to the point at which villages such as 
Saint-Paul-de-la-Croix in my riding have taken to advertising 
in the newspapers to attract families that may be willing to settle 
in a rural community, we know that we need to make some 
fundamental changes to the way we approach rural development 
and agriculture.
<P>
	Right now in Eastern Quebec we can see dairy trucks go by, 
heading for Montreal, and that milk comes back in the form of 
processed cheese. That is the sort of thing we would like to be 
able to change so there could be a future in primary and 
secondary processing in our region. The fact that our 
communities are small does not mean that we do not have 
expertise in the various agricultural productions.
<P>
	My riding has been the home of Canada's biggest milk 
producers for a long time.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Fresh lamb is another area. It should be noted that 
interestingly, 30 per cent of the fresh lamb consumed in Quebec 
is processed in our region.
<P>
	Also, farmers in Eastern Quebec, and my riding in particular, 
have adapted successfully to changes in the agricultural 
industry. The UPA may be confident in the future, but this does 
not mean that all government's actions automatically have its 
blessing. Their confidence comes from knowing that with their 
skills and the ideas they have come up with, they will be able to 
ride out this time of fundamental change brought about by 
GATT.
<P>
	A great deal of work was done in Quebec to prepare for the 
future and make sure agriculture had the place it deserved in 
Quebec in the 21st century. Take for example the ``États 
généraux du monde rural'' and the Trois-Rivières summit where 
a consensus was reached on the efforts required to ensure the 
prosperity of the Quebec agricultural industry for the future.
<P>
	I hope that the government will take that into account in 
planning its next move and that it will make sure the interests of 
the Quebec agricultural community do not get lost in the sea of 
Canadian and Western interests. Care should be taken not to let 
the durum exports issue adversely affect advocacy for farmers in 
Eastern Canada, and Quebec in particular.
<P>
	When the Bélanger-Campeau Commission held hearings in 
the Lower St. Lawrence region, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
who was the Liberal Party representative on the commission at 
the time, had argued that, should Quebec become a sovereign 
state, we would lose any control we may have had on our milk 
quotas. Since then, current world events have caught up with the 
hon. member-who is now Minister of Foreign Affairs-and 
quotas will be less prominent. Belonging to the Canadian 
Federation may not be that beneficial for Quebec farm 
producers after all. A more profitable approach is to make sure 
we are able to sell our products abroad, and for that, we need 
programs to promote processing.
<P>
	We must also learn from the past. In agriculture, we went from 
a period when many regions could be self-sufficient by 
processing and selling their products locally to a new era when, 
in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3670"> 3670 </A></B>
<P>
name of productivity, natural resources are sent outside the 
producing regions, creating unemployment. Something can be 
done to bring  processing back to the regions, thus enabling 
more people to live with dignity.
<P>
	I would like to point out one of the abnormalities inherent in 
the Canadian system. In lamb production, Canada, under 
pressure from the United States, reviewed the way it treats sick 
animals. Before, especially in the case of pure-bred lambs, we 
used to slaughter all sick animals. We have now decided that 
moderately sick lambs would not be killed but quarantined. This 
can be appropriate for owners of very large herds like those in 
the West, for whom quarantining a small part of their herd is not 
a major problem.
<P>
	However, in Quebec, where herds are much smaller, this type 
of action is inappropriate. In my riding, for example, it pushed a 
producer to the brink of bankruptcy. We had to intervene many 
times to make the bureaucracy understand the situation. 
Unfortunately, we have not yet managed to change the 
regulations, the new practice adopted under U.S. pressure.
<P>
	That is one example where implementing a practice across 
Canada can harm the economy of one of Canada's regions.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The other point that I would like to bring to the attention of the 
House is support for exports. Much is being done to help people 
who are long established, but there is not much room for new 
exporters. For example, young people who would like to export 
top-quality maple syrup do not easily find the government 
program that could help them.
<P>
	In agriculture, it is very complicated to find which program 
applies to which crop since agriculture has always been a shared 
federal-provincial jurisdiction; this does not make it easy for 
those who want to be involved in agriculture.
<P>
	In another area, the federal government is acting contrary to 
the fine principles it has put forward, namely by cutting the 
funding for regional agricultural fairs. While they say they want 
to give regional agriculture a chance, this year they are cutting 
the budgets for the 55 regional agricultural fairs in Quebec by 15 
per cent and next year they want to cut them out completely, 
which will eliminate these regional agricultural fairs that 
promote high-quality livestock.
<P>
	I think that such an example proves the government's lack of 
leadership in agriculture. They just say the right words; what 
they do is in fact contrary to the decisions that should be made. 
Instead of encouraging agriculture, they are making drastic cuts 
that will hurt agriculture instead of helping it to develop.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. I would like the 
permission of the House to speak for eight or ten minutes, 
please, if that is possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Members have heard the 
request from the member for Mackenzie. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to make sure, 
at the request of the hon. member for Mackenzie, that he can 
share his comments with us for eight to ten minutes at most. 
Would there be unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Will 
giving me the floor prevent a member who was supposed to 
speak from speaking on this point?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The period should end at 
5.30 p.m.; we would have to add nine or ten minutes, and the 
minister's statement is scheduled for 5.40 p.m. So if a member 
speaks, someone else will certainly be unable to speak. The day 
must end at some point.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
privilege to speak in the House today on this debate on 
agricultural issues. I am conscious of the fact that I represent an 
urban riding but I remind the members of the House that not only 
are the members of urban ridings consumers of agricultural 
products but we are all interested in a healthy farm community.
<P>
	It is in the interest of all of us and there are many of us in 
Rosedale riding, those for example who work at the University 
of Toronto in the research area and others, who make in their 
own way a contribution to the health of the important 
agricultural community in this country.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the last election probably the single most important and 
dominant issue for our government for Canada's agri-food 
industry has been international trade. That is a matter of great 
concern to the foreign affairs and international trade committee 
of which I happen to be the vice-chairman. As was pointed out 
by the members for Haldimand-Norfolk, 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and Peace River this has been a 
very intense and challenging period in that area.
<P>
	I think it is important for us to bear in mind that 1.5 million 
Canadians, that is one in five, depend directly on exports for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3671"> 3671 </A></B>
<P>
their livelihood. Trade in goods and services is equal almost to 
half our GDP and in the agri-food sector for every dollar that is 
earned at the farm gate exports generate about 45 cents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, international trade in this sector has become 
increasingly important for the province of Quebec. In 1991, 
exports from this province amounted to 9 per cent of the 
Canadian total. Today they are 13 per cent, an increase of 49 per 
cent, for a total value of 1.8 billion Canadian dollars.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Exports to the United States are extremely important and new 
markets and new jobs will arise from our entry into new 
international markets. Although we are presently engaged in 
difficult negotiations with the United States over trade in some 
agri-food products which we hope to resolve over the coming 
months, the bulk of our trade remains free of dispute and 
continues to expand. Once a settlement with the United States is 
reached we will have a more secure environment in which all 
sectors can plan for the future.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity today to look at some of 
the impacts of the new trading arrangements and how our 
government is working to assist Canada's agri-food sector with 
its market development activities.
<P>
	The Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development has forecast that the new GATT agreement will 
give the Canadian economy an additional $8 billion boost by the 
year 2002. This government is determined to ensure that 
Canada's agri-food sector is a major participant in that 
economic growth.
<P>
	The new development brings agriculture under effective trade 
rules for the first time in history and will ensure that these rules 
apply equally to all countries. Under the GATT as a result of the 
Uruguay round members have agreed to cut agri-food export 
subsidies by 21 per cent by volume and 36 per cent by value over 
six years. Export subsidy programs like the European 
Communities' CAP and the U.S. export enhancement program 
which the member for Haldimand-Norfolk referred to this 
afternoon are curtailed and international grains and oilseed 
prices will gradually rise.
<P>
	It is hard to describe the importance of these changes. The 
anomalies that were created by agricultural subsidies in world 
trade were absolutely extraordinary. We had this crazy situation 
in the United States for example in which its export subsidies 
encouraged its farmers to export wheat to Turkey. The Turks, 
not being crazy, turned this wheat into pasta and sent it back to 
the United States which then competed with the pasta 
manufacturers in the United States which had to import 
Canadian wheat. Meanwhile Canadians were selling subsidized 
wheat to Italy which the Italians were turning into pasta and 
shipping back to Canada.
<P>
	These anomalies created by subsides riddled agricultural 
trade. They have to some extent been brought under discipline 
under the new GATT rules. The importance of this cannot be 
under emphasized.
<P>
	In that context we have to recognize that our supply 
management system which will be preserved as a result of our 
high tariffs came under attack under article XI, but this 
government was able to negotiate those high protective tariffs 
which will preserve the benefits of our farm management 
system.
<P>
	As the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell pointed out 
we do not live in an isolated world. We are one member of the 
GATT and 115 other members insisted that we change from the 
type of quotas which we had used up to this time to a new and 
different type of system.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	This government recognizes that changes will be needed. 
Changes will be needed to help the sector. To this end, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food is heading a six member federal-provincial industry 
task force on orderly marketing. Its mandate is to consult with 
all supply management stakeholders to identify the issues that 
need to be addressed and suggest co-operative decision making 
processes to deal with those in anticipation of the GATT 
implementation in 1995.
<P>
	Amendment to the GATT rules will allow for more 
competition. But of themselves the rules will not ensure that we 
take advantage of those markets. We have to work for those 
markets and this government recognizes that. To help the 
agri-food sector capitalize on these advantages, Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada has a new branch, market and industry 
services, with offices in all of the provinces. This branch is 
specifically designated to work with the industry on enhancing 
its global competitiveness and increasing its share of domestic 
and international markets.
<P>
	As well, the federal government has 55 trade commissioners 
and commercial officers working on agri-food trade and 
developing more than 150 foreign markets. This includes 18 
agri-food specialists, five of whom were recently named to our 
diplomatic posts in Taipei, Seoul, Singapore, Osaka and Mexico 
City.
<P>
	Here at home, an agri-food industry council will be 
established to advise on all matters related to improving 
Canada's market position, promoting economic growth and 
creating jobs.
<P>
	In addition, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will be 
working with other federal departments and the provinces to 
establish a single window marketing service for Canadian 
industry. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3672"> 3672 </A></B>
<P>
will help facilitate access to programs such as the new getting 
ready to go global program, which gives cost shared assistance 
to food and beverage processors in developing competitiveness 
strategies and initiatives, and the agri-food industry  marketing 
strategy program which helps agri-food associations develop 
and implement marketing plans.
<P>
	The government's plan is to concentrate marketing on those 
areas of the globe which have the greatest potential for 
economic growth and market expansion in the future. In that 
context, the government is putting particular emphasis on the 
Asia Pacific and Mexican markets.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture and the Governor General are 
presently on a trip to China and to Asia with industry 
representatives to sell our agricultural products. I hope, having 
heard the member for Peace River today speak of the importance 
of international trade in agricultural products, he may bring 
some discipline to bear on the member for Wild Rose when he 
questions the costs of these trips and the Governor General 
attending when important marketing initiatives can be made by 
such initiatives.
<P>
	The Asia Pacific region is the fastest growing economic 
region in the world and it offers tremendous opportunities for 
Canadian agri-food exporters. This government intends to 
exploit that market and is doing so at this time. This represents a 
potential for jobs. They are good jobs, high paying jobs based on 
real markets in a growing part of the world.
<P>
	Jobs, Mr. Speaker and other members of the House, I remind 
you, in the export area involve not only the farm marketers 
themselves but support services, banking and other areas, which 
those who live in urban communities benefit from as well. That 
is why the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is in Asia 
today and 15 leaders in the agri-food sector thought it was 
important enough to be there with him.
<P>
	With growing access to new markets around the world, it is 
clear that the future of Canada's agri-food industry is full of 
opportunities, the opportunity for growth and opportunity to 
contribute to economic activity and jobs in all parts of the 
country.
<P>
	By working in close co-operation with the provinces, 
industry and other stakeholders, and by continuing to support 
the trade and marketing initiatives of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada and other federal departments I am confident 
that we can help the industry make Canada agriculture and 
agri-food number one in the world.
<P>
	In so doing, we will be ensuring not only the wellbeing of our 
farm community but the overall economic health of our country 
which includes important interests in our urban community as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address this unfortunate 
motion. However I would like to commend the opposition for 
raising this issue because the agri-food sector is such a strong 
contributor to our economy.
<P>
	A few moments ago the hon. member for Mackenzie was not 
allowed to speak by the opposition. The member for Mackenzie, 
who is very interested in agriculture, often sits in on the standing 
committee. While I may not always agree with his comments or 
theories, I do feel sad that the opposition would not allow him to 
speak.
<P>
	The rules of the road for business are government regulations. 
Regulations protect Canadians, ensuring them safe, nutritious 
food. Regulations also play a very important role. They are a 
way of setting standards. High standards mean quality and that 
can mean Canadian agri-food products are attractive to world 
markets because of their quality.
<P>
	However times change and regulations that were helpful in 
the past become an obstacle to growth today. In some cases, new 
technology makes regulations obsolete as scientific tests 
replace manual inspections. In other cases, various levels of 
government have added layer after layer of regulation without 
co-ordinating their efforts and without counting the cost to 
industry.
<P>
	We view regulations as a tool that can help the agri-food 
sector produce internationally competitive products. But to be 
an effective tool it must be honed and constantly sharpened to 
keep pace with changing world markets and technology. 
Regulations should be a tool which encourages innovation and 
entrepreneurship, not one that blunts industry's integrity.
<P>
	That is why the government is dedicated to reforming 
regulations. Regulations are dry, technical and complicated. 
Done wrong, they cost too much to the industry and to the 
taxpayers but done right, they can create jobs.
<P>
	As members know, the focus of the government's election 
campaign last fall was economic renewal and job creation. 
Building on this commitment in the February budget, the 
finance minister announced numerous initiatives to help 
improve the competitiveness of the Canadian industry.
<P>
	One of the steps he announced was: ``We will intensify and 
accelerate the effort to reform and remove regulations that 
create confusion and costs by putting in place a task force to 
provide on a fast track basis a better regulatory regime, one that 
will not compromise compliance but rather improve the 
competitiveness of business''.
<P>
	The government has already done a considerable amount of 
work in recent years to ensure that government regulations fulfil 
a specific departmental mandate and that they enhance, not 
hinder, industry's ability to compete. An interdepartmental 
committee of assistant deputy ministers on regulatory reform is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3673"> 3673 </A></B>
<P>
currently working to, first, provide departments with the means 
to use alternatives to reduce the regulatory burden; second, 
provide a greater variety of enforcement tools and options; and 
third, improve the process of the regulatory development.
<P>
	At Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the first phase of 
regulatory housekeeping led to the elimination and amendment 
of regulations through an omnibus regulatory package passed in 
April 1993. This work is continuing. A second package of 
regulatory amendments has now been prepared involving the 
processed poultry regulations, livestock carcass grading 
regulations, fertilizer regulations and egg regulations. A copy of 
this package has been provided to the provinces for review and 
for their comment. It is anticipated that it will appear in part I of 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I> this summer.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	As part of this federal regulatory reform process, the 
government, in co-operation with consumer groups and 
industry stakeholders, also reviewed the current regulatory 
requirements concerning best before dating and packed on 
dating and looked at the subject of food date marking in general.
<P>
	Under the food and drug regulations the labels of most 
perishable and semi-perishable prepackaged foods with a shelf 
life of 90 days or less are required to show a durable life or ``best 
before'' date in a clear, non-encoded manner. Storage 
instructions are required if conditions other than room 
temperature storage are necessary. When packaged on retail 
premises, perishables and semi-perishable foods are required to 
show packed on date instead of best before date.
<P>
	The intent of these requirements introduced back in 1974 is to 
provide consumers with useful information regarding relative 
freshness and potential shelf life of food. Foods which have 
exceeded the best before date are still acceptable for 
consumption but they may not be at their peak state of freshness.
<P>
	During the reform process the government found strong, 
general support for retaining present date marking requirements 
for perishables and semi-perishables having a durable life date 
of 90 days or less.
<P>
	Consumers and industry believe these requirements to be very 
effective and a useful way of informing consumers as to relevant 
produce freshness.
<P>
	We also found support for the voluntary use by manufacturers 
of best before dating on foods with durable life of more than 90 
days.
<P>
	As a result of the review the following recommendations were 
developed. Support the use of best before dating on products 
with a durable life of more 90 days on a voluntary basis. Amend 
the food and drug regulations to revoke durable life date 
exemptions for donuts and commissary items. Review date 
marking in respect to products with modified atmosphere 
packaging. Review the need for date marking on low acid foods 
packaged in hermetically sealed containers and on refrigerated 
products and consider extending the requirements relating to the 
statement ``previously frozen'' to all products which have been 
frozen and thawed prior to sale.
<P>
	In the last phase of the implementation process Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada's food production and inspection 
branch, in co-operation with the Department of Health, will be 
consulting on these recommendations with food industry 
stakeholders, including industry associations, consumer groups 
and other federal and provincial government departments.
<P>
	Central to these discussions is Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada's inspection and regulation mandate. The department's 
responsibility is to set and enforce standards to safeguard 
human, animal and plant health and facilitate international trade 
and to support the protection of the environment through 
sustainable agricultural practices.
<P>
	In line with these departmental responsibilities, the FBI 
branch has been working in recent months to develop a business 
plan which will ensure that its resources are directed to the 
highest priorities, to ensure that only safe, wholesome food 
enters the Canadian marketplace and that our inspections 
program works to enhance the competitiveness of Canada's 
agri-food sector.
<P>
	The challenge is to maintain and improve the branch's current 
food inspection programs while at the same time making the 
best use of the taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	I believe our efforts to reduce the unnecessary regulations of 
industry and to focus on our resources on a top priority of 
ensuring food safety will pay off handsomely in every province. 
Reforming regulations create new opportunities. It creates jobs. 
It is a way to ensure that the agri-food sector is profitable. It will 
remain a very important tool for making sure the agri-food 
sector remains competitive.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just a short comment on what the hon. member said in 
his introduction, in which he reproached us for not letting 
another member take the floor.
<P>
	I simply wanted to say that, for the opposition day we 
requested on agriculture, we need all the time we are allowed to 
voice the concerns of Quebec and those of farmers across 
Canada, and we are prepared to consider the possibility of 
having the hon. member speak when we have finished. All 
members who expressed an interest in speaking in this debate, 
members from the rural ridings who want agriculture to have its 
rightful place in Canada and Quebec, should be able to speak, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3674"> 3674 </A></B>
<P>
and that is why we felt this was important, because the treatment 
of agriculture in Quebec has left much to be desired in the past.
<P>
	Agriculture in Canada is to a large extent western agriculture, 
and we want to say there is an agricultural industry in Quebec as 
well, and that is why we want all our members who have 
something to say about their ridings and certain expectations 
they want to express on behalf of their constituents, to be able to 
do so. We want to ensure that the concerns of the agricultural 
industry, in Quebec and in Canada, get the attention they 
deserve, and that is why we want to ensure that the entire debate 
is used to discuss those concerns.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As you know, I have been 
in the Chair all day for this very important debate and I 
understand, as the hon. member just mentioned, that there are 
still a large number of members would like to speak to the issue.
<P>
	As some members have pointed out when the hon. member 
made his presentation, there is a tradition in this House to the 
effect that we do not reflect on a decision which has been made.
<P>
	I imagine that we all learned something. I am convinced that 
the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte will take note, as I 
will, and I thank the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his intervention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte would like 
to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated the member for 
Mackenzie certainly has tremendous experience in the field. I 
also indicated that while I may not always agree with his 
comments or his theories, I do feel he deserved an opportunity to 
make those comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Of course the 
House is always the master of its own destiny. It is a tradition of 
the House that once a decision is taken, we carry on the business 
of the day. It is not the tradition to reflect on a decision taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could assist the Chair 
and the House by indicating that I have had informal 
conversations with my colleagues of all represented parties in 
the House at the present time and they have unanimously agreed 
to extend the hours to allow the member to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We are getting ahead of 
ourselves here. I know that there are other members who want to 
speak to the issue of the day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the debate should normally end 
around 5.40 p.m.
<P>
	Consequently, since I will in all likelihood be the last speaker 
on this motion, I would like to first congratulate again the hon. 
member for Québec-Est, who is the Official Opposition critic 
on agriculture, for tabling a motion which, as pointed out a few 
moments ago by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Témiscouata, is the first one on agriculture since 
the opening of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	We, members of the Official Opposition, are justifiably proud 
to be the first ones to table such a motion and to show to all 
Quebecers, and farmers in particular, that we are here to protect 
their interests in every field and especially in the agricultural 
sector.
<P>
	Today, members from the Bloc have spoken brilliantly and 
eloquently on the issue, and they have clearly demonstrated the 
nonchalance of the Liberal government regarding the 
agricultural sector since it took office. This lack of vision, 
policy and decision is hurting agriculture in Canada, and 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	I want to take those few minutes to emphasize the importance 
of agriculture. I will use my own constituency of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead as an example, since it is 
essentially a rural riding where agriculture is the number one 
industry. I have here some figures which I am pleased to 
communicate to members and to Canadians, so that we can see 
the impact, on this industry, of the measures taken by 
governments, particularly the federal government.
<P>
	There are close to 2,000 farms in the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. According to Statistics 
Canada, in 1991, expenditures and revenues related to the 
agricultural industry in my riding were somewhere around $123 
million and $156 million, respectively. These two figures alone 
show how important that industry is for our riding and for all of 
Quebec also.
<P>
	Moving on, 2,500 jobs in my riding are directly dependent on 
agriculture. Imagine, 2,500 jobs. One would have to travel to 
several municipalities and to several ridings to find industries 
which employ such a large number of workers. And for every 
direct job, we can count on six indirect ones, which means that 
farming in the riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead 
accounts for an additional 15,000 jobs in the eastern townships.
<P>
	The agricultural sector in Quebec has evolved rapidly over the 
years. I listened to the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who tried to get my colleague 
from the Bloc who serves as agriculture critic to admit that 
agriculture has flourished in Quebec because of federal 
government policies. May I remind this House and point out for 
the benefit of my colleague that agriculture underwent a 
remarkable period of growth between 1976 and 1985, thanks to 
the vision and energy of a government, but more especially, 
thanks to one man, the MNA for Lévis, Mr. Jean Garon, who in 
many ways sparked the development of the agricultural sector in 
Quebec. Many people considered the MNA for  Lévis to be a 
dreamer. Some even thought he was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3675"> 3675 </A></B>
<P>
little crazy when he said his goal was to increase agricultural 
self-sufficiency in Quebec from 50 per cent, the level it stood at 
when the Parti Quebecois came to power in 1976, to over 70 per 
cent. Within four years or one term of office, Quebec had 
already achieved a level of self-sufficiency greater than 70 per 
cent, all because of the government's policies. Since then, the 
Liberal government which came to power in 1985 has managed 
to bring the level back down to about 60 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	On the subject of agriculture, we should also mention certain 
initiatives that were taken and the benefits that accrued to show, 
as I said at the beginning of my speech, the impact of agriculture 
on a region. I would like to point out three initiatives that I am 
particularly proud of in my riding. First, the Centre d'initiative 
agricole de Coaticook, which is basically a group of farmers 
who not only put a lot of effort in their own farming enterprises, 
but also provide training to other farmers. They have just set a 
precedent by approving an agreement concluded with the local 
school board to invest in farm training for our young people. 
This deserved to be pointed out. They have been praised by all 
socio-economic stakeholders in l'Estrie for this initiative.
<P>
	There is also the agri-food table, la Table agro-alimentaire, 
in the Haut-Saint-François RCM, which brings 
together-somewhat like the group in Coaticook-a number of 
farmers who have set out to develop the agricultural industry by 
encouraging new farms to locate or get established in their 
region and, to that end, by meeting students in our agricultural 
colleges, in Saint-Hyacinthe and in the Quebec area, as well as 
by inviting them to invest in the most beautiful riding in the 
province, the riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
	In conjunction with all economic stakeholders, they are also 
setting up agricultural products processing industries to ensure 
that our farm products can be processed locally, thus creating 
employment.
<P>
	One last example, before closing: farm tourism. It was barely 
mentioned today, but its is nonetheless an important industry. 
Let me give you one figure. In 1993, in my riding and the 
Coaticook region, thanks to the concerted efforts of the 
municipalities, the agricultural community and the tourist 
industry, 4,000 European tourists, mostly from France, came to 
visit us and were able to appreciate the state of development of 
our agricultural industry as well as enjoying, of course, the 
warm welcome Quebecers are renowned for.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, in the weeks and months to come, the federal 
government must concentrate on an issue of major importance 
not only to my riding but also to Quebec as a whole and even a 
major part of Ontario. I am referring of course to the 
negotiations scheduled to take place as a result of the GATT 
agreement, particularly to set tariffs for milk.
<P>
	Someone on the government side said earlier-and I will 
close on this-that deals had already been made. We want, we 
insist that the efforts made by our farmers over all those the 
years not be compromised by negotiations, the outcome of 
which are not known. We in the opposition will be extremely 
vigilant in that regard.

extend the sitting hours by 10 minutes in order to permit the hon. 
member for Mackenzie to address the House, and subsequently 
of course to add 10 minutes to private members' hour to ensure 
that it is not shortened and that the full hour be allotted to private

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> My thanks to you, Mr. 
Speaker, and to the House for extending the session for 10 
minutes. I am sorry that we had a misunderstanding a few 
minutes ago when we tried to do the same thing and failed.
<P>
	Being from the riding of Mackenzie, which is located in 
northeastern Saskatchewan, we are very concerned about 
agricultural policy and the terms that the government imposes 
on agricultural policy in this country. We were faced with local 
conditions that are quite unusual this past year such as flooding 
and extra rain which has meant harvesting not completed from 
last year and it means that many producers will not be able to 
seed a crop this year because last year's crop is still in the fields.
<P>
	There was a great deal of hope that a third line of defence 
would be worked out given this circumstance in northeastern 
Saskatchewan and northwestern Manitoba. However, no such 
thing happened. The minister and his counterparts across the 
country simply said that the crop insurance and the GRIP 
programs that are in effect are going to have to be used.
<P>
	We urge all farmers in the circumstance of perhaps losing two 
crops to make certain they take advantage of that part of the crop 
insurance program that covers inability to seed in the coming 
year.
<P>
	There have been other problems that these people have been 
facing. They face the same problems that all Canadian farmers 
have faced: low incomes due to low grain prices because of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3676"> 3676 </A></B>
<P>
grain wars that have erupted between the United States and 
Europe; the United States' insistence upon using export 
enhancement funds to depreciate the value of export prices to 
the point that the only place Canadians can get a decent price for 
durum  wheat is in the United States, which is the only country 
that has not been targeted for export enhancement funds.
<P>
	In effect the market is $40 or $50 U.S. per tonne higher in the 
United States than it is in any of the markets that we normally 
sell to because the United States has been paying our old 
customers $50 to $60 a tonne to take their durum wheat instead 
and their other grains as well.
<P>
	As well, for a short period of time a small window of 
opportunity opened up in the U.S. market for barley and that 
became the high value market. Canada sold barley into the 
United States which has triggered a short skirmish in the 
continuing skirmishes along that border in agricultural trade to 
the point at which one of the senators from North 
Dakota-although he says it was in jest-actually suggested to 
one of the committees of Congress that the 300 Minuteman 
missiles located in silos in North Dakota be reprogrammed to hit 
Canadian wheat farmers.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Those problems will pass and they will be resurfacing again 
from my experience in free trade with the Americans. We have 
had free trade, I might add, in meats for over 50 years and there 
have always been times when border access was very difficult 
even though we have a program of free trade in pork and beef 
between our two countries.
<P>
	The challenge I want to speak about today in the short period 
that I have is the global challenge that arises now that we have 
had Canada-U.S. trade agreements, the North American free 
trade agreement, followed by the General Agreement on Tariff 
and Trade.
<P>
	All of these agreements have substantially limited the power 
of national governments to impose or to have their own 
programs for agriculture or for production of any kind of 
product whether it is manufactured products or a raw product 
like most of the agriculture products that we export.
<P>
	This has been assessed by various world trade experts and 
economists who have concluded that in Canada's case Canadian 
agriculture is going to have to get used to a lower level of export, 
lower incomes and this means that we have a great challenge 
ahead in rural Canada and at the federal level as well to find new 
ways of reducing production costs.
<P>
	Where I live our ability to export is highly dependent upon the 
continuation of the crow rate which was there to entice us to 
settle that region in the first place. We are a long way from 
tidewater and cheap shipping. We are relatively close to 
Churchill but none of our purchasers of raw products seems 
interested in picking up products at Churchill so we have to ship 
to Vancouver, Thunder Bay or Prince Rupert, very long 
distances.
<P>
	We are located about as far from those ports as it is possible to 
get on the prairies. Yet the government has continued to pursue 
the policy of the previous government of reducing the benefits 
to the crow rate.
<P>
	The panel has looked at who should receive that payment. 
Though it has not made any recommendations the study shows 
that there is very little to be gained by paying the payment to the 
producers. It shows that if you paid the producers rather than the 
railways barley exports would disappear. There would be very 
little change in the production of meats, beef and hogs, which 
has been the contention by those who wanted the payment made 
to producers rather than to the railways. The government has 
what will probably be a difficult decision because there is so 
much politics behind the feeling among some farm groups that 
they could do a better job of spending the money by paying the 
railways themselves than the government paying the railways in 
order to keep the rates down.
<P>
	We are left with very few options in government policy for the 
federal government. Under the new GATT arrangements it will 
have to reduce its subsidies. We have a challenge of trying to 
identify the subsidies of other countries so that we can make 
certain that we are operating on a fair basis. The previous 
government did not do a good job of that. It did not identify the 
subsidies the United States has even though it spent a lot of time 
negotiating the agreement with the United States.
<P>
	We have some positive things we can look at. I am trying to 
hurry because of the time. We can still use marketing boards. 
There are great advantages to producers in gaining regulated 
control of the products they wish to market. That has been 
proven through the wheat board, the hog marketing boards, the 
Ontario Wheat Board, as was mentioned, various milk 
marketing boards, and the chicken and egg marketing boards 
across the land.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	These agencies do an excellent job of making certain that a 
product finds a market, that it gets to market with the least 
possible cost without running trucks and trains back and forth 
across the country. It is the most efficient way to work.
<P>
	Therefore I would urge the government to pursue those 
options, particularly putting more grains under the Canadian 
Wheat Board and expanding the jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Wheat Board to go into eastern Ontario and the rest of the 
country as it chooses as well.
<P>
	I note that there is a need for revitalization. I was at a 
committee meeting this morning at which the department 
officials talked about rural revitalization. I note that there are a 
lot of things that need to be done in this area and that can be done 
even in spite of the GATT rules.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3677"> 3677 </A></B>
<P>
	We have taxation policies that favour the relatively wealthy, 
medium and high income people, relatively old people, but we 
do not have any RRSP treatment for the young which would 
permit them to invest in their farms and businesses at a young 
age to get some tax benefits. Instead, we wait until they get into 
their middle years and older and then the tax system encourages 
the investment in RRSP. We actually lose taxes as a result of 
that.
<P>
	Why do we not invest the tax treatment in the younger people 
so that they can revitalize local communities and maybe back off 
a little bit the tax advantages that we are giving to the medium 
and high income people? We should be pursuing these and a 
whole host of other things that I had on my list. Perhaps some 
other time the House will grant me the privilege of presenting 
the rest of those ideas.
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider repealing 
the Patent Act Amendment Act, Chapter 2, Statutes of Canada, 1993, to make 
prescription drugs more affordable to Canadians and to encourage the creation 
of jobs in Canada by generic drug companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure this afternoon to move 
this motion in the House of Commons. Bill C-91 in essence 
ended Canada's compulsory drug licensing system in place 
since 1969 which helped make medicines more affordable.
<P>
	Bill C-91 increased patent protection for the large 
multinational pharmaceutical corporations. What that means is 
that those drug companies were able to extend the monopoly 
pricing for periods of up to 20 years for their prescription drugs. 
Canadians are deeply concerned about the consequences of this 
bill. What Bill C-91 has done is increase the cost of some 
prescription drugs by about 120 per cent in the past three years.
<P>
	As a result of this bill, for example, the Saskatchewan drug 
plan, a government funded plan, has had to diminish its 
coverage for Saskatchewan citizens quite significantly but still 
pays about $10 million more a year for the plan because of 
increased prescription drug prices.
<P>
	The boost in the cost of provincial drug programs ultimately 
means you pay more for drugs and increases Canada's 
dependence on the most powerful pharmaceutical companies. 
Bill C-91 also weakens Canadians generic drug companies at 
the expense of foreign multinational pharmaceuticals. It also 
sharply deteriorates our own pharmaceutical trade balance, 
making Canada a warehouse for drug imports. The biggest 
impact is on the consumer, in particular those people who 
require prescription drugs, the sick, the elderly, people from all 
walks of life.
<P>
	The Eastman committee which studied drug patents and costs 
in 1983 claimed that across Canada at that time the public saved 
$211 million per year in drug costs from generics. In 1986 the 
Canadian Drug Manufacturers Association, which is the 
organization of companies that manufacture generic drugs in 
Canada, estimated that compulsory licensing saved us about 
$500 million a year.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	We do not have an updated figure but for health care plans in 
this country which total about $70 billion in costs to the 
government the components of the pharmaceuticals in that $70 
billion cost is about 17 per cent, which means it costs Canadians 
abut $13 billion or $14 billion a year. Estimates today indicate 
that we would be saving between $1 billion and $2 billion a year 
if Bill C-91 did not exist.
<P>
	Not only do we save on the generic price but whenever a 
generic equivalent is introduced to the market the brand name 
product falls about 20 per cent to compete with it.
<P>
	The Eastman committee at that time recommended a 
maximum monopoly of four years. The government legislated 
seven years for some drugs and ten years for others. Someone 
from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs said 
we did not give them a nickel more than they asked for. Now it is 
not just seven years or ten years or even seventeen, but Bill C-91 
gives these pharmaceuticals 20 years of protection.
<P>
	There is a well know drug, an antibiotic, that is marketed as 
Septra by a company called Burroughs Wellcome and there is 
Bactrim by another company called Hoffmann-La Roche. This 
medicine is composed of two constituents that work together to 
produce their effects in the urinary tract and in the respiratory 
system.
<P>
	One of these components is owned by the British drug 
company Burroughs Wellcome and the other component is 
owned by Hofmann-La Roche of Switzerland.
<P>
	Not only do the components work symbiotically, so do the 
companies. Wellcome makes enough of its product to supply its 
own needs and that of the Roche company while the Roche 
company makes sufficient of its own product to supply itself and 
Burroughs Wellcome.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3678"> 3678 </A></B>
<P>
	Then each company advertises its own product as superior to 
that of the opposite company and will produce research material 
to even prove it. Yet the only difference is that the one company 
markets this tablet in green and the other is coloured white. 
There is a slight difference in shape but they both contain the 
identical amounts of the same two drugs that came from the 
same two companies. They come from the same machinery in 
the same factories. Not only that, but they each thereafter supply 
these components to generic drug companies who could produce 
them under compulsory licensing at a cheaper rate and then 
these pharmaceuticals have the cheek to call themselves ethical 
pharmaceutical manufacturers.
<P>
	An article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of January 20, 1993 cites the 
chairman of a company that administers many private drug 
benefit plans in Ontario. He told the Senate committee 
investigating this matter that the average cost of a prescription 
drug in Ontario in 1987 was $12.52. Five years later it was 
$21.12, an increase of 75 per cent over five years for the average 
prescription drug. He projected that by the year 2000, six short 
years away, the average would be about $34.
<P>
	Of course the federal government's rationale for C-91 was 
that great big bogeyman GATT, the General Agreement on Trade 
and Tariffs. Bill C-91 was retroactive to three years prior to the 
GATT's being implemented before it took effect. My concern is 
why should Canada have internal matters decided by foreign 
governments?
<P>
	As a matter of fact, Canadian drug manufacturers have 
indicated in their research that under the present Patent Act 
Canadian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers are prohibited 
from producing for export products that are under patent in 
Canada, even if the product is not under patent in the country we 
wish to export to.
<P>
	For example, given that many patents are granted in the 
United States before they are granted in Canada, patents will 
expire in the U.S. before they expire in Canada. The Canadian 
generic pharmaceutical industry must now locate 
manufacturing facilities in the U.S. when a patent expires there 
before it expires in Canada.
<P>
	This means we cannot continue to create jobs and produce our 
export products here in Canada. In effect we are being forced to 
export Canadian investment and jobs which we prefer to locate 
right here. Unless this problem is quickly rectified we will be 
forced to curtail more jobs in Canada and invest and create jobs 
in the U.S., Mexico and other export markets.
<P>
	The repeal of Bill C-91 would demonstrate to Canadians that 
the Canadian government still has control over its domestic 
affairs rather than the multinational foreign drug manufacturers. 
If this bill is not repealed it will prove once again to Canadians 
that the Liberals are no different than the Conservatives.
<P>
	We have often heard in many jurisdictions in this country the 
phrase ``Liberal, Tory, same old story''.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	My sense of it is that unless the Liberals who voted in 
opposition against Bill C-91 repeal this legislation they will be 
no better than their sisters, the Conservative Party. I think 
actions speak louder than words. It is incumbent upon the 
Liberal government to take action on this bill and repeal it so 
that we can save a whole lot of jobs and a whole lot of money for 
our drug plans and for Canadian consumers in the end.
<P>
	When the Tories passed the drug patent legislation, Bill C-91, 
New Democrats predicted it was a prescription for problems. 
The legislation gave brand name drug companies a 20 year 
monopoly to charge basically whatever they wanted for 
prescription drugs. New Democrats said that the granting of 
generic drug licences would be eliminated and that consumers 
would bear the brunt of decreased competition and increased 
prices. Without competition big name pharmaceutical 
companies would be able to set the price of being healthy.
<P>
	According to a 1986 Ontario report on drug competition when 
five versions of the same drug were on the market the cheapest 
generic drug was almost half the price of the original. Since Bill 
C-91 was passed this type of saving to the consumer is a thing of 
the past.
<P>
	I have here some brand name-generic price comparisons for 
the top 25 genericized products. For example, for the drug 
Cimetidine which is an ulcer drug-that is the drug name, the 
brand name is Tagamet-the generic price is about 80 per cent 
less expensive than the original brand name. We are actually 
paying 80 per cent more for the brand name of a drug which 
produces the same ultimate result.
<P>
	For Naproxen which is an arthritis drug, the brand name of 
which is Naprosyn, the per cent savings if we use a generic is 
about 76 per cent. There is a whole list of examples. Every one 
of these examples is at least 15 per cent cheaper, and in many 
cases up to 80 per cent cheaper by using generics.
<P>
	What we can conclude from this is that the consumers in 
Canada are being gouged by Bill C-91 which allows the 
pharmaceutical corporations to gouge consumers. New 
Democrats in this country, New Democrats in this House of 
Commons, oppose this kind of gouging of consumers.
<P>
	Even provincial drug plans will not be able to shield 
Canadians from the high cost of being healthy. Cash strapped 
provinces will be forced to delete more and more drugs from the 
list of the products they pay for, creating a situation like that in 
the U.S. where people are dying because they cannot afford 
brand name drugs and they do not have an option to purchase 
generic drugs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Saskatchewan was convinced that Bill C-91 was a severe 
blow to health care in Saskatchewan. At that time it estimated it 
would cost its drug plan between $6 million and $10 million 
more each year. Not only has it proven to cost $10 million a year 
more, but it has had to reduce the coverage because of the 
massive increases in drugs.
<P>
	The Tories argument in favour of Bill C-91 is that without 
patent protection Canada is in danger of losing research and 
development investments. In support of this claim Judy Erola, 
former Liberal Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and 
president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of 
Canada, resorted to using blackmail as a rallying cry. She 
claimed that the brand name industry would pass us by if patent 
protection was not extended. While Bill C-91 is in effect the 
promised drug jobs have not materialized and in fact layoffs 
have occurred.
<P>
	As recently as April 26, 1994 in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> it was 
stated: ``Earlier this month Eli Lilly Canada Inc. of Toronto 
scrapped a plan to add 150 manufacturing jobs and a major 
expansion first announced at the time of C-91's passage. The 
company says it still plans to pump more money into R and D but 
shelved the $170 million expansion because of cuts dictated by 
its U.S. parent, the Eli Lilly Company of Minneapolis, 
Minnesota''.
<P>
	Here is one of many examples of this wonderful Bill C-91 
falling short from every single promise that was ever made by 
the former government.
<P>
	The problem with the arguments put forward by Ms. Erola is 
that the drug companies are not legally obligated to use their 
increased profits to conduct research and create jobs in Canada 
and past experience points to the contrary. When Bill C-22 was 
passed by the Tories in 1987 the same promises were made. 
However, Stats Canada figures show that only 500 new research 
jobs were created and these were offset by more than 1,000 jobs 
lost in drug manufacturing. In addition, Canada has no large 
drug companies with basic research facilities headquartered 
here.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We have some very serious problems in our health care 
program in Canada. We have increased prices in drugs which 
have skyrocketed since the implementation of Bill C-91. I have 
chosen this motion because it is important not just to me but to 
millions of Canadians.
<P>
	I have presented in this House petitions from thousands of 
people who are opposed to Bill C-91 and want generic drug 
companies to produce lower cost drugs for their use in terms of 
addressing their health problems. I have letters from a number 
of organizations. I want to read one into the record. This was 
sent to me by Mr. F.J. Lancaster, the immediate past national 
president of the Federal Superannuates National Association, 
which represent about 70,000 retired federal civil servants in its 
74 branches across the country. He says regarding Bill C-91: ``It 
is insidious legislation and  more so because one 10-year 
extension of patent rights on new drugs had already been 
granted, I believe in the 1970s, and Bill C-91 was a further 
sellout to the international drug companies. The costs of 
prescription drugs have risen dramatically. That is hurting the 
poor and aged on small incomes and causing some provincial 
government medical plans to virtually remove from their health 
care plans benefits related to prescription drugs because the 
plans cannot afford the coverage''.
<P>
	He continues: ``As a result, the users of prescription drugs 
have had to assume an additional and very heavy financial 
burden. While our organization is strictly non-partisan, we will 
fight the government of the day on any legislation inimical to 
our interests and we will support the efforts of any of our 
parliamentary representatives who oppose such type of 
legislation''. He represents 70,000 superannuates.
<P>
	I received a number of letters, one addressed to the Prime 
Minister from one of my constituents, urging the government to 
immediately review Bill C-91. This was dated January 5, 1994. 
I have not yet heard whether the Prime Minister responded. I am 
sure he responded to this constituent. These are examples of 
people across the country who are concerned.
<P>
	Another example is on April 5, 1994 a motion was passed in 
the Saskatchewan legislature, the province that I represent in 
this House of Commons, which was unanimously supported that 
read as follows: ``That this assembly urge the federal 
government to repeal Bill C-91 because it provides excessive 
profits to foreign drug companies, causes severe financial 
hardships to prescription drug users, particularly the elderly, 
and makes provincial drug plans economically impossible''.
<P>
	The entire legislature, which is composed of 54 New 
Democrats, 3 Liberals and 10 Conservatives, supported this 
motion unanimously.
<P>
	Not only is this evidence I provided important, but a poll 
taken recently conducted with about 1,100 Canadians was done 
by Insight Canada Research for the Canadian Drug 
Manufacturers Association. In this poll they found that 63 per 
cent of Canadian respondents are concerned about the high price 
of prescription drugs. Seventy-nine per cent of those people 
reside in Quebec. They say that 79 per cent of the Quebec 
population are concerned about it, 71 per cent of the population 
in the prairies are concerned about it and 77 per cent in Atlantic 
Canada. It also found that 75 per cent of Canadians believe the 
federal government should control the price of prescription 
drugs. Eighty-seven per cent of Quebecers believe the federal 
government should control the price of prescription drugs. They 
believe they are too high.
<P>
	I was curious to note in the House of Commons during 
Question Period today the Bloc Quebecois member who stood 
up and said: ``We oppose repealing Bill C-91. We want to see 
this bill protected and actually enhanced and strengthened''. 
They believe it is a good bill. That is not  surprising because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3680"> 3680 </A></B>
<P>
when they were in the previous Parliament they supported this 
legislation.
<P>
	What I cannot find a rationale for is that they really are 
supporting the international pharmaceutical corporations at the 
expense of gouging their own Quebec French Canadian 
consumer. They have in essence betrayed their own people. 
They got elected on a policy of so-called social democracy and 
the first opportunity they have to protect their people, they knife 
them in the gut. I think it is disgusting. All I can say is shame on 
them for that kind of performance and that kind of stand on this 
very, very important issue.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-91 is a threat to medicare, it is a threat to our Canadian 
generic drug manufacturers, it is a threat to consumers of 
prescription drugs. Bill C-91 is a threat to our provincial drug 
plans and it is a threat to the sick and the elderly.
<P>
	It helps no one except the large multinational corporations. It 
does not help anybody else in this country. That is why I believe 
the government of the day has to support this.
<P>
	I might say that in the previous Parliament many members 
opposite who are now in government, including the Prime 
Minister of Canada and the Minister of Health, opposed Bill 
C-91. I am asking them in their positions in cabinet and 
controlling the government to follow their instincts and their 
position in the previous Parliament and to repeal Bill C-91.
<P>
	I end by saying that I was very pleased to hear from many 
members of Parliament who support this motion, including the 
member for the riding of Ontario and, of course, the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	I know my time has ended. I reiterate by saying that I am 
urging the federal government to repeal Bill C-91 for the sake of 
our social programs, for the sake of medicare, for the sake of the 
sick and the elderly in our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place 
today to respond to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
	We share his concern over the impact of the amendments to 
the Patent Act that were introduced in the last Parliament. The 
laws that govern pharmaceuticals must balance many different 
interests. They must serve the industry, consumers and 
provincial governments whose health care plans account for 
about half of prescription sales in this country. As a result, I 
think it altogether appropriate that the government take a careful 
look at the results of the changes to the patent laws that were 
introduced by the last government.
<P>
	We would like to remind this House that the compulsory 
licensing regime for drugs was first adopted in 1923 following 
the example of an act in the United Kingdom. Until 1969, 
however, few compulsory licences were issued because the act 
required that active ingredients used in the manufacture of the 
generic drug would be produced in Canada.
<P>
	That changed in 1969. In that year the Patent Act was 
amended to allow generic companies to import active 
ingredients. This allowed a generic drug sector to develop in 
Canada.
<P>
	Under the system that was established compulsory licence 
applications were filed with the Commissioner of Patents who 
determined the royalty rate to be paid by generic companies to 
the patentees. The royalty rate was generally set at 4 per cent of 
the sales of the generic product. This system continued for the 
next 18 years.
<P>
	Some have argued that the system served Canada well. They 
would point out how the Canadian health care system benefited 
from cheaper pharmaceuticals. Because the results of their 
investment, hard work and innovation was not protected by our 
patent laws, the makers of brand name pharmaceuticals were 
reluctant to establish research facilities in Canada.
<P>
	Back in 1969 this was not considered to be as important a cost 
in light of the benefits of cheaper pharmaceuticals. For one 
thing, it seemed unlikely that brand name pharmaceutical 
companies would establish research facilities in this country in 
any event. After all, most of the innovative pharmaceutical 
companies were foreign multinationals and they tended to set up 
their research facilities in their home countries.
<P>
	Indeed, when a commission of inquiry on the pharmaceutical 
industry, chaired by Harry Eastman, tabled its report in 1985 it 
maintained that the innovative pharmaceutical companies were 
not hurt financially by the compulsory licensing regime. The 
profits of the industry from 1968 to 1982 were substantially 
higher than for total manufacturing in most other industries.
<P>
	In fact, the Eastman commission recommended that 
compulsory licensing brought a competitive element to the 
industry. It estimated that it saved Canadian taxpayers and 
consumers $200 million in 1983 alone. The commission 
recommended that compulsory licensing be continued but that 
the royalties paid to patentees be increased to reflect the costs of 
research and development to the innovator. The report also 
recommended that patentees be allowed four years of market 
exclusivity before generic companies would be permitted to 
enter the market.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The Eastman commission tabled its report at a time of 
profound change in the worldwide pharmaceutical industry. Mr. 
Eastman could not have anticipated some changes in the global 
environment for research and development that were taking 
place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3681"> 3681 </A></B>
<P>
	The major multinational drug manufacturers were beginning 
to invest their research and development dollars in countries 
other than their home country. One of the assurances that they 
sought in return for this investment was adequate intellectual 
property protection for their products.
<P>
	Around the world other leading industrialized countries 
abandoned their compulsory licensing regimes for drugs. 
Canada became increasingly isolated in trade discussions and 
subject to pressure to repeal the compulsory licensing regime.
<P>
	Many members of the House will recall the bitter debates that 
took place over the amendments to the Patent Act that were 
passed in 1987. Pharmaceutical patent owners were guaranteed 
a period of market exclusivity of seven to ten years instead of 
the four years that had been the case previously. In exchange, the 
brand name pharmaceutical companies made a public 
commitment to increase its research and development to sales 
ratio from 4.9 per cent, which is where it was in 1987, to 10 per 
cent by the year 1996.
<P>
	In fairness to these companies the House should acknowledge 
that they have been increasing their R and D. The House will 
recall that the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board was 
created under Bill C-22 to control the prices of patented 
medicines as well as to report on R and D investments.
<P>
	As the House knows, the previous government was not 
content to leave the patent legislation as it was amended through 
Bill C-22. In 1993 after another very bitter debate further 
changes were introduced through Bill C-91.
<P>
	These amendments abolished the compulsory licensing 
regime entirely. They did so retroactively. The amendments 
rendered inoperative any compulsory licence not granted by the 
Commissioner of Patents as of December 20, 1991. That was the 
date the so-called Dunkel text of the GATT was made public. 
The NAFTA also requires implementation on that date. These 
two trade agreements, the GATT and the NAFTA, limit the 
possibility for change in patent laws in Canada. Compulsory 
licensing specifically for drugs is not allowed.
<P>
	However some changes introduced in Bill C-91 went beyond 
what was required by these agreements. The government is 
taking a very close look at ways where it can harmonize the 
interests within the pharmaceutical industry and among 
consumers, provincial governments and drug companies.
<P>
	I also remind the House that Bill C-91 strengthened the 
powers of the Patent Medicine Prices Review Board. For 
example, failure to comply with the board's orders now carries a 
fine of up to $100,000 a day for a company and $25,000 a day for 
an individual. Although the price tests applied by the board were 
not changed, new price control factors can now be added by 
regulation after consultation with stakeholders.
<P>
	Another aspect of the act to amend the Patent Act should be 
mentioned here. Regulations were adopted that prevent the 
health protection branch of Health Canada from approving a 
generic product before the expiry of the Canadian patents on the 
brand name equivalent. These regulations have led to many 
lawsuits within the pharmaceutical industry and the volume of 
litigation arising from this provision is being reviewed.
<P>
	These are matters the House must take into consideration 
when dealing with the motion before us. It would not be 
appropriate to look at just one side of this very complex issue as 
the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden has done.
<P>
	I understand the Minister of Industry has met with 
representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. He is reviewing 
carefully the current drug policy and its effect on investments in 
Canada, job creation and drug prices. He will ensure that 
consumers are treated fairly.
<P>
	The challenge is to ensure that drug patent legislation 
supports the development of Canada's pharmaceutical industry 
while making patented drugs available to Canadian consumers 
at affordable prices.
<P>
	The government will not take the side of the pharmaceutical 
industry over the side of health care objectives. It will take all 
interests into consideration. That is what the government is 
committed to doing. It is what Canadians expect of us. The 
government is weighing very carefully the various issues at 
stake and acting upon its commitment to review the drug patent 
policy.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the next 
few minutes, I intend to share my comments and concerns about 
the motion tabled by the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden, 
who is asking the House to repeal the Patent Act Amendment 
Act passed by the House in 1993 and better known as C-91.
<P>
	I must tell you right away that I strongly oppose this motion 
and I will now explain to my hon. colleagues the reasons behind 
my position.
<P>
	To understand all the elements of this debate, we must go back 
to the past to see what the situation was like in Canada before 
Bill C-91 and its predecessor, C-22, were passed in 1993 and 
1987 respectively.
<P>
	In 1960, a royal inquiry commission found that drug prices in 
Canada were too high and recommended establishing a 
procedure to issue compulsory licences to import and sell 
patented pharmaceutical products. That is what Canada did in 
1969.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3682"> 3682 </A></B>
<P>
	This reform led to the creation of a number of pharmaceutical 
businesses which, after obtaining the compulsory licences, 
produced and sold generic drugs at lower prices than 
brand-name drugs. Although the purpose of the reform, namely 
to control and reduce drug prices, was achieved, it also had a 
very negative impact. Research in the Canadian pharmaceutical 
sector dropped dramatically.
<P>
	To promote research and the growth of the pharmaceutical 
industry, the federal government created the Eastman 
Commission in 1984. In its report made public the following 
year, the commission proposed a major reform which was 
approved by the government and led to C-22, an Act to amend 
the Patent Act.
<P>
	This reform had an ambitious goal: to stop the exodus of 
Canadian researchers to the U.S., convince pharmaceutical 
companies to invest more money in research, and put Canada 
back on the list of industrialized countries where high-tech 
medical research is done.
<P>
	Now that we know the background, we understand better the 
various elements and the reasons that led to this trench war still 
being fought between generic-drug manufacturers and 
innovative companies. After supporting the former for over 25 
years, the government lived up to the challenge of helping 
innovative and research companies while ensuring that drug 
prices remain under control.
<P>
	We can identify three real consequences of this reform. First, 
innovative companies made a public promise to increase 
significantly their investments in pharmaceutical research. 
These companies kept their word. So these two pieces of 
legislation resulted in the biggest research and development 
expansion program ever undertaken in the medical research 
sector in recent history.
<P>
	Before 1987, brand-name drug makers spent only 3.5 to 4.5 
per cent of their sales revenues on research and development 
activities. After C-22 was passed, the ratio of research and 
development spending increased to 6.1 per cent in 1988 and to 
9.7 per cent in 1991. The latest figures available, for 1993, show 
a ratio of 9.9 per cent.
<P>
	We see that investment on research and development has 
practically doubled since the two bills were passed, from less 
than $100 million to more than $400 million invested in medical 
research, within less than seven years.
<P>
	Just on this point, we can see that these two laws were a 
success, but we must hope that drug makers will continue and 
raise R and D spending to over 10 per cent of sales, to come 
closer to American innovative companies that invest 14.2 per 
cent in R and D and their British counterparts, who invest up to 
20 per cent.
<P>
	A second major consequence of this reform was to maintain 
the price of patented drugs. That was the biggest concern of 
opponents of C-22 and C-91. Even today, we see in this House 
that it is still this aspect that seems to give the greatest concern 
to opponents of this reform.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We must admit that drug prices account for much of the health 
spending of various governments. An aging population, greater 
consumption of health care and increasingly sophisticated 
research affect the kind and amount of drugs consumed and the 
funds allocated for drugs.
<P>
	To avoid sudden increases in patented drug prices, the prices 
review board was created with the mandate, which it still has, of 
ensuring that innovative companies do not jack up above their 
actual value the price of patented drugs leaving the factory. The 
board must therefore take into account the price of drugs sold in 
other countries, the price of other medication in the same 
therapeutic category and other factors to determine whether the 
drug price is excessive. The Minster of Industry and the 
provincial ministers have the right to intervene at the board's 
hearings.
<P>
	From 1987 to 1992, the price of patent drugs increased at an 
annual average rate of 2.9 per cent, compared to 4.2 per cent for 
the consumer price index. Since 1988, the price increase has 
remained lower for patent drugs than for drugs as a whole. We 
must therefore conclude that the Patented Medicine Prices 
Review Board, with the added power delegated to it by Bill 
C-91, was able to fulfil its role and prevent undue price 
increases for patent drugs.
<P>
	The third consequence of the reform is mainly the result of 
Bill C-91, which is the legislation we are now being asked to 
revoke. Yet, this consequence, which I would call global 
realignment, is absolutely normal and was unavoidable. In these 
days of trade liberalization and free trade zones, Canada must 
provide its industries and its economy with a legislative 
framework that will allow them to be competitive at the 
international level. The two acts were passed with that objective 
in mind.
<P>
	It is interesting to make a comparison with other 
industrialized countries. While, as a rule, patents for drugs are 
granted for 20 years, some countries have gone even farther by 
extending that 20-year period so as to absorb the marketing 
period, which can sometimes be up to ten or twelve years. This is 
the case with the EEC which, since June of 1992, may grant a 
five-year extension, depending on the length of the marketing 
period, so as to guarantee exclusivity to patent holders for 15 
years.
<P>
	Japan and Australia have also granted extensions of five and 
four years. It is in Canada's interest, given its limited market, to 
ensure that intellectual property laws are governed by GATT 
proposals. Indeed, the primary objective of Bill C-91 was to 
align the Canadian legislation on intellectual property of patent 
drugs with the laws and regulations in effect elsewhere in the 
world.

<P>
	The fact is that before Bill C-91 became law, Canada was the 
only industrialized country which did not treat drugs like any 
other invention. There is no doubt that in 1993, when it decided 
to abolish the compulsory licence program for pharmaceutical 
products and harmonize its policy on intellectual property with 
the rules governing its major competitors on the international 
scene, Canada gave itself one of the best tools to get the 
investments it needs.
<P>
	The motion asks us to repeal the 1993 act, better known as Bill 
C-91, to make patent drugs more affordable. Clearly, the 
provisions contained in the federal act can ensure the protection 
of consumers against price increases for prescription drugs, 
while at the same time promoting research and development, as 
well as the creation of highly skilled jobs.
<P>
	The protection provided by Canada to pharmaceutical patents 
before Bill C-91 became law kept product manufacturers from 
being competitive. While Canadian companies had a seven-year 
protection, their American and European competitors were 
being granted exclusivity for 14 years.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Canada and Quebec cannot overlook the favourable 
conditions offered by our foreign competitors.
<P>
	I think I have shown that Bill C-91 also provides an 
adjustment mechanism in this era of freer trade. This legislation 
enables Canada to adjust and to harmonize its laws and 
regulations with the international agreements to which it is a 
party. Bill C-91 was the outcome of a reform which has had 
positive and desirable consequences on the economy of Quebec 
and Canada, and this is why I firmly oppose this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is important today to put this whole debate 
into context. First of all, the hon. member moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider repealing 
the Patent Act Amendment Act, Chapter 2,-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is all very well but what will we replace it with? You 
know as well as I do how difficult if not utterly impossible it is to 
undo an omelet. This debate reminds me a little of the one we 
had on free trade a few years back. Even though I was one of 
those who voted against the free trade agreement then, I think it 
is impossible to go back, considering the investment decisions 
that have been made since. Going on with the free trade analogy, 
I think we should undoubtedly take into consideration, for 
example, the fact that plants that have closed in my riding 
because of free trade would not reopen if the agreement were 
cancelled. And those that opened since would surely close their 
doors. As you can see, when the eggs are broken, that's it! This is 
what I am trying to explain to this House.
<P>
	Today we are faced with almost the same situation. An hon. 
member tells us we should cancel a measure which was 
approved a year ago. And with what would we replace it? What 
is the point now that investment decisions have already been 
made? Will that lower the price of drugs? We do not know. There 
is no proof of that. Will that encourage other industries? 
Probably not. Will this make us lose investments which could or 
should have been announced? This is quite possible. The 
problem with that kind of motion is that it does not take into 
account the constant evolution of things. Situations change. 
Moreover, as parliamentarians, we must realize that the 
situation changes not only in our country but all over the world.
<P>
	I must say that, when we were debating Bill C-22 in this 
House seven years ago, I did not give much thought to the 
possibility that a GATT agreement would be signed in 
Marrakesh on April 15, 1994, and even less to the provisions of 
such an agreement. The same thing is true of Bill C-91.
<P>
	I come back to Bill C-91 because there is something 
important about it. A little earlier today, during Question 
Period, the hon. members opposite said, and that is the other 
extreme: How dare you say that there will be a review of Bill 
C-91? You do not have to be a lawyer from Baie-Comeau-to 
use one of my favourite expressions-to understand that under, 
section 14 of Bill C-91, the present Act, there must be such a 
review. It is not optional, it is compulsory, it is written into the 
law. And guess who voted in favour of that bill? The hon. 
members of the Bloc who where here during the previous 
Parliament. They never proposed any amendment to remove that 
provision from the bill. So I say to them: Do not get carried 
away.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Do not tell me that this legislation will never be reviewed. 
You voted for a bill that provided for such a review without 
proposing an amendment to delete this provision. I have here a 
copy of <I>Hansard</I> for December 10, 1992. I have looked at it 
carefully. No such amendment was moved by members of the 
Bloc in 1992.
<P>
	Members opposite, do not come and tell me that you are 
against a review of the act in 1997. If you do, you are a little late, 
like the rainbow. The rain has already fallen.
<P>
	So, the act provides for a review to be conducted no later than 
in 1997. That is reality. Since the members opposite voted for 
the bill without moving an amendment to delete this provision, 
we can assume that they were not against it.
<P>
	Of course, members of my party, including myself, proposed 
a series of amendments at the time. My amendments were 
rejected, but that is unimportant. It is water under the Perley 
Bridge, as they would say in Hawkesbury.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Bill C-91 became law and that law still exists 
today. It is unreasonable to suggest that we should repeal it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3684"> 3684 </A></B>
<P>
completely, as the hon. member for  Regina-Lumsden does in 
his motion, without offering any alternative to replace it.
<P>
	I wonder what the hon. member would do if, God forbid, we 
had to vote on this. It is almost like watching a dog running after 
a tire, and wondering what would happen if it caught it.
<P>
	Would he vote for it, knowing what the result would be the day 
after the vote? It is all very well to propose something, but one 
should always consider any proposal in the light of the following 
question: What will happen if it is agreed to? Because, should 
what he is proposing today get agreed to, the members opposite 
might face a deplorable situation.
<P>
	It is easier to propose something, knowing very well that it 
has no chance of getting agreed to, than to propose something 
that just might be agreed to by other members of the House. 
Fortunately, the chances of the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden being agreed to are almost nil. I 
think I have clearly shown why a little earlier.
<P>
	In 1992 we had a full debate here in this House of Commons 
on that piece of legislation. At that time, members of various 
political parties publicly stated their point of view on the bill, 
and then Parliament, in its wisdom, no matter whether I agree or 
not with what it did, passed the legislation, but with a provision 
for a review which must take place in or before 1997. This was 
provided for in subsections 14(1) and 14(2) of the bill. I am sure 
you remember this clause very well, Mr. Speaker. You must have 
read it very carefully yourself.
<P>
	Repealing this act today is not a solution to be considered, 
because it does not give us any assurance that prices would drop, 
that jobs would be created, or that research needed to find new 
drugs for various illnesses would be conducted.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know my 16-year-old daughter Julie, who is 
asthmatic. She must use a pump made by one of the large 
pharmaceutical companies based in Kirkland. Other similar 
products, albeit generic products, were recommended to her at 
one point. In her case, and I do not consider this trivial, the 
supposedly equivalent generic product did not prove to be 
effective. Her condition deteriorated. She leads a normal 
adolescent life, very active, but when she has a bronchitis 
attack, the situation is quite alarming at home. We must then 
immediately fetch one of these pumps. As expected, there is one 
pump in her school bag, and others scattered around the house. 
When we come across a pump that does not have a well known 
brand name, we avoid it, because we know the results, or rather, 
the lack of results that we can expect to have.
<P>
	Research is crucial. I say this personally, based on my own 
experience. The member's initiative does not guarantee any 
improvement, any research, and any reduction in prices. Again, 
when the eggs are broken, that's it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to discuss the motion introduced by my 
hon. colleague. Motion 167 allows us to discuss the possibility 
of repealing Bill C-91 which was passed during the 34th 
parliament.
<P>
	I believe that in all fairness to both the generic and to the 
brand name manufacturers we should hold off on this debate 
until such time is allowed to determine whether Bill C-91 has 
had a positive or a negative impact on research and development 
spending in Canada, employment and health care costs.
<P>
	In fact, it is already explicitly stated in sections 14(1) and 
14(2) of Bill C-91 that a review of this bill will be done in 1997. 
We should allow the Patent Medicine Price Review Board and 
the drug manufacturers time to adjust to this new legislation. 
However, I would like to make a few comments on the motion.
<P>
	First, I think that it would be useful to examine why we need 
patent protection in the pharmaceutical industry. Patent 
protection is crucial to this innovative sector. These companies 
require a certain amount of market exclusiveness guaranteed to 
them in the form of patents in order to recoup their research and 
development expenditures and finance the development of new 
products.
<P>
	I believe like other inventions pharmaceutical products are 
entitled to patent protection. Unlike other products, however, 
the pharmaceutical industry must undergo a strict regimen of 
tests and evaluations to determine a product's safety and 
efficiency before it can be sold commercially. This testing 
process is rigorous and time consuming, involving animal and 
clinical trials.
<P>
	Essentially Bill C-91 allows patent extensions to 
approximately three or four years. This extension still does not 
bring us in line with the rest of the world. In fact, the European 
Community averages 15 years, the U.S. 14, while Canada is at 
10. It is little wonder that Canada has also one of the lowest 
research and development spending levels compared with the 
rest of the developed world.
<P>
	Since 1987 when Bill C-22, the previous amendment to the 
Patent Act, was introduced R and D in Canada also increased. It 
was through Bill C-22 that multinational pharmaceutical 
manufacturers agreed to spend 10 per cent of Canadian sales in 
R and D in Canada. As a result R and D in Canada has increased 
approximately 250 per cent between 1988 and 1992. However, 
as mentioned earlier, it is too soon to determine just what impact 
Bill C-91 will have on the R and D spending in Canada in the 
long run.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3685"> 3685 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Yet I do know that since the passage of Bill C-91 the 
pharmaceutical industry has spent over $600 million in research 
and development in Canada. This is a large capital output which 
has been a benefit to all regions of Canada.
<P>
	Other key issues that must be considered are the mandate and 
powers of the Patented Medicine Price Review Board. This body 
was created under amendment to the Patent Act enacted in Bill 
C-22. The board was also amended in Bill C-91 during the last 
Parliament. The board is a quasi-judicial body which has the 
power to issue corrective orders when at the outcome of a 
hearing it is determined that the price of a patented drug sold in 
Canada was excessive. The board's jurisdiction extends to all 
patented medicines sold in Canada, whether they be prescription 
or non-prescription.
<P>
	The mandate of the board is threefold: first, to ensure that the 
factory gate prices of patent medicines charged by the drug 
companies are not excessive; second, to report annually on the 
activities and pricing trends in the pharmaceutical industry; and, 
third, to report annually on research and development 
expenditures by the patented medicine industry.
<P>
	The board's pricing guidelines ensure that no medicines 
exceed the international range regardless of the category in 
which the drug falls. These guidelines also ensure that price 
increases do not surge above the estimated consumer price 
index.
<P>
	Since the creation of the board the prices of patent medicines 
in Canada have increased on average less than the consumer 
price index per year. Prior to the establishment of the board 
prices of the patent medicines rose on the average twice that of 
the consumer price index.
<P>
	The principal amendments to the Patent Act brought about by 
Bill C-91 include new remedies for firms that charge excessive 
prices. These remedies include ordering price reductions, 
ordering a monetary payment in the amount of the excess 
revenues, and the extension of the patent life of patent 
medicines by approximately three years.
<P>
	With the adoption of Bill C-22 the pharmaceutical industries 
in Canada increase both their patent protection life and the 
amount of employees hired. In fact employment increased by 
almost 15 per cent from 1987 to 1991. Again I believe we should 
have had a longer time period in order to assess the impact Bill 
C-91 will have on the employment rate in the pharmaceutical 
industry.
<P>
	Another key area that must be examined is whether or not the 
extension of the patent life to 20 years has increased health care 
costs in Canada. Again the jury is still out. There has not been 
sufficient time to do a realistic study of the prices of medicines 
in Canada that relate directly to the patent life. Bill C-91 allows 
the board to be an effective control and watchdog that has  some 
real teeth to it, which ensures that drug prices do not become an 
albatross to the health care system.
<P>
	According to the executive director of the Newfoundland 
Hospital and Nursing Home Association, the boards have 
brought the pricing back down and companies have made large 
settlements. The Drug Prices Review Board seems to have done 
some very positive things which have brought companies into 
line.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier the board has a new mandate which is 
ensuring that those manufacturers that wish to break the pricing 
standards will be financially accountable.
<P>
	If we look at the total costs of health care the pharmaceutical 
industry's portion of these costs is approximately 2 per cent of 
health care expenditure in Canada. Therefore I am not overly 
convinced that allowing these companies an extension in patent 
longevity is the driving force behind our increasing health care 
costs.
<P>
	A comparison between the generic industry in Canada and the 
United States illustrates a few interesting points. There are two 
Canadian companies that control 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the 
generic market in Canada and their prices average 60 per cent to 
80 per cent of the brand name product. In the U.S. there are 200 
to 300 companies that compete in the marketplace and the prices 
of the generic manufacturing there average 25 per cent to 35 per 
cent of the brand name product.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I must state we are premature in discussing the pros and cons 
of Bill C-91 because it has not been enacted long enough to 
make a well informed, unbiased decision. I would think we 
would be better suited to discuss this issue in the future, 
allowing both generic and brand name manufacturers to have 
sufficient time to make changes and work within the new bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1) the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 13, I asked 
a question to the Minister of Human Resources Development 
concerning the new apprenticeship program for young people 
which, as you know, is now called ``Young Apprentices''. 
Unfortunately, my question was not answered satisfactorily.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3686"> 3686 </A></B>
<P>
	What I was asking the minister was to commit himself to give 
Quebec its fair share of the program funds so that it could invest 
them according to its own needs and priorities.
<P>
	Instead of answering my question, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development criticized some figures that I had not 
even mentioned in terms of vocational training. Vocational 
training is a provincial responsibility. The next day 
representatives from both the Parti Quebecois and the Liberal 
Party of Quebec in the National Assembly unanimously passed a 
motion asking the federal government to withdraw from 
vocational training.
<P>
	Quebec was not the only one to make this request to the 
minister. At least three other provinces also expressed their 
reservations to the minister, which seemingly caused the 
cancellation of the federal-provincial conference that was 
expected for the next Monday.
<P>
	Since then, the minister has continued to go forward 
unilaterally with this ``Young Apprentices'' Program, despite 
the fact that vocational training is, and I repeat it, the exclusive 
responsibility of the provinces.
<P>
	Using federal spending power, with about 24 per cent of tax 
revenues coming from Quebec, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development admitted yesterday before a 
parliamentary committee that he used funds formerly allocated 
to community agencies to partly finance his new programs. For 
the benefit of Quebecers, I may point out that these programs are 
commonly referred to as direct employment programs.
<P>
	I think it is highly improper to divert funds allocated to 
agencies that focus on local community development, in order 
to finance a new intrusion into a field of provincial jurisdiction. 
Hundreds of community agencies are now waiting for a reply 
from the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	They talk about new models and new programs but never 
about new budget envelopes. They just recycle and fiddle with 
the existing envelopes for community agencies.
<P>
	Does the minister really think he can fool us? When will the 
federal government finally understand that it is now time to 
reduce duplication, get rid of bureaucratic fat, encourage 
consultation on program financing and respect provincial 
jurisdictions such as education and job training?
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister finally understand that we can save more 
than $300 million if he stops the duplication in the field of job 
training and if he gives the Government of Quebec the money he 
intends to spend in this area?
<P>
	Finally, will the minister show some common sense and abide 
by the unanimous resolution of the Quebec National Assembly 
on job training and the various programs for young people 
recently announced by the minister?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by saying that in the 
government's recent announcement of the youth employment 
and learning strategy we stated that we would work in close 
collaboration with all the provinces in the implementation of the 
approaches and specific programs for young Canadians. In 
saying this the government is committed to assisting Canada's 
youth through programs that complement those offered by the 
provinces.
<P>
	Quebec has a very different apprenticeship program from 
those in all other provinces. In Quebec those who wish to learn a 
trade attend a CEGEP for two or three years and then seek out an 
employer. In other provinces a person who wants to learn an 
apprenticeship trade must find an employer who is willing to 
employ and to train him or her. As a result Quebec does not 
require nearly as many funds for apprenticeship as do other 
provinces. Therefore funds are allocated where they are most 
needed, such as for the forms of vocational training offered at 
CEGEPs.
<P>
	In addition Quebec still receives more than its fair share for 
the province's youth through regular employment programs and 
services, as well as through special current initiatives such as 
the joint management of co-operative education and project 
based training courses which are jointly delivered with the 
SQDM.
<P>
	We will continue to work with the province of Quebec to set 
priorities for our youth programs and, where possible, we will 
harmonize our programs with those of the province of Quebec.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HYUNDAIPLANTINBROMONT">HYUNDAI PLANT IN BROMONT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the Minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development-Quebec and it concerns the 
status of the Hyundai automobile plant in Bromont.
<P>
	As the minister already knows, more than 850 workers lost 
their jobs when the plant closed. On March 23 last, I put a 
question to the minister asking him if he could provide any 
information to the residents of Brome-Missisquoi as to how 
the government planned to handle this matter. At the time, the 
Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec informed us that he wanted to work 
closely with the Quebec government in an effort to find a way of 
reopening this plant located in my riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3687"> 3687 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, nearly one month after putting this question to the 
minister, I am again asking him for a status report on the efforts 
made thus far to bring this matter to a happy resolution.
<P>
	For over a month now, all kinds of rumours have been making 
the rounds about the possible reopening of the Hyundai plant. It 
has been rumoured that work will resume either in 1998, in the 
year 2000 or in the year 2002, that the plant will close 
permanently, that other companies have agreed to buy the 
building. And I could go on. Furthermore, the employees 
received very little severance pay from the company.
<P>
	You will agree with me that the situation is already quite 
difficult and that it is essential for the Hyundai workers, their 
families and those around them, as well as for all the taxpayers 
of Brome-Missisquoi, that we avoid creating still more 
confusion on this issue.
<P>
	It is time for the Minister responsible for the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec to tell this House what he has 
done and what he intends to do so that the Bromont plant can 
reopen to make cars or any other product that would put back to 
work the 850 workers who are waiting to use their talents and 
dedication.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin 
by expressing once again the great disappointment felt by the 
government following the decision of Hyundai Canada to delay 
the reopening of the Bromont plant indefinitely.
<P>
	We are well aware that a definite closing of this facility would 
be an immense loss not only for the eastern townships but indeed 
for all of Quebec. I would like to state today, however, that we do 
not regard this as a dead issue and we are not going to sit back 
and resign ourselves to our fate.
<P>
	We have therefore undertaken consultations with the Quebec 
government in the hope of finding a solution to this problem. I 
would like to add that during a recent visit to South Korea in 
early April the Minister for International Trade had an 
opportunity to speak to the chief executive officer of the 
Hyundai group, Mr. Chung, as well as the chairman of the board 
of Hyundai Motor, the parent company of Hyundai Canada, a 
gentleman by the name of Mr. Chong.
<P>
	Both of these gentlemen, I stress, clearly indicated their firm 
intention of reopening the Bromont plant for the assembly of a 
competitive vehicle which could carve out a place for itself in 
the automotive market.
<P>
	Hyundai's directors have mentioned that they intend to 
submit a business plan in the fall of 1994. We will examine this 
document carefully. We will go over it a second time with the 
Quebec government. The results of this examination will 
determine the type of support we  will give to Hyundai to carry 
out its plans and reopen the Bromont plant.
<P>
	Our government is committed to setting the economy of this 
country back on the road to prosperity. Our actions are an 
integral part of our desire to provide all Canadians with 
productive and well paid jobs like those in the automotive 
industry.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
April 22 I raised with the Minister for International Trade a 
question concerning the recent decision by the U.S. government 
which affected Canadian exports of durum wheat.
<P>
	What happened at that time is that the American farm lobby 
pressured the U.S. government, the U.S. trade representative 
and the President to initiate some anti-dumping regulations and 
penalties according to the GATT agreement.
<P>
	What this has done is really create an air of uncertainty for 
Canadian farmers, in particular farmers I represent in the 
province of Saskatchewan. The problem we have with this is that 
the Americans in every election year seemed to initiate a 
number of anti-dumping and countervailing actions on our 
Canadian exports.
<P>
	This is a very serious concern because it seems that we signed 
the free trade agreements in 1988 and NAFTA in 1993. We 
signed last week the GATT agreements to facilitate freer trade, 
competitive trade between nations, particularly between Canada 
and the U.S.
<P>
	Since these agreements have been signed we tend to have all 
of these actions, which are extremely difficult for many of our 
producers, particularly the grain producers in western Canada 
and in other parts of the country when they have a very good 
market. They have a very good product and they are very 
competitive in terms of their product. It is not subsidized to any 
great extent. It is an action of fair trade.
<P>
	I was not totally pleased with the response I received during 
question period. It was very short. What I wanted to do is give an 
overview of my experience in Washington last week. I met with 
a number of U.S. congressmen to discuss trade issues as well as 
with the U.S. trade representative and other people.
<P>
	What I concluded from all this is that in private the U.S. 
congressmen understand the issue of durum wheat imports into 
the U.S. They understand the complexities of trade and the 
commonalties between the U.S. and Canada. In many ways they 
are aware of the very important fact that Canada is the U.S.' 
major trading partner and vice versa.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3688"> 3688 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Privately they are very consoling and they are saying do not 
worry about these things, they are pretty important to the 
farmers they represent but it is election year.
<P>
	This is the point. We have all of the Congress of 435 
representatives, congressmen, running for re-election this fall. 
We have 34 of the hundred senators running for re-election in 
the U.S. this fall. It seems that every two years, which is a very 
gruelling schedule for elections, the U.S. has a large number of 
these anti-dumping and countervailing actions taken upon 
Canada. It is not only Canada, it always means to target other 
countries like Brazil and Europe and South America and some of 
the Pacific rim countries, but it always includes Canada because 
it is really politically astute for it.
<P>
	My question at this time is the same except I would like a little 
more information from the government. Can we have this 
government's assurance that it is going to protect Canadian 
farmers' interests and not cave in to this American pre-election 
posturing?
<P>
	What I am looking for in specific terms is what is our week by 
week, month by month response to this action, which I classify 
as an unfriendly action on our country, to the Americans and to 
some of the businesses that are based in America that do 
business with Canada?
<P>
	Can the hon. member give us a precise overview on what that 
might be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> In the brief time available to me, 
Mr. Speaker, I think I can help the member.
<P>
	This is certainly an issue that has top priority with the 
government. It is an issue that has been raised at the highest 
level and that is between our Prime Minister and the President of 
the United States. The minister of agriculture, the Minister for 
International Trade and the government have the intention and 
the will to stand firm and hard in order to conclude an agreement 
which will respect the interests of the Canadian agricultural 
industry.
<P>
	Specifically our object in these negotiations is to reach a deal 
that will protect Canada's access to the United States and which 
provides certainty and predictability for our agricultural and 
agri-food producers.
<P>
	As the minister of agriculture has stated many times, there can 
be no deal unless it is a good deal for Canada. This means a good 
deal for the grains, food processing and supply managed sectors.
<P>
	With respect to grains, we know that on April 22, last Friday, 
the United States notified the GATT of its intention to 
renegotiate tariffs on Canadian wheat and barley under GATT 
article XXVIII. By notifying us this did not shut the border. 
Negotiations can continue for 90 days, and if at the end of that 
90-day period the United States is determined and takes a 
unilateral action we will  retaliate in kind. We will protect and 
we will defend the interests of Canada and the Canadian 
producers.
<P>
	We trade fairly with the United States. Our success there has 
been because of our high quality and because of a shortage there; 
a shortage there that has been mainly created by its export 
enhancement program which has taken products out of the 
United States in order to take advantage of its huge export 
subsidies.
<P>
	Throughout these negotiations which began in December we 
have consulted closely with the industry and the provincial 
governments on a very high level. We will continue to do that 
because we know that the bilateral trade between Canada and the 
United States of $11.5 billion is important. We are committed to 
ensuring that this trade continues to grow for the advantage and 
for the future positive effects and mutual benefits to both 
countries.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I put 
my question to the Minister of Finance and Minister responsible 
for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec.
<P>
	It pertains to <I>Opération Dignité II</I>. Representatives from this 
organization came to Ottawa to raise awareness among 
government members, because they felt their message was not 
getting through. They are from rural areas. I do not understand. 
Governments change, we had the Conservatives, and now the 
Liberals who were here also before the Conservatives, but the 
rural areas are more and more dependant on UI and welfare.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Now, unemployment insurance is being cut. Years ago, the 
Eastern Quebec Development Bureau spent millions of dollars 
to close small parishes. Instead of creating employment they 
went out of their way to close villages. Fortunately some people 
in those places took things into their own hands. There was the 
first Operation Dignity, the <I>Ralliement populaire</I>-a citizens' 
coalition, and the creation of corporations to pool woodlots, the 
pooling of resources by land owners.
<P>
	There were many demonstrations in the streets under the 
banner of the <I>Ralliement populaire</I> and we were able to get a 
plant, Panval de Sébec. People managed to keep open the parish 
of Sainte-Paule which was scheduled to close. I invite you, Mr. 
Speaker, as well as the minister of regional development, to 
come and visit this parish which took hold of its own destiny.
<P>
	Other municipalities did the same thing. But governments do 
not seem to have any political will, they seem to be trying to turn 
the Gaspé Peninsula into a huge park. It is harder for us to get a 
bit of money for a slaughterhouse than it is for Hibernia to get 
billions. And all this money might not be bring a good return on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3689"> 3689 </A></B>
<P>
investment, while a few dollars for a slaughterhouse in our area 
would make sure that our beef would stay in our  region, instead 
of going to Montreal or Toronto on the hoof and coming back as 
meat.
<P>
	What was done over the last twenty years? Millions are spent 
on unemployment while we are just asking for a few thousand, a 
few million maybe, to produce finished products, but we are 
being refused. That is the reason why I was not at all satisfied 
with the minister's answer. I have this second chance, and I am 
sure that the parliamentary secretary will give me his vision of 
rural life. The minister promised he would come to my riding 
next summer. He said so on the 17th, when I invited him to come 
and talk to the residents of the Gaspé Peninsula.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying to the 
member that I cannot speak on the minister's coming to his 
riding but one day I would love to visit his riding and I hope that 
one day he will come and visit my riding in downtown Toronto.
<P>
	To the member I want to say that even though he looks after 
his people in a rural setting and I am in a downtown setting we 
both share and care in the same way. What the government is 
trying to do is take a number of steps that hopefully will put 
people back to work.
<P>
	We are not just reforming the unemployment insurance 
system. We are also trying to urge the financial institutions and 
the banks of Canada to be more generous in their attitude toward 
small and medium size businesses, the businesses that the 
member described in his riding. With the support of his 
colleagues in committee we are beginning to have some success 
in that area. We are trying with our infrastructure program to get 
some activity stimulated in the member's community and 
throughout all of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	We are also trying to the best of our ability to reform the tax 
system in the finance committee. There are a number of things 
we are trying to do. We know that there is a great sense of 
urgency and we are doing our best to move these projects 
forward.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, the member's riding will get the 
same attention and the same care as any other riding of any other 
member in this House.
<P>
	On behalf of the minister I want to say that we do care about 
the pain that the member's constituents are experiencing and we 
are going to do our best to make sure that some of that pain can 
be relieved in the not too distant future.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEFENCEINDUSTRY">DEFENCE INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two weeks ago, I asked a question of the Minister of 
Industry who, very casually, did not bother answering it. And 
yet, I was asking him a very important question regarding the 
conversion of defence industries to civilian production.
<P>
	As you know, for the last three years, due to the international 
situation and defense budget cuts, the industries involved with 
defense production, 60 per cent of which are located in Quebec, 
have been going through horrendous times.
<P>
	So much so that 10,000-Mr. Speaker, you heard right, I see 
worry on your face-jobs were lost in the military sector and it 
is the reason why I had asked the minister to highlight the 
concrete measures his government intends to take to remedy this 
disastrous situation.
<P>
	I was flabbergasted when I realized that all he did was skate 
around the issue. The minister, whom I thought was an earnest 
man, could not tell us anything in spite of the promises made by 
his government during the election campaign. They are in the 
red book which has know become a black book for Canadians.
<P>
	This government must give us its agenda and assist these 
industries. There are 600 in Quebec, 30 of them in jeopardy for 
lack of orders. And yet they have plans, and they know how to go 
about this long-awaited diversification.
<P>
	Allow me to quote the great Quebec specialist in the area of 
conversion strategies, Professor Yves Bélanger who made a 
statement confirming my own conviction in the <I>Le Soleil</I> on 
April 16. He said the defence industry is not lacking in 
diversification ideas, especially given the fact that it gathered 
the greatest concentration of specialists attracted there by good 
salaries and research conditions.
<P>
	And Professor Bélanger concluded that we must act quickly 
and adequately since recent experiences show that it takes from 
five to seven years to convert half a company's capacity from 
military to civilian production. We will necessarily lose some 
very important players along the way if the government does not 
act swiftly.
<P>
	One wonders why the government does nothing; it certainly 
has the proper tool for it, namely the Defence Industry 
Productivity Program under the management of minister 
Manley and his department. It is the perfect instrument, the 
ideal vehicle for the implementation of a conversion program.
<P>
	How come the minister has not found the vim to propose a 
schedule, and a concrete plan for addressing that problem which 
weighs heavily upon that important industrial sector?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3690"> 3690 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have here a man who is demoralized by this 
negligence on the part of the government, but I want you to know 
that the fight will not end for us until the government presents a 
concrete program or schedule. It can be sure that we will 
continue to fight relentlessly as long as the government will not 
have produced a real program including a schedule.
<P>
	The stakes are too high for Quebec for us to allow the 
government to fail to produce a work schedule by the end of the 
session. We challenge it to act on this, Mr. Speaker, and you can 
be sure that we will be watching it closely and urging it to 
exercise great caution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by saying how disappointed I 
am that the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve does not 
appreciate the British humour of the Minister of Industry. This 
is something we on this side of the House are all quite proud of.
<P>
	I want to tell the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that 
we are committed to carrying out our promise to assist defence 
industries in transition from high technology military 
production to high technology civilian production.
<P>
	The member knows, because this member is educated and he 
is very close to these issues, that this is not like buying a can of 
soup, putting it in a microwave and 20 seconds later it is ready to 
eat. This is a very complex issue. The exercise of converting 
these defence industries into industries that are going to be 
viable in peacetime is very complex.
<P>
	The member should know that we are committed and we are 
working with several organizations, especially in Quebec. As he 
knows, in the February budget the DIPP program was explicitly 
targeted for redesign and we are working with many companies 
such as Oerlikon and Paramax, so I would ask the member to 
please bear with us.
<P>
	I think by the time we return from China along with the 
member and 100 small and medium-sized businessmen from all 
over Canada who are going there with us, there will be even 
more action on the DIPP conversion program.
<P>

Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to
