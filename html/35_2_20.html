	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend Part XXIV 
of the Criminal Code-Dangerous Offenders-to provide:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. that where an offender is convicted of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) a sexual offence involving a child, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) an offence set out in</BLOCKQUOTE>
(<I>i</I>) section 271 (sexual assault) that has been proceeded with by way of 
indictment,
<P>
(<I>ii</I>) section 272 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or 
causing bodily harm), or
<P>
(<I>iii</I>) section 273 (aggravated sexual assault),
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>or an attempt to commit any of these offences, the offender shall, before being 
sentenced, be examined by two psychiatrists to determine</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) in the case of sexual offence involving a child, whether the offender is likely 
to commit or attempt to commit such an offence in the future, and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) in the case of an offence referred to in section 271 that has been proceeded 
with by way of indictment, or section 272 or 273, whether the offender is likely 
to cause or attempt to cause death, injury or serious psychological harm to 
another person through a failure in the future to control his or her sexual 
impulses; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. that where the psychiatrists conclude</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) in the case of a sexual offence involving a child, that the offender is likely to 
commit or attempt to commit such an offence in the future, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) in the case of an offence mentioned in section 271 that has been proceeded 
with by way of indictment, or section 272 or 273, that the offender is likely to 
cause or attempt to cause death, injury or serious psychological harm to another 
person through a failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the Attorney General of the province in which the offender was tried shall 
direct that an application be brought to have the offender declared a 
dangerous offender.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the safety of all 
Canadians. M-116 is a motion to amend part XXIV of the Criminal 
Code regarding dangerous offenders.
<P>
	The motion is a culmination of an effort by my colleague the 
hon. member for Calgary Southeast and myself, to find a way to 
protect Canadians from sexual predators. This motion will make 
Canadians safer in their homes and in their streets.
<P>
	With this motion an individual convicted of a serious sexual 
assault against an adult or any sexual offence where the victim is a 
child must be examined by two psychiatrists. If the two 
psychiatrists conclude that the convicted offender is likely to 
reoffend, the attorney general must direct that a dangerous offender 
application be initiated. The convicted offender would then 
proceed to a dangerous offender hearing. The offender would be 
declared a dangerous offender if the crown proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the offender was likely to reoffend.
<P>
	There is nothing draconian about this motion by any stretch of 
the imagination. This motion would only apply to individuals 
convicted of serious offences. By having a convicted offender 
reviewed by psychiatrists, we are providing the crown and the 
courts with the most comprehensive information possible about the 
likelihood of this offender reoffending. There is nothing arbitrary 
or unconstitutional about this. The motion respects accepted 
judicial practice while protecting Canadians against dangerous 
offenders. What this motion would do is perhaps identify a Paul 
Bernardo, a Clifford Olson, a Fernand Auger or a Mitchell Owen 
after they had committed their first sexual offence.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Auger is the man who kidnapped, assaulted and murdered 
Melanie Carpenter. I have already introduced a petition to the 
House from the Melanie Carpenter campaign. Over half a million 
people signed this petition calling on Parliament to enact 
legislation to keep dangerous offenders, especially dangerous sex 
offenders, off our streets.
<P>
	What is particularly disturbing about Auger's murder of Melanie 
Carpenter is that it could have been prevented. Almost 10 years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1136"> 1136 </A></B>
<P>
before Auger killed Melanie,  he was convicted of two brutal 
sexual assaults on teenage prostitutes. Because the victims were 
prostitutes, Auger only got a sentence of two years less a day.
<P>
	It was not until some five years later, after being convicted on a 
robbery charge and receiving a federal sentence, that Auger was 
closely observed by psychiatric professionals. Once they had an 
opportunity to assess Auger, they realized that they had a walking 
time bomb on their hands but under our current laws he had to be 
released. As a result Melanie Carpenter is dead. If Auger had 
instead been assessed by professionals after his sexual assault 
convictions of the two teenage prostitutes, maybe the courts and 
corrections would have known what they were dealing with: a 
dangerous offender.
<P>
	This motion is a response to the demands of Canadians who are 
fed up with the failure of our justice system to protect women and 
children. We are not suggesting that we should randomly lock 
people up. We are talking about convicted sexual predators.
<P>
	Another example is Mitchell Owen, the man who murdered 16 
year old Pamela Cameron in October 1994 just two blocks from my 
constituency office. Owen had previously been incarcerated for the 
brutal sexual assault of a female in an underground parking lot. 
When he was sentenced the judge called him a walking time bomb. 
When he was released Corrections Canada advised that he was at 
high risk to reoffend. Would Pamela Cameron still be alive today 
had the contents of this motion already been in place?
<P>
	What about Clifford Olson? Here is a man who had a lengthy 
criminal record before his murderous rampage which left 11 
Canadian children dead.
<P>
	It is time for the justice system to consider the seriousness of 
sexual assault and realize that this type of behaviour is a clear 
indicator of a pattern of future violence. We are not trying to lock 
people up and throw away the key. A dangerous offender 
designation simply means that an offender is kept in custody until 
the parole board is convinced that the offender does not pose a 
serious threat to society. Parole eligibility would be after three 
years and then every two years. If rehabilitation and treatment were 
successful, the offender would not be incarcerated forever.
<P>
	Motion M-116 would increase the odds that we would capture 
those offenders who pose a serious threat to the safety of every 
Canadian should they be released prematurely. This motion ensures 
that the correctional system is not pressured to release offenders 
who show no potential for rehabilitation.
<P>
	Motion M-116 meets the Reform Party's objective of ensuring 
public safety. I would expect the motion to receive considerable 
support by all the parties in this House who are concerned with the 
safety of Canadians.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois justice critic has frequently expressed her 
concern for the safety of women and  children. I hope she is as 
concerned with protecting them from sexual predators as she is in 
protecting them from firearms.
<P>
	I must admit that when we debated this motion on December 13 
last year, I was very surprised by some of the comments from the 
government side. It seems the government member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth does not see the need for this motion 
because he ``cannot accept that a Paul Bernardo necessarily will 
offend again''. I found these comments from the government side 
to be shocking. I am not sure what could possibly make the 
member utter a comment like this. I am certain that Canadians are 
relieved he is not sitting on the National Parole Board. I doubt there 
are many Canadians who believe Paul Bernardo should ever be 
released because the member for Hamilton-Wentworth believes 
that he may not reoffend.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Then we have the comments of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands who criticized me and the Reform Party for our obsession 
with law and order issues. I do not apologize for my so-called 
obsession with crime prevention and the protection of Canadians. 
Perhaps if some of the government members were obsessed with 
law and order issues, they would be more willing to support 
motions such as this to protect Canadians against sexual predators.
<P>
	In its red book the Liberal government devoted an entire section 
to safe homes, safe streets. It surprises me that the government 
would not wholeheartedly support Motion M-116 which is 
designed to protect Canadians and to ensure their homes and streets 
are safe. In fact, we are actually helping the government to keep its 
own red book promises.
<P>
	On page 84 of the red book the Liberal government claims: 
``Dealing with the growing incidents of violent crime will be a 
priority for a Liberal government''. According to the red book: 
``Every person has a right to personal security and a Liberal 
government will move to protect that right''. Also on page 84 of the 
red book, the government claims to be particularly concerned with 
protecting women and children against violence. This motion 
would help the government fulfil its own promise. Motion M-116 
specifically targets sexual predators and pedophiles.
<P>
	Given this, I do not see any reason why the government would 
not strongly support this motion. Once again this government plays 
partisan games rather than putting the interest and safety of 
Canadians as a priority.
<P>
	Unlike some of his colleagues, the Minister of Justice did 
express concern about the situation of dangerous offenders in our 
communities. According to the minister, the government is in 
agreement with the objectives of this motion. The minister 
indicated by his comments on  this motion that the government 
recognizes there is a problem with dangerous offenders being 
released and possibly reoffending. He said that the courts may 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1137"> 1137 </A></B>
<P>
indeed need extended powers to deal with these cases in order to 
protect the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	I am pleased to see the minister at least recognizes that 
Parliament needs to enact legislation to protect Canadians against 
sexual predators. Given that the minister recognizes the need to 
protect Canadians against violence, we would expect the 
government to be eager to support this motion.
<P>
	Motion M-116 will prevent tragedies where sexual predators 
reoffend. If this motion were adopted, perhaps Melanie Carpenter 
and Pamela Cameron would still be alive today.
<P>
	Motion M-116 reflects the view of the over half a million 
individuals who signed the Melanie Carpenter Society petition and 
the hundreds of thousands of Canadians supporting the Peace and 
Justice for Canadians Association. They believe as I do that 
dangerous sex offenders and pedophiles belong behind bars and not 
on our streets until such a time as they will no longer pose a risk to 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Canadians have had it with our judicial system which fails to 
protect Canadians against sexual predators. Motion M-116 would 
be a start in reforming our justice system to recognize the rights of 
women and children to the protection they deserve by the judicial 
system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion by the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley is a reflection of the Reformers' reactionary mentality 
since their first day in this House. The motion we are examining 
today would force the government to amend the Criminal Code so 
as to declare all individuals convicted of sexual assault dangerous 
offenders.
<P>
	Such an amendment would, to all intents and purposes, eliminate 
all crown discretion. It would oblige the attorney general of the 
province in which the offender was tried to direct that an 
application be brought, each time there was a conviction, to have 
the offender declared a dangerous offender. This obligation would 
arise each time two psychiatrists concluded that there was a 
likelihood of re-offending. What the hon. member is proposing 
amounts to letting psychiatrists usurp the roles of the prosecutor 
and of the judge. This is tantamount to turning the justice system 
totally upside down.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	It is clear in the hon. member's mind that the way to eradicate 
the problem of violence in Canada is to overload our courts and 
crowd our penitentiaries. The third party is never one to propose 
anything innovative,  nor anything with a potential for consensus 
among the members.
<P>
	The Reform Party persists in clouding the issue by fiddling with 
crime statistics in order to justify their ill-advised interventions. 
Where the law is concerned, these hypocrites claim to be defending 
victims' rights, but in reality they are making political hay at the 
expense of the sufferings of victims of crime. Like Don Quixote 
jousting with windmills, these extreme rightwingers will do 
anything to get attention. As I said last week, demagogy has no 
place in criminal law.
<P>
	I wonder: what is the justification for such a motion? Has there 
been a sudden sharp upswing in violent crime? No, on the contrary. 
The latest statistics available indicate the crime rate dropped by 5 
per cent during 1994, the third year in a row that it has gone down.
<P>
	In 1994 as well, the figures for violent crime were down 3 per 
cent, the greatest annual drop since 1962. In fact, without 
exception, all categories of violent crime were down in 1994.
<P>
	There was a 10 per cent drop in sexual assaults, regardless of 
type. The homicide rate was the lowest recorded in the past 25 
years. The combined total of homicides and attempted murders 
continued to account for less than one per cent of violent crimes.
<P>
	In the light of these statistics, we cannot help but wonder about 
the seriousness of the member's motion. The existing procedure for 
declaring an offender dangerous works very well. I am not alone in 
saying so; it is the opinion of all the provincial and the federal 
attorneys general.
<P>
	But what about the existing procedure? Section 753 of the 
Criminal Code allows the courts to declare an individual found 
guilty of a serious personal injury offence or a sexual offence a 
dangerous offender.
<P>
	Once the accused is found guilty of one of the offences in section 
752, the court hears the evidence by the crown and bases its 
decision on the following: demonstration of the offender's inability 
to restrain his behaviour; a substantial indifference on the part of 
the offender respecting the consequences of his acts and the 
behaviour of the offender associated with the offence is so brutal 
that normal standards of behavioral restraint would be insufficient.
<P>
	The court gives its decision following conviction, but before 
sentencing. The court declares the offender dangerous and then 
imposes a sentence of detention for an indeterminate period in lieu 
of any other sentence. This is one of the harshest sentences a court 
can impose, as the offender is not automatically entitled to parole. 
An individual's file is then reviewed three years after conviction 
and every two years thereafter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1138"> 1138 </A></B>
<P>
	In practice it is merely a pro forma review, since, only in very 
rare instances do the case management officers of the National 
Parole Board not recommend continued detention.
<P>
	My colleague has already proposed a bill whereby the whole 
legal proceeding would be repeated just prior to the conclusion of 
an individual's sentence. Clearly, the least we can say is that she is 
single-minded. The only question this motion raises is that of 
relevance.
<P>
	The hon. member acknowledged herself in the House that her 
earlier bill applied to very few individuals. The problem posed by 
repeat offenders is much greater and requires solutions much 
broader than those proposed by my colleague.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member puts excessive emphasis on isolated cases 
when she claims that her motion would be the solution to this kind 
of problem. The fact is that her motion proposes impractical 
solutions and targets dangerous offenders who represent only 0.5 
per cent of Canada's current inmate population in federal 
penitentiaries.
<P>
	By the way, in 1994, Quebec only had one dangerous offender. A 
second one was just added to the list. The vast majority of inmates 
considered to be dangerous offenders are in Ontario and in western 
Canada. From 1985 to 1994, only one dangerous offender was 
paroled every year. That number always remained constant.
<P>
	The difference between Quebec and the other provinces is easy 
to explain. For several years now, Quebec has had an effective 
medicolegal system in place to deal with court referrals, including 
dangerous offenders. The system works well and people suffering 
from mental disorders get adequate psychiatric treatment. All in 
all, the Quebec initiative is a proven solution to the problems 
experienced in the rest of Canada, and other provinces should have 
the wisdom to follow our example.
<P>
	The current situation certainly does not justify an intervention as 
drastic as the one proposed by the hon. member. Moreover, the 
proposed reactionary measures are uncalled-for, because the courts 
already have effective tools to decide whether an offender should 
be declared dangerous. A judicious application of the Criminal 
Code would greatly alleviate the problem.
<P>
	It is not enough to merely react to public opinion fuelled by 
gutter papers trying to improve their sales. Nor is it enough to 
target a very small number of individuals. The government must, in 
co-operation with the provinces, have a comprehensive approach to 
detect repeat offenders and ensure that society is better protected. 
The Quebec model should be followed.
<P>
	One step was taken with the federal, provincial and territorial 
task force on violent high-risk offenders. The  hon. member should 
carefully read the report released last year. She will find interesting 
suggestions and, more importantly, a more realistic picture of the 
current situation.
<P>
	It goes without saying that, unfortunately, I will not support her 
motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. M-116 is identical to motion numbered M-461 debated 
during the last session. It did not win approval of the House. I note 
that the hon. member keeps trying on this subject.
<P>
	At the outset, I do not believe that the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has thought this idea 
through, either in terms of its legal impact or its practicalities. Let 
us be clear on exactly what this amendment to the Criminal Code 
would require if it were approved.
<P>
	First, every criminal who is convicted of a serious sexual 
offence, namely sexual assault under sections 271, 272 and 273 of 
the code would have to be examined by two psychiatrists in order 
that the risk of reoffending be determined. If they conclude that the 
risk is high, then a dangerous offender application would, of 
necessity, have to be launched. There would be no discretion on the 
part of the judge and certainly not on the part of the crown 
prosecutor.
<P>
	Under the present system, the judge considers relevant 
information about the offender's criminal history and the mental 
state of the offender at the time of the offence. This usually takes 
the form of a formal pre-sentence report. Of course the perspective 
of the victim is considered.
<P>
	In other words, in a normal case a whole range of information is 
taken into account in order to determine the appropriate sentence. 
If this motion were to be adopted, every convicted sex offender 
would be remanded to a psychiatric facility for a thorough 
examination by two psychiatrists. These psychiatrists could give a 
precise prediction of the risk presented by every criminal.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Under current law the crown attorney and the judge are the 
authorities who decide whether to seek the opinion of psychiatrists 
on the danger posed by a convicted person. It is not the other way 
around. The psychiatrists do not tell the officers of the court 
whether to proceed with a dangerous offender application.
<P>
	There is good reason for giving the crown and judges the 
discretion to seek a detailed psychiatric examination of the 
offender and to initiate a dangerous offender application. It is 
because the dangerous offender process is essentially and primarily 
a legal one, it is not just a question of psychiatric prediction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1139"> 1139 </A></B>
<P>
	The crown attorney has to decide whether the dangerous 
offender application will meet the legal standards set out in part 
XXIV of the Criminal Code. For example, section 753 of the code 
requires the crown to show that the offender ``by his conduct in 
any sexual matter, including that involved in the commission of 
the offence for which he has been convicted,'' has shown a failure 
to control his sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing serious 
injury in the future.
<P>
	This is a legal test, as the courts have repeatedly pointed out. 
There is no point in making an application under part XXIV if it 
has no chance of succeeding.
<P>
	I do not wish to denigrate the role of psychiatry in this process. 
Indeed, dangerous offender rules require that psychiatric evidence 
be presented for both sides at the dangerous offender hearing.
<P>
	I also note the references which the hon. member made in the 
last debate on this issue to the work of Dr. Robert Hare in 
predicting the risk of recidivism by psychopaths, including 
psychopathic sex offenders.
<P>
	The ability of psychiatrists and psychologists to assess the nature 
and degree of risk of offenders has certainly improved in the last 
decade. I have heard Canada described as a leader in this field. I 
further note that the Correctional Service of Canada employs a 
wide range of clinical and actuarial testing in its intake and case 
management programs for federal inmates.
<P>
	The proposed amendment to the Criminal Code has the balance 
wrong. It would compel the crown to bring a dangerous offender 
application every time a pair of psychiatrists reach a medical 
conclusion about risk. Perhaps if the motion called for discretion, it 
might receive more support. However, the motion advocates a 
sweeping measure that would diminish the role of judges and 
prosecutors and indiscriminately force every case of sexual 
offending to proceed through a lengthy and expensive examination 
by psychiatrists, even when there is little chance of those 
psychiatrists labelling the offender as high risk.
<P>
	I am glad that the hon. member has such faith in psychiatrists. 
Perhaps she is unaware that the Canadian Psychiatric Association 
has stated that there is already a shortage of qualified forensic 
psychiatrists in Canada. The Correctional Service of Canada and 
provincial departments of justice are already hard pressed to find 
psychiatric advice even for priority cases.
<P>
	I find it interesting that the Reform Party will spare no expense 
in this area, even if the chances of winning a dangerous offender 
case are thin or remote. To put this in context, I refer members to 
figures which were recently released by Statistics Canada.
<P>
	In 1994-95 the federal government spent $913 million on adult 
corrections. The provinces and territories spent another $980 
million. The capital cost of building federal penitentiaries 
increased 70 per cent between 1990-91 and  1994-95. It costs 
taxpayers $44,000 per year to keep a person in a federal 
penitentiary. The per capita cost to operate the adult correction 
system represents $65 for each Canadian.
<P>
	Could we not be a bit more selective in where we focus our 
resources? Did the hon. member do a cost analysis?
<P>
	I would like to suggest there is a way to be selective and strategic 
in the way in which our limited resources are employed. The 
speech from the throne of February 27 of this year contains the 
following statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government will focus corrections resources on high-risk offenders 
while increasing efforts to lower the number of young people who come into 
conflict with the justice system. The government will develop innovative 
alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	This motion is typical of measures that unselectively demand 
indeterminate detention for crimes that should be targeted much 
more carefully. I believe the important word here is carefully.
<P>
	I trust prosecutors, courts and juries to pass the appropriate 
judgments on sex offenders. We all expect that. The question that 
must be asked is whether sex offenders are slipping through the 
system. Are opportunities for dangerous offenders being missed?
<P>
	Federal and provincial ministers of justice certainly agree the 
dangerous offenders provisions are an extremely valuable tool if 
used properly.
<P>
	I note that during the last debate on this identical motion the 
Minister of Justice made reference to the dangerous offender 
flagging system. This system has been set up by the RCMP 
working closely with the provinces. It allows police and 
prosecutors to identify criminals who appear to demonstrate a high 
and continuing risk of future violent conduct.
<P>
	Police and crowns can then become aware of these individuals 
through a flag placed on the data banks of the Canadian Police 
Information Centre, CPIC. I am informed that most provinces and 
territories have designated co-ordinators to operate the provincial 
end of the system and that a number of offenders have already been 
flagged. It is this kind of targeted measure that will make the 
dangerous offender procedure more effective.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the dangerous 
offender sentencing procedure as set out in part XXIV of the 
Criminal Code is a well tailored scheme that meets the 
requirements of the charter of rights and freedoms. The criteria are 
reasonable and focus on a select group of high risk offenders.
<P>
	If the sweeping, unselective amendments anticipated in this 
motion were implemented there would be a considerable risk that 
the entire dangerous offender scheme would be undermined and 
discredited. I cannot support the motion.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to my hon. colleague who sits on the Justice committee with me. 
I wonder if he feels that lawyers are the ones who should do the 
psychiatric examination of people who have demonstrated by their 
actions that they are dangerous to our children and other people 
within society.
<P>
	I rise to support my colleague's motion to amendment the 
Criminal Code. If Motion No. 116 is adopted, the section of the 
Criminal Code dealing with dangerous offenders will be altered to 
allow for the examination of sex offenders by two psychiatrists to 
determine their propensity to offend again.
<P>
	If the psychiatrists conclude the offender is likely to commit or 
attempt to commit another offence in the future, the attorney 
general of the province may direct that an application be brought to 
have the offender declared a dangerous offender.
<P>
	On September 14 last year an article appeared in the <I>Financial 
Post</I> containing figures from Correctional Services Canada. I 
concur with the author's observations that these figures are 
worrisome and clearly indicate the system does not protect the 
public from convicted murders and other dangerous predators. 
These figures demonstrate the need for my colleague's amendment 
to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	According to a chart furnished by the solicitor general to Diane 
Francis, editor of the <I>Financial Post</I>, between 1989 and 1994 no 
fewer than 78 people committed murder while on conditional 
release.
<P>
	If we had in place legislation allowing for the designation of 
dangerous offenders prior to and following sentencing, if we had 
eliminated statutory release and if we eliminated the patronage 
appointment of parole board members, thereby ensuring only 
qualified people are making the decision regarding the parole of 
violent offenders, measures Reform has been advocating for well 
over two years, we would have saved 78 lives in this five year 
period, or at least the possibility of doing so would have been 
present. We would have saved 1.3 lives each month during this 
time.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	We must move immediately to amend the Criminal Code to 
ensure the public is protected from potential repeat offenders who 
have demonstrated by their actions that they are a danger to our 
children and members of society.
<P>
	The same figures reveal that some 4,960 persons convicted of 
lesser violent offences such as child molestation, manslaughter, 
rape or attempted murder repeated their crimes while on 
conditional release. These figures show we have a terrible record in 
terms of judging whether a person has been rehabilitated after they 
have demonstrated they pose a violent threat to members of 
society.
<P>
	Ms. Francis concluded that those figures are awful, and I agree 
with her. Five thousand crimes against our children and other 
innocent victims could have and should have been deterred or 
prevented. Clearly the Criminal Code amendment my colleague 
from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has proposed will 
assist in the prevention of these types of assaults.
<P>
	The examination of these offenders and therefore the indefinite 
incarceration of dangerous offenders will enhance public safety. 
Sex offenders, especially child molesters, have a high rate of 
recidivism. The only way to keep our children safe, the only way to 
prevent sexual predators from taking victims and destroying the 
life of another innocent child is to keep them locked up, to keep 
them incarcerated indefinitely until there is absolutely no risk of 
reoffending.
<P>
	If we cannot protect society from those who have identified 
themselves by their actions as dangerous to others, what chance 
does our justice system really have?
<P>
	A recent article in <I>MacLean's</I> reveals that psychologists and 
criminologists agree that the best way to reduce recidivism rates is 
by classifying offenders on the basis on the continuing risk they 
represent to society, and in those cases in which the risk of 
reoffending is high, classifying such offenders as dangerous.
<P>
	Years ago the process of classification was fraught with guess 
work but today research in Canada has led to vastly improved 
techniques for classifying offenders. University of British 
Columbia psychologist Robert Hare has developed a widely used 
scale known as the psychopathy check list. Employing this list 
during intense interviews with offenders, psychologists can with 75 
per cent to 80 per cent accuracy determine whether an offender is a 
dangerous psychopath.
<P>
	This test is not only valuable in determining an offender's risk of 
reoffending for the purpose of classifying them a dangerous 
offender and thus providing for indefinite incarceration, it also 
assists correctional services in determining how they may, if at all, 
rehabilitate such offenders. Many experts agree the best way to 
reduce the risk of repeat offenders is through intense counselling.
<P>
	If Melvin Stanton and Joseph Fredericks had been examined by 
psychiatrists, as recommended by my colleague, and if Daniel 
Gingras had been subjected to Mr. Hare's test, the parole board 
may not have had the opportunity to make such a disastrous 
decision regarding the temporary absence or parole of this 
convicted murderer and these two sex offenders.
<P>
	In January 1988 Melvin Stanton, a violent sex offender, was 
granted a temporary absence from an Ontario penitentiary and 
within hours of getting out raped and murdered a young woman in 
downtown Toronto.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1141"> 1141 </A></B>
<P>
	If Mr. Stanton had been classified a dangerous offender or if 
the risk of his reoffending had been known, the parole board never 
would have granted him leave and an innocent life never would 
have been so violently snuffed out.
<P>
	If parolee Joseph Fredericks had been recognized by the justice 
system for what he really was, a sadistic pedophile, and 
incarcerated accordingly, 11-year old Christopher Stephenson of 
Brampton, Ontario would not have been abducted, raped and 
fatally stabbed in June 1988.
<P>
	If convicted murderer Daniel Gingras was not given a temporary 
absence from an Edmonton institution in the summer of 1987, two 
lives would have been saved. I urge members of all sides of the 
House to vote in favour of this motion.
<P>
	In the absence of such an amendment, Canadians will have to 
take measures to defend their own lives and those of their children. 
They will have to do what the mothers of Val-d'Or, Quebec have 
done to protect themselves. They will have to plaster warning 
pamphlets throughout their communities. They will have to keep 
their doors locked and they will have to keep their children within 
close range at all times; no bike rides through the park, no walking 
home alone after school because they live in constant fear for their 
children that they may fall victim to a sex offender.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Convicted sex offender Joe Cannon, who is serving six months 
for gross indecency and who has been convicted of six sexual 
offences since 1988, will soon be eligible for temporary leave from 
a prison in Val-d'Or. With no assurance from the justice system that 
this offender will not strike again, residents can only minimize, not 
eliminate, his chance of victimizing one of their children again.
<P>
	In our judgment the only way the children of Val-d'Or can be 
completely safe from this sex offender is if he kept in prison until 
examiners, two psychiatrists, are absolutely certain he will not 
reoffend. My colleague's amendment could provide that assurance.
<P>
	The main objective of any proposed justice legislation or 
amendment to the Criminal Code is to improve public safety. This 
amendment meets that criterion. It will enhance personal security 
by providing us with the assurance that sex offenders, those 
offenders labelled dangerous, will not be released from prison until 
there is an absolute sign that there is no risk of their harming our 
children.
<P>
	I urge members on all sides of the House to support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this motion. I have many 
reservations about the motion which I will put on record.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has 
introduced a motion that calls for making it mandatory for the 
crown, in all cases in which a person has been convicted of a sexual 
offence involving a child or sexual assaults, to apply to the court to 
have the offender declared a dangerous offender whenever two 
psychiatrists are of the opinion that there is a danger the offender 
will strike again.
<P>
	The hon. member is asking the government to implement this 
through an amendment to part XXIV of the Criminal Code, the part 
that deals with dangerous offenders. Obviously the hon. member is 
of the view that the dangerous offenders provision of the Criminal 
Code needs improvement. Quite possibly it could be improved but 
I am not sure the measure proposed by the hon. member would 
carry the appropriate result.
<P>
	I am not saying part XXIV should never be changed, but the 
evolution of the dangerous offender concept and the restrictions the 
charter of rights imposes on that concept indicate we should 
proceed cautiously in broadening it or oversimplifying it.
<P>
	The existing dangerous offender system has three components: a 
focus on the most serious offences, a focus on the pattern of the 
offender's conduct, and an assessment of the likelihood of the 
offender's continuing his serious offending. These criteria must be 
met if we are to justify locking up individuals indefinitely.
<P>
	I will address one proposed change with which I disagree, a 
proposal central to this motion, the mandatory aspect. The motion 
provides that every time two psychiatrists determine that in effect 
an offender poses a high risk of reoffending, the attorney general of 
the province in which the offender was convicted shall direct that a 
dangerous offender application be brought.
<P>
	I do not support the elimination of the discretion of prosecutors 
in the bringing of dangerous offender applications. It would be 
unwise to do so. The criteria for a dangerous offender finding are 
contained within the Criminal Code. This is a concept created by 
criminal law and supported by criminal procedure.
<P>
	It is true these criteria rely heavily on psychiatric prediction of 
risk, but medical standards are not the only ones that have to be 
met. Section 753 of the Criminal Code requires that the likelihood 
of the offender's committing further harm must be established to 
the satisfaction of the court. This is not entirely or even primarily a 
matter of medical or statistical prediction but a legal decision made 
according to criteria legislated by Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1142"> 1142 </A></B>
<P>
	The crown should possess the discretion, considering all 
evidence available to it, to estimate whether an  application will be 
strong enough to meet this legal standard. If an application is 
brought without meeting this legal standard, it is a waste of time 
and resources and will not succeed.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I also want to address the issue of broadening the scope of the 
legislation. The motion would broaden part XXIV to capture any 
sex offence against a child. This would include cases of sexual 
interference under section 151 and an invitation to sexual touching 
under section 152 of the Criminal Code. While these crimes carry a 
maximum penalty of 10-year's imprisonment, individual offences 
usually do not receive such lengthy sentences nor do they typically 
involve the degree of violence envisioned in part XXIV. In 
broadening the target group so much, the motion before us runs a 
serious risk of conflicting with the charter and a 1987 Supreme 
Court decision.
<P>
	The current dangerous offender provisions came into the 
Criminal Code in 1977 and replaced the habitual offenders 
provisions that had been found to be too broad. These amendments 
were designed to be more precise, to target the most serious 
offenders and, similarly, to avoid widening the net too much. In 
essence, Parliament was saying, let us target the worst offenders 
without sweeping in the low risk and the nuisance cases.
<P>
	The dangerous offender legislation passed a major hurdle with 
the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. <I>v.</I> Lyons in 1987. The 
court ruled that the dangerous offender provisions did not violate 
the charter of rights and freedoms. This case constitutes a firm 
indication by the Supreme Court that any law that seeks to sentence 
a citizen to an indefinite term in a penitentiary must be well 
tailored and confined to the most serious circumstances.
<P>
	In broadening the target groups so much, the motion before us 
runs a serious risk of conflicting with this decision. I doubt that the 
Supreme Court would find this much net widening consistent with 
the charter, particularly when given the new rules prescribed 
elsewhere in this motion. Crown attorneys would be forced to 
launch many more applications. The court, as in the Lyons case, 
would be vigilant to the potential for abuse in the overall structure 
of the procedure.
<P>
	In the same Lyons case, the Supreme Court also stated that it was 
important for the crown to have some discretion in bringing 
dangerous offender applications and that the absence of any such 
discretion could lead to a conclusion that the law is arbitrary. That 
could very well be the case if Parliament was to legislate according 
to this motion before us today.
<P>
	I would like to point out how successful part XXIV of the 
Criminal Code has proven to be. Between 1977 and 1995 
approximately 143 offenders were found to be dangerous offenders 
and sentenced indeterminately to a  Canadian penitentiary. Of that 
number, 134 remain there still.
<P>
	There are signs that the provinces are using the procedure more 
often. Successful applications usually average eight or nine a year. 
In 1993 there were 15 successful cases. In 1994 there were 13 
cases. We all remember the recent designation of Paul Bernardo as 
a dangerous offender.
<P>
	I suggest that the current motion is not an appropriate way to 
improve the dangerous offender legislation. I regret that I cannot 
support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not pleased to speak on this bill today. As a matter of 
fact, I am very upset that this Liberal government, which has a 
majority in the House and has the power to enact laws to protect 
our society, our families and our children and to follow through on 
a promise of recognizing the need for safety in our society, refuses 
to enact legislation that will do exactly that. It leaves it up to the 
Reform Party, the opposition, to bring this type of motion to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	While I am certainly anxious to support M-116, the motion of 
the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, at the 
same time I am really upset that it has been left up to an opposition 
party to do this. Reformers have recognized the need to protect 
society and are proud to do it.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	After listening to the hon. members from the Bloc and the 
Liberal Party speak, it must be said that we have just heard 
members from these parties prefer to argue for the rights of sexual 
offenders and sexual predators. They prefer to argue for those kinds 
of rights as opposed to arguing for the rights of society as a whole 
and the victims of these very sick people.
<P>
	The motion the hon. member from Surrey-White Rock puts 
forward seeks to amend the dangerous offender section of the 
Criminal Code to ensure that sexual offenders, these predators, will 
not be free to walk in society and offend again. They would be 
declared dangerous offenders. This would happen if two 
psychiatrists who are trained in assessing the character and the 
mental makeup of the people who have committed these horrible 
crimes stated that these people would reoffend again. The courts 
would be bound to keep them in jail which is where they should be.
<P>
	Being labelled a dangerous offender involves an indeterminate 
prison sentence. There is a need for this amendment to the 
legislation. One need only look back a few years to get a sense of 
how poorly the justice system deals with people who sexually 
offend.
<P>
	It has been mentioned before but the House will remember the 
case of Melanie Carpenter and her killer Fernand Auger, an 
individual with a tremendously long  history of sexual offences. 
Before being released from prison a psychologist stated that 
beyond a shadow of a doubt Mr. Auger would reoffend. The system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1143"> 1143 </A></B>
<P>
knew he was going to reoffend but it let him go free. Now Melanie 
Carpenter is dead because of it.
<P>
	I am just amazed at these Liberal and Bloc members who, when 
speaking against this motion, constantly refer back to the criminal 
justice system as their rationale. The Canadian people know that 
the criminal justice system stinks. It needs a complete overhaul. 
Yet the Liberal and the Bloc members use it as their rationale to 
speak against motions which will protect society. They say it 
cannot be done because the criminal justice system states so and so 
and they go on to relate what the justice system says.
<P>
	The thinking that goes on in the minds of some members is 
astounding. They try to defend the criminal justice system which 
no Canadian would ever defend.
<P>
	The present system is such that psychologists could have done 
nothing to stop Mr. Auger's release. The system allowed this Auger 
fellow to refuse treatment while he was in prison. This guy was a 
sexual predator, a sexual offender. He was convicted. He went to 
prison and he stated: ``I'm just going to stay for a while but I don't 
need any treatment and I am not going to take it''. What happened? 
The system let him out and he brutally killed someone.
<P>
	Joseph Fredericks, a man with a long history of sexual offences 
against children was released from a Toronto jail in 1988. Despite 
the fact that there was a 99 per cent chance that he would reoffend, 
the system let him go. The system put him back into society. The 
system did not have the power to keep him incarcerated even 
though the system knew he would reoffend. He abducted, raped and 
killed Christopher Stephenson. The system let him go. Once again 
the system failed. As a result the Stephenson's lost their son.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	More recently, in my home town of Prince George, we learned 
that Bobby Gordon Oatway, a twice convicted sexual offender, a 
pedophile, a predator of little children, was being released from 
prison on parole even though he had refused treatment in prison, 
even though the corrections people, the parole people, knew 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was most likely to offend again. 
Out the door he walks. He was coming to Prince George.
<P>
	Had it not been for a phone call from one of his victims in the 
lower mainland of B.C. to Prince George letting people know he 
was coming, he would have come back into our community 
probably totally undetected. Chances are that he would have 
committed an offence there.
<P>
	After the citizens were warned that he was coming, on their own 
and without the help from the justice system  because the system let 
this Mr. Oatway out in the first place, mounted a campaign and 
distributed posters. This changed Mr. Oatway's mind and he did 
not come to Prince George. Unfortunately he is in Toronto now and 
they are faced with the same problem. They have a predator in their 
community who is likely to offend again. The system failed. He 
will offend against innocent children who are just enjoying being 
kids only to be victimized by some sexual predator, some sick 
person.
<P>
	Canadians believe that the justice system is severely deficient 
when it comes to protecting society from these sick, sexual 
predators. M-116 goes a long way to addressing the situation. It 
ensures that dangerous sexual offenders will be kept in prison so 
that our streets, our playgrounds, our schoolyards and our 
communities can be safe again.
<P>
	Why should parents have to worry about where their kids play, 
how they go to school? Why should parents have to worry about 
their kids going to a playground and having a good time, like kids 
are supposed to do? They have to worry because the justice system 
lets people who are sexual predators out on the streets. That is 
unfair.
<P>
	The government has had lots of chances to improve the law as it 
applies to this type of offender. When the Liberals passed Bill C-45 
last year, my colleagues in the Reform Party put forward a number 
of amendments to address sexual offenders and ways to fix the 
system so that society would not have to fear these people. 
Specifically, they argue in favour of a child sex offender registry 
which would identify them so that citizens could take precautions 
on their own where the justice system fails them.
<P>
	As well, they argued in favour of sex offenders having to serve 
their full sentence and undergo-this will come as a real shock to 
Liberals-mandatory treatment while in prison. Needless to say the 
Liberals did not adopt any of these proposals and society remains 
vulnerable to these sick people who prey on little children and 
commit other sexual offences.
<P>
	The problem with the government, as mentioned in the opening 
part of my speech, is that it is concerned more for the rights of 
criminals. Victims' rights come second as far as the Liberals are 
concerned. While a lot of bureaucrats sit around and muse over 
how to protect criminals' rights, these offenders are wandering 
around anonymously in our neighbourhoods.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association got into the heart of the issue in 
a submission given to MPs in 1993. It stated: ``We think we should 
rethink the basic assumption that dangerous risk high offenders 
must be released no matter what danger they pose''. Policemen in 
our streets are dealing with these people on a daily basis. They 
know these people. They know the chances of them  reoffending. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1144"> 1144 </A></B>
<P>
They want to keep them off the streets. That is exactly what Motion 
M-116 addresses.
<P>
	We must question the logic in simply allowing the justice system 
to keep releasing these offenders. I might add that we have to 
question releasing them when their chance of reoffending is very 
high. Seventy per cent of all inmates who are dangerous offenders 
have at least one prior federal sentence. These individuals are hard 
core criminals and it is not overly difficult to identify them.
<P>
	Similar to the Canadian Police Association position, the group 
CAVEAT released a report called ``Safety Net''. It called for 
dangerous offender applications to be brought against high risk 
offenders in order to protect the public. This should be the ultimate 
role of our justice system: the protection of society, our families 
and our communities. Unfortunately, it seems as though it has been 
turned on its head according to the Liberal and Bloc members, and 
criminals' rights come first. That is a shame.
<P>
	In November 1994 the supreme court ruled that sex offenders 
could no longer be automatically banned for life from hanging 
around parks, school yards and playgrounds. The justice system 
says that people who prey on and victimize little kids cannot be 
kept from areas where little kids play. That is a sign of a very sick 
system. What is even more distressing is that the government 
supports that decision.
<P>
	I cannot support the government's position on this. I will support 
Motion M-116. I urge all members who are concerned about the 
public, the families and the children of the country to support it as 
well.

	The House resumed from Friday, March 22, consideration of Bill 
C-14, an act to continue the National Transportation Agency as the 
Canadian Transportation Agency, to consolidate and revise the 
National Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway Act and to 
amend or repeal others acts as a consequence, as reported with 
amendments from the committee, and of motions in Group No.8.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Motion No. 18 relates to clause 98, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>98.(1) A railway company shall not construct a railway line without the 
approval of the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The Agency may, on application by the railway company, grant the 
approval if it considers that the location of the railway line is reasonable, taking 
into consideration requirements for railway operations and services and the 
interests of the localities that will be affected by the line.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are excellent provisions, and an effort is made to take into 
consideration the needs of the users, the company and the region. 
All that is fine but incomplete. There are two other equally 
important elements, which our motion is designed to include.
<P>
	The first of these two elements is the environment. We are 
surprised to note that the legislation does not state that, before 
granting approval, the environmental impact must be considered, 
given that constructing a railway line will obviously change the 
urban or rural landscape and that an environmental impact 
assessment is therefore required.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The second element that was overlooked-and this clearly 
reflects the general attitude of this government, which constantly 
overlooks the interests, priorities and jurisdictions of the 
provinces-as part of the process for granting the approval to 
construct a railway line is consultation, the mere fact of consulting 
the province or provinces affected before granting this approval.
<P>
	Yet, land use planning is specifically a provincial field of 
activity, a provincial area of jurisdiction, either directly or by 
delegation, because the development plans are prepared by the 
provinces and approved by the provincial government under which 
the municipalities come. In particular, corridors may or may not 
have been provided or approved by the province in these plans for a 
line to eventually go through the area.
<P>
	If the allowance, the right of way was not provided for in the 
development plan for a railway line to go through, it is obvious that 
changes will have to be made. It is really unthinkable that the 
federal government go ahead without even consulting the province 
concerned. This is typical of the way the federal government deals 
with the provinces, and that is why our motion adds that the 
granting of the approval to construct a new railway line shall also 
be subject to ``the obtaining of an environmental assessment and 
compliance with zoning by-laws in the municipalities in any 
province affected by the railway line''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with regard to the Bloc motion, there is some merit in it in 
terms of environmental considerations however, on reviewing this, 
had it been worded a little differently it would have been easier to 
support. The way the motion reads it is a cumbersome process 
which would grind work to a halt. It is not workable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1145"> 1145 </A></B>
<P>
	Motion No. 19 is also connected in some way to what the Bloc 
raised, which were the concerns of municipalities within the 
various provinces affected by rail activity. Railways have property 
which must be crossed from time to time either by the 
municipalities for infrastructure work or by utility companies in 
order to supply service to the general public. Often permission is 
required to make these crossings, either with an overhead crossing 
or more often an underhead crossing.
<P>
	The concerns raised by both the municipalities and utility 
companies are that in the event of rail line abandonment or selling 
off of the rail lines, they have no tenure on these crossings. They 
would like something put into the bill which would ensure the 
infrastructure would continue in the interests of the general public. 
Obviously, it would be a great hardship for a municipality if 
suddenly a water or sewer line which crossed rail property was 
ruled improper and had to be rerouted.
<P>
	I suspect it will be suggested by the other side that it could be 
taken care of by getting an expropriation and that is right. The land 
could be expropriated which would of course mean going to court 
with lawyers and delays and uncertainty. This is not a company 
benefit or profit for an individual or an individual company. This is 
just something to address the needs of the taxpayers in the affected 
area. It is worthwhile. It is not something which will be a hardship 
to the rail lines. I ask that all members of the House give it serious 
consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened quite carefully to the amendment proposed by the member. 
I should say that the government does not support the motion 
because it is not consistent with the current environmental 
legislation regarding circumstances and responsibilities for 
conducting environmental assessments. While I understand where 
the hon. member is coming from, he should realize there is an 
inconsistency in the motion.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the subject of local conditions, the hon. member 
should read section 98(2) again. We believe that the consideration 
of local conditions is already adequately covered in 98(2) and for 
that reason we do not believe that this motion should be supported.

	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I do believe there 
may be more than five who have come in now, but at the actual 
time the fifth member was standing at the back by his desk.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is no doubt at all. The member is 
right. There are more than five now, but unfortunately when there 
was the standing vote, there were not five and accordingly the 
matter would fail then on division.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-14 be amended by deleting Clause 112.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 24</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-14, in Clause 112, be amended by replacing line 20, on page 49, with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``must be commercially fair and reasonable to all parties.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, this clause 
has been quite contentious among the users in the grain industry. 
They have some difficulty with the phrase ``commercially fair and 
reasonable'' which clause 112 contains.
<P>
	This is not something that I alone was concerned about in the 
House. The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster had also 
attempted to move a similar motion, hence the support by my hon. 
friend from Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	The problem is that the provisions of this clause are to provide 
an interpretive direction to the Canadian transport agency when it 
is setting rates or conditions of service as they apply to carriers.
<P>
	Since the clause now reads ``a rate or condition of service 
established by the agency under this division must be 
commercially fair and reasonable'', a lot of the witnesses who were 
before the transport committee, including the prairie pools, the 
National Farmer's Union, the three prairie provincial governments, 
indicated they could not support such a provision because there was 
no clear definition as to what constitutes fair and reasonable.
<P>
	It was also indicated that clause 113 was to serve as a general 
guideline for the NTA. If that were the case, this kind of guideline 
should be conveyed to the agency through means other than 
legislation.
<P>
	In their submission to the transport committee the three prairie 
governments stated clause 113 provides yet another potential 
avenue for railways to delay the process and to appeal rates 
established by formulas for interswitching and competitive line 
rates.
<P>
	Since a large number of the people who will be affected by this 
clause think it should be dropped, I am in agreement and propose 
this amendment to strike this clause from the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we support this amendment because of the overwhelming 
request for that by all the people who intervened at the committee 
level.
<P>
	As I said earlier in debate, I do not see why the Liberals would 
hold committee meetings, paying for interpreters, paying for all the 
technicians, paying for the research people, the clerk and all the 
others who come before the committee if they are not prepared to 
listen to those who come.
<P>
	One of the people who came before the committee was Mr. 
Ashley from the National Transportation Agency. I specifically 
asked him the meaning of ``commercially fair and reasonable''. His 
response was there is no specifically defined position since it may 
mean rather than it would.
<P>
	This was to cause a lot of uncertainty for shippers who wish to 
bring their cases before the agency. It also means a great boost for 
the law profession, as it argues the two opposite extremes of this 
definition.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It was not there before. The vast majority of people who came 
before the committee do not want to see it there now. We have not 
seen any evidence to suggest it serves a useful purpose. We would 
like to see that taken out and we are very happy to add our support 
to the hon. member for Mackenzie in his attempts to have this 
removed.
<P>
	Motion No. 24 ties into the same thing. It is an amendment to 
what is now clause 112. It is not necessarily a good amendment. It 
would be ideal to have the clause removed completely, in which 
case Motion No. 24 would simply disappear.
<P>
	If the government intends to use its majority to push through a 
decision that was unpopular among shippers, among the majority 
of people who came before the board, and that was not even 
supported by the National Transportation Agency, with great 
reluctance we will probably support Motion No. 24 because it is the 
equivalent of losing only a finger or two when you had been 
threatened with losing your entire arm. I do not think it is that good. 
It is probably more like losing it above or below the elbow. That 
would be a more appropriate analogy.
<P>
	Motion No. 24 does not make much improvement. If the 
Liberals are condescending enough to allow us to have that little 
crumb and will not do what is right, we will have to take whatever 
is left over.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the words of my friends opposite, although I 
believe we should put this in the context of the examination that 
has taken place in committee.
<P>
	It is true that our committee members, including opposition 
members, are bound to listen to and consider any position brought 
forward. However, this is the difference between this side of the 
House and the other. It is not simply the weight of people who 
arrive as witnesses that determine the outcome.
<P>
	We do not believe we can have our role as government, as 
representatives of the people of Canada somehow suspended 
because a group of people, a large number of people, come on one 
side or the other. We have to analyse the merits of what is said and 
not simply count up the number of people who oppose or support a 
particular measure.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 23, the committee did that. It 
considered the representations made and it came to the unanimous 
conclusion that this section of the bill did not require immense 
substantive amendment. In its view  a regulatory decision must be 
accepted as being in good faith and must be considered fair and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1148"> 1148 </A></B>
<P>
reasonable. We cannot accept the intent of this motion which 
implies the opposite if we have any confidence whatsoever in the 
regulatory bodies the House sets up.
<P>
	We do not support this motion, although I can assure hon. 
members it was carefully considered. The intent put forward is 
taken care of by the wording of the current bill.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 24, the words listed are ``must be 
commercially fair and reasonable to all parties''. Obviously this is 
a government motion which we support for the following reasons. 
The provision gives guidance to the agency when it takes over from 
commercial negotiations between the parties so as to impose a rate 
or a level of service on the railway.
<P>
	It is assumed that at the point when it takes over the commercial 
deliberations between the two parties have broken down. At that 
point the agency must have the guidance of this section, and it will. 
It must look at balance to ensure that when it examines the rate it 
will be fair and reasonable to all the parties.
<P>
	Some stakeholders have said this phrase is unclear and will 
create excessive litigation. I do not believe so at all. In my view the 
average person in the public, the average person watching the 
televised proceedings of the House today will have pretty good idea 
in their own mind of what is fair and reasonable.
<P>
	I think excessive use of the courts to get the lawyers to argue 
something which is not fair and reasonable, not the common sense 
meaning, would not succeed when we have a good regulatory 
agency such as the NTA.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Some litigation is inevitable with any new piece of legislation. It 
happened with the major transportation bills in 1967 and again 20 
years later in 1987 and it will happen with this one. There will be 
challenges, of course. It happens every time there is a legislative 
change.
<P>
	As to the claim that there are going to be hundreds of cases, let 
me just observe that the costs of litigation make that prohibitive, 
costs not only in terms of dollars but also in terms of time. These 
costs fall on all parties. Railways and shippers know that after one, 
two or three key cases they will have all the clarity they need from 
the NTA and the courts. What we will get as a result of the change 
are more successful commercial agreements for the rail service, 
which is the objective, where both parties and the entire Canadian 
economy wind up as the winners.
<P>
	Clause 112 in the Canada Transportation Act, that the rate 
imposed by the agency be commercially fair and reasonable to all 
parties, is important and indeed vital for rail renewal in Canada 
which is obviously in the interests of producers and shippers as 
well. This will help put the required new balance into the formula 
for the benefit of all Canadians. Therefore, we definitely support 
Motion No. 24, just as we must oppose Motion No. 23.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak to the amendment by my colleague from the NDP and to 
the support he has received from the Reform Party.
<P>
	This is an important discussion. I sat on the committee and from 
my railway experience I can say that this is obviously something 
that has stacked up against the railways for a number of years. If we 
are going to have a successful railway industry and a transportation 
sector which will deliver the services required, there must be a 
significant balance.
<P>
	In 1987 when the Tory government brought in the NTA, it 
brought in some regulatory changes but stacked them on top of 
each other. Because of that stacking there were some problems with 
the act which these amendments are trying to change. The rationale 
is that if we are going to go to a more commercially driven 
transportation sector, the process must be in place for it to be 
successful.
<P>
	Most intriguing is that on the one hand the Reform Party has 
continually said that governments should not get in the way of free 
market enterprise and allow companies to make decisions on their 
own. We all know that commercially fair and reasonable means 
that agencies are given the objective of making decisions on behalf 
of two complainants. For instance when a shipper disputes what the 
railway would like to charge there must be some form of criteria 
laid out in order for them to make decisions and arrive at a result. 
The process in the amendment the minister has added which affects 
all parties is intended to make sure that the parties are relatively 
successful in Canada.
<P>
	One thing the opposition has failed to bring forward so far in the 
discussion but which came forward in committee is that since 1987 
the line rates and the cost to the railways have increased 30 per 
cent. In fact railway companies in this country have had significant 
problems in making a profit. I know the NDP are suggesting this 
but I am quite surprised that the Reform Party is in agreement. If 
they are suggesting that the government bail out the railways every 
time they do not make a profit, we can then go back to the 
regulatory system which is in place now.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	People would go to the agency only for one reason. The agency 
would make a decision on whether it is fair and commercially 
viable for the railway to up its cost per commodity. Under the 
present system, that has not taken place and therefore, there have 
been problems with it all along. The intent of these new regulations 
and changes is to put the balance back where it belongs. It is the 
same  argument with labour-management relations. If there is not a 
good balance then it does not work. The same thing occurred with 
the 1987 amendments. Of course, the grain farmers and shippers in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1149"> 1149 </A></B>
<P>
western Canada are opposed to this. There will be stronger, 
businesslike discussions and debate which will go on before they 
go to the agency.
<P>
	I reiterate that when I was in committee not everybody agreed 
that this was a bad thing as the member who spoke previous to me 
suggested. There were different groups of thought. If we go to a 
commercially based industry and system and if the government 
stops subsidizing the railway industry, it would have to have the 
means and the capability to be successful. That is what this 
rebalancing does.
<P>
	The amendment the government has proposed will prove over 
the years that this is good for Canada in the long run. It is not going 
to be successful if we use the short term arguments of the 
opposition. We will be revisiting this as we did in the 1920s, in the 
1940s and in the 1970s and bailing out railway industries because 
we have not allowed them the tools to be successful. That is why 
this amendment is so important to the overall viability of the 
industry itself and of course to all of us who need to get our 
products to market.

with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) Sections 264 to 267, 344, 345 and 358.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, cut to its most simplistic form, this motion 
would require the agency to determine whether or not a passenger 
train service was in the public interest. It would say that the 
governor in council has declared a route or segment of a route of 
VIA Rail to be a protected route. Essentially it would require the 
agency to determine whether a line that carries passengers should 
be protected, particularly in areas such as northern Ontario where 
80 per cent to 90 per cent of the customers along the route have no 
other access to their destinations except by rail. The basic 
difference is that this would be required, instead of a clause where 
the agency may use these as considerations.
<P>
	While Motion No. 70 lists a bunch of numbers, essentially it 
would make the proper corrections. Since this amendment would 
deal with sections 268 to 270 of the Railway Act, Motion No. 70 
would simply drop those numbers from the succeeding clause in 
the bill because that would no longer be necessary. Motion No. 70 
is simply housekeeping contingent upon Motion No. 56 passing.

<P>
	The question here is whether a fully deregulated system can in 
fact perform a function for isolated areas. I note that some 
witnesses from the coalition for service to northern Ontario began 
their commentaries by saying that they began their work over a 
year ago believing strongly that they would seek market driven 
solutions to the ills that plague transport rather than once again 
looking to governments to save the railroads.
<P>
	This spring however the coalition reluctantly came to the 
conclusion that when it came to rail passenger service, services in 
northern Ontario were no different from rail passenger services 
elsewhere in the world and that specifically, northern Ontario 
services understood that the passengers by themselves were not in a 
position, nor were they willing to pay for the full cost of such rail 
based service. Someone other than the fee payer would be needed 
to pay the difference in cost. They went on to point out the amount 
of subsidy which has been paid to maintain some of the lines in 
northern Ontario. I suspect we would find subsidies being paid to 
maintain service in other parts of the country as well when it comes 
to rail passenger service.
<P>
	The intent of this amendment is to recognize that there are some 
places which will not be able to pay for the service on a user pay 
basis, that those parts of the country are important and that 
therefore we all should pay a little bit in order to maintain access to 
those regions for the people who live there. That is after all what a 
country is supposed to be about. It was the original rail service 
requirement in the Constitution to link the various colonies and 
regions of the country together.
<P>
	Even though we are going to a deregulated system, there will 
always be some parts of the country in which full deregulation will 
make absolutely no sense, such as the many communities in 
northern Ontario. This particular amendment would require the 
agency to take that into consideration before it decided whether to 
provide a service.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to speak against this motion for some very obvious reasons. The 
NDP are still stuck about the 1920s. Its members do not seem to 
have been able to take a good look at what this bill intends to do.
<P>
	The bill is intended to take the public interest out of a mode of 
transportation. It treats railroads just like truckers or shippers or 
anybody else. That is not to suggest that the agency is the final 
arbitrator of the public interest.
<P>
	The legislation states that if there is something in the public 
interest it can be taken to members of Parliament. They are there to 
fight for a particular rail line if it is being subsidized. It will be a 
transparent subsidization  that will be dealt with based on the 
merits of a certain region.
<P>
	To send it to a non-elected body which on the one hand looks at 
the commercial side of issues but on the other hand what Canada's 
public interest is and what the beliefs are of the government of day, 
suggests to me that it is skewing the whole process of having 
successful transportation systems.
<P>
	Section 48 permits the minister to enter into support agreements 
for the continuation of rail passenger service. From my experience 
and knowledge, that is what has been done in northern Ontario. I 
take offence at the member's suggestion that all of a sudden the 
government is going to leave northern Ontario in the lurch.
<P>
	The other issue is one I have mentioned before. I believe the 
people who should deal with the public interest are those of us in 
the House. The agencies are there to make sure that the 
transportation system functions and runs properly. That is why the 
public interest scenario has been taken out of the bill.
<P>
	I suggest to members that we get into the modern age and 
understand what is the intent of a rail transportation system. It is to 
get product to market as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Rail 
transportation, as far as passenger service is concerned, is a 
different issue and should be dealt with in a different arena which 
happens to be this one here.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 66</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-14, in Clause 155, be amended by replacing lines 17 to 21, on 
page 72, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) The Minister shall lay before the House of Commons a report 
concerning the review made under subsection (1) within thirty sitting days after 
the review is completed.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will defend Motions Nos. 57 to 65 together. They have 
the same purpose, are related to clauses 147 to 155 and are not 
intended to amend them. The sole purpose of the motions is to 
delete these clauses from the bill.
<P>
	These provisions are back, with special benefits for Western 
grain transportation. We are opposed to such benefits. Let us 
remember that just a few days ago, in this House, the hon. member 
for Frontenac expressed his disagreement with the fact that dairy 
subsidies had been eliminated, with no compensation for dairy 
producers, while the same had not been the case for Western grain 
transportation and production.
<P>
	These clauses deal with the introduction of a maximum rate and 
special conditions for the transportation of Western grain. These 
provisions were introduced in the 1987 legislation, when the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, the so-called WGTA, was 
repealed and the subsidy eliminated. But Western farmers were 
generously compensated, to the tune of close to $3 billion, for the 
elimination of the subsidy and the WGTA. In this bill, the 
government is reintroducing the provisions introduced in the 1987 
legislation.
<P>
	Western farmers have been very well compensated, unlike their 
counterparts in Quebec, as I have just mentioned. They should 
therefore be able to cope with the new conditions for transportation 
in the West, and to  adapt to a rail system operating on a strictly 
commercial basis, as is the case here.
<P>
	Treating Eastern and Western shippers on an unequal footing can 
only result in an inequitable development of the rail system by 
adversely affecting the resources that shippers in the Eastern 
network can invest. It is for these reasons that we are asking that 
these clauses be deleted from the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a couple of short observations.
<P>
	If this motion is passed, it will negatively impact on western 
grain transportation. If Bloc Quebecois members were to rise in the 
House and say that they are a regional party, interested in specific 
partisan points within the province of Quebec, then their motion 
would be perfectly understandable.
<P>
	However, for them to say that they are a national opposition 
party, the official opposition, and vote on such partisan views is 
totally unacceptable. We will not be supporting this motion.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
grouping of the motions includes one from me. It states that Bill 
C-14 on page 72, section 155, requires a review where:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the minister shall, in consultation with shippers, railway companies and any 
other persons that the Minister considers appropriate, conduct and complete a 
review of the effect of this Act, and in particular this Division, on the efficiency 
of the grain transportation and handling system and on the sharing of efficiency 
gains as between shippers and railway companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As we go further through section 155 which creates this study in 
the future, nothing requires the study to be made public. This 
motion has the effect of requiring that the results of such a study be 
laid before the House of Commons within 30 days of the 
completion of the review.
<P>
	This is quite common and normal for reviews structured under 
acts of Parliament. I presume it was an error on the part of the 
government and it was simply missed. I expect that the government 
will be supportive of this since it has a similar kind of clause in 48 
which deals with extraordinary disruptions to the system and those 
extraordinary disruptions are reported to the House of Commons. 
As well in clause 43, the minister tables the annual reports of the 
Canadian Transport Agency.
<P>
	On such an important issue as this review of whether the whole 
system of deregulation has or has not worked, it is obvious that the 
House of Commons would and should be interested. I am sure it 
was simply an oversight on the part of the government and I expect 
the motion will be supported at the time of the vote.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``155.1(1) After consultation with such participants as the Agency deems

sections; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>f</I>) reduce the additional costs directly attributable to the acquisition by the

<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The Agency shall, on or before March 31, 1997 and on or before March 31

<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) to ensure that the contribution to constant cost provided by the movement of 
grain is fair in relation to the contribution provided by other commodities.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this motion falls neatly behind the one I 
spoke to just a few moments ago. It fleshes out a little more the 
kinds of consultations the agency should engage in when doing a 
review. It is for an earlier review than the one required under the 
previous motion. In the previous motion the review was to be 
completed by 1999. This sets out similar guidelines for a review, 
which I suppose if one was a social scientist, an economist or an an 
accountant, would say that this establishes the base line for the 
future review. It establishes the same parameters and the same 
requirements. It looks at the same things the review in 1999 will 
look at but does it on the first year of the agency's activities. We 
will see in 1999 whether progress is made.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It will be very difficult to do a proper job of the review in 1999 if 
there is no base study done now. This sets up the opportunity for the 
agency to conduct such a base study. It will clearly establish the 
real costs of the system as of this coming year. When we have the 
review in 1999  we will know whether progress has been made and 
whether the act is a success or a failure.

On the Order: Government Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>March 14, 1996-The Minister of Transport-Second reading and reference 
to the Standing Committee on Transport of Bill C-20, an act respecting the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-20, an act respecting the commercialization of civil air navigation 
services, be referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on Transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to refer the 
civil air navigation services commercialization act to the Standing 
Committee on Transport. As members know, the navigation system 
is the network of air traffic control services, flight information 
services, aviation weather services and navigational aids necessary 
for the safe and expeditious movement of aircraft across the 
country.
<P>
	It is customary for the underlying principle of a bill to be debated 
before it is referred to the committee. That debate usually occurs at 
second reading. However, in the case of this legislation the debate 
has taken place over the course of the past two years, and a very 
extensive debate it has been.
<P>
	The government first announced it would study 
commercialization of the air navigation system in the 1994 budget. 
Hon. members debated the merits of commercialization at that 
time.
<P>
	The not for profit model set out in the legislation was chosen by 
an advisory committee composed of users, unions and other 
stakeholders. The committee studied seven different options for 
commercialization. It consulted with interested parties across 
Canada. Many Canadians from coast to coast debated the merits of 
commercialization during the consultative process. I pay tribute to 
the energy and dedication displayed by members of the committee 
from all sides of the House in that exercise.
<P>
	The government announced its decision to proceed with 
commercialization of air navigation in the 1995 budget. Hon. 
members were again afforded the opportunity to debate this 
decision. There has been already considerable debate on the 
underlying principle of this bill. Because so many have been given 
the chance to contribute there is today broad support for this piece 
of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	As the House knows, Nav Canada was incorporated in May 1995 
under the part II of the Canada Corporations Act for the purpose of 
developing, operating and maintaining the air navigation system. 
Highly successful negotiations have resulted in an agreement in 
principle between the government, Nav Canada and the involved 
unions. Under this agreement Transport Canada will transfer the 
navigation system to Nav Canada for $1.5 billion. This will make a 
significant contribution to the government's deficit reduction 
efforts, efforts to which the governor general in the speech from the 
throne paid tribute a few weeks ago.
<P>
	Subject to the review and the approval of Parliament and the 
receipt of royal assent, this transfer is set for July 1 this year, a very 
significant date in Canadian history.
<P>
	Nav Canada will receive all the assets used by Transport Canada 
in the provision of air navigation services. This includes land, 
equipment and other items required to ensure the system's 
continued safe and effective operation.
<P>
	After the transfer Nav Canada will be responsible for providing 
all of the air navigation services currently provided by Transport 
Canada including air traffic services, community aerodrome radio 
services, aeronautical telecommunications, aeronautical 
information services and aviation weather services.
<P>
	Transport Canada will be responsible for ensuring the continued 
safe provision of these services. The new safety regulations 
developed specifically to address the commercialization of the air 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1154"> 1154 </A></B>
<P>
navigation system will be in place before the transfer happens. 
Transport Canada will  monitor and enforce these regulations in 
much the same way it now does with the air carrier industry.
<P>
	Nav Canada will be required to have an internal safety 
management program. In addition, the corporation will not be 
permitted to reduce the service it provides where it would 
jeopardize safety. Furthermore, the Aeronautics Act which 
establishes the regulatory framework to maintain safety in the 
aviation industry will always take precedence over the 
commercialization legislation.
<P>
	I mentioned a moment ago that we have reached agreement in 
principle with all parties in this project. I underline this includes 
unprecedented support from the very people who will be most 
affected by commercialization, the employees working in the 
system itself. Their support is outlined in a memorandum of 
understanding between Transport Canada and the employee 
bargaining agents. Under this memorandum, which was signed last 
September, current collective agreements will continue to apply. 
Bargaining agents will have successor rights until Nav Canada and 
its employees reach their own agreements between each other.
<P>
	Those who use the air navigational system have likewise 
endorsed this legislation, and no wonder. The government projects 
that costs will come down, possibly within two to three years, as 
private sector management principles take hold of the system, as 
subsidies are phased out and as the regulations governing the air 
navigation system are streamlined.
<P>
	There are concerns of isolated communities and they are 
reflected in this legislation as well. The act ensures continued 
provision of air navigational services to northern and remote 
communities. It also includes a process to involve provincial and 
territorial governments should any service reductions be proposed 
by Nav Canada in the future.
<P>
	Following established practice and in keeping with Nav 
Canada's national role, the provisions of the Official Languages 
Act will also apply throughout Nav Canada as if it were a federal 
institution.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Nav Canada must maintain services to humanitarian or 
emergency flights in the event of any work stoppage that might 
occur.
<P>
	The commercialization of the air navigation system is a key part 
in the government's efforts to modernize the Canadian 
transportation system. It complements our other transportation 
initiatives including the commercialization of federal airports, 
seaports and harbours, the privatization of Canadian National 
Railways, the commercialization of ferry services and the 
conversion of Transport Canada's motor vehicle test centre to a 
government owned but contractor operated facility.
<P>
	Commercialization of the air navigation system is consistent 
also with international trends such as those in Australia, New
<P>
Zealand, Germany, South Africa and Ireland. All those countries 
have opted for some form of commercial air navigation during the 
past decade.
<P>
	This transaction is one of the largest commercialization 
initiatives undertaken by the federal government. It is a model of 
the co-operation required between public and private sectors. It is 
also a very visible demonstration of the government's commitment 
to streamlining its operations and reducing its expenditures as well 
as its determination to stop providing services that can be better 
provided by the private sector.
<P>
	That is a good deal for all Canadians, for taxpayers, by making a 
$1.5 billion contribution to reducing the federal deficit. It is good 
for the industry by maintaining safety while increasing the 
system's ability to respond to changed demands and new 
technologies.
<P>
	It is good for users by providing more efficient and cost effective 
operations. It is good for the system's employees by offering them 
the opportunity to continue to work and contribute in a new and 
challenging work environment. It is also good for Nav Canada by 
setting the stage for it to operate one of the world's best run and 
safest air navigation systems.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to approve the motion to refer the civil 
air navigation services commercialization act directly to 
committee. Let us speed up the process of ensuring continued safe, 
efficient and flexible air navigation services for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-20, which is before us 
today. Our position is clear: we are not, opposed to the principle set 
out therein, that is to say providing the public with better and more 
affordable service. In today's difficult times, I believe this 
principle must be everyone's objective.
<P>
	We are, therefore, in agreement with the principle of Bill C-20, 
but we have many questions on the way the government has drafted 
it, has worded the underlying principles.
<P>
	For instance, it is all very well to say that Nav Canada is to be a 
not for profit corporation. Fine, no problem with that. Now, if we 
look at who will be on the board to preserve the rights of users, we 
find there will be 15 representatives of the aviation sector, both 
commercial and non commercial, the unions, the federal 
government, plus independent members. Here again, I find this 
praiseworthy.
<P>
	When we thoroughly examine who those members will be, 
however, we find they will be only the major carriers. The small 
ones will not be represented, although a number of those consulted 
by the members of the task forces on this intended government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1155"> 1155 </A></B>
<P>
measure expressed a wish to see small carriers hold at least one seat 
on the board.
<P>
	They did not get it in the legislation, for all practical purposes. Is 
that a sign of how things will be later on? I hope not. Surely they 
will have the chance to remedy this, and we will stress that point 
when the bill goes to committee.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, we support the principle, but we have some questions 
about the wording. We have some concerns about safety as well.
<P>
	I heard the minister introduce this bill at this particular stage, 
and he said we would have to leave it up to the agency to check the 
homework the government had done to find ways to save money, 
and all with the aim of user safety. I do not think the bill stress 
safety enough. I agree that savings have to be made, but, as far as 
safety is concerned, I do not think anyone, especially in the field of 
aviation, is going to ask the government to make savings at the risk 
of safety.
<P>
	The preamble to this bill should make the message very clear to 
the agency that will be managing these things in the future. Safety 
is vital, and, at this point in time, I think the bill is lacking in this 
regard. We will also make sure the matter comes up for discussion 
in committee.
<P>
	There is the matter of employment as well. The agency, which 
currently manages all navigational services, has some 6,400 
employees. It is therefore very important in terms of the jobs in this 
agency that legislation be passed by Parliament to promote or 
attempt to keep as many jobs as possible, while lowering costs.
<P>
	I heard the minister earlier assuring the House that union 
members had been consulted, that there was no problem continuing 
labour contracts and that everything would go smoothly. Yes, for 
the time being. However, there is a series of collective agreements 
to be renegotiated between March 1997 and October 1998, I 
believe. If the objective is to save money, some jobs will certainly 
be lost in the process, whether we like it or not.
<P>
	This bill should perhaps include a detailed list of what the 
government would like the corporation to keep. Now is the time to 
do it while we are reviewing this bill and setting up this 
organization. We as legislators and members of the House of 
Commons will set the guidelines, and I think it is important to do 
so right away.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing union representatives testify about 
these collective agreements before the committee and explain to us 
how they see the future in terms of privatizing, so to speak, all 
civilian air navigation services. This is a very important point.
<P>
	I have another point to make that is extremely important, 
especially for some regions. I represent the  riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm, which unfortunately does not have a major 
airport although there are some on the outskirts. My colleague from 
Trois-Rivières, for his part, is lucky enough to have a major airport 
in his riding. I think it would be important, in this bill, to make the 
regions feel secure, to help small airports get equal, if not special, 
treatment because local economies are often directly or indirectly 
linked to transport facilities, including airports.
<P>
	However, in its drive to save money, the non-profit corporation 
may not see things the way I do today. It will not necessarily think 
about the regions in deciding to eliminate or modify jobs or even to 
close air transport services. Now is time for us, as the legislators 
now considering this bill, to include in it some very specific 
provisions outlining what we as parliamentarians want from this 
non-profit corporation.
<P>
	The corporation will buy this for $1.5 billion. This is all well and 
good, but then if there are problems or if the regions encounter 
some difficulties, we will not come out ahead in return for $2 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It is time that to stand up for the regions, because they are 
important. They are important to Quebec and to Canada as well. 
Nowhere in this bill do I see any assurance that these services will 
be maintained.
<P>
	Another important element is small air carriers. There is a direct 
link between small carriers and small airports. Small carriers and 
major carriers view things quite differently; take for example, in 
Part III, the air navigation charges set by NAV CANADA.
<P>
	Major air carriers would like fly over fees to be lower than 
landing fees, which is quite normal. On the other hand, small 
carriers are calling for just the opposite. Why? Because they are not 
on as strong an economic or financial footing as major carriers.
<P>
	If we want small air carriers to be able to survive in their regions, 
this point must be stressed in the legislation. Nowhere in Bill C-20 
is this philosophy, this attitude of the government regarding small 
carriers reflected.
<P>
	We get the distinct impression that the bill was dictated by major 
carriers and that it is intended to serve their interests. Granted, It is 
for reasons of economy and to have better service in the future. But 
we know that the signal was sent by the major carriers.
<P>
	It is important for small airports and carriers, as well as for the 
regions, to send the message today, through Bill C-20.
<P>
	Bill C-20 is complex because it deals with a number of issues. 
However, many terms used are vague. A principle of law provides 
that, when drafting a piece of legislation, the legislator must be 
clear. It uses terms that are as clear as possible, to facilitate their 
interpretation by the courts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1156"> 1156 </A></B>
<P>
	However, some expressions in this bill are quite vague, 
including three in clause 2(4), which will have to be improved on, 
hopefully in committee. There are expressions such as interested 
party, persons designated by the minister, demonstrable consensus 
and transparency. These expressions are not very clear in the bill. 
In the end, we do not really know the purpose of this legislation.
<P>
	These things will have to be clarified in committee so that we 
can support this bill. In principle, we agree, but we must also end 
up with an act which will mean something and with which we can 
agree.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will start by telling the government I am recommending 
to my party that we support this bill going to committee after first 
reading, which is contrary to our normal policy.
<P>
	When the House first started the concept of sending legislation 
to committee after first reading, it sounded like a great idea. It was 
supposed to be easier. Nobody would get their back up in the House 
before the bill went to committee. However, we were blind sided by 
that because once a bill got to committee, we found that it was 
treated in a very autocratic manner.
<P>
	I opposed Bill C-101, which later became Bill C-14, going to 
committee after first reading. Of course the Liberals used their 
voting might to ram it through. In all fairness at committee level, 
notwithstanding the fact there were still things in the bill which I 
did not like, it was dealt with in a much more open handed manner 
than had previously been the case.
<P>
	I see no advantage in debating the bill at this point. Debate does 
not answer questions. It postulates each of the various positions, 
but it does not answer questions. I have some questions which need 
to be answered and this can best be done at the committee level. I 
would like to see the bill go to committee so we can start dealing 
with the real questions that have been brought up. Before I proceed, 
I would like to put the government on notice on some things I am 
concerned about and will be looking for answers to in committee.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I would like to comment on one of the remarks made by the 
member from the Bloc Quebecois. He talked about his concern that 
the anticipated formula will charge more for aircraft landing than it 
will for aircraft overflying. I should tell the hon. member that 
unfortunately for him, he does not seem to know very much about 
the air traffic control system.
<P>
	An aircraft that overflies, probably in the high level air space, 
stays under the control of a series of sectors but in one spectrum of 
the air traffic control system, high level control. Where an aircraft 
landing may have started in  high level control when it came into 
the air space but had to descend through low level control, then into 
terminal control and then ultimately airport control, there is a much 
greater workload, more people involved and more equipment 
requirements. Therefore, there is a rationale for this.
<P>
	If the member has small airlines or operators who are concerned 
about this, if he cares to share those with me, I would be happy to 
talk to them. I have talked to a lot of large and small operators as 
well as all the other players in this and I have not found this 
particular opposition. It does not mean I am not open to hearing it if 
he has something to bring forward.
<P>
	The minister in his opening remarks talked about this great 
windfall of $1.5 billion that is going to come in. He suggested that 
it will be used to reduce the deficit. If he does I just hope he keeps 
in mind that it is not going to come in every year. It is not going to 
do much for deficit control. It is just a little short term thing. The 
reality is that it is probably not going to be used for the deficit at 
all. It is probably going to be used to try to buy off some provinces 
where they are signing on to the new GST scheme.
<P>
	I am in favour of a lot of things about the program as it stands 
now, for example the not for profit corporation as opposed to the 
crown corporation which I had the impression the government was 
pushing and pushing rather hard at the beginning. In fact, I could 
see a lot of senior bureaucrats jockeying for a high level position in 
the new crown corporation.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that the various users involved in this 
did get their act together and sat down and presented a united front 
to transport and did manage to bring in the not for profit concept. I 
am sure it will work much better than a crown corporation ever 
would. It is good to get it out of government hands, not only out of 
transport but out of the crown corporation concept as well.
<P>
	Under the previous government control we have seen something 
known as RAMP, the radar modernization project. That has been on 
the go for a decade and it is now way behind schedule. It is over 
budget. After over 600 software applications, it is still not fully 
operational. That is a good example of government efficiency. I 
hope to see much better being done by the private sector.
<P>
	A number of questions need to be answered and I will just touch 
on a few. One of the things the new corporation is banned from 
compensation for is anything the government does by way of an 
international agreement. I do have some concerns there. We can 
certainly expand on this in committee. I raised my concerns at the 
briefing we had on this and I will be taking this further.
<P>
	I have a concern that the corporation had a very vested interest in 
taking this over. It is their own organization  that impacts on it 
more than anyone else and consequently they want to have a say in 
this new operation. Therefore, it was incumbent upon them, one 
way or another, to ensure that they were successful in taking over 
this privatized or commercialized air traffic control entity. I have 
some concerns that they may have been in a situation of negotiating 
with a gun at their heads as several of the airport authorities did and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1157"> 1157 </A></B>
<P>
now find after the fact that they do not have enough capital to 
operate properly.
<P>
	In talking about capital, the Nav Canada corporation has 
advertised that it is now going to go for a bond issue, seeking 
possibly as much as $2.5 billion to $3 billion. One question I have 
not heard answered is about the pension fund the government has 
turned over to Nav Canada for the pension earnings and positions 
of all those people who have current pension time earned. That 
pension fund has to be invested if it is going to grow and continue 
to have enough revenues in it to pay the pension obligations that the 
various employees have earned. Can that pension money be 
invested by Nav Canada in the Nav Canada bond issue? A lot of 
employees in the organization would like to know the answer to 
that as well.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I have concerns about a couple of other areas. One is northern 
operations. When and under what conditions can Nav Canada be 
required to continue to operate in the north when it seems to be no 
longer practical to do so? If it is ordered to continue when there is 
no commercial sense in being there, will there will be any 
compensation, and if so, in what form?
<P>
	I come to the AWOS, the automated weather observation system. 
I assume this will come, at least partly, under the parameters of the 
new Nav Canada corporation. I am very concerned about how this 
will be handled. AWOS is a dangerous piece of equipment. It has 
been installed in 60 locations. The former Minister of Transport 
acknowledged that it has problems and decommissioned it at two 
airports, but still left it in 58 others.
<P>
	Why are the lives of the people at two airports where it was taken 
out more important than the lives of the people at the other 58 
airports where it is still in service? How does Nav Canada fit into 
the AWOS system and what are its plans for it?
<P>
	There is also the matter of the Hughes contract. This new 
computerized concept of radar is way behind schedule, away over 
budget, but the government rewrote the contract so that it is now in 
theory back on schedule and back on budget. It did that by giving a 
considerable time extension to Hughes, along with an increase in 
what it is going to pay for a system that is going to have most of its 
major features removed.
<P>
	The government cannot stand up and say the Nav Canada 
corporation loves this because it is paying $1.5 billion. These were 
gun at the head negotiations and someone has to speak on its 
behalf. I will be raising that issue in committee.
<P>
	I will give the government the opportunity to prove that it is 
being more open minded, that it is going to follow with the intent 
that it stated when it brought up the original concept of going to 
committee after first reading. I trust that it will be as open in 
committee this time as it was to some degree under Bill C-101. If it 
is, then perhaps we will support going to committee after first 
reading several times in the future.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the government does what it did on Bill 
C-89, which was to ignore all the input, all the amendments and 
ram the bill through the way it was, then I can assure the House that 
this will be the last time that we support this concept.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure and an honour to speak in support of this motion being 
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport.
<P>
	As my colleague opposite mentioned, not necessarily today but 
also in committee, air navigation technology is changing rapidly. I 
have just returned from New Zealand and I met some members of 
Canadian companies on that tour that are involved in the transition 
of the New Zealand navigation system. It is attempting to privatize 
but also to upgrade navigation technology.
<P>
	My report to the hon. member and to this House would be that 
things are going very well. We have agreed to stay in touch and 
hopefully we will get some reports on this side of the Pacific on 
what and how that is all unfolding.
<P>
	This is a very important bill, putting into place a crucial element 
of the government's overall strategy to modernize Canada's 
navigation and transportation system. It comes at a time when 
governments around the world are getting out of the business of 
providing services and concentrating instead on setting policy and 
enforcing safety. That has to be of paramount concern to all of us in 
this House.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	It also comes at a time when governments are recognizing that 
they can no longer meet all of the needs of modern air navigation. 
Many user groups, such as the Air Transport Association of 
Canada, the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association and the Canadian 
Air Traffic Control Association, have all said that the current 
government operated air navigation system does not meet the needs 
of the aviation community and its expanding role.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the time for a government operated civil 
air navigation system has passed. Once  there was a need for 
governments to be involved in every aspect of air transportation. 
The present system had its beginnings in wartime when in 1944 
member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organization, 
ICAO, signed the Chicago convention. Article 28 of that 
convention called on all members to provide airports, radio 
services, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1158"> 1158 </A></B>
<P>
meteorological services and other air navigation facilities to 
facilitate international air navigation.
<P>
	In Canada, the Department of Transport, known today as 
Transport Canada, assumed responsibility for the operation and 
maintenance of the principal airports and the non-military air 
navigation system. For over 50 years the department met the 
responsibility of developing aviation facilities and, in particular, 
providing air navigation services to civil aviation.
<P>
	Starting in the seventies and continuing today, governments in 
the developed world began to reconsider their involvement in 
providing services that could be better provided by the private 
sector. As a consequence, many government began to reduce their 
involvement in various sectors both as regulators and as owners.
<P>
	With government downsizing and public sector restraint in full 
swing both here and in other countries, there is no longer any 
justification for a government operated air navigation system, just 
as there is little justification for governments to own railroads or 
airports. The aviation sector is mature. It no longer needs extensive 
government involvement to grow and prosper.
<P>
	Canada has undertaken its review of the role of government in 
the aviation industry. As a result the federal government has 
eliminated much of the economic regulation of commercial 
aviation. It has divested itself of ownership in the airline industry 
and in the aircraft manufacturing industry and is moving away 
from operating airports.
<P>
	The government's review of the air navigation system showed a 
number of reasons to change: the present system is not flexible 
enough to respond to changes in demand, and greater efficiency, 
lower costs and increased accountability are needed.
<P>
	Safety, once seen as the justification for state control and 
management of air navigation systems, is now viewed as an 
integral part of managing the system. This, combined with the 
increasing fiscal pressures on governments, has led to the 
conclusion in Canada and around the globe that the system can be 
run along commercial lines, subject to appropriate government 
regulation.
<P>
	Consequently, the government has acted decisively to alter its 
role in providing air navigation services. The current bill provides 
the legal means to transfer Canada's civil air navigation system 
from Transport Canada to Nav Canada, a private non-profit 
corporation, for $1.5 billion.
<P>
	Canada, in its leadership role in the aviation industry, is at the 
forefront of many changes. Many countries, such as New Zealand, 
Australia, Ireland, Austria, Portugal, Germany and Great Britain 
have already commercialized their air navigation systems. This 
bold move has been carefully planned and developed to meet 
Canada's unique needs in aviation requirements. The separation of 
government will provide the commercial freedom necessary to 
meet customer needs and increase system efficiency.
<P>
	The challenge however is to be able to maintain a functional 
system in the remote parts of Canada that are lacking in some of the 
resources required to keep a safety component very reliable.
<P>
	Nav Canada, as a user oriented corporation, will be able to 
respond efficiently to the needs of the system with effective 
government regulation and maintain the high, established level of 
safety. Transport Canada is sharing the experience gained in this 
project with other countries, departments and agencies. Its 
experience will serve as a model both nationally and 
internationally. The commercialization of the air navigation system 
is a key element of the government's comprehensive strategy to 
modernize and prepare for the next century.
<P>
	The commercialization of the air navigation system will provide 
many important benefits: first, for taxpayers, by making a $1.5 
billion contribution to reducing the federal deficit. This was the 
amount that the previous speaker mentioned. Second, for the 
industry, by maintaining safety while increasing the system's 
ability to respond to changing demands and new technologies; 
third, for users, by providing more efficient and cost effective 
operations; fourth, for the system's employees, by offering them 
the opportunity to continue to contribute to a new and challenging 
work environment; and fifth, for Nav Canada, by setting the stage 
for it to operate one of the world's best run and safest air navigation 
systems.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I ask that all members support the motion to refer the bill to the 
Standing Committee on Transport before second reading. This 
initiative has already been the subject of extensive consultation 
across the country, as well as internationally. It is in the interests of 
all Canadians that we move forward with due speed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to Bill C-20, I would like to begin by pointing 
out the scope of its proposed reforms.
<P>
	Air navigation services are delivered via seven regional control 
centres. There are 44 control towers and 86 flight information 
stations. It is important to point out the human element: 6,400 
people are currently involved in supporting the air navigation 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1159"> 1159 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a very general agreement in favour of 
commercialization, and we too are in favour. It was recommended 
by independent studies, a departmental task force and the October 
1992 Royal Commission on National Passenger Transportation, 
and supported by those working in the field, air carriers, private 
operators, the air controllers' union and so on.
<P>
	I shall begin with a word about the corporation created by the 
bill. The bill provides the framework for handing over Transport 
Canada's civil air navigation services to NAV CANADA, a not for 
profit corporation incorporated under Part II of the Canada 
Corporations Act. This is a follow up to the agreement in principle 
signed December 8, 1995 by Transport Canada and NAV 
CANADA, selling the air navigation system for $1.5 billion.
<P>
	The fact that this corporation will be one of a kind places it in a 
monopoly situation of concern to us. The federal government will 
need to monitor its performance, but abuse of monopolistic power 
must be avoided.
<P>
	The new corporation must ensure that those with little if any 
representation on the board, such as the small carriers or the 
general aviation sector, are not discriminated against. New 
companies must not be at a disadvantage either. It would appear at 
first glance that NAV CANADA has not respected the wishes of the 
small carriers, for only the big ones are represented on the board. 
There is, for instance, no representation of the Association 
québécoise des transporteurs aériens.
<P>
	In committee we will be proposing amendments relating to 
better safeguards against arbitrary power and to maintaining 
services to outlying areas.
<P>
	Where safety is concerned, Transport Canada has established 
security regulations and standards that will apply to the new 
corporation, and operations will be monitored to ensure 
compliance. It would be important, however, on a more general 
level, to ensure that public safety takes priority over profits. The 
bill does not include any safety standards. It would be important to 
include in the preamble the point that safety must take precedence 
over profits, and that passenger safety will always come first, 
ahead of any commercial considerations, whenever the two are in 
conflict.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We must also ensure that those who will be designated to 
implement the legislation will not be chosen arbitrarily. We are told 
it will be established by the minister, but on whose 
recommendation? Nobody is saying. Who should be consulted? 
Whose advice should be taken into account? Nobody is saying. For 
our part, we want to be sure there will be no political patronage in 
the selection of employees and that the more active union leaders 
will not be left on the shelf because of their activity, and we will 
make amendments in this regard.
<P>
	In addition, some changes will have to be made to the legislation 
in favour of remote areas, whose economic performance, naturally, 
could be considered less significant.
<P>
	The minister can designate northern or remote services which 
will be given special treatment under the legislation. That is 
excellent, but we feel there must be a list first approved by the 
standing committee of the House, which will hold public hearings 
on this. Accordingly, small airports such as Sept-Îles or 
Rouyn-Noranda will be able to make representations if they need to 
to protect their interests. It would be just too easy for the new 
corporation to cut services for reasons of profitability in remote 
areas.
<P>
	Still on the subject of remote areas, the legislation provides that 
the corporation may, despite rejection of the proposal by a 
provincial government, change or close northern or remote 
services. This is not acceptable. It must take the opinions of the 
provinces into account.
<P>
	Big and small carriers do not share the same opinions on charges 
for air navigation services, as my colleague for 
Berthier-Montcalm pointed out a few minutes ago. Major carriers 
want the cost of overflights to be less than the cost of landing, and 
the small carriers want exactly the opposite. In view of the 
importance of regional transport in the regions and in Quebec, we 
cannot agree with the way the legislation deals with this.
<P>
	On the other hand we agree with the principle in Part IV on 
employees. At first glance, there is no employer-employee 
problems. The working conditions will be the same as those in the 
public service for the life of the collective agreement, which 
terminates on a date set by regulation, as approved by cabinet.
<P>
	However, with the closures anticipated and the cuts in service, 
there will probably be lay-offs in a few years. It would therefore be 
appropriate to have the union leaders appear before the committee, 
in order to get their opinion on the matter.
<P>
	In conclusion, we agree with the legislation in principle and will 
support it if the amendments we will propose in the spirit I have 
just described are considered. Furthermore, we do not oppose its 
being sent to committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of this motion to refer Bill C-20 to the 
Standing Committee on Transport before second reading. Before I 
proceed, I want to speak to the comments made by the hon. 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke in which he made 
reference to ramming something through. I understand his 
frustration but it is with democracy and not with this place.
<P>
	In any event, the bill carries out the decision taken by the 
government as announced in the February 25 federal  budget to 
commercialize the air navigation system. It provides for the legal 
means to transfer Canada's civil air navigation system from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1160"> 1160 </A></B>
<P>
Transport Canada to a private, not for profit corporation called Nav 
Canada. I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate to the 
House that safety will not be compromised with that transfer.
<P>
	Canada's civil air navigation system is a network of air traffic 
control services, flight information services, aviation weather 
services and air navigation aids that allow for the safe and efficient 
movement of aircraft. This system handles more than six million 
aircraft movements a year. Its annual budget is about $550 million 
for operations and maintenance and $250 million for capital 
improvements for a total budget of some $800 million.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Transport Canada has managed this system well for more than 
50 years during which time air travel and air navigation have 
modernized becoming evermore complex and evermore necessary. 
Times have changed and governments everywhere are finding it 
increasingly difficult and less necessary to operate transportation 
systems.
<P>
	Transport Canada's mission is to provide for a safe, 
environmentally sound national transportation system that is 
consistent with a competitive economy and the achievement of 
Canada's goals. However, the new Transport Canada is moving 
away from operating the system to focus on setting the standards 
and regulating for safety and security. The department has been 
receiving strong messages from many quarters that the air 
navigation system needs improvement. It is unlikely these 
improvements can ever be made if the system stays under the 
government's wing.
<P>
	The potential of commercialization to improve efficiency and 
maintain the safety of the air navigation system has long been 
recognized. In 1992 the Royal Commission on National Passenger 
Transportation recommended commercialization of the system.
<P>
	Nevertheless, change is always unsettling. Some may feel that as 
government withdraws from operating the system, safety may be 
compromised. Nothing could be less true. None of the changes that 
are being made to Transport Canada and the Canadian 
transportation system will ever compromise the department's 
commitment to safety. Safety and security will always come first 
and Transport Canada will continue to ensure that the high 
standards of safety and security that Canadians have come to 
expect will in fact be maintained.
<P>
	Safety was identified as the highest priority when 
commercialization was first considered in early 1994. Transport 
Canada's position was then, and continues to be now, that 
operations under Nav Canada must be as safe as the current system. 
This is not just a case of good  intentions. When it comes to the air 
navigation system, safety is an integral part of its management.
<P>
	Nav Canada will be responsible for providing all the air 
navigation services currently provided by Transport Canada. 
Aviation safety and the safety of the public will remain the 
responsibility of the Minister of Transport. This responsibility will 
be exercised through the Aeronautics Act and regulations made 
under that act. To do so the department is establishing safety 
regulations and standards that will be monitored, audited and 
enforced in much the same way as the department regulates air 
carriers, airports, aircraft manufacturers and other commercial 
aviation enterprises.
<P>
	The new regulations developed specifically to address the 
commercialization of the air navigation system will form part VIII 
of the Canadian aviation regulations. Under these regulations Nav 
Canada will be required to have an internal safety management 
program. In addition, the corporation will not be permitted to 
reduce the services it provides if doing so would jeopardize safety. 
The Minister of Transport has the authority to direct Nav Canada to 
provide services in the interests of safety.
<P>
	Consultation on the new regulations has begun through the 
Canadian Aviation Regulations Advisory Committee. They have 
been published in part I of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and should be 
enacted into law early this year.
<P>
	The Aeronautics Act which establishes the regulatory 
framework to maintain safety in the aviation industry will always 
take precedence over the Civil Air Navigation Services 
Commercialization Act. Far from compromising safety, the new 
arrangement is our guarantee that Canada will continue to have the 
safe, effective, modern air navigation system it needs.
<P>
	One of the reasons for commercializing the air navigation 
system is to ensure that the system has the resources it needs to 
continue to provide the highest level of safety possible. There is no 
doubt we must have a modern air navigation system to ensure the 
safe and efficient movement of aircraft, whether domestic or 
international, in Canadian managed air space.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Governments cannot respond effectively to the modern needs of 
air navigation. The downsizing of government services and public 
sector restraint is incompatible with the dynamic needs of the air 
industry. Outside of government the system will be able to operate 
more efficiently. By increasing the system's ability to respond to 
changing demands and new technologies, we will help to ensure its 
continued safe operation. That means the system will have the 
resources it needs to provide the best system possible and, with the 
federal government overseeing safety and security, that means the 
safest system possible.
<P>
	In closing, I ask that all members support the motion to refer Bill 
C-20 to the Standing Committee on Transport before second 
reading.

	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and

colleagues in the House to attend Business Connections '96.
<P>
	Built around a change and technology theme, Business 
Connections '96 promises to be a very exciting all day event. This 
initiative promotes rural economic development, helping to secure 
our future and guarantee the quality of life we value into the next 
century. From agricultural research on the ground to the 
information highway in cyberspace, my constituents are involved.
<P>
	Over 50 exhibitors will display their products and services, 
representing micro businesses, high tech, retail, service based and 
large industries. Keynote speakers and panellists will share their 
knowledge and experience.
<P>
	Sponsors include Gibbard Furniture Shops, in its 160th year, 
Celanese Canada, Goodyear Canada, Lafarge Canada, Municipal 
Trust, Scotiabank and Strathcona Paper. We have also gained the 
endorsement of four area chambers of commerce.
<P>
	I am especially pleased that the Secretary of State for Science, 
Research and Development will join us to discuss science and 
technology opportunities.
<P>
	We hope that everyone will come to Napanee on April 13. I 
guarantee them an informative and exciting event.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> One Canada. 
All of its citizens equal before the constitution. Mr. Speaker, it is 
almost too late to assure that equality is given to all Canadians.
<P>
	The Nisga'a deal signed on Friday will create two classes of 
Canadians: one class has its right to own land protected by the 
Constitution, the other does not. One has its right to commercial 
fishing guaranteed by the constitution, the other does not. It is not a 
constitutional right for non-aboriginals to own land. If it is a 
constitutional right for aboriginals to own land, so it should be for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I appeal to the Prime Minister not to sign any binding agreement 
now or in the future which would confer rights upon groups of 
Canadians based on race. It is urgent because creating two classes 
of Canadians carries with it the seed of the destruction of Canada's 
peace and order. We implore the Prime Minister, on behalf of our 
children, grandchildren and ourselves, not to finalize as it currently 
stands the Nisga'a deal.

more comments from a grassroots group in Peterborough riding 
which is working to strengthen Canada. The group writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the problems-is that people not knowing each other, find it easy to 
accept the stereotypes provided for them by manipulators whose steadfast goals 
are destructive for us all. Yet in Montreal, English, French and other ethnic 
groups work together with a good degree of harmony because they are face to 
face. Social intimacy flies in the face of stereotypic attitudes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We, and others like us, must extend some kind of invitation to our fellow 
Canadians in Quebec that will bring us closer to that face to face ideal. Whether 
that can be accomplished on the small scale by inviting francophone 
acquaintances from various rural and urban areas to our homes-or-to initiate 
chain letters which will attempt to establish an accord with those in Quebec who 
feel alienated from the rest of the country, we do not know. We do know, 
however, we must act to dispel such destructive stereotyping on the part of so 
many English and French Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	This event is the culmination of a series of democratization

country. In two of those ridings I am surprised the Liberals have the 
nerve to run candidates.
<P>
	Excess power from Churchill Falls sells in the U.S. for $800 
million a year, but Labrador and Newfoundland gets only $20 
million of it. The trans-Labrador highway is in a deplorable state 
and needs $75 million to rebuild it. That is less than 10 per cent of 
the money lost every year due to Liberal inaction.
<P>
	In Etobicoke North the Liberals cancelled the Pearson 
development contract which cost metro Toronto ridings like 
Etobicoke North 1,140 airport jobs, 560 direct off airport jobs and 
3,000 indirect jobs as well as 14,000 person years of construction 
work.
<P>

hang their heads in shame and the voters in Labrador and Etobicoke 
North should hang the Liberals out to dry.

<P>
	Mr. Ouellet inherits a Canada Post plagued with service 
problems. Cheques mailed from Saskatchewan to Edmonton take 
more than two weeks, resulting in late payment and interest 
penalties. I get reports of Christmas parcels still not delivered after 
six weeks. Photos sent two years ago are still not received.
<P>
	A weekly newspaper goes from Tisdale, Saskatchewan to Swan 
River, Manitoba each week. The trip takes three hours by car, 20

Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois was amazed to learn that there is no

minister, and that it does not come under any existing official 
program of the department. Nonetheless, 10 telephone operators 
are working on this project and are taking orders from Canadians.
<P>
	While the CBC's budgets are blithely being slashed, with 1,000 
additional layoffs planned, while cuts to the National Film Board 
will result in the dismissal of some 150 creators, it is disgusting 
that the department has introduced a propaganda initiative without 
any advance idea of the cost.
<P>

associated with the Deputy Prime Minister's propaganda? A

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANBROADCASTINGCORPORATION">CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, last week, while talking about CBC funding, the Deputy 
Prime Minister said, and I quote: ``What makes it difficult, every 
time we seek new avenues of funding, is the block we run into, the 
Bloc Quebecois''.
<P>
	I would like to remind the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of Canadian Heritage that the Bloc Quebecois is the only party 
fighting for maintaining the mandates of the CBC, the NFB and 
Telefilm Canada, but that we are opposed to a CBC tax.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. As the CBC faces 
cuts amounting to $150 million over two years, could the heritage 
minister finally tell us how she intends to go about funding this 
crown corporation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see 
that the Leader of the Opposition is open to new ways of funding 
the CBC. What is unfortunate is that the Leader of the Opposition's 
open-mindedness was not reflected by his own critics who, the day 
after the Juneau report was tabled, rejected any form of funding 
other than the current parliamentary appropriations.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition is willing, I, of course, will work 
in co-operation with the Minister of Finance to try to find new ways 
of funding the CBC in the long term and I would expect the Bloc 
Quebecois to support our efforts instead of blocking them as they 
have done so far.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage should remember that, 
not so long ago, her predecessor's careless answers hurt his career.
<P>
	My question is extremely serious and if we had an answer once 
and for all, we would move on to something else. The president of 
the CBC clearly stated-and he was the second president to do 
so-that they could no longer absorb $150 million in cuts without 
the corporation's mandate being affected. Yet the minister asserts 
that the CBC's mandate will be maintained.
<P>
	Our question is very simple and quite legitimate and it deserves 
an answer: How will the minister allow the CBC to carry out its 
mandate if she cuts another $150 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker,  talking about careless 
remarks, it is not the government who, the day after the Juneau 
report was tabled, dismissed all funding recommendations. It was 
the Bloc Quebecois who immediately refused to consider any of the 
long term funding alternatives as proposed in the Juneau report.
<P>
	I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that we in government 
are now considering all long term funding alternatives for the CBC. 
I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will at least lend his 
support, even though his former and current critics have not 
endorsed any new funding methods.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of Canadian Heritage that what we formally object to is the 
creation by the government of a new tax that would make 
Canadians pay twice for the CBC. We object to this. I understand 
that she is looking for ways to fund the CBC, but in the meantime 
the corporation itself is facing some serious problems. The minister 
should understand this.
<P>
	This is not a trick question, but a request for information. How 
can the minister impose another $150 million in cuts without 
changing the mandate of a crown corporation which, at least 
according to its last two presidents, is unable to do what is required 
of it? What does she intend to do? It is her responsibility, and we

<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I see that the Leader of 
the Opposition still rejects the new funding methods recommended 
in the Juneau report, as they were by both the former and the 
current Bloc critics.
<P>
	That said, when I work with the Minister of Finance on a new 
funding alternative, it is precisely so that we can achieve one of the 
major objectives in the Juneau report, namely the long term 
funding of organizations such as the NFB, Telefilm Canada and the 
CBC.
<P>
	I think it is unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition refuses 
to consider new funding mechanisms that could in the long term, as 
proposed in the Juneau report, eliminate the need for an annual 
budget review of the CBC.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. The Bloc Quebecois 
recognizes, and joins with others in recognizing, the importance of 
the CBC, the NFB and Telefilm Canada as cultural institutions, as 
set out in the Juneau report. Second, we also recognize the report's 
insistence on the need to settle the long term funding issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1166"> 1166 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc is clearly opposed to a CBC tax being levied. Last 
week, the minister herself told me in this House that she was 
against imposing a CBC tax, but at the same time she is 
establishing a cultural production fund. My question is clear: What 
is the source of this cultural funding? Where will she get the 
money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the idea put forward by 
the member opposite, to support the recommendations made in the 
Juneau report while not rejecting any new method of funding, as 
the Juneau report proposed, is typical of the politics practised by 
the Bloc Quebecois by constantly talking from both sides of their 
mouths. In fact, we agree with the Juneau report that long term 
funding should be provided through instruments other than 
parliamentary appropriations. And that is precisely what my 
colleague, the Minister of Finance, and myself are looking into 
right now.
<P>
	This lack of open-mindedness on the part of the Bloc Quebecois 
is unfortunate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is quite simple, we are asking the minister to tell us what scenarios 
are being contemplated and what she is working on in terms of 
where the funds will come from. Given that both the past and the 
current presidents of the CBC agree that an extra $150 million in 
cuts will affect the CBC's mandate, are we to understand from the 
minister's response, since she stated that the mandate would not be 
modified, that the CBC will be allowed to run deficits, to be 
absorbed by the consolidated revenue fund?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate that I 
am not surprised the Bloc Quebecois is speaking out of both sides 
of its mouth.
<P>
	The day the Juneau report came out, one of its important 
messages was that for the survival and the growth of the CBC, 
alternate methods of financing must be sought in the long term. 
That is precisely the work I am now undertaking with my 
colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	What is sad is that a party that claims to support public 
broadcasting has turned its back on looking at new and innovative 
methods of funding such public broadcasting.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, across 
the province of Ontario, Liberal MPs have been trying to convince 
their constituents that what they really meant was harmonizing the 
GST, not eliminating it.
<P>
	There is only one problem with that. Canadians still have copies 
of the Liberal campaign pamphlets from  1993. Two weeks ago the 
member for Niagara Falls said he did not promise to scrap the GST 
but his election flyer has just surfaced from 1993 and he promised 
in it to fight to eliminate the GST.
<P>
	My question is this. Which Liberal is telling the truth? The 
Liberal candidate for Niagara Falls or the Liberal MP for Niagara 
Falls?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the position of Liberals throughout the campaign and the position 
of the government have been very clear. It was stated in the red 
book on page 22. It is conceivable that members of the Reform 
Party have not read the red book. I would suggest they do so as it 
would give them very good insight into what the country is all 
about.
<P>
	In 1990 the leader of the Reform Party said that he would rip the 
GST out. Was he speaking for the Reform Party? Was he speaking 
for the Reform when he said it could not be repealed immediately 
because it would increase the deficit? Was he speaking for the 
Reform Party when he commended the government on its attempt 
to harmonize the tax with the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes we 
did say that and we still say that it should be phased out. We need to 
cut spending, that is the problem. We stand by that.
<P>
	Liberal candidates across Ontario ran on the promise of killing, 
scrapping and abolishing the GST. Once they were safely in power 
they broke that promise. Now they are busy trying to bury the 
evidence.
<P>
	After the minister of immigration gets through shredding her 
predecessor's pamphlets, there are 98 other ridings of Liberal 
propaganda and broken promises for her to get to work on with the 
shredder.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister this question. Why did the Liberals 
break their promise on the GST? How many other Ontario Liberals 
are going to have to start shredding their campaign pamphlets?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every Liberal who ran in the last campaign ran on a 
platform that was very successful, which was the red book. The 
promise is on page 22. As it was tabled in the House, it is available 
to every member of Parliament. If some members do not want to 
read it there is not much I can do about that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
amazes me is that when the Liberals fall back on the red book now, 
the member from Niagara Falls, in his local newspaper last week, 
said: ``I guess I could say that we were a little over-zealous and 
little over-anxious. I guess you could say it has haunted me''. 
Those are words from a Liberal MP, not me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1167"> 1167 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister this. How many Liberal MPs has the 
Prime Minister haunted with his promise to scrap, kill and abolish 
the GST and then totally turn around on that? It makes no sense.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let 
me repeat once again that, in 1990, the leader of the Reform Party 
said very clearly, when he was trying to get the member for Beaver 
River elected, that he was going to rip the GST out, to get rid of it. 
One year later, he wanted to keep it. Now, his position is exactly the 
same as ours in the red book, in that he wants to replace the GST 
with a harmonized tax. It took him three years to get to where we 
have been since the very beginning.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	The Reform Party can go through this charade time after time on 
what the government's position is. The government's position has 
been very clear. The difficulty the Reform Party has is that it is 
caught by its own contradictions year after year on the GST, on 
social programs, on the commitment to bring in a new budget, on 
how fast it would reduce the deficit, on medicare and on virtually 
everything.
<P>
	There is no consistent philosophy from Reform Party members. 
They only have one objective which is to confuse. The only people 
they confuse are themselves.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The CBC's 1994 annual report tells us that the English network's 
budget was $750 million, compared to $275 million for its French 
counterpart. Yet, the two networks more or less have the same 
number of viewers and, according to their presidents, production 
costs are the same for both.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Since the Minister of Heritage agrees with the Bloc Quebecois 
that taxpayers should not have to be taxed, can she tell this House 
whether her magical formula to fund the CBC will allow her to 
eliminate the discrimination between the two networks and ensure 
that both cultures are treated on the same foot in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
statement is wrong. Canadians currently do pay taxes to support the 
CBC.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately, the minister missed my question, and such 
a good question too.
<P>
	Since the Juneau report proposes, among other measures, to 
decentralize CBC's French language production and take it to 
regions outside Quebec, will the Minister of Heritage confirm that, 
to avoid a weakening of French language television in Canada, this 
recommendation will not be implemented, unless she minister 
allocates new funds to fund it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I answered the member. 
The premise of her question is false. What she said on 
Radio-Canada was that Canadians would not be taxed. In fact, 
Canadians are currently being taxed to the tune of some $900 
million, specifically for the function of Radio-Canada.
<P>
	What was recommended in the Juneau report was a different 
method which would see reductions of parliamentary spending 
being taken up by a more direct tax.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It takes money to promote CBC's activities in both official 
languages. Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois flatly rejects, 
without even giving it any consideration, any new funding method 
that would ensure, in the long term, the promotion of French and 
English programming from coast to coast.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
couple of weeks ago when Brian Tobin was in town he told 
reporters that he was here to pick Ottawa' pocket. I would 
encourage the finance minister to check his wallet because now we 
hear that $100 million has disappeared out of their super slush fund 
that is being used to pay off provinces so that they will harmonize 
with the GST.
<P>
	Is the minister so desperate to get the provinces to sign on to his 
harmonization proposal which, of course, is a breaking of their 
election promises, that he is willing to pay them off even when we 
have a $600 billion debt? And where is he getting the money to do 
that?

we have been having discussions with a number of provinces which

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In Halifax, in May 1995, the Minister of Heritage announced his 
decision to raise from 20 per cent to 33.33 per cent the figure for 
foreign participation in broadcasting parent companies. In 
November 1995, he repeated that commitment formally. To date, 
however, the order in council to authorize that harmonization with 
the telecommunications sector has not yet been issued.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister explain to us why his government is still 
dragging its feet on this order in council despite its repeated 
commitments to do so, while it knows very well that this delay puts 
broadcasting  companies at a disadvantage compared to 
telecommunications companies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we wish to guarantee 
Canadian content in the broadcasting policy. This is something I 
believe even the Government of Quebec endorses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Since the 
telecommunications and broadcasting industries are fighting for 
the same turf, can the Prime Minister assure us that they will be 
treated in the same way when it comes to regulations on foreign 
ownership levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Haiti would be 100 per cent in Canadian hands and that the 
mandate was for four months only. Now we find out we are paying 
the entire bill, the mission may be extended, the mandate is

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

also under the United Nations.
<P>
	We were asked as a country to take responsibility for the 
command. Canadian Brigadier General Daigle is in command of 
the UN mission. He is also responsible for the additional forces we 
put in to supplement and ensure the mission had sufficient 
resources to continue to fulfil the task set for it. We are working 
exactly under the UN mandate as established by the security 
council. The Canadian troops that are there as auxiliaries are 
subject to exactly the same mandate. They both report to Canadian 
Brigadier General Daigle.

Speaker, last Saturday, <I>Le Soleil</I> quoted the Minister of Finance as 
saying in an interview that it was urgent for the federal government 
to invade the area of securities, an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, because Canada was losing its capital markets to New 
York and Chicago.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that what makes New York and 
Chicago attractive to Canadian investors is the greater savings 
available in the U.S. as well as higher prices for an initial issue of 
shares, and has nothing to do with purely political motives like his 
excessive taste for centralization that makes him interfere in this 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I never used the word ``invade''. I talked about 
co-operation, about creating partnerships and working together. In 
fact, the hon. member is right when he talks about the premium 
paid by American investors and the U.S. capital markets. There is a 
threat  not only to Canadian but also to European stock exchanges.
<P>
	That is why we must work together, we must co-operate. The 
idea is not to invade, but there is no doubt that it costs a great deal 
of money to send prospectuses to 10 provinces. We must find a 
way, as suggested by the Montreal business community, to 
co-operate to give the Canadian financial community a strong 
bargaining position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to justify his interference in the area of securities, the 
minister mentioned normal competition between stock exchanges 
but not reasons that might encourage investments in that area, 
something the minister could act on. One thing has strictly nothing 
to do with the other.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance not admit that there is no need for 
him to interfere in the area of securities, since all the problems he 
mentioned, including how complex the share issue process is, will 
be resolved by next September, when a harmonized system 
designed by the provinces will be put in place without the federal 
government getting involved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> The hon. 
member knows full well, Mr. Speaker, that we are in favour of 
harmonization, in terms of securities as well as taxation. That said, 
the situation is much more complicated and the problem much 
deeper that a mere matter of co-operation between stock 
exchanges.
<P>
	This is not my own observation but rather the observation of the 
Montreal stock exchange president. In fact, the vast majority of 
stock brokers operating in Montreal know very well that 
co-operation is necessary. That is what we want to do, and I do not 
understand why the Bloc Quebecois is stalled in the sixties. They 
must stop looking at the future with their rear-view mirror. We 
must give the people of Quebec and Canada the ability to compete

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
consultations may have taken place, but I am not sure that the 
minister followed up on what was said.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	I remind the minister that, last week, the commissioner himself 
admitted that the Coast Guard needs adequate impact studies 
regarding these new service fees.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that it is unthinkable to impose new 
service fees while being totally unaware of their impact on the

marine industry, including  shipowners in the St. Lawrence, and on 
related industries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member I would like to make 
three points.
<P>
	The first point is there is an agreement in principle that access to 
public facilities managed at public expense has to be charged a fee. 
The second point is we are graduating these marine service fees at 
$20 million, $40 million, $40 million, $60 million over a period of 
four years. I want to remind the hon. member that we are dealing 
with a service that cost $384 million and we are charging only $20 
million for it.
<P>
	The impact studies he talked about will be done between the 
imposition of the collection of the $20 million and the $40 million. 
There simply is not time to do all the studies. We have done the 
consultations. We will impose the fees. We will do the impact 
studies before we go into the $40 million fees for services that cost 
$384 million. That is not a bad deal.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a relevant question for the solicitor general.
<P>
	The people of Toronto are now familiar with what kind of 
garbage this Liberal government dumps in their back yards. West 
Toronto residents were outraged to learn last week that Bobby 
Oatway had been secretly flown into their neighbourhood, leaving 
B.C. at five o'clock in the morning to avoid outraged residents and 
victims in my riding.
<P>
	This pedophile originally faced 41 charges, mostly against 
children. Why did Corrections Canada shuttle this walking disaster 
out of B.C. and why were the Toronto police or the community 
advisory group in Toronto not advised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am informed that Oatway reached the statutory release period of 
his sentence.
<P>
	I am further informed that the Toronto police were advised that 
Mr. Oatway would be placed in the Keele centre the day before he 
arrived and that the advisory committee was informed the day after. 
I am further informed that Mr. Oatway is to be kept under strict 
supervision in the centre. The correctional service is taking his 
presence as a very serious matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is my point. This man is not rehabilitated and I have the 
corrections and parole documents to prove it. I have a couple of 
quotes. March 1996 from the parole  board: ``The concerns about 
your risk to reoffend remain'', and September 1994: ``The board 
concludes that you present an undue risk to reoffend, therefore day 
parole is denied''.
<P>
	Why will the solicitor general not give his people the tools they 
are asking for to keep our streets safe? Why will he not give them 
the power to keep pedophiles like this one behind bars until they 
can prove they are safe to law-abiding Canadian citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in point of fact as the hon. member has indicated, Oatway was not 
released on parole. He is in the statutory release period of his 
sentence. Furthermore, there is a provision in the new Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act whereby, if there is a referral for that 
purpose to the parole board, the parole board can rule that 
somebody in Mr. Oatway's category can be held to the end of their 
sentence.
<P>
	I further add that the Minister of Justice and I, after consultation 
with law enforcement and other groups, are working on measures 
to deal with the issue of post-sentence detention of high risk violent 
offenders. Furthermore, we do intend to bring forward a number of 
measures to make the dangerous offender provisions more easily 
usable by prosecutors at the time of conviction. We also indicated 
that we want to present to Parliament measures to create a new 
category of long term offender.
<P>
	If my hon. friend is serious about his concern, I look forward to 
him giving his full support to the measures we want to take to deal 
with public concerns about this kind of issue.

the work of the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton who, in the first

	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	In the throne speech, the government announced that it intended 
to introduce a bill on the protection of endangered species. When 
speaking to the media, the Minister of the Environment added that 
he was even prepared to extend the scope of the bill tabled by his 
predecessor, which for once respected Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	Is the minister aware of the serious warnings from the former 
Quebec environment minister to his predecessors, exhorting them 
not to provoke a new battle in an area of responsibility that comes 
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is correct that the government through 
its throne speech made a very determined effort to make the 
introduction of the endangered species legislation a priority. We 
make no apologies for that.
<P>
	This issue is not one which should be posed as being of 
federal-provincial jurisdiction. Rather, in addition to federal 
legislation, there should be a determination across the country to 
have a national framework in place so that those endangered 
species as well as their habitats may be protected and that the 
federal-provincial jurisdiction take second seat. Of all the issues 
the public responds to in my ministry, this is the one issue which 
elicits the strongest and most emotional response by adults and 
young children alike.

<P>
	The Krever inquiry is ready to make its final report and there are 
specific allegations that the federal government has done 
something wrong. If the federal government is innocent of all 
wrongdoing, why is it taking such forceful legal action to prevent 
Krever from making his report known to every single Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's description of 
what we are doing is not right.
<P>
	We have said from the outset that we have done nothing to 
interfere with Mr. Justice Krever's findings. If he has the intention 
of making findings of wrongdoing, that is entirely up to him. We 
have supported and encouraged the inquiry at all points.
<P>
	The only reason we are in court, and we are there on a very 
narrow ground, has to do with procedural fairness. We have made a 
submission to the court, which is best argued in court, with respect 
to the fairness of the way in which the commission went about its 
business in terms of providing late notice to certain individuals that 
they may have findings made against them.
<P>
	As to the right of the commissioner to make findings of 
wrongdoing, we have never argued with that. We are happy to have

<P>
	The GATT signing in Marrakech set in motion an ambitious 
round of trade talks to begin in 1999 aimed at agricultural 
subsidies, but also targeting state trading entities.
<P>
	Since department of agriculture officials have begun to use the 
term ``state trading entities'' when describing the Canadian Wheat 
Board, having done so recently at the CFA convention, has the 
government already decided to rid itself of the wheat board, the 
dairy commission and the supply management boards by defining 
them out of existence through GATT as it did with the Crow rate?

is no room for smugness or complacency.
<P>
	The attitude we have always adopted in Canada is one of great 
vigilance and care. We set and we enforce standards which are 
among the highest in the world. That is why we can say with 
confidence that Canada's meat supply is safe.
<P>
	Under our surveillance system BSE has not been detected in any 
domestic Canadian cattle herd. The one reported case, in 1993, 
occurred in an animal imported from the United Kingdom. During 
1993-94, as the House knows, the government took extraordinary 
measures to protect Canada's livestock industry and consumers to 
eradicate that disease in Canada, even though those measures were 
criticized by some, including both the opposition parties in the

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-7, an act to 
establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I thank the opposition parties for agreeing 
to proceed with Bill C-7 at exactly the point it had reached in the 
previous session of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The opposition's co-operation in this saves time, energy and 
money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also thank members of Parliament from all parties for their 
advice in making Bill C-7 a good piece of legislation. I am 
particularly grateful to members from my party for their ideas to 
ensure this bill offers Canadians modern, flexible, accessible, 
innovative, efficient, affordable and improved government 
services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1175"> 1175 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-7 merges a variety of related government operations into 
one department. The new Department of Public Works and 
Government Services delivers virtually  all common services to 
federal government departments and agencies. The bill creates a 
more streamlined, efficient and effective responsive department. It 
represents a rethinking of the delivery of government services to 
guarantee that new, alternative and better methods of service 
delivery are implemented. It represents an approach based on a 
spirit of partnership with other governments and the private sector.
<P>
	The legislation saves money for Canadian taxpayers through the 
reduction of office space and administration and the elimination of 
overlap and duplication. By placing several government services in 
one department we make it easier for Canadians to do business with 
the government and easier for Canadians to receive information 
from the government.
<P>
	The legislation provides single window access for suppliers and 
contractors to the government. It rationalizes government 
operations to provide specialized expertise and one stop service for 
client departments and Canadian citizens. It modernizes services to 
reflect the information age in which we live. It simplifies and 
strengthens the administration of federal programs and services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill affords the federal government greater flexibility and a 
broader choice of options for collaborating with provincial and 
territorial governments and the private sector. The new legislation 
will make it possible for the department to join with other levels of 
government, if they are agreeable, sharing premises, purchasing 
and support services.
<P>
	It will make it possible for the department to enter into 
partnership agreements with Canadian businesses in order to help 
them break into foreign markets, again if they wish to take 
advantage of that assistance. By consolidating programs, 
eliminating administrative constraints, stressing the essentials and 
taking advantage of the latest technology, the department will be in 
a position to effect rational and concrete changes, and thus to serve 
Canadians with equity, transparency and cost-effectiveness.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	We will be able to serve Canadians better, while at the same time 
reducing the department's budget by $353 million over three years. 
The number of employees will be reduced by 30 per cent over the 
next five years.
<P>
	The consolidation of skills and resources, the rationalization of 
systems, and the adoption of new service delivery approaches, are 
already making it possible to save money and to deliver improved 
services. By eliminating government office supply stores and 
warehouses, we have been able to cut 280 positions and to 
withdraw from that sector of activity.
<P>
	The direct deposit of salaries and payments has allowed us to 
reduce processing and mailing costs. In 1994-95, we saved $28 
million. Moreover, it is my pleasure to inform the members of the 
House that, since October 1995, as the result of an information 
campaign, more than 1.7 million recipients of federal government 
payments have registered for the direct deposit program, which 
means an additional saving of $7 million.
<P>
	At the moment, some 40 per cent of payments by my department 
are made directly. We are aiming for 60 per cent over the next three 
years, and resultant savings of approximately $44 million. I would 
like to thank all Canadians who have signed up for the direct 
deposit program. I invite all those who have not yet done so to take 
advantage of the program.
<P>
	Through agreements with other levels of government, we are 
able to combine purchases of medicines and vaccines in bulk, 
which means additional savings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those are exactly the kinds of practical and important 
partnership efforts stressed in the new speech from the throne. 
They are a fulfilment of our red book commitment ``to work 
closely with provincial governments to reduce duplication and 
improve service delivery in all areas where governments are 
involved''.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Sudbury, I know how 
important it is for small businesses in my community to be able to 
compete on a fair footing for government work. All Canadians 
know that a more competitive contracting system means a better 
deal for taxpayers.
<P>
	Through the electronic open bidding system, we are enabling 
Canadians from every part of the country to bid on government 
contracts and to know what contracts have been given to whom and 
for how much.
<P>
	Bill C-7 will require the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services to follow through with even more initiatives 
for enhancing integrity and efficiency in the contracting process.
<P>
	Passage of this bill will also guarantee that the work of the 
department in seeking to co-operate with other levels of 
government has legislative authority. This will give my department 
permission to enter into constructive partnering arrangements with 
the private sector in order to benefit small businesses in Canada 
and to serve the economic well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	It is important legislation to confirm the legal propriety of more 
than 70 bilateral discussions taking place with other governments 
to harmonize services for Canadians and reduce the cost of those 
services.
<P>
	My department certainly wants to be in a position to enter into 
even more common sense arrangements with other Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1176"> 1176 </A></B>
<P>
governments in the important fields of  informatics, realty services 
and procurement. That too will be authorized by Bill C-7.
<P>
	I cannot stress too much how essential it is for my department to 
work in harmony with other governments. It is essential for the 
department to work in harmony with the private sector as well. My 
department is not, should not and will not be in the business of 
competing with other Canadians. We are in the business of serving 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The legislation before the House underscores that point by 
stating explicitly that Public Works and Government Services 
Canada will enter into a partnering arrangement with a private 
sector firm only on request. I want to make it clear that my 
department will only offer its services to another level of 
government on request.
<P>
	Bill C-7 states that the department can enter into these kinds of 
co-operative arrangements with other levels of government or can 
partner with the private sector only on the approval of the federal 
cabinet. This ensures the kind of political accountability which 
Canadians expect from their government.
<P>
	What is really most exciting about this legislation is that it will 
allow the Department of Public Works and Government Services to 
advance the Team Canada approach so vigorously pursued by the 
Prime Minister at home and abroad. Through partnering initiatives 
with the provinces and territories, my department will help deliver 
high quality, low cost services to Canadians in all parts of our 
country. That is particularly important in areas of Canada such as 
northern Ontario where I come from. It is also particularly 
important in rural Canada.
<P>
	Through new partnerships with Canadian businesses, we will use 
the department's resources, credibility and know how to help 
Canadian firms reach new international markets, increase their 
exports and fuel the job creation which those exports make 
possible. That is particularly important for providing the future 
oriented employment we all want for young Canadians.
<P>
	This bill has received widespread support from professional 
organizations and industry groups in every corner of the country. 
We are changing the responsibilities of the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services today in order to serve the 
interests of Canadians tomorrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The passing of Bill C-17 does not mean that the way government 
services are administered will be cast in stone. On the contrary, the 
approach will be practical, flexible and intelligent. We will 
continue to modernize. We must continue to try alternate solutions 
to meet the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	The federal government, as the throne speech promised, can and 
will be open to change and must continue to find new ways to better 
serve Canadians.
<P>
	Right now, I am awaiting a report from my department on the 
planning, design and construction of architecture and engineering 
projects. The aim of the study is to determine which activities 
could be given to the private sector. The study is being done by a 
team of engineers, architects and technicians representing the 
private sector, unions and government.
<P>
	Through their co-operation, we will ensure that the government 
really serves Canadians.
<P>
	I know most Canadians are not aware of the details of this 
legislation, but I think I can fairly say that all Canadians would 
agree with the underlying objectives of the bill. We all want to stop 
wasting public funds. We all want government services to be 
effective, accessible, reliable and sensitive to our needs. We all 
want best value in terms of quality and price.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As members of Parliament, we want to move forward in 
rationalizing government services and in forging new partnerships 
with other governments. We want to be in a position to be an ally of 
Canadian businesses, particularly small businesses, in competing 
in a tough global market. We want to provide better services to 
Canadians, better access to those services, more efficiency from 
those services and new savings from those services.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	These objectives are the very essence of this legislation. That is 
why Bill C-7 should receive the support of all sides of the House of 
Commons. I encourage members to pass this bill with enthusiasm.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
participate in the debate at third reading of Bill C-7. This bill is in 
the same form as Bill C-52 of the first session of this Parliament. 
As a result of the government's manoeuvre, which was condemned 
by all opposition parties, this bill to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts is now at third reading.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' position is as follows. Since the beginning, 
the Bloc Quebecois has objected to this bill and based its approach 
on four points: amending the operating rules regarding financial 
commitments; establishing a code for contracting out; greater 
involvement by members of Parliament; and regular statements on 
the awarding of contracts. Let us go briefly over these four points.
<P>
	First of all, operating rules. We believe the federal government 
should set operating rules governing federal financial 
commitments. Under this process, all House of Commons 
committees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1177"> 1177 </A></B>
<P>
would be required to review four  times a year all government 
spending in the areas under their jurisdiction.
<P>
	This review of government spending would apply to all 
expenditures above $25,000. To set this process in motion, the 
federal government should follow the example set by the Quebec 
National Assembly, whose practices have proven very effective. 
Second, we ask that the bill clearly lay down a code for contracting 
out.
<P>
	Third, we demand that members of Parliament from all parties 
be consulted on or kept informed about the process for awarding 
government contracts in the ridings they represent.
<P>
	Finally, we ask that Public Works and Government Services 
Canada produce regular statements that clearly show the contracts 
awarded by the federal government and spell out its operating 
rules.
<P>
	There are other points with which the Bloc Quebecois disagrees. 
First, the fact that there is no way federal MPs can know what 
government contracts, if any, are carried out in their own riding. 
We have also suggested that the government make federal officials 
accountable for the expenditures they make, so that any 
discrepancies can be reported.
<P>
	We discussed the issue of advance payments, which result from a 
squandering of public funds at the end of every fiscal year of the 
department. Finally, we questioned the scope of the bill, which 
enables the department to offer its services to provincial and 
municipal governments.
<P>
	In the wake of the last budget, this would leave the door wide 
open to more duplication and squandering, the two main causes of 
our being in debt, a debt that will amount to $600 billion in 
1996-97.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at this bill, as third reading calls for 
taking stock of this government action. First of all, regarding the 
code of conduct to ensure the acquisition method's transparency. 
The main amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois was to 
reject the bill, because it did not provide for the establishment of a 
specific code of conduct to make transparent the method of 
procurement, for all goods and services purchased by the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	This was a major amendment in that its purpose was to 
completely change how the public, experts and elected 
representatives have access to information on government 
expenditures made through the department.
<P>
	The approach favoured by the Bloc Quebecois was based on 
transparency as regards the money the government and its 
administration spend within the government and the work they 
contract out.
<P>
	At present, both outside of government or within the public 
service, anyone who tries to get more information  is confronted to 
this huge labyrinth and cannot get the information he or she is 
looking for. This bill will not solve this problem.
<P>
	Another factor is definitely the complex structures and the 
technical terms that considerably hamper the research process and 
dampen the spirits of those interested in knowing what 
governments do with public funds.
<P>
	The public service in general and the department in particular 
have created impressive obstacles to confuse those who try to 
understand how the federal administration allocates government 
contracts.
<P>
	There are countless entrepreneurs who try to get contracts, but 
are unable to figure out all the intricacies of the government 
structure.
<P>
	And there are also many who contact their MP to complain either 
about the process, the eligibility criteria, or the contracts awarded, 
because they feel the system is unfair.
<P>
	Also, given the current legislation on the financing of federal 
political parties, any company or legal entity can contribute to the 
election fund of a federal political party, without any limit being 
imposed.
<P>
	This lack of limit poses a number of risks. Financing political 
parties can help companies establish close links with the 
government and it can open doors for them.
<P>
	Greater transparency and simplicity in the awarding process 
would no doubt help avoid such situations, and would provide all 
Canadians and Quebecers with a fair and easily accessible system.
<P>
	The same logic applies in the case of lobbyists. Lobbyists are 
very powerful people because the companies or the interests they 
represent have provided financial help to political parties, which 
have thus become indebted to them.
<P>
	It is for all these reasons that the Bloc Quebecois was in favour 
of rules to monitor the federal government's financial 
commitments. However, the latter always turned a deaf ear to that 
suggestion.
<P>
	Let us now look at contracting out. Over the last few years, there 
has been a definite trend showing that the federal public service is 
relying increasingly more on contracting out.
<P>
	For the year 1992-93 alone, the Treasury Board estimated at $5.2 
billion the total dollar figure for that activity.
<P>
	During the period from 1984-85 to 1992-93, all contracting out 
activities, whether for professional, computer or maintenance 
services, experienced unprecedented growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1178"> 1178 </A></B>
<P>
	With the downsizing of the public service, that activity is bound 
to grow even more.
<P>
	Such a level of spending should be subject to some guidelines 
reflecting the federal government's future plans in that regard.
<P>
	The stakes are too high for federal public servants, contracting 
firms and Canadians to leave that issue in limbo indefinitely.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would have liked the bill to set provisions, 
rules, or a legal framework forcing the government to properly 
oversee the contracting out process and make it more transparent. 
Such a monitoring system would also have to be suited to all those 
involved in this important process.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Both the government and public servants, and the general public 
will agree that such a code would be useful, because it would 
facilitate relations between the government and its employees, on 
the one hand, and would ensure that contracting out does not take 
place in an unclear context, which would certainly please the 
public.
<P>
	A modern government uses modern means to meet the 
expectations of the public. There is no doubt that contracting out is 
still one such means. A way must be found to get a better handle on 
it so that it is an acceptable part of our everyday affairs. At the 
present time, contracting out is seen by public servants and unions 
as a formidable adversary and an ideological enemy that must be 
eliminated.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves why this perception of contracting out is 
so persistent? The reason is very simple. Contracting out is feared 
because it is uncontrollable, both in its present form and in its 
present volume.
<P>
	As long as the federal government refuses to state clearly what 
its contracting out policies are now, and how it will go about 
contracting out in the future, the climate will continue to be 
unhealthy, aggressive and potentially explosive. It must be 
recognized that approaches to this issue are so divergent that the 
department will have to ask some serious questions.
<P>
	The ideological differences are so great that they could lead to a 
crisis for the government, which has unfortunately not followed the 
Bloc's proposal to include in this bill sensible legislative 
provisions for the management of contracting out, with the 
emphasis on transparency, so that all stakeholders would have their 
concerns addressed.
<P>
	In my opinion, contracting out ought to be guided by three 
factors: healthy competition, the specialized or uncommon nature 
of the product or service, and the need for a greater or lesser 
volume than usually available resources can provide. The question 
of contracting out is not merely the result of the current situation, 
but a trend  that threatens good management and proper operation 
of the federal public service.
<P>
	The third point: consultation of all federal MPs. It is important 
that all be given a sense of responsibility and kept informed and/or 
consulted about the awarding of contracts in their ridings. 
Regardless of their political stripe, all MPs are elected 
representatives and have been delegated with the legislative 
representation of their riding. Their jurisdiction is more than just 
legislative, in that when called upon to decide affairs of the state, 
there are obviously concrete administrative consequences as well.
<P>
	Elected representatives are consulted in the House, called upon 
to vote on a considerable number of items, but denied the means of 
checking out in their ridings whether the state's decisions are in 
line with House recommendations and legislation.
<P>
	Public expenditures fall in this category. Elected representatives 
have the right to question the government on all expenditures by 
the public administration, and ministers back up the administrative 
decisions from their departments. How then can an MP fully and 
worthily fulfil his role in the House, if he or she lacks the means to 
really find out what the federal public administration is doing in his 
or her riding?
<P>
	In a word, I cannot understand why, in this day and age of 
modern telecommunications, MPs' offices cannot find out which 
companies in their ridings are responding to calls for tenders. Are 
they really meeting the criteria of these calls for tender?
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In the Standing Committee on Government Operations, a Liberal 
member mentioned that he had managed to change a decision to 
move a Canada Post warehouse and thus saved the public treasury 
$1 million. All to his credit. However, the fact that this member 
knew what was happening in his riding is due to his having seen the 
call for tender inviting companies to bid on the contract. He had not 
been advised of this expenditure. By chance, or through research, 
he learned that projects involving this sort of expenditure were 
happening in his riding. How easy and logical it would be if this 
member, and all members, could be informed of government 
expenditures in their respective ridings. No one can say our 
proposal would be costly to manage. One single example of the 
type I have just mentioned represents a significant saving.
<P>
	In short, to conclude this point, I would like to suggest that all 
members' offices have access, without additional cost, to all calls 
for tenders and all contracts. This sort of mechanism should have 
been in place long ago.
<P>
	Public officials have a responsibility too. We have information 
that certain states are considering the right to report public waste. 
Without going into a whole lot of detail, this principle should be 
debated in this House,  particularly because the bill concerns the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1179"> 1179 </A></B>
<P>
concludes most of the government's contracts for goods and 
services.
<P>
	Questioning government expenditures from outside is certainly a 
good way to control public spending. This is what we were driving 
at earlier. However, for the picture to be complete, questioning 
must also come from inside on the practicality of the department's 
expenditures. This is what we proposed and what the government 
rejected.
<P>
	We continue to believe that a mechanism giving public servants 
the right to report wastage of public funds should be put in place 
and this right promoted. For the major part, public expenditures are 
initiated or paid by public servants themselves, which is within the 
scope of their duties in the public service. However, the workings 
of the federal government, just as the workings of other western 
governments, are not perfect and one can easily imagine that all 
kinds of useless expenditures are made on a regular basis.
<P>
	To sum up this paragraph, this act would have allowed public 
servants to blow the whistle on the government for spending 
millions of dollars during the campaign leading to the October 30 
referendum, which was contrary to the Quebec Referendum Act.
<P>
	The auditor general's reports are a delight for those who enjoy 
learning about the federal government's useless expenditures. 
There is no other way to become aware of useless internal 
expenditures. Moreover, too often, the government takes forever to 
follow up on the auditor's analysis and recommendations. We 
might consider legislation to compel the government of the day to 
act on the auditor's report. This is my suggestion.
<P>
	Other measures should be put in place and we would have hoped 
that the review of this bill would have provided the opportunity to 
do so. But as is often the case, the government did not answer the 
call of common sense.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Let us move on to federal advance payments. An advance 
payment amounts to making the most of the resources available to 
a departmental service so that it has access to the same level of 
resources in the following budget year. This practice is used by 
public service employees and managers responsible for providing 
services for fear that, if they do not use all the resources at their 
disposal, their annual budget will be cut.
<P>
	I have a suggestion to make in this regard. Why should the 
budget rules imposed on members of Parliament not also apply to 
all departments? We as members of Parliament can carry up to 5 
per cent of our annual budgets over to the following year without 
suffering any cuts simply because we did not spend our whole 
budgets. On the other hand, we are responsible for any  
overbudgeting. Why should public service managers not have the 
same accountability?
<P>
	Why should members of Parliament be responsible for their 
budgets in their ridings but not the government? These are all 
questions that deserve answers.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that, when establishing the Department 
of Public Works and Government Services and amending and 
repealing certain acts, the government missed a great opportunity 
to address the real problems, and especially to help resolve these 
problems. This is unfortunate. The four points that we brought to 
its attention and on which we expected developments have not been 
heard.
<P>
	The government will not establish a code of ethics guaranteeing 
the transparency of procurement methods. The government will not 
establish a code for contracting out. The government will not 
increase consulting mechanisms for all members of Parliament. 
The government will not take steps to make public servants more 
accountable.
<P>
	In a word, the government will continue to make promises it 
does not keep and to ignore the comments of others. It overlooks 
solutions that could work wonders, perhaps because the 
government is not the solution but the problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-7, formerly Bill 
C-52 which was presented to the House back in 1993. Just a scant 
three years later we are looking for approval of provisions for 
which most in fact are probably already in place.
<P>
	I do not want to dwell on this subject for an extended length of 
time because the bill was introduced and then became C-7 in 1994 
and the changes within the bill are already in place. However, I 
would like to make a few points about the bill and the practices of 
the department in general.
<P>
	I and my party have some serious reservations about particular 
sections of the bill which appear to give the minister unlimited 
discretion with respect to fees, business practices and other 
operations within the ministry which in itself is sort of scary. As a 
matter of fact, I have received quite a number of letters, faxes and 
calls from people who have concerns in relation to those aspects of 
the bill.
<P>
	Clause 16 is particularly worrisome because of the broad range 
of powers it implies and gives to the minister. It states that ``the 
minister may do anything for or on behalf of'', and then it enters 
into a number of conditions. Given the history of the Liberal 
government when it has such a free rein, that can present a scary 
situation to a lot of people who are concerned about how the 
government spends money.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1180"> 1180 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Given the government's penchant for spending money and its 
history of giving choice favours, if I may use that word or we can 
call it patronage, to friends of the government, giving a minister 
this kind of leeway and discretion is particularly worrisome to 
ourselves and indeed to many Canadians.
<P>
	Clause 16(b) states that public works can do anything for ``any 
government, body or person in Canada or elsewhere''. The term 
``in Canada or elsewhere'' is rather questionable. I thought the 
purpose of any government in Canada was to serve Canadians.
<P>
	Why would this minister seek to have a provision that would 
allow the minister to do things on behalf of Canadians with people 
outside the country when we are talking about government 
operations and public works? The focus should be to deal within 
Canada in any area.
<P>
	Why is the government giving powers to a department entering 
into contracts with foreign governments, companies or 
individuals? We have all those resources here in Canada.
<P>
	One of the most worrisome parts of this bill is that the 
government appears to be and is getting involved in providing 
services that are already available in the private sector. It is our 
opinion that the government should not be competing with the 
private sector. The provisions of this bill allow it to do exactly that.
<P>
	We question why the government would want to get involved in 
competition with the private sector which pays taxes, tries to do 
business in this country, provides jobs for Canadians, provides a 
living for the owners and tries to build a company. Instead, the 
private sector comes up against a government that is competing 
with its own tax dollars and generally far more resources than any 
private sector company has in this country. That is a real concern of 
ours.
<P>
	Clause 16 also permits the minister to do what he or she pleases 
with whom he or she pleases. That is scary in itself. One can apply 
that principle to any of the functions that might occur in that 
department.
<P>
	When we give a minister that kind of wide ranging power to do 
what he or she pleases with whomever he or she pleases, given the 
history of the Liberals' penchant for spending money, giving away 
very lush government contracts to friends of Liberals and 
appointing friends of Liberals to very well paying positions, we 
have to ask if this power is excessive. Should it not be curtailed 
more?
<P>
	We have put forward amendments that would address these wide 
ranging powers and the freedom they give by curtailing the 
department's ability to compete with the private sector first. 
However, as history will show, when we put through common sense 
amendments they are defeated by the government. This is curious 
since the government operations committee just released a  
preliminary report on the contracting process entitled: ``Small 
Business is our Business''. The report flies in the face of what this 
bill intends to do.
<P>
	One of the main findings of the report is that more contracts 
should be awarded to small and medium size businesses. It sounds 
good to me. However, here we have Bill C-7 which permits the 
government to enter into direct competition with those very 
enterprises the report states it should be doing more business with.
<P>
	In our opinion, the government should have adopted the 
amendments put forward by the Reform Party which would have 
been in line with the report ``Small Business is our Business''. We 
think it should have listened and should listen to the committee and 
prevent the department from competing against the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Many letters have been written to many MPs in this House from 
private sector companies, whether they be small or medium size 
companies, stating their distress about the fact that the government 
can and is entering into competition with them using their own tax 
dollars to do so. Reformers believe these companies have a very 
legitimate concern. Why should their own government compete 
directly with them?
<P>
	The government should have adopted some of the amendments 
put forward by Reformers and it should have listened to its own 
standing committee which dealt with this and provided a number of 
recommendations.
<P>
	Ultimately the government should be downsizing the department 
and getting out of those areas that are controlled and well served by 
the private sector. Why should the government be involved in areas 
of operation that are served very well by the private sector 
business? However, we see the reverse when we examine Bill C-7.
<P>
	The government operations committee identified a number of 
areas of concern with respect to the department that are not 
addressed in this bill. For instance, the committee was concerned 
that 40 per cent of the contracts, worth about $3.5 billion, given out 
by the government were sole source. In other words, those 
contracts did not go out to public tender. They were just given out 
with no tendering process to particular firms. Nothing in this bill 
addresses this situation.
<P>
	As members know, sole sourcing can very easily lead to abuses 
within the system. This was one of the things we discussed at 
length in the standing committee. There were a lot of concerns 
from Liberal members themselves about sole sourcing of 
government contracts. We discussed it before the House prorogued 
and before the government decided to take an extra holiday in 
February. We were prepared to deal with it and hopefully we will 
now get back to dealing with it in committee. We will send more 
recommendations to the government in the hope that it will start to 
listen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1181"> 1181 </A></B>
<P>
	The committee recommended that Treasury Board and public 
works draft a code of conduct for contracting out which would 
lay out very strict guidelines on how contracting out would be 
done by the government. However, the committee report went 
further by stating that the reporting framework for contracting 
needs had to be significantly revised.
<P>
	In all, there is a great deal of concern over the contracting 
process. What really concerned us was the amended tenders, the 
amendments that could be made to contracts given out by the 
government. In other words, someone can bid a price and after they 
have the contract they can go back to the government at the local 
level and request their tender or bid price be amended. How could 
any private business ever operate like this?
<P>
	When I was in business, after an agreement was made to 
purchase something from a supplier, a price was quoted, the deal 
was made and we agreed to it. However, the situation here is that 
the government can put out a contract, someone can bid on it and 
win the bid and then turn around and ask for an amendment. Given 
that the contract is at a certain level, say $30,000 and under, the 
decision to amend the contract can be made locally within the 
region. We feel this opens up the process to all forms of abuse and 
we asked in committee to have it dealt with. We see nothing in the 
bill that deals with it. We hope that when the committee deals with 
it again some of the recommendations that come forward might be 
added into this bill as amendments.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Even though the committee's work is fairly recent, we are all 
well aware of some of these problems that are hounding the 
government's contracting procedures. I talked about the contract 
amendments which add on to the contracts and drive the price 
higher than what the original agreement was.
<P>
	To talk about that for a moment, there are some astounding 
figures. For example, in 1990 contract amendments totalled $602 
million. These are not the original prices; these are the add-ons. By 
1993, in just a short three years, once the people who were 
submitting the bids found out how to work the loophole in the 
system which allowed for contracting amendments and get around 
the contracting process, the amendments went from $602 million in 
1990 to a staggering $1.8 billion in 1993. That is totally 
unacceptable. No private sector operation could even dream of 
operating in that way.
<P>
	This is another situation we feel the Liberals and the House of 
Commons have to deal with immediately. Reform has been talking 
about this situation for almost three years now. There have to be 
more controls to safeguard the public purse. We cannot allow the 
discretionary power within the department that exists. It is open to 
all forms of abuse.
<P>
	There really are no procedures in place other than this discretion 
that will really safeguard the public purse. These are tax dollars we 
are working with. These tax dollars are given to the government by 
hard working Canadians who want to see their tax dollars spent in a 
prudent fashion. Let us never forget that the tax dollars are 
basically funds paid into trust by Canadians. The government 
should regard taxpayers' money as a sacred trust and should do 
everything it can so that there is no question by Canadians as to 
how the government spends that money.
<P>
	Whereas there should be more controls to protect the public 
purse, Bill C-7 in fact increases the power of the department and 
the minister and loosens control. What on earth is this government 
thinking about when it puts in a bill like this and when it asks its 
members-let me rephrase that-when it tells its members to 
support a bill like this?
<P>
	The department is famous for being partial in its provision of 
information which at best is very difficult to receive. Reformers put 
forward amendments which would ensure that the disclosure of 
information was complete and easily accessible which is not 
unreasonable. Our party appears to be the only one in the House 
concerned about how taxpayers' dollars are spent by this 
government. We asked that information on how the money is being 
spent be easily accessible. We asked for that in the form of an 
amendment. The Liberal government in an effort to protect its little 
empire, which gives it all sorts of powers to spend money and 
reward friends, defeated our amendment which asked for 
accessibility.
<P>
	What kind of a message does that send to the Canadian 
taxpayers, who as we all know are among the highest, if not the 
highest taxed wage earners in the whole world? What kind of 
message does that send to the people who are paying taxes, that this 
government will not allow a party like the Reform Party, who want 
to be the guardians of the taxpayers' money, or for that matter any 
other interested and concerned people access to how the 
government departments spend their money? It is a very poor 
message indeed. We put forward the amendment for disclosure. It 
was defeated by the government.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	When we consider that $9 billion was spent on contracting last 
year, we think the public has a right to know exactly how the 
money is being spent. However, Bill C-7 does not address this 
issue. It is almost laughable. For all the Liberal government's talk 
about transparency and openness, all the promises it made on the 
campaign trail and in the red book about being transparent and 
open, the public still has difficulty obtaining information from the 
department of public works.
<P>
	Forget about the public having difficulty; Reform members have 
difficulty obtaining the information we want in order to check on 
how the government is  spending the money. I have requested 
information through access to information a number of times only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1182"> 1182 </A></B>
<P>
to obtain about one-tenth of what I requested and even that was 
blanked out in many cases. What kind of a message does that send 
to Canadians?
<P>
	All of this reminds me of a related issue, which is the 
privatization of Canada Communication Group I spoke about in the 
House the other day. Canada Communication Group falls under the 
control of the department of public works. In July 1995 the 
minister announced that it would be privatized. In some respects 
we do not have much of a problem with privatization if it is going 
to save money and increase efficiency. We thought we would wait 
to see how it was going to work.
<P>
	The government struck a committee to advise it on a process 
which was to be fair, open and transparent. The committee was to 
advise the government on how the privatization should be 
implemented. The process was going to be open, fair and 
transparent, as the government says it would like to be some day. 
We and the public have yet to hear from that committee. Equally 
distressing, as I understand it the committee is reporting to the 
minister behind closed doors on an as required basis.
<P>
	What happened to the fair, open and transparent process which 
was to be the committee's criteria? There has never been a report 
from the committee which has been made public. It is reporting 
only to the minister who at her discretion can advise Parliament as 
to how the privatization implementation is proceeding.
<P>
	All of this is very disturbing to our party and to concerned 
Canadians who want a little more openness with respect to how 
their dollars are being spent. Once again the Liberal government 
promised one thing but did another. That is why we must be wary 
of the Liberals' promise that Bill C-7 does not confer broad powers 
on the minister. I would suggest that it does exactly that.
<P>
	Furthermore, when the bill was before the government 
operations committee in November 1994, it was rammed through 
in typical Liberal fashion by the Liberal majority sitting on the 
committee. Amendments and witnesses were put forward by 
Reform. We submitted our lists, we submitted our amendments and 
the Liberals on the committee refused every one of them. So much 
for openness and transparency. So much for wanting to make 
available information on how the government operates.
<P>
	One has to ask, what is the government afraid of? Why does it 
not want the Reform Party looking into the way it spends 
taxpayers' dollars? Why does it not want Canadians to have an 
understanding of how it spends taxpayers' dollars? Is the 
government trying to hide something?
<P>
	We have seen contracting out. There is a company that does a lot 
of business with the government. SNC Lavelin is a very well 
known Quebec company that does a lot of  business with Canada 
Post and other departments, including Transport Canada. It is a big 
company with a zillion subsidiaries and is involved in a zillion 
consortia.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I have been trying to find out why this company is getting so 
many government contracts. I know it has been getting them for 
years, contract after contract, untendered for the most part. It has 
received a number of multimillion dollar contracts from Canada 
Post through its subsidiaries, SLS Corp. and Clientech and others 
with no tendering process in place.
<P>
	We can talk about the contract for the mine sweepers for the 
coast guard on the east coast. Fenco MacLaren, a company which 
bid on the work to be done for the government, outbid Halifax 
shipyards. I was not involved in the committee that was looking 
into that but I found out that Fenco MacLaren is not even a 
shipyard. I thought it strange that a company that does not even 
own a shipyard could get a huge government contract which 
common sense dictates must go to a shipyard. Yet Halifax 
shipyards which bid on the contract did not get it. Lo and behold, in 
looking into the research data on Fenco MacLaren what do I see? It 
is owned by SNC Lavelin. Well, my questions have been answered 
so far. We will delve into that one a little more, let the Liberal 
members be aware and particularly the minister who was in charge 
of that one.
<P>
	The Liberals promise one thing and they do another. We put 
through common sense amendments to open up the process to what 
is going on and to make it more transparent and the Liberals shoot 
it down.
<P>
	The amendments and the witnesses we proposed to the 
committee were refused by the Liberal members. They wanted to 
get out of the committee as soon as possible. They did not want a 
detailed examination of Bill C-7 in any way, shape or form. They 
rammed it through committee and let it flounder on the Order Paper 
for about 16 months.
<P>
	The bill appears to be largely administrative but as I noted 
earlier, members should have some real concerns about some of the 
power conferred on the minister. Members should be asking why 
the bill permits the government to compete with the private sector. 
Why? If the government is so serious about creating jobs and 
helping small business as it claims in the flyer ``Small Business is 
our Business'', it would not allow particular clauses in the bill 
which allow it to compete with private sector small business to go 
forward.
<P>
	I urge MPs who are concerned about job creation and the health 
of the small business sector to vote against the bill. Even Liberal 
members who feel this way are invited to vote against the bill as 
well. I know Reformers are going to be voting against the bill 
because we have serious concerns about the powers that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1183"> 1183 </A></B>
<P>
bestowed  upon the minister and her department. Reformers will 
certainly not be supporting the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We are now entering the 
next stage of debate where members will have 20 minute 
maximums for their interventions subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
rising to speak on Bill C-7 I cannot help but note that this very 
straightforward piece of legislation has been under consideration 
by the House of Commons for a very long time. Members of 
Parliament have had the opportunity to examine the bill very 
closely and they have made a number of suggestions to improve the 
bill. That was very much welcomed by the government.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Key amendments have been put in place to satisfy the legitimate 
concerns that have been brought forward through the process. I 
hope that now, with a sense of goodwill on all sides, we can move 
forward to pass this legislation which has, at its very heart, the 
basic goals of providing Canadians with savings, efficiency and 
improvement in services.
<P>
	Passage of this legislation will enshrine in law the merging of a 
variety of related government operations into one department. The 
Department of Public Works and Government Services delivers 
virtually all common services to government departments and 
agencies.
<P>
	In essence, the bill creates a more streamlined, efficient, 
effective and responsive department. The department saves money 
for Canadian taxpayers through the reduction of office space and 
administration, and the elimination of overlap and duplication.
<P>
	The federal government is by far the largest purchaser of goods 
and services in the country. Public Works and Government 
Services Canada is responsible for the orderly processing of about 
65 per cent of federal procurement. Clearly the move toward a 
more consolidated approach to government purchasing is of benefit 
to all concerned.
<P>
	It provides a single window access for suppliers and contractors 
to the government. It rationalizes government operations to 
provide specialized expertise and one stop service for client 
departments. It modernizes services to reflect the information age 
in which we live. It simplifies and strengthens the administration of 
federal programs and services.
<P>
	As a government we have made a firm commitment to all 
Canadians that we will provide them with an administration that is 
efficient, innovative, co-operative and fair. Canadians are rightly 
concerned about the cost of government at all levels.
<P>
	They are aware that overlap, duplication and poor co-ordination 
with other levels of government have contributed to the tax burden 
that they must bear. They expect, and they demand, that we take 
every measure possible to streamline government operations, 
reduce administration costs, cut out red tape and improve service 
delivery of government programs.
<P>
	Bill C-7 responds directly to these challenges. The bill 
modernizes government services so that the federal government 
can concentrate on doing what it does best and most cost 
effectively and leave the rest for those who can do better. The 
department has had to rationalize all of its operations to achieve 
these savings, efficiencies and improved services.
<P>
	For the department this has meant taking advantage of new 
technology. For example, thanks to more powerful computers, laser 
printers and developing technologies the number of cheque 
production centres in the country has been reduced from 11 to 4. 
This means annual savings of $4.8 million after implementation.
<P>
	Efficiency means cutting costs but it also means whenever 
possible improving services. That is why the department has 
moved to make direct deposit the standard method of payment. 
This means annual savings of $20 million to Canadian taxpayers 
and at the same time increased security, privacy and convenience 
for recipients of payments. Efficiency means providing equal 
access to all suppliers to government.
<P>
	Through the electronic open bidding service we are enabling 
Canadians from every part of the country to bid on government 
contracts and to know what contracts have been given to whom and 
for how much. The open bidding service is a nationally accessible 
service which 25 other departments and crown corporations as well 
as the provincial governments of New Brunswick, Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta have chosen to use 
to advertise their procurement needs as well. It is sort of a one stop 
centre. This is a good example of co-operation between various 
levels of government in an effort to reduce overlap and duplication.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Through the open bidding service, the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services has long sought to provide a 
single window for suppliers on the estimated $57 billion Canadian 
public sector market from all levels of government. We are very 
optimistic that this can be achieved through this process.
<P>
	Throughout the examination of Bill C-7, considerable attention 
has also been directed toward the availability of procurement 
information and the integrity of the system. Members and the 
public in general want to easily and effectively monitor 
government spending and ensure that contracts for goods and 
services are entered into in a fair and reasonable manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1184"> 1184 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government agrees that the procurement processes 
must be, and be seen to be honest, open and fair. If government 
is to play a positive role in society, honesty and integrity in 
political institutions is a definite requirement.
<P>
	To this end, we promised to restore the public's confidence when 
we said in the red book: ``Open government will be the watchword 
for the Liberal program''. Since being elected 28 months ago, 
ministers have insisted on the highest standards of integrity and 
honesty in fulfilling their mandate. On that, members can refer to 
the speech from the throne on February 27, 1996. The government 
has taken many concrete steps to make openness and integrity a 
prime focus within the procurement process.
<P>
	As already mentioned, the government has stressed the 
importance of the open bidding system. Not only is this system 
efficient, not only does it reduce the paper burden and lower the 
cost to the taxpayers, it also ensures that everyone with an interest 
has access to the government's contracting requirements.
<P>
	This service is available not only to companies that do business 
or would like to do business with the government, but also to 
members of Parliament, provincial governments, the media or any 
Canadian citizen that wishes to track the course of government 
purchasing. What could be more open, fair and transparent than 
that?
<P>
	In May 1994, a couple of years ago, guidelines were issued to 
regulate for the first time a fair and open regime for the purchase of 
advertising and public opinion research. Regulations were also 
brought in to curb the power of lobby groups to influence decisions 
regarding government purchasing.
<P>
	One of the amendments that has been incorporated in the bill 
requests the minister to investigate and develop services for 
increasing efficiency and economy and ``for enhancing integrity 
and efficiency in the contracting process''.
<P>
	Dealing fairly and honestly with the thousands of Canadian 
individuals and companies that do business with the government is 
a matter of very high priority. The public sector, at all levels of 
government, is under intense public scrutiny today. Canadians 
demand that governments not only control their expenditures but 
that they operate openly so that the public may judge the 
effectiveness of their operations.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
meeting this challenge by providing equal access to the federal 
market by showing fairness in awarding contracts and by ensuring 
that contracting information is available and acceptable, whether 
accessible to all Canadians in the most efficient and cost effective 
way.
<P>
	The government has taken these positive measures by operating 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services under 
order in council. The passage of this legislation will give 
parliamentary approval to that government decision.
<P>
	The government wants to move forward in rationalizing its 
services. It wants to provide better service to Canadians, better 
access to those services, more efficiency from those services and 
new savings from those services.
<P>
	Bill C-7, an act to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services is a good bill made better by the suggestions 
of members of this House. I ask for support to give it speedy 
passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments made by my 
colleague, the parliamentary secretary. I have two or three 
questions that I would like to address to the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	First, I wonder how Bill C-7 accomplishes what the business 
community has requested for some time, a fair and equitable 
method of tendering for projects, regardless of size. Second, what 
is the amount of the estimated savings proposed as a result of this 
new bill and its amalgamation efforts? Finally, does the bill address 
our concerns of duplication of effort and if so, how will this be 
accomplished? Perhaps the parliamentary secretary might like to 
comment on those questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the questions from my 
colleague.
<P>
	We are talking about a lot of money when we talk about savings. 
After this bill reaches its ultimate effectiveness, savings will be in 
the neighbourhood of $180 million by fiscal year 1997-98. To all 
taxpayers in the country that means a lot of savings.
<P>
	I will give a micro example of that. I spoke about the direct 
deposit system. By directly depositing cheques the government 
save money on postage, bank fees and paper. Already about 40 per 
cent of government employees are enrolled in direct depositing. 
We would like to have that up to about 60 per cent in two or three 
years. Just that one initiative alone saves about $20 million. Twenty 
million dollars here and another million dollars there and it all adds 
up. In total it adds up to about $180 million.
<P>
	Businesses know that the government is a big business. The 
government is involved in a lot of procurement. A lot of contracts 
have to be made out or extended. It works out to about 1,000 
contracts a day, big and small. It is incredible. Businesses people 
want a system that is open, fair, transparent and above board. 
Through this open bidding system that is what they get.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1185"> 1185 </A></B>
<P>
	Business people want information. They will make the 
judgments. To make the judgments they have to have  information. 
All federal contracts are available on OBS. A number of provincial 
governments are tied into the system. It is all there: the price of 
contracts, the intentions of contracts to be let and so on. It is an 
enormous repository of information for business people.
<P>
	In my humble opinion businesses are very happy with the kind of 
information that is made available to them. From time to time there 
may be difficulties. When dealing with a department that is as large 
as this and with a market that is worth billions and billions of 
dollars, it is hard to be perfect. There are going to be times when 
there are differences of opinion. In the main, Canadian businesses 
are very happy and very supportive of the open bidding service. I 
am glad that it is in place.
<P>
	The minister wants the system to work even better. Nothing on 
the face of the earth cannot be improved. If it is made by human 
beings there will always be imperfections because we are 
imperfect, so we are looking for ways of improving the system. If 
there is a way to do it, if there is a way to save money, that is our 
objective, that is our target and that is exactly what we will do.
<P>
	I appreciate the question from my hon. colleague.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have a few questions to ask and also a few comments to make 
following the remarks my hon. colleague just made. The hon. 
member responsible for the Standing Committee on Public Works, 
who just spoke, chaired the Standing Committee on Public Works 
during both sessions of this government's mandate.
<P>
	He reminded us that the Liberal government was elected to put 
an end to squandering and to administer public funds efficiently. I 
think that there is a far cry between the government intentions, as 
described in the red book, and reality.
<P>
	First, I think that the best way of eliminating waste or 
squandering is through a procurement policy. The government 
should have its procurement policies in writing.
<P>
	We know that the vast majority of government procurement 
transactions are conducted through tender or electronic bulletin 
board. I sat on the committee, and the Bloc Quebecois suggested 
that, to procure goods, materials and services, the government use, 
in addition to the electronic bulletin board, ads or public notices 
published in newspapers to ensure that it gets the best prices and 
that many people have the chance to bid and show their products to 
the government.
<P>
	We know that, at present, only those who subscribe to the 
bulletin board can get referrals and know the government's 
requirements in order to bid.
<P>
	In my riding of Charlevoix, there are people who would like to 
bid to offer their products or services, but they do not have the 
equipment required to offer their products or services to the 
government.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me something. Does he 
intend to set himself the goal, in the performance of his duties, of 
bringing the government or the ministerial side to commit to going 
to public tender, after specifications have been drawn up, and to 
awarding the contract to the lowest bidder that meets the 
requirements?
<P>
	Also, will there be a written material management policy? Will 
there be policies regarding equipment inventory? Let me give you 
an example for the benefit of hon. members. In my constituency 
office, in Charlevoix, I have only one person working for me, an 
assistant. When the government furnished my office, in December 
1993, I was told that I was entitled to three computers. ``Why am I 
entitled to three computers if I have only one employee, I asked? 
All I want is one computer, but a good, efficient and efficient one''. 
``No, based on government policy, on House of Commons rules, 
you need three computers, came the answer''. So three computers 
were installed: it took them a week to install three computers, two 
of which are never used. Just think of the costs of materials and 
labour.
<P>
	This was under previous government policies. And even if this 
government was elected to eliminate waste, as promised in the red 
book, nothing came of it. Today, the same policies apply within the 
House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the observations made 
by my hon. colleague from Quebec. He has a concern about waste, 
as he should as a member of Parliament. All members on both sides 
of the House are concerned about waste.
<P>
	Over the decades all governments have had reputations of waste. 
I can say with enthusiasm that this government and especially the 
minister, since I am talking about the new Department of Public 
Works and Government Services, want to hear about waste.
<P>
	I will not stand in my place and pretend everything works 
absolutely perfectly. When there is waste, when there is 
inefficiency, when there is a better way of doing things we want to 
hear about it.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I would always invite the hon. member whenever he comes 
across examples of inefficiencies to bring them to our attention. It 
is a big department and things will not always work well. I would 
be more than happy to entertain concerns, whether relatively small 
or relatively large.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1186"> 1186 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member asked about an open process. I believe we 
do have an open process. If there is a better way to make it more 
open, transparent and fair, let us do that.
<P>
	I appreciate the comments of the hon. member. We are working 
on it as best we can.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-7, which seeks to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services. This bill was first reviewed during the last 
session and is now back before us at the same stage as it was in 
December.
<P>
	This debate provides an opportunity to point out a number of 
things. We will not discuss the overall administration of the 
department; however, we want to discuss the department's 
mandate, ways, processes and practices, and to look at its 
effectiveness. This is basically what I intend to do in the few 
minutes that I have.
<P>
	The Liberal government often accuses the official opposition of 
only criticizing. When a bill is before the House and Bloc 
Quebecois members discuss it, Liberal members and ministers 
often say: ``All you do is criticize; you have nothing else to say. 
You cannot make constructive proposals''.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-7, the official opposition worked very 
seriously, and I want to pay tribute to the Bloc members who sat on 
the public works committee during the last session for their 
excellent work. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to conclude 
that the government did not take into account the recommendations 
and suggestions made by the Bloc Quebecois, as is its habit.
<P>
	This afternoon, the hon. member for Châteauguay raised four 
points on which I would like to go back. My colleague mentioned 
the need to monitor the government's financial commitments, and I 
will get back to this later on. He also talked about the contracting 
out process. As he mentioned in the question and comment period, 
the Bloc would like to focus on the need to have an open process so 
that all our fellow citizens can benefit from government services, 
especially business people who offer their services to the 
government. That is why we have contracting out rules.
<P>
	The Bloc wants members of Parliament to be more involved in 
the process. Hon. members should be consulted at least on what is 
going on in their ridings and need to be kept informed, but I will 
also come back to this issue.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Lastly, I want to talk about ethics in government, by drawing a 
parallel with the party financing legislation which, of course, does 
not exist at the federal level. There is one piece of legislation which 
addresses the financing  issue, but its provisions are so broad that I 
would rather draw a parallel with the rules we have in Quebec and 
which really set the province of Quebec apart from the other 
western democracies in this area.
<P>
	Let us talk about control of financial commitments and the 
suggestion made by the Bloc Quebecois to ensure that all House 
committees can meet regularly, at least four times a year, to 
examine the financial operations and commitments of the 
departments they are responsible for. Again, we might want to refer 
to what is done in Quebec. We often hear our colleagues, especially 
the members from western Canada, criticize what is being done in 
the province of Quebec, but I think we should also focus on what 
deserves to be mentioned and recognized. In this instance, I think it 
would be well worth it.
<P>
	In Quebec, parliamentary committees and commissions can, I 
guess any time they wish to do so, summon a minister, of course, 
but also senior public servants to account for their management. 
Any day they wish to, they can summon public servants before 
their committees and ask them to account for the decisions they 
made in their own department.
<P>
	This request by the Bloc Quebecois to do the same thing at the 
federal level is quite in line with the will expressed by this 
Parliament to change the rules governing the auditor general and to 
allow the tabling in the House, four times a year, of the report of the 
auditor general, as asked by the former member for Vanier who 
now sits in the Upper House. In that context, it appears quite 
logical and normal-that is, if this government can be logical-to 
see to it that each committee of the House can proceed with the 
audit of the financial commitments of the departments or agencies 
for which they are responsible.
<P>
	This is a positive and constructive suggestion, and instead of 
hearing the minister responsible for public works and my colleague 
for Winnipeg St. James, whom I hold in great respect, boast about 
what this government did in the contracting out sector, I would 
have preferred that he take action and announce, as we considered 
this bill, amendments to allow an audit of financial commitments 
four times a year.
<P>
	This brings me to the code for contracting out. My colleague for 
Châteauguay suitably noted that the federal government is 
spending enormous sums of money through all sorts of contracts 
for the procurement of equipment, merchandise and services. 
Throughout Canada, it is estimated that more than $5 billion were 
spent for such purposes in 1993-94. Where I come from, that is not 
peanuts. These are significant sums of money that must be spent 
wisely and we must make sure that they serve the purposes they 
were meant for.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1187"> 1187 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Even though it has been mentioned that changes have been made 
to the awarding of contracts and that some improvements have 
been made, there is still plenty of room for improvement, 
particularly with regard to contracting out.
<P>
	First, it would be important, as I said earlier, that not only the 
suppliers of services but also the people who receive the services 
understand the way government works and understand the 
tendering process.
<P>
	However, the experience of members of this 
House-particularly opposition members, who receive many 
complaints every day in their constituency office-indicates that 
the federal government's administrative practices for awarding 
contracts leave a lot to be desired. More often than not, it is a total 
mess and one has to wonder if officials who have to make decisions 
do not try to confuse everybody on purpose and to make things as 
complicated as possible to avoid scrutiny and to avoid being asked 
questions.
<P>
	So if we are serious about spending government funds wisely, it 
is imperative that we establish a code for contracting out, that we 
have clear and simple rules that would help the Canadian public 
understand what the government or the public servants are doing on 
their behalf.
<P>
	I would like to underline a few suggestions that have been made 
to improve the process. First of all, members should be consulted 
or informed. It is amazing that, as elected representatives, we have 
to rise in this House during consideration of this bill or any other 
bill to ask to be informed of what the government is doing in our 
ridings.
<P>
	As Dr. Laurin, an MNA and former minister in a Parti Quebecois 
government, used to say, there is something wrong when an elected 
member has to stand in this House and ask the government to 
please inform the elected representatives of the people about what 
the federal government is doing in their riding.
<P>
	We are raising this issue, because that is not what is being done 
right now. It is not standard procedure. There is no way our fellow 
citizens who cannot follow government operations day to 
day-may God spare them that chore, because they have other 
things to do, like taking care of their families and paying 
taxes-can get a clear idea of what government administration is 
all about when members themselves have to resort to amending a 
bill so that elected representatives will be consulted. I think the 
minister or the government should have readily recognized this 
deficiency and presented relevant amendments instead of waiting 
for the opposition to do it.
<P>
	The opposition has kept a watchful eye, it has assumed its 
responsibilities, and suggested that members be consulted. The 
goal is not to determine who should get  the contract, the way it is 
being done right now in Liberal fundraising events, but to know the
<P>
motives behind government actions in different ridings, the 
spinoffs, and who is capable of providing the goods or services that 
are recommended. This is what the Bloc Quebecois is asking for. I 
would not want to conclude without-
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> He has nothing left to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> The member 
says I have nothing left to say, but I would ask him to just listen to 
what I will be saying over the next five minutes. He will learn and 
profit from it because if he gets his information only from his 
party's caucus, I can understand why he is so uninformed at times.
<P>
	Let me conclude, if I may, by talking about-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> So soon?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> No, not so 
soon Mr. Boudria, you still have five minutes to benefit from what I 
have to say. Oh. Please excuse me, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead just earned himself a 15 or 
20-second penalty. Let me remind him he must always address the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> You are 
perfectly right, Mr. Speaker, I agree entirely.
<P>
	I would just like to conclude my comments by saying that it will 
be necessary not only to establish a code for contracting out, to 
consult members of the House, to make sure civil servants are 
responsible for their decisions, but also to assure the public that the 
government will make decisions based on political ethics. I am 
referring of course to the act on the financing of political parties.
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague from the Reform Party complained about 
the fact that SNC-Lavalin gets many government contracts without 
any justification. Maybe he is right. He did not give any details on 
that. I wish he would have also given examples from elsewhere and 
not only from Quebec, but politics have reasons that reason very 
often ignores.
<P>
	On that point, let me stress one thing: the fact that, at the federal 
level, the political party financing legislation authorises 
companies, corporations, to finance political parties greatly 
jeopardizes the awarding of contracts. As I mentioned a moment 
ago-some may have thought I was joking, but I am very 
serious-I believe a greater number of federal government 
contracts are considered within the Liberal Party financing system 
than in parliamentary committees.
<P>
	It is totally inappropriate that things should happen that way. But 
why is it so? Simply because that is where companies, those who 
provide money to the Liberal  Party, that is to say the 
government-and it was the same under the Conservatives-that is 
where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1188"> 1188 </A></B>
<P>
they are able to get information which otherwise might not be 
available to them.
<P>
	I might have to conclude on that, but let us take the example of 
the Pearson deal. For weeks, even months, the Bloc Quebecois 
battled the government which settled the Pearson airport deal in a 
totally unacceptable way.
<P>
	We all remember that during the last election campaign, the 
Prime Minister promised to undo the decision of the Conservative 
government and make sure that Pearson remained a public 
company, belonging to the government, and was not sold to private 
interests. We were in total agreement with that. However, lots of 
examples, each one more convincing than the other, showed that 
the interests which prevailed in the Pearson deal were those of 
lobbyists and bagmen of the various political parties which 
exercised power during the last few years, that is to say the Liberal 
Party and the Conservative Party. So much so that the government 
felt obliged, in order to regain an image of integrity, to introduce a 
bill on lobbyists, and have it passed by the House. It was actually a 
very timid piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	If the government is serious when it says it wants government 
contracts to be granted in an equitable and fair manner, it must 
accept suggestions made by members regarding public disclosure 
of contracts to be granted.
<P>
	But we must also make sure that the solution to this kind of 
problem is not found through the funding of political parties. This 
is why we have to introduce a bill to reform political party funding 
and make sure that not only the spirit but also the letter of the act 
which now applies in Quebec, which has set a precedent for all 
western democracies, is also applied at the federal level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for identifying 
the problem in this bill very well, but especially for raising an 
extremely important point, that is, consultation of elected officials.
<P>
	I think that is at present a major flaw, one that is not being 
corrected in Bill C-7. Currently, and with the bill, it is impossible 
for federal members of Parliament to know what government 
contracts will be given out in their own riding. They are being 
consulted on almost anything, they are invited to vote on all kinds 
of pieces of legislation, but they are refused access to information 
allowing them to know exactly what will happen and what 
contracts will be given out in their own riding.
<P>
	How do you think an attentive and combative member of 
PArliament, whoever he may be, can fulfill his role with dignity 
and efficiency if he does not know what government activities are 
going on on his own territory? I  will give a concrete case that I am 
presently living in my riding. I will then ask a question to my 
colleague.
<P>
	Transport Canada, Harbours and Ports, has decided to dredge the 
surroundings of Wharf No. 2, in Sorel, in order to restore the river 
to its initial depth, which was 9.1 metres. Over the years, sediment 
has accumulated and the depth is now 7.5 metres. So, they want to 
take away, on the Sorel side, 1.6 metre of sediment and 
contaminated silt, but to move it where? To the other side of the 
river, in my riding, on the shores of the municipality of 
Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola.
<P>
	Who was informed of that? Hunting and fishing associations in 
Sorel, the outfitting operation in Tracy, the city of Tracy, the 
development corporation of Lake Saint-Pierre, 
Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel and Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola, but this latter 
is invited to an information meeting for the dredging of the port of 
Sorel.
<P>
	The municipality does not wish to know about the impact of 
dredging at Sorel, so it is not represented at the meeting. The 
municipalities' representatives were never told: ``Come to the 
meeting, because we will dump the waste at your place''. No one 
felt the need to inform the federal member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, whose riding will get the waste. He would 
have known who would be interested. This issue has nothing to do 
with patronage, as the hon. member said.
<P>
	An hon. member who knows his riding and knows people who 
might be interested in a particular project, as I would be, if 
contaminated waste was being dumped, incidentally, on an 
uncontaminated site, will inform the islands' hunting and fishing 
association, tourist agencies like the SIRBI and the SABA, boating 
associations, etc. The hon. member knows his riding, so he would 
have got these associations interested in the issue.
<P>
	However, they do not wish to inform hon. members, because 
they wish to do as they see fit and, above all, to avoid being held 
accountable. Well, they are in for a surprise. In this particular case, 
I knew what was going on and they will have to justify their 
actions. That is another story though, but I hope the hon. minister 
got my message. She will certainly hear from me again about this 
unacceptable issue.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Here is my question for the hon. member. Does he not feel that, 
in such a situation where it is proposed to carry the equivalent of 
40,000 ten-wheeler rigs full of contaminated silt from the south 
shore to the north shore, it would have been normal to advise at 
least the members concerned, the member for Richelieu and the 
member for Berthier-Montcalm, even before putting money into 
this project, in order to know what they thought and what they had 
to say about it, whether there were groups they wanted to have 
consulted, and whether they could give us guidance?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1189"> 1189 </A></B>
<P>
	First, does the hon. member find it normal that the government 
did not advise us? Second, while we are overhauling these pieces 
of legislation, would it not be normal to deal right away with this 
flaw by making it a duty to inform the members concerned by 
a project even before putting money into it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> First, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague from Berthier-Moncalm 
on his speech. As I said at the beginning of my own speech, there 
was an opportunity to review a bill such as this one, which, at first 
sight, may seem technical or insignificant to most of our fellow 
citizens. When we study the bill more closely, however, when we 
take a closer look at it, when we analyze it like the official 
opposition did, we see right away the effects this bill or these bills 
will have on our fellow citizens, and the example given by the 
member for Berthier-Moncalm is eloquent proof of that. I hope 
the minister is listening carefully to my colleague's words, not only 
in this particular case, but also to realize that she has to consult all 
members of the House, whatever their political stripes.
<P>
	I believe that if we were elected by the people, if we ran a 
campaign, it proves that we have been involved in our communities 
for some time. We cannot learn everything overnight, it takes 
years. Generally speaking, members of Parliament are 
knowledgeable people; they know what is going on in their riding. 
Consequently, they should be consulted.
<P>
	Earlier, I described the suggestions the Bloc made to improve 
this process also. When we are speaking of the monitoring of 
government contracts, of departments' financial administration, 
which could be done by the committees, it would also be 
appropriate at the same time to ask questions to departmental 
officials, the minister and senior civil servants about situations like 
those that the member mentioned.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say to the minister and the government in 
general that it is in their interest to change their practices in this 
regard. Our fellow citizens are less and less willing to accept to be 
kept in the dark about government decisions, at all levels.
<P>
	For example, right now in Quebec there is a group called 
Mouvement pour le redressement économique du Québec, whose 
aim is to question governments on the way they spend the money 
they have to provide services to the population. We see more and 
more of that kind of spontaneous grassroots organizations.
<P>
	What message are they sending to our political leaders? They are 
telling them: ``We will no longer accept that you make decisions on 
our behalf without consulting and informing us in advance''.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that the very least a government could do is to 
consult the men and women that were elected by  the population. If 
the government is really serious when it says that it wants to 
improve the efficiency of its administrative structure, particularly 
with regard to contracts, then it should say so right now, during our 
present debate. It should say in a clear and open way that it intends 
to consult the elected members of Parliament on the contracts it is 
giving out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to speak to Bill C-7, formerly Bill C-52. I must tell you 
that even as late as this morning, I was not going to speak, but upon 
closer examination of the issue, I am pleased to comment on this 
bill and to echo a number of my colleagues' concerns with respect 
to the nature of the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	A great deal of money flows through this department. It could 
become very closely linked to patronage, unless a very stringent 
code is developed that would place tight constraints on its ability to 
act without a transparent process, give everyone equal access to 
contracts, and allow effective control of the system for managing 
public funds.
<P>
	First of all, I would point out that it is no small amount that 
Parliament and cabinet are called upon to manage. This year, the 
federal government will spend some $165 billion, of which of 
course close to $45 billion will go to interest on the debt; this aside, 
$120 billion are nonetheless spent on programs.
<P>
	A good part of this budget will funnel through the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services, which approves the 
operating expenditures of the various departments, whether for 
rental of accommodation, or all the other sorts of things 
departments need to operate.
<P>
	It is quite surprising to discover just exactly how difficult it is to 
obtain precise information in this regard. I had some fun a few 
months back trying to determine how much had been spent 
renovating buildings in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. It was 
a very difficult exercise because, even when it is possible to obtain 
overall figures, total amounts, there is never any very precise data 
on who won the contracts and how large they were. Were there cost 
overruns compared to tenders? Information like that requires 
painstaking research. I did not get the feeling that the people I 
consulted were very enthusiastic about helping me find out what I 
wanted to know.
<P>
	The Bloc has made some very interesting suggestions. I would 
like to address each of these items briefly. One of the first 
suggestions made by the Bloc for improvement, to ensure that 
administration was more efficient, was to make sure that one or 
more committees-of the many House committees-the standing 
committees, would be able to make a quarterly examination of the 
expenditures of the various departments. Initially I think the 
suggested level for this was $25,000 and up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1190"> 1190 </A></B>
<P>
	So, all expenditures in excess of $25,000 ought to be assessed 
by parliamentary committees. This would get MPs more involved 
in government administration. It would increase monitoring and 
all those who might be tempted to fiddle with public funds would 
be more nervous if they knew that these expenditures would be 
examined in a public exercise where a number of people could 
voice opinions and even hold a debate. If it was felt appropriate, 
they could even call the people in question in to explain 
themselves. This strikes me as merely a normal process to ensure 
more efficient and more responsible administration.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	At a time when the public is being asked to make sacrifices in the 
battle in which the various governments are engaged against the 
deficit, we must ensure that what we are administering is at least 
administered as efficiency as possible, in order to improve public 
confidence.
<P>
	If I recall correctly, those words were used in the Liberal Party's 
red book, which talked of greater transparency and restoring public 
confidence. When the time comes to put their money where their 
mouth is, and to bow to the arguments suggested by the opposition 
parties, one might say that their reflex for self-protection, keeping 
the political machine as non-transparent as possible, won out over 
the Liberals' good intentions while they were in the opposition and 
were experiencing the frustrations a goodly number of MPs are 
now experiencing.
<P>
	Of course, there must be some members of the government party 
who manage to obtain some information, thanks to their good 
relations with ministers or because of their participation in 
previous campaigns, the support they gave, or I might even say 
because of political debts tied to a leadership race or similar things. 
Nevertheless, this is not a normal situation because as elected 
representatives, whatever our political party, we were all elected in 
ridings and therefore each of us reflects a majority of electors in his 
or her own riding.
<P>
	Of course, those constituents voted for a political party but they 
also voted for an individual and they expect their member of 
Parliament to be as effective as possible and to be the best 
representative possible in Parliament.
<P>
	Therefore, being able to study all those expenditures in 
committee can harm no one. I would like the government party to 
tell us why it is against such a measure. How would the suggestion 
that all expenditures over $ 25,000 be thoroughly examined by a 
committee render Parliament less efficient and less vigilant 
regarding in terms of managing public funds?
<P>
	We are aware that it would impose a large amount of work on 
members, but this is part of our role. We might be much more 
efficient if we did this rather than certain things done in committee 
and which, and I hope you will allow me to be sceptical, have very 
little impact on  departments if they have not given directives, or 
circulated reports from the committees. This is why members of 
committees should be given more autonomy.
<P>
	For those who are following this discussion, committees are 
composed of members of recognized political parties. There is a 
number from the government party and from the two opposition 
parties, the official opposition and the third party. These people 
could look at these expenditures over a few weeks, meeting a few 
times a week.
<P>
	The government has said nothing about the follow-up to this 
suggestion, and today is not the first time we have made it, but 
nobody has considered it worth acting on.
<P>
	Another aspect concerns contracting out. In recent years, the 
government has cut its staff drastically and contracts out 
increasingly. It can thus save money. We have nothing against this 
of itself, but it is very dangerous if it becomes a devious way to 
provide work for one's political friends.
<P>
	Need I point out that, unlike Quebec, which has very strict 
legislation on the funding of political parties, here, companies can 
make donations to political parties. Recently I was looking at a 
1994 report which revealed that a lot of companies contribute to 
political parties. I am talking about the traditional political parties, 
because this does not apply to the Bloc, which is funded by 
individuals. Companies provide most of the funding of these 
parties. I cannot believe that this is a disinterested gesture on their 
part. When an individual gives $75,000 or $100,000 to a political 
party, I am not so sure he is expecting nothing in return.
<P>
	It is more complex than that. Contributions can even be made 
through numbered companies. So, trying to find out who really 
financed the political parties can be a very difficult and demanding 
task, requiring a lot of time and energy to see who financed what 
and whether contracts are awarded according to contributions as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	As we know, there is a growing trend toward contracting out. 
How is it that the government did not deem it appropriate to clearly 
define a code of ethics on the awarding of those contracts that 
would be far more severe than the one in place? Here again, 
transparency, a word repeated over and over in the red book, is 
absent. They did not find it appropriate to act on that 
recommendation.
<P>
	I will make the same argument as earlier. How would this make 
Parliament less efficient? It seems to me to be a good suggestion. 
You know, today people expect a lot from us. They ask us to not 
just criticize the government but also to make suggestions 
forcefully. That is what we do. We make concrete suggestions in 
order to make the management of public funds as efficient as 
possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1191"> 1191 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a third point, and it is important. The member for 
Berthier-Montcalm referred earlier to something that occurs 
sometimes, and more often recently. One learns that important 
things, major things are happening. They may happen in our 
ridings without us being informed whereas if we, as 
representatives of those citizens, had been informed, we could 
have warned people and reacted as efficiently as possible. In his 
case, it was a problem with major environmental impacts. A 
similar example came to my mind.
<P>
	Public Works has transferred, or is in the process of transferring, 
the management of docks to the municipalities. I represent a little 
municipality of barely 250 inhabitants called Moffet. There is a 
federal dock in Moffet. The kind of renovations done to that dock 
could have been managed much more efficiently by the municipal 
administration. One day officials from Public Works came to 
undertake the renovations-in co-operation with Fisheries and 
Oceans, of course-but these people did not take into consideration 
particulars or comments. Because the town's mayor showed up at 
the site. In a small town, when people from outside are coming in, 
they are spotted at once. On that day, the people rushed to meet 
them and seeask what they were doing. Then, they realized they 
were coming to repair the dock. It was obvious to the local 
population that what was about to be done would not be work, but 
nobody had told the contractor. He had the contract, and he had to 
abide by it to get paid.
<P>
	The person who got the contract said: ``If I want to be paid, I 
must follow the specifications, and I will''. Six months later, 
everything had to be redone, because the repairs did not last. There 
had been an error in assessing spring flood levels and other factors.
<P>
	If my office or myself had been advised that the government was 
considering such work, we could have contacted the municipality's 
officials or officials from other regional county municipalities that 
had carried out similar projects. We could have been more efficient 
and we would not have had to do it twice. Moreover, we could have 
informed local contractors that repairs were to be done and that the 
bidding process was open. We can say repeatedly that the process is 
open, but not everybody knows that. If we were more involved at 
the local level, we could be more efficient. There would be more 
economic spinoffs in our regions.
<P>
	What the Bloc Quebecois suggested to avoid this kind of thing 
was to inform members of what is going on, and in the present case, 
namely the management of public funds under federal jurisdiction, 
to give notice to the elected representatives of the people of what is 
coming, what will have to be done, and even what has been done so 
far. But of course, acting in a more transparent and efficient way is 
not one of the present government's priorities. I insist because I am 
convinced that it will lead to more efficiency.
<P>
	Why not try to be more efficient? This is a question we might 
well ask.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It might be to protect certain interests. To play politics, or worse, 
to use patronage to reward friends of the government by granting 
them a number of contracts and kickbacks in exchange for their 
political ties.
<P>
	When people elect us they believe that we have a lot of power. 
They think we can change many things easily. Increasingly, they 
get the feeling that we are fighting a machine trying to protect 
itself, to be more or less transparent, to account for things in a 
certain manner. Three or four years later, the books are kept 
differently, the way data is presented is changed, it is very 
confusing, several sets of data are combined together, the whole of 
Quebec is lumped together, even the whole of Canada. It becomes 
very difficult to know exactly what was done in each area.
<P>
	Returns which are more local in nature or deal more with 
specific ridings are more difficult to get. Sometimes, it is possible, 
but it is generally quite rare. They are certainly not available from 
the new Department of Public Works and Government Services. 
And yet, a lot of money is channeled through this department.
<P>
	Perhaps, if there was more consultation, if people were more 
involved, there might be fewer buildings with empty offices, fewer 
very expensive buildings or fewer very expensive renovations.
<P>
	Once I spoke with someone responsible for building 
maintenance or improvement, especially for federal buildings. This 
person benefited from the spinoffs and said to me: ``I certainly 
have no right to complain, but it is incredible to see the amount of 
waste''.
<P>
	That is what he said. And I, a member of Parliament, felt totally 
powerless in front of that situation. When you call for information, 
you would think you were asking for the moon because it takes 
quite a considerable effort to obtain a statement of expenditures for 
a specific building and to find out if there were misuse or 
squandering.
<P>
	Naturally, people who authorize squandering try to justify it. To 
prevent that, we should act before and not after the fact. This is one 
of our problems. Our society is largely focused on remedial action; 
we try to solve problems but we do not try hard enough to prevent 
them. It is the same with the management of public funds. It would 
seem only normal to ask for statements.
<P>
	The year 2000 is almost here. Computer services are well 
developed and it would be very easy to obtain statements from the 
different ridings.
<P>
	The auditor general is supposed to be the watchdog of 
government. It costs nearly $50 million a year for us to monitor the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1192"> 1192 </A></B>
<P>
government, for the government to check its own administration. 
His task would be made easier if elected members were more 
involved in the monitoring  of public spending. Everybody knows 
that we have administrative assistants, people who work for us, and 
we could follow very closely the spending of public money in our 
ridings, and influence the way things are done.
<P>
	This would greatly enrich the role of elected members-and 
especially members of the governing party-who would feel that 
they have real influence on the decision making process in their 
communities. If the public knew that their local representatives can 
watch very closely, can monitor, and even influence or neutralize 
things which are not done efficiently, they would feel a little closer 
to politics.
<P>
	What worries me the most is seeing how far they can go. This 
reflects the attitude of the Prime Minister, a slight lack of respect 
for democracy as a whole. Whether it be through a desire to 
influence the rules of democratic consultation, or through 
processes like the one dealing with the Pearson airport or by an 
attitude when faced with suggestions like the ones we have made, 
which would serve to reinforce democracy-because MPs are 
representatives of their constituents-one wonders to what extent 
politicians are protecting each other with the backing of the 
bureaucracy. I am talking about the highest ranks of the 
bureaucracy, because local civil servants usually act in good faith 
and are willing to co-operate. There are some departments where 
things are going very well.
<P>
	In my riding, for example, in the Department of Human 
Resources Development it is working very well. In that 
department, they are in the habit of consulting members of 
Parliament. However, it is getting less common, because 
previously the signature of an MP was required, but now it is less 
often the case, although consultations on a voluntary basis remain, 
depending on the person in charge, on whether he or she was 
appointed by the present or the previous government, on the mood 
of the minister in charge, etc.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I believe this was a very valid component of organizational 
culture that recognized the role played by the elected 
reprresentatives. It is very dangerous to get away from that.
<P>
	Before closing, I would like to give an example of something 
similar, which is happening with the appointment of people who 
are going to be in charge of the Statistics Canada census. There was 
a usual, familiar processus, but it would appear that political 
interference is on the rise, and this is not necessarily sound and not 
necessarily desirable.
<P>
	So, in closing, we have very interesting suggestions which will 
ensure that the worst that could happen for the government is that it 
be more efficient. So I wonder why government members are 
opposed to that. If they are acting in good faith, they will adjust 
their bill. We are at the third reading stage, there is still time to 
improve it  and then we could considere supporting these 
government actions, which will ensure that we will become more 
efficient and above all more responsible.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it behoves me to respond to some of the statements made by 
members of the Bloc. I do not think they can be allowed to go 
unchallenged.
<P>
	A few minutes ago the member for Berthier-Montcalm raised 
the issue of the dredging contract at Sorel, Quebec. He more or less 
implied that the public has been ignored, that certain concerns have 
been overlooked and that people who have legitimate concerns 
have been shut out of the process. I say unequivocally and 
categorically that is not true.
<P>
	Yes, there are environmental concerns surrounding that project. 
Those environmental concerns are being met. Already there have 
been public meetings on this issue. There were two meetings that I 
know of, one on January 5, 1996 and another on March 14, 1996. 
Those meetings involved public consultations.
<P>
	For the hon. member to somehow suggest that the public is being 
ignored in this process, he is just not being factual and is not 
rendering a service to the House. I can state that if further public 
meetings are required that will happen. As I said, there are 
environmental concerns. The Department of Public Works and 
Government Services has a responsibility to address those 
concerns.
<P>
	I want to put those statements on the record. I do not think that 
the hon. member from Berthier-Montcalm had all the information 
at his fingertips. I would hope he would take what I have said into 
account.
<P>
	I also want to address one of the issues raised by the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue. If I can put it in my own words, the 
hon. member for Témiscamingue was asking out loud what is 
going on in his riding or in other ridings in Quebec. He was saying 
that the government issues contracts and he, the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue, does not know what is going on.
<P>
	I would suggest that he should do his homework better. There are 
means available to the hon. member for Témiscamingue and for 
other members from the Bloc, other members from the province of 
Quebec, other members from all provinces in this country. There is 
ample opportunity for-
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. The member is 
now in question and comment period concerning the speech made 
by the member for Témiscamingue.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1193"> 1193 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The member is now responding to allegations that I am making. 
If we want to set the record straight, the member is giving false 
information, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> This is not a 
question of privilege.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, let me continue with respect to 
what the hon. member for Témiscamingue was saying. In effect he 
was saying he did not know what was going on in his own riding 
and that members of the Bloc Quebecois should know more about 
what is going on with respect to the letting of government 
contracts, that it should know more about what is going on in its 
ridings.
<P>
	If the members do their homework they can find out. We talked 
about the open bidding service before and I will talk about it again. 
For example, I cite what is available on OBS: all contract 
opportunities; notices of plans, sole sourced contracts as well as 
notices of contract awards; the open bidding system also offers 
contract histories, that is information on contracts that have been 
awarded in the past to whom and for what amount.
<P>
	He is also somehow suggesting we should make all this 
information available on a riding to riding basis, which would 
invite all kinds of red tape. We already have red tape in the 
government. We already have too much paper and we are providing 
this information through the electronic system, OBS.
<P>
	If the hon. member really wants to know what is going on he can 
do it. It may take a little work but if he ties into the open bidding 
system he can get the information he needs.
<P>
	I go back to what the member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead said. I am not exactly sure what 
he was talking about. I know the hon. member. He is a personable, 
engaging fellow, but I think he has had a bad day. Somehow he was 
talking about promoting a contracting out code.
<P>
	We have the system in place that is open, that is fair, that is 
transparent. It is above board. What the members from the Bloc are 
suggesting is that we draw members of Parliament into the 
system-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau: </B>Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I think the 
hon. parliamentary secretary has just woken up from a long sleep, 
and before he goes back in time to the throne speech or his election 
in 1993, we should remind him that this is the question and 
comment period following the speech of the member for 
Témiscamingue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Your point of 
order was not valid at all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, I will finish my last point in a 
moment. I thought I was doing a service to the members of the Bloc 
by providing this information. I believe I am providing a service to 
all Canadians watching this debate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead seems to 
be suggesting we politicize the public service. I think we have one 
of the greatest public services in the world. It is professional and 
public servants do their jobs in a professional manner. The last 
thing I want is to politicize that service. I believe we have a system 
in place.
<P>
	If the members of the Bloc do their homework, if they need 
information, if they want information, it is there. They may have to 
do some work but after all that is what they are paid for. We have a 
system that works and we should be very proud of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like to 
remind you that the question and comment period is 10 minutes 
long. As should be obvious by its name, it is a period for questions 
or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, in the three or four minutes I have 
left, I will respond to the parliamentary secretary. First of all, I 
would like to remind him of a few points. In his comment, question 
or lecture, if you like, the hon. member referred to my work as a 
member of Parliament. I say to him that the constituents in my 
riding will decide for themselves in the next election and I invite 
him to come to my riding to discuss this matter, perhaps sooner 
than he expects. I will then be pleased to be accountable to my 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	He referred to the situation in the riding of my colleague, the 
hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm. I wish to tell him that some 
of the information he gave is wrong. He should ask the people in 
his department to do the job if he does not want to do it himself. 
First of all, the first public assembly was held January 15 and not 
January 5, and it was in Sorel by invitation. Only one person from 
the north shore had been invited and was present.
<P>
	The second public assembly, which was held March 14, was 
organized by my colleague for Berthier-Montcalm and not by his 
department or by the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	So I would ask the parliamentary secretary-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> To apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Not to apologize, it would be asking too much, but at 
least to congratulate my colleague in some future speech, because 
we know that he likes to revisit past issues, the next time he has an 
opportunity to do so in about 20 minutes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1194"> 1194 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to get back to what the hon. member 
said about working harder and not being afraid of work. We are 
certainly not afraid of work. What we are asking him is to submit 
contracts worth $25,000 and above to House committees, to 
elected members, for review and analysis so that we can do our 
job properly. We are not afraid of work. If he himself is afraid, 
that is his problem. We, however, want to be more effective and, 
as I was saying earlier, more accountable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in this House to participate in the debate at third 
reading on Bill C-7 to merge two former departments, namely 
Public Works Canada and Supply and Services Canada.
<P>
	This bill does not change the legislation much at all. On the 
surface, the bill is not controversial. That is the problem. Since Bill 
C-7 was introduced, the official opposition has taken issue and 
continues to take issue not with what the government has done but 
rather with what it has not done. Basically, the old system is being 
kept. Change the designation, change the first page and put 
everything back together unchanged.
<P>
	Members will recall that this is the department handling the 
majority of the federal government's goods and services 
procurement contracts. Billions of dollars are involved, and with 
billions of dollars at stake, almost nothing is being done, no effort 
made to determine how this money could be spent more efficiently. 
Contrary to what they had promised in the red book, they are not 
taking the time to put in place a transparent system to make these 
expenditures more efficient and effective. I will give you more 
examples from my riding in a moment. If the hon. parliamentary 
secretary who wants to see whether we have done our job, he could 
start by telling me if he has done his.
<P>
	When tabling Bill C-52, now Bill C-7, the federal government 
had an opportunity to innovate. It had an opportunity to establish a 
model department, a department from which all the cumbersome 
red tape would have been removed. As a rule, a modern 
government uses modern tools to meet public expectations. The 
federal government, thanks to proposals from the official 
opposition, had a chance to fulfil its electoral promises and ensure 
maximum transparency in all aspects of power.
<P>
	As my colleagues said earlier, people generally feel that 
opposition members object for the pure delight of it, but our party 
proposed four clear and precise amendments that would allow the 
government to improve its supply and services system, boost its 
popularity, and, at the same time, restore public faith lost because 
of the all too present patronage seen in government. What have 
they done? Absolutely nothing. They replaced the front page, 
changed the title and the number of the bill, and trotted it out again.
<P>
	So, nothing at all was done. Of all the amendments presented by 
the Bloc Quebecois during the previous debates on the bill, none 
was retained. Let me recall a few just to show how appropriate they 
could have been to improve the bill's effectiveness.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I must state the Bloc Quebecois's concern that there 
were no simple and transparent rules. If a contractor in my riding 
wishes to deal with the federal government, he will have to go 
some distance to locate a resource person. Before knocking on the 
right door, before speaking to the right person, before reaching the 
appropriate service, this contractor, or his business, must have the 
following qualifications: he must be very familiar with the system, 
be a generous donor, have a lifelong knowledge of the system, and 
have friends in the right places.
<P>
	This is precisely what we wanted to change. We wanted to 
change that perception regarding access to an imposing structure 
that discourages anyone, including ordinary citizens, experts and 
elected representatives, interested in finding out more about the 
department and how public funds are spent. I will give you some 
examples later on.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it should be possible and in fact easier for 
anyone, such as a contractor, to have access to that structure and 
offer his services. I want to remind this House of the experience of 
some of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues who, a few months ago, 
sent a written request to Public Works and Government Services 
Canada to obtain a list of the contracts awarded by that department 
in their ridings.
<P>
	Such a request from an elected representative is perfectly in 
order. After all, in the case of the infrastructures program, we 
regularly receive in our offices a list of the projects submitted in 
our ridings. The list also specifies which projects are approved and 
which ones are rejected. That list is a public document. We can 
quite appropriately discuss it with local politicians.
<P>
	So, some Bloc Quebecois members simply asked the department 
responsible for awarding the supply and services contracts how the 
government spends public funds. As member for Terrebonne, I 
should know how that money is being spent in my riding.
<P>
	These members sent their written request to the Department of 
Public Works. The minister's reply was especially surprising and 
disappointing. The Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services answered that it was unfortunately impossible to reply to 
their requests because it would entail too much expense. We do not 
know how he did it, but he gave an estimate of $160,000 for those 
expenditures at that time.
<P>
	This example clearly shows how cumbersome the department is. 
It also shows how members who, like my colleague for 
Témiscamingue, like my colleague for  Berthier-Montcalm, like 
myself and like all my colleagues, including Liberal members and 
Reform members, want to do their job-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1195"> 1195 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> And the member for Lotbinière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> And my colleague for Lotbinière, I am sorry. It 
shows how impossible it is for those members to do their job well 
and to know about the expenditures that have been made in their 
ridings. Departmental officials tell us that it is impossible to give 
us an answer, that they do not know how much they are spending 
and they do not know either how the contracts are awarded.
<P>
	The public service, and more specifically the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services, have set up impressive 
obstacles to confuse people, like members of Parliament, who try 
to understand the workings of the federal machinery for awarding 
government contracts in our ridings.
<P>
	The number of contractors who try to get contracts from the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services, but do not 
manage to understand all the ins and outs of the government 
machinery, is very large. I think every member from every party 
gets that kind of complaint in his or her constituency office. That 
explains how a select club of contractors came to exist, people used 
to the workings of the system, who too often take advantage of the 
government largesse.
<P>
	Official opposition amendments providing for simple and 
transparent rules have all be defeated. Another amendment I will 
deal with momentarily provided for a contracting out code. It has 
met with the same fate. As the hon. member for Témiscamingue 
mentioned a while ago, I think we need easy, clear and transparent 
rules and standards. Contracting out is a fact, and I will give figures 
later on, but it could be made more effective.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois amendment simply reflected a tendency to 
contract out that has been growing over the years in the federal 
public service. The last available data are for fiscal year 1992-93. 
According to Treasury Board estimates, services that have been 
contracted outside the federal government totalled $5.2 billion 
during that year.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The federal government was certainly not unaware of that trend 
when it introduced Bill C-7. It should have taken this opportunity 
to regulate this new procedure.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board has told us year in and year 
out: ``The number of public servants has dropped by 3 per cent, or 5 
per cent, and the public service has been shrinking''. What he 
forgot to tell us is that, in the meantime, contract budgets have been 
rising. What we would like to know, as elected representatives of 
the people, is how much money is being wasted-yes, wasted-in 
contracts and how these contracts are awarded.
<P>
	Why is the number of public servants decreasing year after year 
while contracting out is on the rise? We have a good idea. It means 
fewer responsibilities in terms of labour relations and job security, 
fewer responsibilities for the employers towards their employees.
<P>
	Should we issue a contracting out code? We did propose one. 
What did we get for an answer? Nothing. The Bloc Quebecois 
thought Bill C-7 would establish such a code, or at least rules for 
the government to properly control the contracting out process and 
to make it more open.
<P>
	Everyone from the government and its employees to the general 
public would have benefited from such a contracting out code. This 
is the kind of code that ensures better work relations between the 
government and its public servants, while contracting out is often 
perceived by the public service and unions as a fearsome enemy 
they have to fight all the time.
<P>
	By developing clear contracting out rules, everyone's role would 
be well defined and everyone would benefit. Also, such a code 
would have cleared up the whole contracting out process, 
something the population would have appreciated. We would have 
solved the problem. It is by setting these kinds of standards rather 
than by rejecting a whole series of proposals to make positive 
changes to the awarding process that we will restore the Canadian 
population's confidence in our abilities and revive their 
expectations.
<P>
	By refusing to follow up on the two recommendations from the 
official opposition regarding the importance of establishing a 
contracting out code and establishing clear guidelines, the Liberal 
government is encouraging or giving the appearance of 
encouraging outmoded practices, for which the public is still and 
always the first to pay.
<P>
	I would remind you that in a recent survey, school board officials 
and municipal, provincial and federal politicians had the trust of 
about 4 per cent of the population. If we add up the number of 
school board officials and municipal, provincial and federal 
politicians, they represent about 4 per cent of the population. This 
was not a very strong vote of confidence and it is not going to get 
any better with standards like these. If we then look at the error 
rate, something like 4 per cent, we did not do very well.
<P>
	In another vein, I would like to draw the attention of this House 
to another recommendation of the Bloc Quebecois which never 
went anywhere, that being the involvement of MPs, regardless of 
affiliation. This is not a partisan recommendation, to involve them 
in the letting of Public Works and Government Services contracts 
in their respective ridings, as is now the case with infrastructure 
projects.
<P>
	At the present time, it is literally impossible-let anyone correct 
me-for an MP to find out about  contracts let by the department in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1196"> 1196 </A></B>
<P>
question in his or her riding, as we mentioned earlier. This makes 
no sense, if we accept the principle that MPs are the people most 
aware of what is going on in their own ridings.
<P>
	The problem of the wharf in Témiscamingue was mentioned 
earlier, as well as another problem in the riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm. It is now my turn to tell you about a problem 
in my riding. It concerns the unemployment office.
<P>
	We learned at one point that, because it did not conform to 
standards, the Terrebonne unemployment office had to be 
moved-which is quite commendable-to another location that 
was larger, better suited, more modern, with new carpeting, new 
furniture, new lights, a new computer system, etc.
<P>
	The move was made about six months ago. It cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars with the work that was done at the new 
location and the signing of a ten-year lease. To show you the great 
consistency between government departments, a month later, we 
learned that the Terrebonne unemployment office was going to be 
closed.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	How many tens of thousands of dollars, how many hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, were spent on a ten year lease for beautiful, 
brand new premises, just to announce one, two or three months 
later that the office was being closed down? When? Unknown. That 
makes for an excellent work atmosphere. They tell the workers: 
``You will be cut, and the office will be shut down. We do not know 
when, but give us a year or two and it will all be over. We have just 
set up fancy new offices, but forget about an office-warming 
party''. There was not even an official opening ceremony. No time, 
it was closed. Or going to be closed. Now, that shows a really 
coherent policy. How more with it can anyone be?
<P>
	So that is another example, and we could go back a bit in time for 
several more. As my colleagues have said, MPs need to be aware of 
what departmental contracts are being awarded in their ridings, so 
as to be effective and efficient, and to help the government as well. 
Whether Liberal, Bloc Québécois, or Reform, who are the ones 
who should be informed of what is going on in our ridings? The 
MPs, first and foremost, not the public servants, but the MPs. Not 
so that we can carry out our own political patronage, but to offer 
our opinions, as is done everywhere.
<P>
	Besides, this recommendation of the official opposition was 
based on the principle that the competence of members of 
Parliament goes beyond the legislative framework, inasmuch as 
they have to study matters of state and this, of course, has practical 
administrative consequences. Nevertheless, even if members of 
Parliament are consulted, even if they are invited to vote on various 
kinds of issues, as they will be called to do in a  moment, they are 
still denied any means of verifying if votes, expenditures, income 
tax and government decisions comply with the recommendations 
and legislation of the House.
<P>
	In a few moments we will vote on one bill and tomorrow we will 
vote on another. Then we will try to see whether our vote is well 
represented in our riding, and we will be denied this information. If 
members cannot have access, as the minister wrote, to information 
on the expenditures by the various departments in their ridings, 
how can an ordinary individual unfamiliar with the intricacies of 
government machinery obtain information? It is impossible.
<P>
	The government's refusal to inform a member about federal 
government activities in his or her riding is another of its failings. 
Why not consult, or at least inform a member, as in the 
infrastructure program, when a contract is awarded in his or her 
riding? This would be an opportunity to encourage transparency 
and efficiency in an overloaded system.
<P>
	Furthermore, members of Parliament could be used as 
safeguards against the blind waste of public funds. They could, for 
example, advise a public servant who does not know how things 
work in Témiscamingue and who, in turn, could advise an architect 
before any plans were drawn up. A public servant could visit the 
riding to consult other public servants before setting up premises, 
drawing up a 10-year lease, etc. if the office is to be closed before 
its official opening. I think there may be more intelligent standards 
to be set in the public service if we want to get more than 4 per cent.
<P>
	In addition to stressing the merit of having members of 
Parliament involved in the system, the Bloc Quebecois stressed the 
importance of making public servants accountable since these are 
the first to know how public funds are used. The Bloc Quebecois 
recommended the implementation of an instrument 
allowing-even though I do not like the term-exposure of waste 
of public funds by civil servants and valuing the practice. What we 
mean by that is not a ``stooling'' system revealing situations where 
someone is spending more than the other. It is simply a system 
allowing civil servants to report the inadequacy of some program 
without being penalized.
<P>
	As I said, the underlying principle is not to frighten employees 
who would suspect others of checking up on them, but rather to 
admit that useless spending is made regularly.
<P>
	Finally, I would conclude this short speech by reminding the 
House of another recommendation we made and which is largely 
approved by many MPs of all parties.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois seized the opportunity to firmly condemn 
the practice of advance payments. What is advance payment? It is a 
practise which consists in using all the resources available to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1197"> 1197 </A></B>
<P>
departmental unit. This way, the department makes sure it will 
have the same budget for the following year.
<P>
	What does this mean? It is simple. If, in a department, you have 
$1,500,000 to spend, you must make sure you spend it all. If, 
towards the end of the last month, you still have $150,000, buy 
$150,000 worth of dictionaries if you want, but spend it all.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Practices like these account for a rating of 4 per cent in people's 
confidence in the government. Practices like these have been 
condemned by the Bloc Quebecois throughout consideration of Bill 
C-7.
<P>
	To conclude, these four amendments, these four proposals by the 
Bloc Quebecois would have allowed every one in this House, not 
only the Bloc, not only the sovereignist movement, to regain some 
respect and improve their public image.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I really cannot believe my ears. I am absolutely amazed that 
members of the Bloc would propose the politicization of the letting 
of contracts. It is really hard to believe in this day and age that any 
member of Parliament would suggest that they should directly 
intervene in the letting of contracts.
<P>
	What is the point in having a professional civil service? What is 
the point of setting down an objective set of criteria if members of 
Parliament, even with the best of intentions, were allowed to 
interfere in the letting of contracts or in the invitation of bids. It 
simply would not work.
<P>
	If we hear today outcries about patronage, which we do from 
time to time, can you imagine, Madam Speaker, the kind of 
outcries you would hear if we were to pursue the course suggested 
by the Bloc? I suppose if the government were to let a contract to 
someone who had ties to the Bloc, then of course everything would 
seem open, fair, transparent and above board. It would be seen as 
okay.
<P>
	What would happen if the government ever let a contract to 
someone who may have some kind of remote ties to the 
government? Right away the accusation of patronage would be 
heard.
<P>
	We went through this in the 19th century. Surely the Bloc would 
not want to have that kind of political patronage come back on to 
the political scene.
<P>
	The Bloc members have been more or less implying or 
suggesting that we do not listen and if only we would listen we 
would do a far better job. Let us talk about Bill C-7 or in its former 
incarnation Bill C-52. Members voiced concerns about clause 16. 
They were concerned about the discretion that the original version 
of clause 16  gave to the minister. They were concerned that the 
minister would have too much power.
<P>
	What was done? The clause was amended. Under clause 16 the 
minister no longer has that discretion. Now the discretion must be 
exercised by order in council, in other words by full cabinet. Not 
only that, but it was amended so that when it came to entering into 
contracts with other governments, whether they were inside the 
country or outside the country, it cannot be done by the federal 
government on its own, in other words, it cannot be done 
proactively. It has to be done as a result of an amendment only on 
request.
<P>
	Even if the government thought it would like to enter into some 
kind of contractual liaison with another province, it cannot do it 
unless that province approaches us and asks us specifically to enter 
into a contractual liaison. That is an example of listening.
<P>
	When the members of the Bloc talk about us not listening, I 
would submit very sincerely that they are being disingenuous. To 
put it in clearer language, they are not being sincere.
<P>
	With that kind of talk, I do not think the members of the Bloc do 
service to themselves, their constituents, the people of Quebec, and 
certainly not to Canadians in general. We have what is called an 
open bidding system, which is open, fair, above board and 
transparent. If members of the Bloc want to acquaint themselves 
with the system they will find that it is a good system and it is 
working.

	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member for Mackenzie and I voted at the beginning and at the end. 
We are not trying to vote twice but we did not hear our names over 
the microphone either time. I would like to be assured that we were 
recorded as voting in the affirmative for this amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> You can rest 
assured it was called.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I declare Motion No. 1 negatived. Motion No. 69 is therefore 
negatived as well.
<P>
	The next vote is on Motion No. 25.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
that you would find unanimous consent that members who voted on 
the previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion 
before the House. Liberal members will vote nay.
<P>
	I also wish to add the name of the Secretary of State for 
Agriculture to the list for this vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest: </B>Madam Speaker, my colleague for Saint John and 
myself being the sponsors of this motion, I wish to inform the 
government whip that we consent to apply the vote on the previous

motion to this motion, and also,  of course, to add the name of the 
Secretary of State for Agriculture to the list.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, members of the 
offical opposition will vote nays.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, except for those who might wish 
to vote otherwise, we will vote yes to this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Madam Speaker, the NDP votes yes on this motion.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Beauce):</B> No, Madam Speaker.

<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I invite the 
honourable member for Sherbrooke to repeat the comments he 
made earlier about the vote because they were not recorded.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest: </B>Madam Speaker, of course I intend to vote in 
favour of this motion. Therefore, if I heard my colleagues well, 
there is unanimous consent.

these apart and give us separate votes on Motion No. 2 and Motion 
No. 29.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That was in the

having voted on the motion presently before the House, with 
Liberal MPs voting nay.

Motion No. 29 defeated.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 31.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to seek unanimous 
consent that the results of the vote taken a little earlier today on 
Motion No. 1 at report stage be applied to the motion presently 
before the House, adding of course the presence of the Secretary of 
State (Agriculture) who will vote too against the motion.
<P>
	I wish also to seek unanimous consent that this vote applies to 
the following motions: Nos. 36, 37, 38 and 68.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, members of the 
official opposition will vote yea.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, we do not give unanimous 
consent to apply to Motion No. 38 or Motion No. 27. We would like 
a standing vote on those two, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Madam Speaker, there seems to be some confusion 
concerning the procedure. If we agree to reverse or to apply votes 
we do not have to get up and say how we vote. We just agree to 
apply them. We agree to apply them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Beauce): </B>Madam Speaker, I will vote against the 
motions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, perhaps I should reword this to 
say that I am seeking unanimous consent to apply the result of vote 
1 to report stage Motions Nos. 31, 36, 37, not 38 just for greater 
clarity, and 68.

have to be voted on.

	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
that the House would consent to apply the result  of the vote at

Agriculture, who, I believe, will vote in favour.
