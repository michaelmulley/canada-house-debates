On the Order:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>September 27, 1996-The Minister of Transport-Second reading and reference 
to the Standing Committee on Transport of Bill C-44, an act for making the system 
of Canadian ports competitive, efficient and commercially oriented, providing for 
the establishing of port authorities and the divesting of certain harbours and ports, 
for the commercialization of the St. Lawrence Seaway and ferry services and other 
matters related to maritime trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and 
amending and repealing other Acts as a consequence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-44, an act for making the system of Canadian ports competitive, 
efficient and commercially oriented, providing for the establishing of port 
authorities and the divesting of certain harbours and ports, for the commercialization 
of the St. Lawrence Seaway and ferry services and other matters related to maritime 
trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and amending and repealing other 
Acts as a consequence, be referred now to the Standing Committee on Transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always, I consider it a great 
privilege to rise in the House. Today I am speaking in support of the 
proposed Canada marine act which was introduced on June 10, 
1996.
<P>
	The new Canada marine act will enable ports to respond more 
effectively to the needs of their customers and will eliminate 
needless bureaucratic interference in the marine sector. 
Modernization of the marine sector has a direct link to jobs and 
growth. A stronger and more efficient marine transportation system 
will improve Canada's international trade performance. That 
means jobs right here in Canada.
<P>
	The legislation will make it easier for ports to operate according 
to business principles. It will enable the Government of Canada to 
commercialize the operations of the seaway and to improve the 
way pilotage authorities and ferry services operate in Canada. It 
will serve to enhance the competitiveness of our marine sector, 
preparing it for the 21st century.
<P>
	At this point I wish to acknowledge the contribution already 
made to this bill by the Standing Committee on Transport, which 
undertook a comprehensive study of the national marine sector 
early in May of 1995. The SCOT report contained a number of 
recommendations to improve the marine system, many of which 
have been addressed in the legislation.
<P>
	I would like to address the main elements of Bill C-44. I want to 
begin with ports. The major ports in Canada will be managed by 
Canada port authorities. These CPAs will operate under the 
following guiding principles. Any port can apply to become a CPA, 
and there is a process in place to evaluate criteria proposed in this 
legislation. I expect anywhere from 10 to 15 ports will meet the 
criteria and be eligible for CPA status in the very near future.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	Port authorities will be established by letters patent as non-share 
capital corporations and will pay an annual amount to the crown 
based on gross revenues.
<P>
	The board of directors will consist of a federal, provincial and 
municipal appointment and then a majority of directors nominated 
by the port users. Boards of directors will have a defined code of 
conduct and conflict of interest provisions as set out in their letters 
patent and regulations.
<P>
	For the port users, local communities and financial community 
there is a new public accountability regime with new disclosure 
requirements that will ensure access to more detailed information. 
This accountability is achieved by an unprecedented transparency 
of operations and through rigorous disclosure requirements.
<P>
	The following documents and procedures will be made public on 
a mandatory basis. There will be an annual report. There will be an 
annual audit, a public land use plan requiring public input in the 
development process and amendment process. There will be annual 
meetings throughout, open to the pubic. Directors' and officers' 
compensation and benefits will be reported in the annual  report. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4788"> 4788 </A></B>
<P>
There are further aspects of the accountability regime which will be 
put in place by the proposed Canada marine act.
<P>
	The port authority will be required by law to have financial 
audits conducted annually in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing practices. Furthermore, a special examination of the 
management, operations and financial performance will be 
conducted no less than every five years and the results reported to 
the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Perhaps the most important accountability mechanism stems 
from the fact that ports will have to raise their financing in the 
private sector.
<P>
	Financing will depend on what the market sees as the realistic 
future cash flows of the ports. Their development aspirations will 
be subjected to ordinary measures of commercial risk. The 
government will no longer be responsible for their debt. In fact, 
this means they have to be more efficient than they are today. The 
government will not be on the hook for their liabilities.
<P>
	The end result is a system where port authorities will be 
accountable to their customers, their local communities, their 
financial community, federal, provincial and municipal 
governments.
<P>
	We are moving the decision making and accountability out of 
Ottawa and into the boards of directors of the new port authorities. 
We are ensuring financial responsibility by having the financial 
community decide on new port investment.
<P>
	We are keeping title to the federal lands that are entrusted to the 
new boards and we remain accountable for important framework 
issues such as safety. We think these are reforms that will energize 
our ports and contribute to Canada's growth of jobs and prosperity.
<P>
	For regional and local ports, the changes to the port system offer 
an opportunity for local interests in all provinces to manage ports 
in a manner more responsive to local needs with lower costs and 
better service.
<P>
	This act enables these ports to be transferred as operating ports 
to local interests and, in some cases, other federal departments.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that since January Transport Canada has 
already 47 port sites in the Arctic that were transferred to the coast 
guard April 1, 1996. Twelve fishing recreational port sites were 
transferred to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans April 1, 
1996.
<P>
	Order in council approval for 199 harbours was proclaimed in 
June 1996. Fifty-four letters of intent have been already signed as 
of this month. Five port sites will be transferred to local interests 
by the end of this month.
<P>
	I move on to the challenges facing the seaway. Quite frankly, 
they are formidable. We have a $7 billion asset supported by a 
declining traffic base and $70 million in revenue.
<P>
	If we do not take steps now to put the seaway on a stronger 
footing, we will have a big problem on our hands in a few years. 
The key to the future viability of the seaway lies in achieving 
efficiencies, reducing costs and making the system more 
competitive. Part III of the Canada Marine Act enables the Minister 
of Transport to enter into agreements with a non-profit corporation 
or any other private sector interests to operate and maintain all or 
part of the seaway.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	We now have an agreement in principle for a new operator to be 
put in place, perhaps as early as January and the existing seaway 
authority would be dissolved at an appropriate date.
<P>
	Another section of the bill deals with marine pilotage. 
Maintaining an effective pilotage regime to ensure safety and 
environmental protection is the primary concern of the 
government, users, the pilotage authorities and pilots alike.
<P>
	The Canada Marine Act includes amendments to the Pilotage 
Act which will allow for faster setting of tariffs to prohibit 
appropriations from the government and to provide for a 
ministerial review in consultation with the authorities and users in 
1998.
<P>
	These changes will serve the users better and ensure that the 
authorities operate in a more cost efficient and cost effective 
manner. Safety and environmental protection will continue to be 
the government's highest priority when making decisions with 
respect to marine pilotage. The changes in the delivery of pilotage 
services will ensure that the safety of marine transportation is 
maintained.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to ferry services, the Canada Marine Act 
will permit the Minister of Transport to enter into agreements with 
the private sector or other levels of government to provide the 
constitutional or other services that are currently provided by 
Marine Atlantic. These provisions are included in the act to 
facilitate the increased commercialization of ferry operations as 
outlined in the national marine policy.
<P>
	Again, the government will maintain its regulatory role for 
safety and it will continue to support constitutionally required 
services.
<P>
	This has just been a quick overview of the proposed Canada 
Marine Act. The goals of the marine policy are reflected in this 
legislation. We want our marine sector to be more competitive, 
more commercially driven, free from Ottawa bureaucracy and 
more responsive to the users.
<P>
	We believe this legislation will help us to achieve these goals 
and prepare the marine sector and transportation system for the 
competitive demands of the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just so everyone 
understands the rules of debate on this motion, members  are 
entitled to 10-minute interventions without questions or comments. 
The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4789"> 4789 </A></B>
<P>
maximum, of course, is three hours of debate on this motion before 
it is referred to the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make a few comments with regard to the Canada Marine Act.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has outlined the objectives of the 
act. The objectives are very noble and I certainly congratulate the 
parliamentary secretary for setting them out in legislation. It is 
time that our ports were more self-sufficient, self-determining in 
their goals and objectives and in financial accountability. I want to 
place on the record my support for the parliamentary secretary's 
outline of the objectives of the bill.
<P>
	I have received representation with regard to this issue a number 
of times since I arrived in Ottawa. As a person who represents a 
rural constituency in Lethbridge, Alberta, we usually do not talk 
about the seaway too much, or oceans, travel or marine life at all 
because we always are worried about having enough rain for the 
crops, never mind worrying about oceans, lakes and seaways.
<P>
	Pilotage on the Great Lakes has been brought to my attention. 
There are certain shipping lines that travel the lakes day after day, 
week after week, month after month. The captains of those boats 
are very aware of the travel patterns. They know how to be safe on 
the lakes and they know how to move from one port to another and 
avoid any kind of disaster or cause any difficulty in making their 
way and taking their cargoes of grain, coal or other materials from 
one port to another.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	As I understand it, in the past it was compulsory that they take on 
pilots at some of the ports. These pilots, either one or two or three, 
board the boat, find themselves a comfortable seat but the captain 
is still in charge. He knows where the boat is going. The pilots 
really do not contribute at all to that passage.
<P>
	The concern is the major cost that is incurred by that pilot 
entering the boat, taking a nice comfortable chair, riding from one 
port to another and supposedly fulfilling his or her commitment in 
determining what is a safe route and the best way to go.
<P>
	I can see that this may be necessary when foreign boats comes 
into the seaway, perhaps from the European continent or some 
other country. When they enter the seaway it is new territory or it is 
territory they may only travel a few times each year. Under those 
circumstances the regulations should require that those vessels 
should take on pilots as it ensures safety on the Great Lakes. It 
ensures that the correct route is taken and that the necessary 
requirements are met. I do not understand all of those 
requirements.
<P>
	I do see the case for a shipping company-the hon. minister and 
the parliamentary secretary certainly know the companies to which 
I am referring-that is consistently on the lakes and has been for 
years. They have experienced captains. Perhaps that is another 
requirement. Perhaps the captains have to travel the lakes so many 
years. After they have been travelling the lakes and navigating the 
ship on the seaway for some many years, they have the right to be 
their own pilot. Maybe some regulations could be put in place to 
deal with that issue.
<P>
	Why should the shipping company incur the extra cost of pilots 
when they are not needed on the boat at that time? It is a major cost 
to the industry. Certainly it employs somebody and creates a job. I 
understand that some of these pilot jobs are passed on from one 
family member to another. There are three or four families in their 
third or fourth generation of pilots so it is an industry for them.
<P>
	Under the regulations the shippers on the Great Lakes have to 
use them. They have a guaranteed income, a wonderful thing, and I 
know they would not want to upset that. In practical terms it just 
does not seem right.
<P>
	I recommend to the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the 
government that they look at this and maybe set up categories of 
where the requirements of a pilot are necessary and where they are 
not necessary. That makes some common sense as I see it.
<P>
	I am making a judgment, maybe as a prairie gopher. I do not 
understand all of the things that happen in terms of navigation on 
the Great Lakes. But after standing back and looking at it in a 
common sense way, in terms of efficiency and the shipping 
companies not incurring costs that are not necessary, I think that 
would be very right.
<P>
	As a farmer in western Canada, some of the grain I grow travels 
on the Great Lakes. It is moving on those boats. The Upper Lake 
Shipping Company, for example, moved some of my grain on the 
Great Lakes. I guess I am paying something extra because of the 
pilotage cost that is built into the system.
<P>
	I certainly appreciate the new objectives that have been set out 
for the port authorities. It is good that is being done. They sound 
excellent. The accountability that is built into it is certainly 
supportable and of merit.
<P>
	I ask the minister to have a second look at pilotage when 
regulations are designed to look at what is right and what is not 
right.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The third objective that the minister set out in his remarks is that 
the new act will be more responsive to the users. That is a good 
objective. It is the consumer, the user that really needs it, not the 
government. It should not be a bill for government. It should not be 
a bill to protect the bureaucrats of the system and enhance their  
jobs. It should not be a bill to protect the pilots. It should be a bill 
that enhances the opportunity of the users, that allows them to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4790"> 4790 </A></B>
<P>
efficient, to keep the costs down and to have safety as their utmost 
responsibility. I believe that is built into the bill.
<P>
	I would like to thank the House for the opportunity to speak to 
this bill. On that basis I am prepared to support it as an individual 
member from western Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I will give a brief description of the bill and then I 
will outline the Bloc's position.
<P>
	Bill C-44 implements the federal government's new national 
marine policy. Three hundred and twenty-four Transport Canada 
ports are equipped for commercial traffic. Ninety per cent of 
marine traffic goes through 45 ports. This bill mainly affects three 
major marine issues, namely ports, pilotage and the seaway.
<P>
	As far as ports are concerned, 324 of them come under the 
jurisdiction of Transport Canada, which shows the scope of this 
bill. The bill calls for the creation of Canada port authorities or 
CPAs, which will be private not for profit organizations operating 
in accordance with market discipline. The Canada Ports 
Corporation is being dismantled but the federal government still 
owns the federal lands on which CPAs are located.
<P>
	As for the seaway, the government intends to continue to 
commercialize operations, as the bill allows the federal 
government to reach an agreement on management and operations 
with the private sector.
<P>
	Finally, pilotage authorities will no longer have access to public 
funds.
<P>
	Here is our party's position on these provisions. First of all, we 
must emphasize that we have always supported the port divestment 
and commercialization policy, as we pointed out in our May 1995 
report on Canada's marine strategy. Therefore we support the bill 
in principle; however, we have four reservations about it.
<P>
	First, some neglected ports must be rehabilitated. The new 
managers and owners should not be penalized by the federal 
government's failure to properly maintain many federally-owned 
harbours and ports in recent years. They must have access to 
facilities that are in reasonable shape. In this regard, officials tried 
to reassure us by saying that $125 million has been set aside for this 
purpose, but this amount seems woefully inadequate.
<P>
	Second, during the divestment process, the federal government 
will have to take into account the differences between the various 
port facilities. Some profitable ports will sell easily, but other will 
need more assistance from public officials and the local 
community. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, want to emphasize this 
important point and we will be watching the federal government to 
ensure it takes regional disparities into account.
<P>
	Third, even though the federal government wants to withdraw 
financially from the area of shipping, paradoxically, it wants to 
impose government representation on the boards of directors. This 
is just one more of many areas in which the federal government has 
tried to retain full power while withdrawing financially since the 
Liberals have been back in power. The government is 
decentralizing its deficit but trying to maintain control over 
shipping.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Our fourth and last reservation is with the federal government 
wanting to divest itself within six years of ports that do not meet 
the requirements to become part of the ports system: traffic 
diversity, connections with other transport modes, and financial 
autonomy. At the end of these six years, it will decide what should 
happen to those ports that did not sell. This deadline may well 
cause insecurity in many communities, in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is for the commercialization of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway. We are also for government support for the 
building of ships suited for seaway navigation, which we feel is 
essential to the continued operation of the seaway and to shipyards 
in Quebec and Canada. Because of the reservations I have just 
listed, however, the Bloc cannot support Bill C-44 as it stands. 
Following the consultations scheduled to start on Monday, my 
party will propose amendments and, depending on how well these 
amendments are received, will vote accordingly.
<P>
	To conclude, Bill C-44 clearly shows how miserably the federal 
marine policy has failed these past twenty years. The federal 
government just realized, although a bit late, that its involvement 
over the years has resulted in costly and cumbersome 
bureaucratization as well as ineffective management. The St. 
Lawrence Seaway is a good example of this.
<P>
	More than $7 billion, in 1996 dollars, has been spent by the 
federal government on the seaway. But the seaway only generates 
$70 million per year in revenue, a 1 per cent return on the 
investment. Add to this the fact that shipping has declined by half 
since 1970. These figures show how effective federal policies are 
in shipping as in many other areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by saying that this intercession is being 
delivered on behalf of my colleague, the Reform transportation 
critic, the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. Reform 
supports the intent of Bill C-44. However, there are several areas 
with which we have concerns and I would like to expose those in 
the next few minutes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4791"> 4791 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion before us is to refer the bill to committee before 
second reading. We will support that motion but I believe it is in 
order to state the reasons for that support and the reservations we 
have.
<P>
	The first time this procedure was used on a transport bill was the 
legislation dealing with the privatization of CN Rail. We supported 
the Liberal argument that this process would allow the bill to be 
dealt with better in committee and that it would make it more 
amenable to amendments. Those assurances were false.
<P>
	The bill was debated at length and our transport critic brought 
forward several amendments designed to improve the bill that we 
had already generally agreed with. Although several Liberal 
members of the committee expressed words of agreement with 
some of those amendments, when it came time for the vote every 
amendment was defeated by the same Liberal Party that asked for 
our support for the new streamlined procedure.
<P>
	Interestingly, after the bill was passed in the House and 
implemented it became very clear that the Liberals would have 
been wise to have accepted some of those Reform amendments.
<P>
	The next transport bill to come before the House with a motion 
to send it to committee before second reading was the Canada 
Transport Act. This time, based on the false promises issued by the 
Liberals on the previous transport bill, the Reform Party did not 
support the motion. When the bill ended up in committee our critic 
once again went to work exposing numerous flaws with a bill that 
we generally supported. Once again he brought forward numerous 
motions designed to improve a bill that we did want to support.
<P>
	Unlike with the previous bill, the Liberals listened and then 
supported the majority of those amendments. Although there were 
a couple of rejected amendments which we felt were deal killers, 
we do acknowledge the Liberals' improved attitude in dealing with 
our amendments. Because of this improved attitude we are willing 
to give them another chance to act as they promised when they first 
introduced this procedure.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Having given our reasons for supporting the motion to refer the 
bill to committee before second reading so as to make it more 
amenable to amendments, I will now place the government on 
notice as to some of the aspects of the bill we have difficulty with.
<P>
	However, before I do that there is one other item that needs to be 
brought out. This bill was introduced in the House last spring. The 
intent of doing so was supposedly to allow the appropriate people 
to have the summer to study the bill in order to be prepared to study 
it again upon the reconvening of Parliament in September.
<P>
	One of the instruments utilized by members of Parliament is a 
briefing book on the bill supplied by the  appropriate department, 
in this case transport. Our transport critic, the member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke, did not receive the briefing book 
until the afternoon of September 25. That is not acceptable. I hope 
this disregard for proper and timely action is not an indication of 
how this bill will be dealt with.
<P>
	During summer our transportation critic studied this bill and 
made notes of his concerns. He then went on the road to discuss the 
bill with various port operators and users. He began his meetings 
by asking for their reaction to Bill C-44. He found in virtually 
every case that many of the concerns of those he visited were 
identical to his own concerns.
<P>
	Those areas of common concern include the size and the 
make-up of the board of directors. Section 6(2)(f) stipulates that 
the number of directors be between nine and eleven. Most port 
operators do not need nor do they want that large a board. Of those 
operators our critic visited, the desired number indicated ranged 
from three to five. One operator who did support five stated that he 
could live with seven but would prefer the lower number.
<P>
	The Reform Party had previously expressed its opinion of board 
of director make-up in its minority report in the marine study 
completed by the Standing Committee on Transport last year. We 
believe in government participation but not government control.
<P>
	Section 6(2)(f)(v)) of the bill states that one director is to be 
appointed by concerned municipalities and one by the province, 
two specifically in the case of the Port of Vancouver, and all other 
directors are to be appointed by the Minister of Transport. In the 
case of some of those appointments, the minister is to consult with 
the users. But no obligation is placed on the minister to appoint 
those who are chosen by the users.
<P>
	The government may argue it is its intention to appoint directors 
selected by the users but if it does not say that, it is not likely to 
happen. If the minister does indeed plan to appoint those elected by 
the users, why not just let the users appoint their own directors, but 
not in the numbers stipulated in the bill? No one group, be it the 
government, the municipalities or the users, should have in itself a 
majority on the board.
<P>
	Section 9 and others within the bill set out a provision that 
cancels any right that current office holders might have to 
compensation, damages or indemnity.
<P>
	Section 11(2) goes further by clearing stating that neither the 
port authority nor Her Majesty in Right in Canada is bound by any 
severance agreement entered into between a predecessor of the port 
authority and any of its officers after December 1, 1995. Given that 
transport is the same department that gave us the Pearson 
cancellation bill, we should not be surprised that it would do 
something like this.
<P>
	Section 24 restricts the right of a port authority to operate any 
form of business which may provide needed  cash flow revenues 
for the port. For example, Fraser port does partial assembly of 
vehicles upon their arrival. That is good business and aids in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4792"> 4792 </A></B>
<P>
financial viability of the port. The government should not be 
restricting this activity, it should be encouraging it. Fraser Port is 
an example of how we should set up the new port authorities. I am 
glad to see the nod across the way from the parliamentary secretary 
to go in that direction.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Section 27(3) states that a port authority may not mortgage any 
property that it holds in any manner. Does this restriction apply 
only to the crown land turned over to the port to operate or does it 
include other properties which have or may in the future be bought 
by the port authority? This we think is overly restrictive and creates 
serious financial problems for the ports.
<P>
	Another problem section is 36(5). This either stops a port 
authority from acquiring a new property or at a minimum requires 
an amendment to the letters patent each time there is a purchase. 
The idea of the bill is to get rid of bureaucratic red tape, as stated by 
the parliamentary secretary, not create more.
<P>
	Section 45 states that the Official Languages Act applies to a 
port authority as if it were a federal institution. That is absolutely 
without merit. Why would the Port of Prince Rupert on B.C.'s 
north coast need to be bilingual? Why would small ports at other 
west coast locations need to have this unnecessary expense and 
hiring restriction placed on them? It is not a matter of not wanting 
to provide a bilingual service, it is simply that no one would ever 
use it. Let us be practical.
<P>
	Section 56 sets it up for the minister to gouge money for little or 
no service out of certain ports like Kitimat. Considering that the 
Minister of Transport is also supposed to be the Liberal cabinet 
representative for B.C., he should be ashamed of allowing such an 
unfair provision to remain in the bill.
<P>
	Section 63 is little better and is also likely to cause undue 
hardship on Kitimat.
<P>
	While there are some other areas of concern, these are the most 
contentious. We are giving the government fair notice as to where 
our concerns lie. I hope it will remain open minded and work with 
us to make Bill C-44 one which all parties can support and one 
which will benefit all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate because, when we deal with the marine 
sector, the MIL Davie workers, in my riding of Lévis, immediately 
come to mind. My goal is to see if this bill includes measures that 
will be beneficial for these workers.
<P>
	Why do I think in these terms? Because Bill C-44 is pompously 
called the Canada Marine Act. However, there is nothing in it about 
marine construction or the merchant navy. Yet, I saw Liberals, 
including the Prime Minister, come to meet MIL Davie workers 
and tell them that a summit would be held and a policy would be 
developed.
<P>
	In the end, this bill deals primarily with ports. What is it all 
about? The member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, who spoke 
before me, stated the Bloc's position. In principle, we cannot 
oppose this bill, because it theoretically seeks to take politics out of 
port authorities. However, we are not so sure that this will actually 
be the case.
<P>
	For example, in most cases, the federal government will 
continue to appoint the directors of a port authority. As mentioned 
in clause 12(1), there will be an official representing the federal 
government, but, with the exception of those individuals appointed 
by the municipalities and the provinces, the others, including those 
representing the users, will be appointed by the federal 
government.
<P>
	I happen to come from the region of Lévis, across from Quebec 
City, which has a major port.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Over the years, I watched what was going on in the port of 
Quebec, because there are port facilities on both sides of the river. 
What happened is that, over the ten previous years, the port of 
Quebec had accumulated profits of $36 million. This prompted the 
federal Conservative government, and then the Liberals, to grab 
$33 million out of the $36 million.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, you will understand why the port 
authorities had no real incentive to make profits. The member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes talked about siphoning off profits 
and he is absolutely right. This best describes what took place. The 
federal government was siphoning off the profits and, then it says, 
in the bill, that the previous policy has failed. This is indeed the 
case, because, wherever it was cost-effective, the federal 
government moved in and took amounts for its own administration.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has certain concerns, one being that, 
although the port of Quebec City was cost-effective, smaller ports, 
and there are many of them, are not in the same situation. We are 
still worried about them. Often, ports are in pitiful shape. The 
federal government has neglected the maintenance of several small 
ports and now it would like to turn these small ports over to local 
entrepreneurs, rely on the spirit of economic development and 
initiative that local people may have.
<P>
	It is not much of a gift in some cases, unless the necessary 
money is invested. We will see, during the consultation, because 
there will be hearings at which the various stakeholders throughout 
Canada who are interested in the matter may express their views. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4793"> 4793 </A></B>
<P>
The members of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition,  will 
be present at each of these hearings to listen to people's concerns.
<P>
	At first sight, $125 million to refurbish all the ports concerned 
seems insufficient to us. Sometimes, what is needed is an analogy 
with what is happening in other areas. This morning, I read in the 
newspaper about a group of five small regional airports in Quebec 
that have decided to make representations to the federal 
government. The representatives say that they would be interested 
in taking over management of these airports, but that they are in 
unsatisfactory shape at the moment. For a year, or 18 months now, I 
believe, we have been seeing, if we look at specific cases, that 
people are realizing that if an adjustment is not made, it is not as 
interesting for local authorities to take over the administration of 
what the federal government leaves behind.
<P>
	I will give another small example. I personally wonder. Take the 
Toronto airport, You will tell me it is not the same thing, but it still 
has a bearing on the ports. The Conservative government had 
decided to privatize Pearson, but the Liberal government wanted to 
prevent privatization. Why? Because there was more in it for them 
that way. It makes me wonder. When something brings in money, 
the government wants to hang on to it to fill its own coffers, but 
when it is a losing proposition, and when the government itself has 
contributed to the deterioration of the infrastructures, it wants to 
hand it over to the local authorities.
<P>
	At first sight, this strikes me as a real contradiction. So during 
these hearings on the ports, people will have a chance to express 
their concerns. I think that these hearings will provide an 
opportunity for them to do so.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The only thing I see is that the time limit seems very short. In the 
human resources development committee I have seen that people 
have not had enough time to prepare a brief because of the time 
limits. The democratic process, though generally very good, is not 
always followed as it should be, because people have not been 
given the necessary time to prepare. At any rate, we shall see what 
happens.
<P>
	This the reason for the Bloc Quebecois' serious reservations, 
despite our support of the principle.
<P>
	There is also the matter of pilotage. I have had a lot of 
representations from people about the St. Lawrence, where I 
understand it will be implemented in 1998. The St. Lawrence pilots 
have expressed their concerns to me. They are not sure it is a good 
thing to move the St. Lawrence pilot administration to Ottawa. In 
this instance, centralization does not seem attractive at first glance.
<P>
	Finally, as for privatization and increased commercialization of 
the St. Lawrence Seaway, I would be in agreement with that. Yet I 
would point out that, as the member for Lévis, I would certainly 
like to see this  new legislation take into consideration the fact that 
<P>
vessels plying the St. Lawrence Seaway in future will have to be 
built with a narrower seaway in mind. We are well aware that it is 
not all that easy to navigate through all kinds of submerged 
barriers. As well, environmental protection regulations would be 
necessary.
<P>
	If all of this were done, the situation of the workers at MIL 
Davie, whom I represent here, would also be improved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-44 which concerns 
shipping.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to digress somewhat. Speaking of 
transport, two weeks ago in my riding we opened the Véloroute des 
bleuets, a bicycle path around the Lac-Saint-Jean that will give all 
visitors as well as residents a chance to tour this lovely region. It is 
probably one of the few bicycle paths that forms a loop, in other 
words, you never cover the same ground twice.
<P>
	I say this just in passing. Now, from cycling to boating.
<P>
	Shipping is probably one of the most important economic sectors 
in Quebec and Canada. Need I add that it helped create our two 
countries. That is why it is essential to consider every aspect of a 
bill that concerns this sector before taking action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Two countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Yes, two countries.
<P>
	The proposed legislation implements the federal government's 
national marine policy announced in December 1995. This is new 
legislation that will regulate the entire shipping sector, both in 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The government dares to refer to this legislation as the Canada 
Marine Act. In fact, we are really talking about legislation to 
regulate shipping in Quebec and in Canada. So why is there no 
reference to shipbuilding, an important industry in Quebec? Why is 
there no reference to shipyards? Why is there no reference to the 
merchant navy? I intend to answer those questions.
<P>
	First of all, because the federal government's marine policy has 
been a complete flop. A good example is the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
In 20 years, the federal government has invested $7 billion-quite 
a bundle-while annual revenues amount to about $70 million 
annually. The situation is pretty clear.
<P>
	The government is definitely in the red, and furthermore, today's 
shipping is half what it was in the seventies, in the good old days. 
This is why the government wants to get rid of the embarrassing 
economic situation of its ports, while maintaining a final say on the 
membership of the boards of directors that will have the 
responsibility for managing the ports.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="4794"> 4794 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, clauses 12(1)(a) amd (e) of the bill provide that 
the federal government will have a representative on each of these 
boards in addition to appointing the other members in consultation 
with the users. But the bill does not specify whether or not the 
minister is required to respect the users' choice. I think that this, in 
a way, shows the irony of this bill. The government should not try 
to sell us a bill of goods: it cannot get rid of the infrastructure, and 
still have a say in this.
<P>
	The government may well consult with users and then appoint 
whoever they want, as this seems to be a hallmark of the party 
across the way. Again, the government talks about decentralization 
but the facts show a totally different situation. In government 
language, it simply means getting rid of the federal deficit at the 
expense of the other levels of government while maintaining 
control through a federally-appointed board of directors and 
especially saving the work for its own officials. This is reminiscent 
of what is happening here in Ottawa, where everyone is working to 
keep his or her job. Effectiveness does not matter.
<P>
	Given the state of Canada's deficit, the government should 
perhaps sell off the whole country, keeping only the Parliament 
buildings. That would be one way to get rid of its debts.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> First they must find a buyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Right, the problem is finding 
a buyer. That would be one way for the government to get rid of its 
debts without losing its decision making power, which is very 
important.
<P>
	In the end, I seriously wonder about two problems that might 
arise from this bill. First, I am very concerned by the wide variation 
in the commercial viability of the various ports. The government 
should take into account the differences between the various port 
facilities. As we know, some ports are more profitable than others 
and will sell off quickly, while others will need more help from 
both the public and the private sectors and from local communities. 
Making them commercially viable will increase our already heavy 
financial burden.
<P>
	The second problem that bothers me is this. In what kind of 
shape will the ports the federal government will hand over to the 
private sector be? Finaly, as my colleague for Lévis said 
essentially, earlier, when something is profitable, you retain control 
over it and pocket the profits, otherwise, you divest ourselves of it. 
It is a well known fact that several harbours and ports were left to 
look after their own maintenance and modernization. Officials did 
try to reassure us by saying that $125 millions will be earmarked 
for repairs to ports that have not been properly maintained. Given 
the condition of certain ports, it seems clear to me that $125 
million is very definitely not enough. Again, this goes to  show that 
the 
<P>
government's sole aim is to get out of debt by shifting the costs of 
repair onto other levels of government and the private sector.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is very much in favour of the 
commercialization of the St. Lawrence Seaway. At the same time, 
we are for government support for the building of ships suited for 
seaway navigation. We will be looking at the bill with a view to 
making suggestions on how to improve it, so that it better meets the 
expectations of all Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	As I said and I repeat, shipping, particularly on the St. Lawrence 
Seaway, represents an important industry, an economy, which must 
not be taken lightly. The government must consider the merits of 
my line of argument.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Rather than give the floor to 
a member for one minute, we will proceed to members' statements 
and then we will resume this debate after question period.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has done it yet again with the appointment of Wilfred 
Moore to the Senate yesterday. He has extended his unbroken 
streak of blatantly and cynically putting his Liberal Party interests 
ahead of democracy in Canada.
<P>
	I do not need to talk about Mr. Moore's impeccable Liberal 
pedigree because the Prime Minister wants only people who would 
do his bidding.
<P>
	Canadians should realize how the Prime Minister is perverting 
the Canadian democratic process. For example, Canadians assume 
because their elected representatives overcame strong lobbying by 
the heritage minister and her department that there be a ban on 
cable company negative option billing that the ban would come 
into effect but this is not so. Even as we speak the Liberal senators 
are being told how to vote on behalf of the heritage department, on 
behalf of the cable companies and against consumers. This Prime 
Minister wants to have his own way.
<P>
	Perverting the Canadian democratic process with endless Senate 
appointments works against Canadians who are demanding 
accountability instead of Liberal manipulation.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Drayton Festival. 
Located in my riding, the Drayton Festival will conclude its sixth 
season on Sunday, October 6.
<P>
	A true success story, the festival has quickly grown from 16,000 
tickets sold in 1991 to 60,000 this year. Running from May to 
October, the 21-week season is the third longest running summer 
theatre in Ontario.
<P>
	This season the most popular show was a Canadian musical play 
about the second world war as seen through the eyes of six 
Canadian soldiers. Extremely popular with all audiences and 
heavily supported by the Royal Canadian Legion, the show was 98 
per cent sold out.
<P>
	The theatre, which receives no government money, recently 
launched a $1.5 million capital campaign to renovate its historic 
building. To date over $500,000 has been raised.

	We should also use all our influence to gain full international 
recognition for the agreement on straddling stocks and highly 
migratory fish.
<P>
	The policies and achievements of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans last year gave us a position of moral leadership in global 
fish stocks management. We should work to retain that position.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Justice referred to conditions 
mutually acceptable to Canadians and Quebecers based on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4799"> 4799 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Constitution. Need I remind everyone that this 
Constitution has been judged unacceptable by all of the 
governments of Quebec? The present federal Minister of 
Immigration, who is present in the House, moreover, held that 
opinion when she was a member of the Quebec National Assembly. 
I do not know whether she has changed her mind since then.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice also stated yesterday, and I quote: ``We 
shall take whatever steps are necessary in the months ahead to 
comply with the commitment we gave in the speech from the 
throne''.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice confirm that referral to the Supreme 
Court is only the first step of plan B, and that the federal 
government is preparing to impose impossible conditions on 
Quebec, by setting the rules for the referendum itself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, and might I add a note of 
reality to this?
<P>
	It was Mr. Bouchard himself who sent his Minister of Justice 
into a Montreal court room, a few months ago, in the spring of this 
year, in order to convince it to close the Bertrand case because, 
under the Constitution, the courts have nothing to do with 
sovereignty. He was not successful. We responded to that in court 
and were successful in convincing the judge to continue because 
the court does indeed have a role to play by deciding these matters 
of law.
<P>
	After that, the Quebec Minister of Justice left the case, yet the 
basic questions remain, those raised by Mr. Bouchard and his 
Minister of Justice themselves.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	We have raised those fundamental questions in the highest court 
of the land, and Mr. Bouchard and the Government of Quebec have 
refused to participate. In my opinion, the only conclusion we can 
reach is that Mr. Bouchard and the Government of Quebec are well 
aware that what we maintain is true: unilateral action is illegal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the unilateral action by the Government of Quebec is 
illegal, yet the unilateral action by the federal government is legal. 
That is this boils down to. That is what they mean by democracy.
<P>
	Their ``democracy'' is a game with loaded dice. Their 
``democracy'' denies the existence of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Justice admit that any desire for change 
expressed by the people of Quebec is subject to a veto by any one 
of the provinces, from Newfoundland to Prince Edward Island, 
since unanimity is required under the Constitution, a constitution 
no Quebec government, whether Liberal or PQ, has accepted or 
signed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it suits the purpose of the hon. 
member to confuse one issue with another. What he fails to address 
is that the one rule that binds us all in this country is the rule of law.
<P>
	What is at issue here is whether that rule of law is to govern all 
that we do, including resolving the great national question of 
separation.
<P>
	We made clear yesterday that we must respect a decisive 
majority on a clear question on that issue as expressed by the 
population of Quebec. The question will be separation or not, 
nothing in between, not partnership or any such thing. Separation 
or not is the clear and honest question that must be asked.
<P>
	We have every confidence that when that question is asked, the 
population of Quebec will vote, as it has done on two earlier 
occasions, for a united Canada.
<P>
	The issue we confront in the case that we have now referred to 
the Supreme Court of Canada is this. My hon. friend and the 
government of the province of Quebec pretend that if they get the 
result they want the very next day they can walk away unilaterally 
from the nation that is Canada. That is not so.
<P>
	They would have to follow negotiations to resolve the tough 
issues involved in separation, not partnership. Those negotiations 
have to be in accordance with an orderly process consistent with 
the rule of law.
<P>
	That is our point in taking his questions to the Supreme Court of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are getting closer and closer to the real bottom line. 
What this minister is telling us is that Quebecers and their 
government lack the maturity and democracy to be capable of 
making a decision on their own concerning their development, 
their future. That we need the other provinces, the anglophone 
majority in Canada, to tells us how to go about it. That is the 
bottom line.
<P>
	With the exception of his better approach, this minister is acting 
exactly like his Prime Minister, who has always found a way to 
stick it to Quebec-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> What is the question? Hold on, it is coming up. 
As I was saying, like the Prime Minister, who has always fiddled 
with principles in order to stick it to Quebec.
<P>
	To quote the Minister of Justice again, because it is noteworthy: 
``Mr. Speaker, I very much hope that our federalist allies in Quebec 
will see the value of clearly determining these questions that have 
now been put at issue''. You see, the Quebec federalists are not in  
agreement with the federal government. They can smell a trap that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4800"> 4800 </A></B>
<P>
reeks of Meech Lake, but the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration does not seem to be unable to do so.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question. Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> My question is on the way, if only the wolves will 
stop their howling.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Justice aware that this government is in the 
process of cutting all ties with Quebec, even with its federalist 
allies like the Quebec Liberal Party?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have addressed the question, we 
have made a speech.
<P>
	But the speech mentioned the word ``democracy'', a pertinent 
word here, because of course we must respect the decision of the 
population of Quebec on the question of separation. Of course, if a 
decisive majority voices its opinion on a clear question after a legal 
process, and decides to leave Canada, to separate, that decision 
must be respected. That is true.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Yes, it is true. It is obvious that we do not intend to 
hold someone within Canada by force, against their will. We are, 
however, confident that decision will not be taken.
<P>
	But the reason for our referral to the Supreme Court this week is 
that action after such a vote cannot be unilateral. We need answers 
to the difficult questions which arise under such circumstances. 
That is to say, all Canadians are involved in this process, a process 
which must respect the rule of law. That is the purpose of our action 
this week.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I may be allowed to 
comment, the first round of questions took us 10 minutes. I would 
therefore appreciate the co-operation of both sides of the House in 
making both questions and answers more concise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice said yesterday that he would 
recognize the will of Quebec if certain conditions were met.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice tell us in no uncertain terms 
whether the federal government intends to determine the wording 
of the question and the percentage required to recognize a 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we intend to act on the 
commitment we made in February in the speech from the throne, 
that if there was a third referendum in Quebec, there would be a 
clear question, full discussion of all the consequences, a fair and 
equitable process and  an opportunity for all Canadians to have 
some say on the future of their country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice also said that all Canadians would 
have their say. However, he would not tell us whether he was 
considering holding a pan-Canadian referendum to determine 
Quebec's future.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice tell us today whether the 
government has dismissed the possibility of holding a 
pan-Canadian referendum on the future of Quebec? Yes or no?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Government of Quebec 
insists on a third referendum after twice the population of Quebec 
voted for a united Canada, the first issue will be to determine the 
will and wish of Quebecers. We have said time and again that we 
are confident they will choose a united Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member pretends that in such an event the population 
of Quebec would choose a different course. We are saying that in 
any such unlikely eventuality, all Canadians have a stake in what 
would then happen, which is the settlement of the issues that would 
be outstanding on separation, not partnership. All Canadians must 
have a voice in determining those issues.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the defence minister have 
demonstrated to Canadians their lack of leadership, and by their 
lack of leadership they have allowed morale in the Canadian 
Armed Forces to plummet.
<P>
	Instead of restoring morale, they have been lining the pockets of 
their Liberal campaign workers. The defence department budget 
was meant to protect Canada's interests, not as a personal slush 
fund for friends of the Prime Minister and his cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	To the acting Prime Minister, why is the Liberal government 
spending more money rewarding its friends than it is restoring 
morale in the Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are rules for these contracts which are clear. Each department 
has delegated authority to assign some contracts according to rules 
which are provided by the Treasury Board. These rules have been 
followed by the minister of defence.
<P>
	I am assured that all the rules that were in place have been 
followed. In this case, the rules that apply are similar to the rules 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4801"> 4801 </A></B>
<P>
that apply to the Leader of the Opposition and to the leader of the 
third party. These contracts have to meet certain criteria. I am 
informed they have all been met.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again Canadians will not be happy with the fox 
writing his own rules when it comes to guarding the chicken house.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the defence minister clearly are putting 
their self-interests ahead of leading the Canadian military by 
failing to uphold ethical standards. By rewarding Joe Thornley and 
Stephanos Karabecos with lucrative contracts they have shown that 
they put their personal self-interests and financial betterment of 
friends above rank and file troops in our Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	To demonstrate to members of the Canadian Armed Forces that 
their interests and their morale are paramount, will the government 
conduct an official review of the tendering process for the Thornley 
contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
allegations of the member opposite are simply incorrect.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated the number of contracts 
that have been allocated to people who were ex-candidates for the 
Reform Party. The criteria have to do with efficiency, ability to 
meet the requirements of the contract within the moneys allocated. 
This is what has been done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows that he is clearly trying to confuse 
Canadians. He is comparing apples and oranges. We are talking 
about the executive branch of government issuing untendered 
contracts; leadership and responsibility with accountability, not 
interest at all costs.
<P>
	While the defence minister was stuffing the pockets of his 
Liberal buddies, the family of Corporal Neil MacKinnon was 
trying in vain to find out exactly how its son was killed.
<P>
	First, Mr. and Mrs. MacKinnon were lied to and then the lie was 
covered up for over a year. The command inspector will not be 
investigating this shameful incident. People have been charged in 
Corporal MacKinnon's death but no one is being held accountable 
for the lies his parents had to endure for over a year.
<P>
	Why does the defence minister's leadership stop at the bank for 
his Liberal friends when it never made it to the home of Corporal 
Neil MacKinnon?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member opposite has imputed a lot of motives. 
The facts do not flow  directly or logically. He is trying to evolve a 
web here that is so convoluted it is very difficult to answer his 
question.
<P>
	Simply put, the accident that took place with Corporal 
McKinnon was a tragic accident. Upon its discovery, immediately 
the armed forces took forthwith a board of inquiry to get to the 
bottom of it. They have followed through to the very end with 
charges. People have been charged with negligence of duty. One 
cannot be more responsible than that.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The opening of the tunnel in Jerusalem sparked a wave of 
violence which so far has claimed nearly 100 casualties. In a 
situation where Jewish colonization has started again and 
negotiations on the definitive status of the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip are threatened, the opening of this tunnel constitutes a 
genuine provocation that further compromises the peace process in 
the Middle East.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister indicate whether, as other 
governments have done, the Canadian government intends to ask 
Israel to close the tunnel in order to restore calm and thus 
contribute towards resumption of the peace process?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Co-operation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada is very concerned about the surge of 
violence in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. I very much 
appreciate the concern shown by the hon. member of the 
opposition.
<P>
	We are dismayed by the increasing number of casualties over the 
past few days. Canada is asking for an immediate ceasefire.
<P>
	I can also inform you that today, the Canadian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs is attending a special session of the UN Security 
Council on this important question. My colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, will present Canada's position, which is to ask 
Israeli and Palestinian representatives to resume direct negotiations 
and take immediate steps to restore calm.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister also met with senior Israeli representatives 
yesterday in New York to press them to refrain from any pressures 
that may be unhelpful to the Middle East peace process. I can also 
inform the member that some senior officials from the Department 
of Foreign Affairs met yesterday in Ottawa and gave the same 
message.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

Canadian government, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
intends to ask for a ceasefire. I asked a very specific question, 
namely whether he intends to ask for the tunnel to be closed.
<P>
	Furthermore, does the minister also intend to support the request 
by Yasser Arafat for immediate intervention by the Security 
Council on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Co-operation and Minister responsible for Francophonie,

before the UN Security Council today is very important, and at this 
time I would not wish to commit Canadian diplomacy as 
specifically as the hon. member for the opposition would have us 
do, since these discussions are now taking place in New York.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice is sending out some fairly confusing signals. 
Yesterday and today he suggested that Canadians would have a full 
voice on any developments surrounding the future of their country 
in the event of Quebec's secession. However, today he stopped 
short of saying that Canadians would be involved and have a voice 
in a referendum campaign in the event of Quebec's secession.
<P>
	Is it the government's position that a full and meaningful voice 
would mean that they would have a vote in a referendum 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have said time and again, even 
in the speech from the throne, that our commitment is quite clear. It 
is that if a third referendum is to be held in Quebec we will ensure 
that the choice is very clear: remaining in Canada or separating. 
There is no middle ground and no suggestion of partenariat or some 
association which is in someone's imagination. That is the first 
item.
<P>
	Second, the consequences would be clear. Those voting in 
Quebec would know that they are choosing between Canada and 
something very different, which is separation.
<P>
	Third, the process would be fair. Canadians would have a right to 
express themselves in seeking to persuade the population of 
Quebec to remain.
<P>
	Fourth, no matter what the decision, Canadians everywhere 
would have a say in the future. This would mean that unilateral 
action, no matter what the result of the referendum, is illegal and 
unacceptable and following a referendum in Quebec when the 
population of Quebec expresses its view, all Canadians must then 
participate in determining where we go from there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I 
am trying to get to is how would they have a say in where we go 
from there? I am going to push on to another question.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Reformers maintain that Quebecers have the right to decide 
whether to secede from Canada, but this does not imply the right of 
the Government of Quebec to unilaterally establish the terms and 
conditions of secession.
<P>
	The only way to ensure that Canada's interests will be well 
represented in the event of secession is to pass contingency 
legislation laying out the terms and conditions of secession. Is the 
government willing to consider such legislation or is the Supreme 
Court reference the sum total of its plan B?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court reference is a 
response to issues raised by the Government of Quebec. It was Mr. 
Bouchard and his minister of justice who said that the courts have 
no role to play. When they raised that issue in the Bertrand 
litigation we went to that courtroom, persuaded the hon. Mr. Justice 
Pidgeon that, indeed, the courts do have a role to play. He said as 
much in his judgment of August 30. After that issue was 
determined, Mr. Bouchard and his minister of justice left the 
courtroom and abandoned the process.
<P>
	We have now taken the very issues he has raised and put them 
before the Supreme Court of Canada. That is what this reference is 
about.
<P>
	In a more direct response to the hon. member's question, the 
issue of contingency legislation was raised yesterday by his 
colleague, the hon. member for Calgary West. As I said then, a 
number of suggestions have been made in the public discussion 
about how we might approach this issue. They are all useful 
suggestions. That public discussion should continue. It is very 
valuable and we encourage it.
<P>
	I am sure that through that discussion in which all Canadians are 
participating a number of valuable suggestions will arise and they 
shall all be considered.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	This government is collecting scandals the way some people 
collect stamps. After the family trust scandal, yesterday the auditor 
general condemned Revenue Canada for allowing several major 
corporations to avoid paying duties and excise taxes to the tune of 
some $630 million a year.
<P>
	Given that the time limit for a tax audit is four years, can the 
Deputy Prime Minister explain why Revenue Canada has 
conducted only one audit of all the major oil and tobacco 
companies, thus preventing the government from recovering 
several million of dollars with each audit?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
I also want to thank the auditor general for bringing these issues to 
our attention.
<P>
	I would first point out that in the year after the government took 
office, lost revenues due to smuggling decreased by two-thirds. 
That is a result of government initiatives. It is a big $1 billion 
decrease.
<P>
	During the time that the audit resources were reallocated into the 
anti-smuggling situation, all of the large industries were 
monitored. The department has recently completed several large oil 
company audits and the results confirm our risk assessments. The 
rate of compliance was excellent. It was in excess of 95 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have noticed 
that the government acts only when it has its back against the wall, 
as was the case with smuggling. Every day, the revenue minister is 
allowing hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions in tax 
revenue to be lost. By not going after the $630 million owed her 
department, the minister is making a royal gift to major 
corporations on the back of taxpayers.
<P>
	What are the government and its minister waiting to take action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue 
these smuggling initiatives. In fact, it will be done 
department-wide. The assistant deputies are monitoring the 
situation and working together. Not only that, it involves other 
jurisdictions. It involves the police forces and the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	We are doing very well. This is a criminal element in our society 
and we are going after that money. It is important work in our 
department and we will continue to do it well, so that instead of a 
$1 billion decrease we look forward to getting rid of the extra $500 
million. We are working on that and we have the plan of action to 
complete.

last Monday when the House was voting on the negative option 
bill. It appears to be on the letterhead of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. It says: ``Government position on Bill C-216. Third 
reading. Government position: No''.
<P>
	It may be a forgery because the minister said outside the House 
that she had not tried in any way to influence the members of her 
caucus to vote the way that her department wanted to vote, which 
was against the consumer and in favour of the cable companies.
<P>
	My question is very simple. Is this document a forgery or was 
her statement a forgery?

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the 
problem. Her answers have been devoid of even the smallest 
particle of fact.
<P>
	The issue is that on one side of the coin she is trying to imply to 
the Canadian people that the government is opposed to negative 
option billing; therefore, making the connection to this bill which 
is opposed to negative option billing as though she was supporting 
the bill, whereas, in fact, I have evidence that the government 
position was opposed to that bill. She is trying to have it both ways.
<P>
	I ask her again, was her government in any way, shape or form 
trying to influence the members to vote against the negative option 
bill which was before the House, namely, Bill C-216?

the opinion that increased circulation of information between 
private and public schemes would result in improved service to 
clients and reduced program costs.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to amend the Canada Pension Plan in 
order to rectify the shortcomings in the present system and thus 
ensure that only those truly entitled to disability benefits actually 
receive them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are aware of the auditor 
general's comments. I had an opportunity to meet with Mr. 
Desautels and to discuss his report.
<P>
	Obviously, I and my departmental officials have a great deal of 
respect for the work that has been done on this issue. It is very 
complex. We undertook, in our response to the comments of the 
auditor general, to take the necessary action in order to try to be as 
effective as possible.
<P>
	With all due respect to the auditor general, I wish to assure my 
hon. colleague that, when all is said and done, we are still very 
interested in ensuring that, where an error has been made, and 
errors are still made, we come down in favour of those applying for 
disability benefits, rather than taking a more stringent approach.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general has noted that the government's 
reassessment activities are still falling short of the mark, despite 
the very firm recommendations he made in 1993.
<P>
	When does the minister finally intend to take the necessary 
action so that only those who are eligible benefit from the public 
disability pension scheme?
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, at the meeting of social services 
ministers in Victoria almost two weeks ago, we all agreed that one 
of the major problems facing the systems that manage the workers' 
compensation boards, the private insurance companies, as well as 
the government of Canada, through the Canada Pension Plan, had 
to do with disability.
<P>
	It is extremely difficult to define this whole question in absolute 
terms. There are many situations that are extremely complex from 
a medical point of view. But we undertook to try to work together, 
the private sector, the provincial governments-because they too 
have major problems with this-and the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I hope that we will find solutions, but in the meantime we will 
continue to be effective and to protect the rights of the disabled.

	Yesterday the premier of Manitoba made some serious

payments under the disaster financial assistance arrangements are 
made according to the same criteria and all the provinces are 
treated fairly and equitably.
<P>
	The Manitoba government has already been paid advance 
payments of $7 million for the 1993 floods. In July of this year we 
received a request from the Government of Manitoba telling us the 
amount of damages for the 1995 and 1996 floods but there was no 
request for an advance payment to be made and therefore no 
advance payment was made.

	In this case, all the rules have been followed and Manitoba has 
been treated in a totally fair and equitable manner.

<P>
	In view of the fact Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
and the Yukon have notified the minister they will be opting out of 
administering the new federal firearms' regulations and are 
launching a court challenge, does the minister still stand by those 
statements?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

continuously. The fact that the attorneys general of some of those 
provinces did not like what was done does not mean they were not 
asked for their views and their views were listened to carefully.
<P>
	The hon. member is factually wrong in saying that Ontario is 
opting out. As I understand its position, it is challenging the regime 
in court but it has not decided to opt out.
<P>
	The fact is that there are some provincial governments who do 
not support gun control. That is the sad fact: some provincial 
governments do not support gun control. It is a good thing there is 
at least one level of government in this country that is prepared to 
represent the wishes of the vast majority of Canadians who stand 
up for gun control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fact of the matter is all provinces support crime 
control.
<P>
	As a result of these court challenges the federal government will 
end up fighting these challenges using taxpayers' dollars, the same 
taxpayers' dollars which will be used by the provinces and the 
same taxpayers' dollars the federal government will need in its out 
of court settlements for the Pearson airport deal and the Airbus 
fiasco.
<P>
	I ask the minister this. Have the court bills been tallied?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

us some money perhaps he can speak to his friends in the Alberta 
government and have them drop the lawsuit.
<P>
	I read in this morning's newspaper that the attorney general of 
Alberta gives himself a 50:50 chance. It is for the courts to decide. 
We have to respect the role of the courts.
<P>
	I will say this. I am very confident. From the federal perspective 
it looks a lot better than 50:50. Let me say that this is on the part of

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you know quite well the Canadian content includes 25 per cent 
French channels. That is very important. In the case we are 
concerned with, Mrs. Barshefsky, the U.S. Secretary of State for 
Trade, has asked her Canadian counterpart to take steps so that 
DMX can operate in Canada under the conditions agreed to by the 
CRTC and thus to ensure, without saying it in so many words, that 
this issue does not become an irritant between the two

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform believes that government operations should not compete 
directly with the private sector and supports the privatization of 
services offered in the private sector at an equal and competitive 
rate.
<P>
	We now understand that the new buyers of the Canada 
Communication Group will get special access to lucrative federal 
contracts that bypass the bidding process. Privatization should save 
money, not cost taxpayers more.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of public works. How can the 
minister guarantee to Canadians that the government will get the 
best deal on printing contracts if contracts are not awarded through 
an open, competitive bidding process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the minister, I can point out to the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4806"> 4806 </A></B>
<P>
member that there are times when the standard procedure of open 
competitive bidding, which is the general policy of the 
government, has to be varied by reason, for example, of some trade 
mark or copyright.
<P>
	They require standardization of equipment that can only be 
obtained from one supplier. In addition, there may be other reasons 
of a similar nature. I can only assure him that our general policy is, 
of course, open and competitive bidding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking about integrity of government. That is one of the lamest 
answers we have come across in quite a while.
<P>
	I have been part of the government operations committee 
looking into the open bidding system. This has nothing to do with 
open bidding. This has to do with giving a lucrative contract to one 
special segment. The government has sold the corporation to the 
employees and are now giving the employees special access. This 
is not open government.
<P>
	My question, again, is for the minister of public works. Will the 
minister guarantee that the private sector will not be put at an 
unfair disadvantage and allow all companies a fair chance to bid on 
all government contracts above $30,000, as required by Treasury 
Board guidelines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a little difficulty with the hon. member's 
supplementary. The first question was about open bidding. In the 
supplementary he is not talking about it.
<P>
	What I would like to point out to him is that it is simply not 
possible in a complex system such as the federal government to 
make such totally sweeping guarantees.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	For example, if we have computer software of a particular type, 
it is not possible to open it up to open bidding to companies that 
could not supply that product because of copyright infringement 
problems. There has to be some give and take.
<P>
	In addition, there have to be some elements, which are successor 
contracts, where we already have developed a system in place. To 
throw out existing work and start completely afresh every time a 
new contract may come down on a program would simply be bad 
business management and exactly the opposite of what the private 
sector would want this government to do when it protects taxpayer 
dollars.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific),

<P>
	There is a lot of concern among Canadians of Hong Kong origin 
that in order to maintain their permanent resident status in Hong 
Kong they were asked to return to Hong Kong by July 1. But their 
concern is with how long they have to stay after that and how long 
before they have to be in Hong Kong. Does it mean that all Hong 
Kong residents who have foreign visas or who have foreign 
citizenship status have to remain stagnant in Hong Kong after July 
1, before they register?

small but important quote, the president of Agriteam Canada

CIDA is like any other client. If you do your homework, submit 
first rate proposals and have people on the ground to sell your 
product where the decisions are being made, you get fair 
consideration. We at Agriteam Canada are definitely westerners, 
yet we have won a number of CIDA contracts. We do not do it by 
crapping on Quebec. We do it by showing that we have more to 
offer than firms from Quebec or Ontario''. That is the way it works.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAMARINEACT">CANADA MARINE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-44, the Canada Marine Act.
<P>
	I will take a moment, of course, to state the purpose of Bill C-44 
and discuss some concerns the Bloc Quebecois has regarding this 
bill as well as amendments that will need to be made at a later 
stage, when the bill comes up for further consideration at 
committee.
<P>
	Bill C-44 implements the national marine policy the federal 
government had announced back in December 1995. Naturally, it 
will apply to the whole marine industry in Canada and Quebec. The 
four main areas affected are ports operated by Transport Canada, 
law enforcement in Canadian ports, pilotage and, finally, the Great 
Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system.
<P>
	Let us now look at each of these areas individually. As far as the 
ports are concerned, this bill provides for the establishment of the 
Canada Port Authority to replace the Canada Ports Corporation.
<P>
	There are questions and concerns about law enforcement in 
Canadian ports, as we remain in the dark about the government's 
true intentions as to what is to happen to the police force which is 
currently comprised of about 100 constables and 30 civilians. 
Maintaining this force cost approximately $9.6 million in 1995. 
Further explanations are required concerning the future of law 
enforcement in these ports.
<P>
	As for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, the 
government intends, of course, to pursue the commercialization of 
operations, and the bill provides the authority to do so.
<P>
	The fourth element concerns the issue of pilotage. From now on, 
operations will be much more efficient, since public funding will 
no longer be available. The bill provides that Transport Canada will 
have to report to Parliament before December 31, 1998, regarding 
the review of the following issues: compulsory pilotage area 
designations, cost reduction measures, pilot certification process 
for masters and officers, and licensing requirements for pilots.
<P>
	This is, in short, what is to be found in the bill. As for us, Bloc 
Quebecois members, we feel that the title of the bill somewhat 
exceeds its content. The bill is called the Canada Marine Act, but it 
is silent on shipbuilding, shipyards, and the merchant navy. It is not 
as complete as it could be.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	It would have been interesting to find out about the 
government's intentions regarding these issues and to see them 
included in the Canada Marine Act, so as to have a global picture. 
This is only wishful thinking, but who knows, perhaps the 
government will provide more details in the subsequent stages of 
the review of the bill.
<P>
	We also have to conclude that the government failed, when we 
look at the shipping policy of the past 20 years. Over the years, 
some $7 billion, in current dollars, were invested in the St. 
Lawrence Seaway, while annual revenues generated by the seaway 
are of the order of $70 million. Since that was not a huge success, 
they are now dismantling the whole thing, privatizing it, etc.
<P>
	This is due mainly to the financial situation of the government 
who now realizes that, these last few years, it did not play such an 
efficient role as a promoter in this field, as in, might I add, many 
other transportation areas. Just consider the trend in the 
Department of Transportation these last few years. It was the same 
thing with the deregulation of air transportation, the dismantling of 
the rail industry and now, it is the shipping industry.
<P>
	It is somewhat amazing that a country-made out of two 
countries-such as Canada, which covers a huge territory has not 
been able to better define all of its transportation policies. It is also 
disappointing to see that a such a vast country, where there is road, 
rail, sea and air transportation, could not become a leader or a role 
model in efficiency.
<P>
	I want to point out that the Bloc Quebecois has always supported 
a disposition policy and the commercialization of harbours and 
ports. We did mention it in the minority report of the Bloc 
Quebecois concerning the maritime strategy tabled in May 1995.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4809"> 4809 </A></B>
<P>
	The commercialization of harbours and ports raised some 
concerns in every region, but maybe more so in areas like mine, 
where there are recreation harbours. The same question always 
comes back: ``In what shape will they be handed over to the local 
authorities? In what shape are they now? In what condition will 
they be handed over?'' We are told of a $125 million fund, which 
should be used to refurbish the ports and, in some cases, the cost 
could be negotiated differently depending on the port's condition.
<P>
	This is not a very clear policy. We know that when criteria are 
rather fuzzy funds are often allocated to the ones who press harder. 
Often decisions are political and not necessarily based on 
considerations of efficiency when there are no clear, definite and 
well understood criteria.
<P>
	Thus, there are concerns because many sites have not been 
properly maintained throughout the years. All regional and local 
disparities must also be taken into account. We must show respect 
and make sure that we have a system of ports that is adequate as a 
whole. When the amounts will be affected or negotiated for the 
management transfer to local organizations or companies, we must 
ensure that the system remains adequate as a whole.
<P>
	I find it rather disturbing that at the beginning this process will 
be somewhat haphazard as was the case for the commercialization 
of airports. There will be a problem because obviously things will 
not proceed as fast in one place at it will in another. This is not the 
model to apply to sea transportation. We have reasons to worry, 
since the same department is involved.
<P>
	There is a factor which is surprising from the logical point of 
view but not from the political one. In the last few years, as 
everybody knows, the federal government has come to realize that 
it can no longer afford to provide the same level of service, but it 
nevertheless tries to keep the same level of control.
<P>
	This is why paragraphs <I>a</I>) and <I>e</I>) of clause 12(1) provide that the 
federal government has one representative on each of the boards. 
Pursuant to this clause, the federal government can also appoint 
other individuals in consultation with the users.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	But the government, in consulting, does not have to follow up on 
the recommendations of the stakeholders. Obviously, an exception 
is made for directors representing the municipalities or the 
provinces, but we can see that the federal government will have one 
direct representative and will appoint other representatives. As is 
usually the case, these people will certainly have views that are 
compatible with the government's. Thus, the government is 
keeping a high level of control.
<P>
	It is always somewhat surprising and somewhat irritating to see a 
government investing less and less money but keeping the same 
level of control.
<P>
	If the government wants to decentralize and to have local 
management because it is more efficient, etc., why does it impose, 
on a board of directors, people that are appointed through a 
political process? Often these people are local friends of the 
government who are there to ensure that the government's views 
will prevail on these boards of directors.
<P>
	We have seen this in several other cases, and it is very disturbing 
and disappointing for the people in the regions who realize that this 
decentralization is sort of artificial. The government is 
decentralizing the financial problems but is keeping control over 
the decision-making process.
<P>
	There is a last point I want to mention. The members of the Bloc 
Quebecois have suggestions and recommendations to make with 
regard to the Pilotage Act. I cannot elaborate on that at this moment 
since my time is running out, but I am sure the members who 
represent us on the transport committee will do it adequately.
<P>
	In general, this bill contains some interesting elements, but it 
needs a lot of improvements. We need to have complete and 
effective decentralization, which means, among other things, that 
situations as the one described in section 12 must be avoided.
<P>
	Corrections will have to be made to this bill and, once this is 
done, we will be able to judge if it is a good or a bad piece of 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a few comments regarding Bill C-44 as it 
pertains to Port Alberni, which is in my riding. It is one of the six 
recognized ports on the west coast.
<P>
	I met with the harbour commission about a month ago. It had 
some major concerns regarding the legislation. The difficulty, it 
would appear, is that this legislation will treat Vancouver, which is 
a huge port, similar to a smaller port such as Port Alberni.
<P>
	Alberni has an operating budget of $3 million to $4 million. It 
has operated with a very small profit for the last eight years. In 
other words, it is not a burden. It is on a user pay system. It is 
working. The Port Alberni Harbour Commission is working well. It 
serves the community. It does not cost the taxpayers any money. 
However, this legislation will change all that.
<P>
	I have to return to the analogy of treating a huge port like 
Vancouver similarly to a smaller port such as Alberni. It is the the 
pantyhose solution, one size fits all. In this case it will not work.
<P>
	It would appear that the problem goes back to when the 
legislation was drawn up. It was drawn up by  bureaucrats before 
there was consultation. Yes, a committee will do a cross Canada 
tour, but the bureaucrats have now got themselves into a position 
where they are backed up against a wall, defending legislation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4810"> 4810 </A></B>
<P>
which will not fly. Why do we have to have this kind of situation 
where the bureaucrats draw up the legislation before there is 
nationwide consultation to get the information which is required to 
write good legislation?
<P>
	I hope when the committee travels across Canada that the 
representations from the different ports and boards will be listened 
to.
<P>
	That brings up another point. It is really odd in the Canadian 
system that a committee is not tied to a minister. A committee can 
come up with some wonderful recommendations, good legislation, 
which the minister can then totally ignore if he or she chooses to do 
so. That is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I hope that the committee listens well, makes good 
recommendations and furthermore that the minister and the 
bureaucracy also listen and come up with legislation that fits all the 
ports across this country and does the job that we require.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-44, the short 
title of which is Canada Marine Act. This bill is crucially important 
for the future of shipping and the survival of ports and harbours in 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	First, allow me to point out that in all matters concerning 
transportation in general, the way the government works is to harm 
regions, legislate in a piecemeal manner, without measuring the 
impact its legislations will have once in force.
<P>
	During last spring's debate on Bill C-20, many members 
wondered about the impact of the privatization of air navigation 
services on remote regions. We were not against the principle of 
privatizing these services, but we thought that it should not be done 
in the sole perspective of deficit reduction and by dumping the 
problems and costs in the local stakeholders' backyard.
<P>
	In the same vein, Coast Guard fees for services, such as ice 
breaking and dredging, are likely to hinder the competitiveness of 
Quebec's ports. Again, the federal government's main thrust is the 
fight against the deficit and this, at all cost, at the expense of the 
true interests of Canadians and Quebecers. That jobs could be 
jeopardized does not seem to carry much weight in this 
government's political choices.
<P>
	The same can be said today about Bill C-44. First, in spite of its 
title, the bill does not propose any kind of shipbuilding or merchant 
marine development strategy. Instead of development, it seems 
that, once again, under the pretence of streamlining operations and 
improving services, the government has only one thing in mind: to 
dump its deficit onto the provinces, municipalities and local 
stakeholders.
<P>
	The bill's main objective is to commercialize port services by 
getting rid of the present Canada Ports Corporation and replacing it 
by Canadian port authorities.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to a policy to divest itself of 
ports and harbours by commercializing them. In fact, local 
stakeholders would probably be able to manage those facilities 
much more efficiently than the federal government did until now. 
Indeed if we look at the last 20 years of federal management of 
ports and harbours, we can only come to the conclusion that there 
have been an excessive bureaucratization which resulted in 
unreasonable costs and inefficient management of facilities.
<P>
	The St. Lawrence Seaway, for example, received $7 billion in 
investments over the years but generates only $70 million in 
revenues annually for a traffic of only half that of 1970. There are 
324 commercial ports and harbours in Canada.
<P>
	Right now, 90 percent of the commercial maritime traffic 
transits through 45 of these ports. Obviously the federal 
government must withdraw from the management of that sector, 
but not any which way.
<P>
	In the bill before us today, we see that the Canada Ports 
Corporation will be replaced by Canadian ports authorities or 
CPAs. These CPAs will manage the port facilities, but the federal 
government will keep ownership of the lands and facilities. That is 
to say that the government will withdraw from the fiscal aspect 
while keeping its control since it will have a representative on all 
CPA boards.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	We can understand that this government is trying once more to 
avoid its financial responsibilities while keeping all its powers. 
When this government talks about decentralisation, we must 
understand that in reality it wants to decentralise its debt. When it 
talks about involving local stakeholders, we must understand that 
their main role will be to pay the bills while being forced to abide 
by federal standards.
<P>
	Criteria are also being established for ports do be designated 
CPAs. Applications made by ports will thus be evaluated under the 
following criteria provided in clause 6: first, the port is, and is 
likely to remain, financially self-sufficient; second, the port is of 
strategic significance to Canada's trade; third, it is linked to major 
rail lines or a major highway infrastructure; and fourth, it has 
diversified traffic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4811"> 4811 </A></B>
<P>
	Only ports respecting those criteria will be designated as CPAs. 
As I said earlier, the federal government is withdrawing from the 
financial area but it wants to hang on to control of CPA 
administration.
<P>
	Of greatest concern is the fate of ports which cannot become 
CPAs. The government is taking its time: it allows itself six years 
to dispose of those ports. This delay will therefore create some 
insecurity in Canada as well as in Quebec. Actually, the federal 
government has neglected the maintenance of the ports and most of 
them are in poor condition. They will need substantial repairs. 
Therefore, several ports probably will be left out of the running and 
will not have the status of port authorities, unless municipalities 
and provinces invest significant funds for their rehabilitation.
<P>
	Again, under the cover of decentralization, the federal 
government is passing the bill on to other levels of government. It 
would be more honest on the part of the federal government to 
rehabilitate those port facilities before their transfer given the fact 
that their deterioration is the result of lack of maintenance by the 
government.
<P>
	Although the Bloc Quebecois is not against the principle of 
privatizing port facilities, we will vote against this bill just because 
the government is not proceeding in the right way. This bill needs 
major amendments in order to meet the different needs of port 
localities and regions.
<P>
	To this government, decentralization of powers seems to mean 
only decentralization of the debt, a debt which results from a poor 
management on its part. The impact of this bill in its present form, 
combined with the new fee structure for Coast Guard services, will 
come down hard on a number of municipalities, in both Canada and 
Quebec, which rely on commercial shipping. The government does 
not seem to be taking this into consideration.
<P>
	We will therefore try to see that the Liberal government assesses 
the real consequences of its policies-policies which may be costly 
to the people of Canada and of Quebec.

	The House resumed from Wednesday, September 25, 1996, 
consideration of the motion that Bill C-29, an Act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial pur-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4812"> 4812 </A></B>
<P>
poses of certain manganese-based substances, be read the third 
time and passed and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think today is my lucky day. I am very pleased to speak 
on third reading of Bill C-29, formerly Bill C-94, an Act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances. The immediate 
purpose of Bill C-29 is to ban the addition of MMT to unleaded 
gasoline in Canada by prohibiting the importation of that 
substance.
<P>
	Over the last few years, environmental concerns have become 
more present in our daily lives and are important for the citizens we 
represent, particularly those living in big cities, who call for for an 
ever healthier environment. They want standards to be established 
not only to further reduce pollution, but also to improve the overall 
quality of the environment.
<P>
	Therefore, it is legitimate for the government to act in order to 
protect people's health and to legislate on the issue of dangerous 
substances contributing to the deterioration of the global 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	However, the bill before us today does not stem from a desire to 
protect the environment or public health. Instead, it seems 
motivated more by a desire to meet the expectations of the 
automotive industry and those of Ontario corn growers who hope to 
see a whole new market develop for them, that of ethanol, an 
additive made from corn, which could eventually replace MMT.
<P>
	This bill came about in 1994, it must be remembered, thanks to a 
powerful lobby of automobile manufacturers. According to them, 
MMT, a substance that has been added to unleaded gasoline since 
1977, causes damage to the pollution control equipment in 
automobiles and is detrimental to public health.
<P>
	It goes without saying that car manufacturers are quite opposed 
to the addition of additives to gasoline, be it MMT or any other 
substance.
<P>
	Faced with a threat by car manufacturers to raise the price of cars 
in Canada and limit their warranty if the practice of adding MMT 
to gasoline continued, the environment minister of the day, the 
current Deputy Prime Minister, caved in and introduced Bill C-94, 
which eventually became Bill C-29.
<P>
	For us, at second reading, this bill is still raising the same 
questions. We voted in favour of this legislation so that the two 
major stakeholders in this debate on banning MMT could present 
their respective point of view. These stakeholders are the car 
manufacturers and the oil industry, especially the Ethyl 
Corporation, the only company to produce and export MMT to 
Canada.
<P>
	We hoped that the Standing Committee on the Environment 
would conduct an in-depth review based on studies by both parties 
concerned.
<P>
	Already then, it was obvious that the former environment 
minister was not taking into account studies showing that MMT 
was not a threat to public health. Indeed, in a study dated December 
6, 1994, Health Canada concluded that MMT was not a health 
hazard. Obviously, any substance added to gasoline is, to a certain 
extent, a pollutant as is gasoline. But for Health Canada, MMT in 
itself is clearly not a health hazard.
<P>
	In the United States, the automobile industry has had to 
reconsider its position on MMT as a result of a decision by an 
American court to the effect that the ban on MMT had to be lifted 
for lack of conclusive evidence of any harmful effect on 
antipollution devices.
<P>
	Indeed, in its decision, the United States court of appeal for the 
District of Columbia pointed out the lack of evidence in the 
arguments made by supporters of a ban on MMT, and I quote: 
``Concerning the arguments presented by the American 
Automobile Manufacturer's Association to challenge the finding of 
the Environmental Protection Agency that MMT does not affect 
either partially or totally the functioning of the emission system of 
vehicles, the American court has deemed these arguments 
unfounded. First of all, the court pointed out that the agency had 
established the Ethyl additive had easily passed the tests required 
for all the most severe investigations ever conducted''.
<P>
	It must be kept in mind that, in April 1995, this same court made 
a decision rejecting the claims of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to the effect MMT was harmful to health, even 
though the Agency recognized MMT was not playing any role in 
the deterioration of pollution control equipment.
<P>
	Therefore, it is more than likely MMT will be reintroduced in 
the United States, and very rapidly so.
<P>
	The oil companies favour the use of additives in gasoline. 
According to some data, MMT added to gasoline would help 
reduce nitric oxide emissions, which are harmful to the 
environment and one of the causes of urban smog.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	From the hearings of the Standing Committee on Environment, 
it has not been shown, on the basis of scientific studies, that MMT 
is a toxic substance and a risk to public health. It has not been 
demonstrated either that MMT is harmful to pollution control 
equipment in automobiles. Furthermore, the objective of 
harmonizing our gasoline policies with those of the United States 
does not hold any more since the ban on MMT was been lifted by 
our neighbours to the South, which makes possible the addition of 
MMT in gasoline in the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4813"> 4813 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, what this bill is proposing us, is to comply with the 
requests of the automobile industry. As I said earlier, at the present 
time, nothing argues for the banning of MMT. If MMT has such 
a detrimental effect on public health in general, it should have 
been banned by Health Canada or under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. What this bill proposes is not to 
ban MMT as a product but to ban the importation and 
interprovincial trade of this substance.
<P>
	What are the consequences of this trade ban? First of all, it must 
be pointed out that Ethyl, an American corporation, is the only 
company that manufactures this product and exports it to Canada. 
The plant importing it, which is located in Ontario, mixes MMT 
with other fuel additives. These products are then shipped to 
refineries. Under this bill, which bans interprovincial trade in and 
the importation of MMT without banning its use or production, if 
the Ethyl corporation ever built an MMT manufacturing plant and 
set up the distribution of this substance in every province and 
territory, unleaded gasoline produced across Canada could still 
contain MMT. I am not an expert in this area, but I think we would 
be deluding ourselves if we believed that the real purpose of this 
bill is to protect public health and the environment.
<P>
	Nothing in this bill would prevent the scenario I just described 
from becoming reality, because MMT has not been banned. This is 
a rather extraordinary way to deal with a substance which, in the 
opinion of the Minister of the Environment and the Deputy Prime 
Minister, is deleterious to the health of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	At a time when businesses are looking to rationalize their 
operations, it would be rather surprising for Ethyl to decide to open 
plants in every province and territory of Canada. This means that, 
under Bill C-29, it will be forced to shut down its operations in 
Canada.
<P>
	Some 40 jobs would be lost if the plant in Ontario closed. Also, 
MMT no longer being available, oil companies would have to 
change their refining and production methods.
<P>
	The oil industry estimates that it would cost close to $100 
million to produce gasoline that is equally performant without 
MMT, as a result of this bill. This extra cost will inevitably make 
the price of gas at the pump go up. As usual, consumers will pay for 
this initiative, not to mention the potential job losses resulting from 
this price increase.
<P>
	We have come across another possible effect a few weeks ago. 
On September 10, feeling aggrieved by this ban on MMT exports to 
Canada, Ethyl gave notice of its intention to file a complaint under 
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	The company argues that Bill C-29 is in conflict with certain 
provisions of NAFTA, as the subject-matter of the ban is not the 
product itself but its import. As was  pointed out, the production, 
sale and use of MMT are not prohibited. As a result of such 
contraventions of NAFTA, Ethyl will sustain damages, actually 
more than $200 million American, or nearly $275 million 
Canadian, in loss of revenue.
<P>
	Questioned on this in the House last Wednesday, the Minister of 
the Environment insisted this bill was essential to protect both the 
environment and the health of Canadians. In light of the 
consequences this bill will have, we can only doubt his sincerity 
and, consequently, vote against the bill.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Again, not only did the federal government encroach on 
provincial jurisdictions by legislating in interprovincial trade, but it 
also ignored the opposition to Bill C-29 expressed by the 
provinces.
<P>
	Last May 1, Quebec's legislature unanimously passed a 
resolution requesting the postponement of federal Bill C-29 
concerning gasoline additive, MMT, as long as environmental 
studies had not been conducted in a properly scientific manner.
<P>
	As always, the Liberal government turns a deaf ear to the 
requests from Quebec and the other provinces that the minister 
withdraw the bill in order to examine its real impact and what is 
really at stake.
<P>
	When this government decided to interfere in interprovincial 
trade and ignore the pleas of the provinces, it demonstrated once 
again how it really sees co-operation between the federal 
government and the provinces. Its idea of co-operative federalism 
is to wax eloquent on federal-provincial agreements, and then keep 
moving in on provincial jurisdiction constantly breaking its 
promises.
<P>
	For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is once again asking the 
minister to postpone passage of this bill. The environment and the 
health of our fellow Canadians are too important to simply be used 
to further the expectations of the strong lobby of Ontario's motor 
vehicle manufacturers and corn producers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
disappointed in the Bloc member's argument. To use provincial 
versus federal technical arguments about jurisdiction with respect 
to an issue which involves the health of all Canadians strikes me as 
a very dangerous approach.
<P>
	We are getting close to the end of the debate on this legislation 
which will effectively ban manganese in gasoline in Canada. I 
would remind the member opposite that manganese is a heavy 
metal. It gets into the environment. Once it is in the environment, 
in the ecosystem, it stays there.
<P>
	The hon. member says that there are doubts. Very often in 
scientific studies it is difficult to prove something absolutely 
conclusively. If there are doubts about something that might be 
poisoning our children in the same way as years ago there were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4814"> 4814 </A></B>
<P>
doubts about lead, which was in gasoline, and how it affected us 
and our children, then we should err on the side of safety. 
Eventually it was proven that lead affects us and our children and 
legislation was passed, but that was after generations of young 
people had grown up and their brains had been affected by the lead. 
Use the precautionary principle and vote for this legislation.
<P>
	I have spoken twice at some length in parts of this debate and I 
do not want to repeat all of those arguments. However, I rise now to 
point out to the member that in my riding of Peterborough we have 
many workers who work at the General Motors plants in Oshawa. 
They have come to me and explained very carefully the proven 
impact of manganese on the on-board emission control systems 
which are going into the modern vehicles they are producing and 
which they have to sell abroad competitively.
<P>
	These automobiles are being produced with $2,000 or $3,000 
worth of emission controls and we are filling them up with gasoline 
which has manganese in it. First of all, we damage these expensive 
items in our cars and then, because these systems control all the 
pollutants and not just manganese going into the environment, we 
damage the control systems. As a result we allow pollutants of all 
sorts which are in gasoline to get into the environment. This is not 
the case in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	To the auto workers in my riding I would say this: The Canadian 
Automobile Association in my riding and nationally, which 
represents all the motorists in Canada, wants Bill C-29 to go 
through. The auto parts manufacturers, the people who make the 
computer-like emission control devices, want it to go through. That 
is in addition to all the people who are interested in the health of 
Canadians and to all of the people who are interested in the 
environment.
<P>
	I would be most grateful if the member would search her heart 
and not use these technical, legal matters because of her position 
with respect to the separation of Quebec in an area which affects 
the health and environment of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to what my 
colleague had to say with great interest. However, I totally disagree 
with him when he compares lead to manganese.
<P>
	I began to study nursing forty years ago, in a pediatric hospital. 
Forty years, that is quite a long time ago. There were no 
anti-pollution systems at that time. Forty years ago,children were 
being admitted to hospitals with lead induced encephalitis. 
Therefore, lead toxicity was already a recognized phenomenon.
<P>
	As far as manganese is concerned, at present there is no evidence 
to show that it poses any threat to public health. Granted, all of the 
heavy metals are dangerous. Copper is dangerous, but we have 
some in our system. If we had to remove everything that is 
dangerous, there would be nobody left on the planet.
<P>
	The arguments made by my colleague to the effect that plant 
workers are convinced that the anti-pollution systems are greatly 
affected by manganese in fuel, are something that I can understand, 
coming from these workers, but we must also look at rulings, 
especially by U.S. courts, to the effect that this has nothing to do 
with deterioration of anti-pollution systems.
<P>
	Everybody looks to his own interests. In itself, that is not 
surprising. But I do not think that we should use the excuse of 
public health to support the interests of powerful lobbyists. I 
believe that the role of a government whether federal or provincial, 
is to look after the well-being of its citizens, all of them, and not to 
privilege one group in particular.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, plus ça change, plus c'est 
la même chose. Just as in the case of Bill S-9, the alternative fuels 
act, we have 295 members of Parliament, most of whom are 
technological illiterates, attempting to referee between two 
powerful corporate lobbies. The cabinet is divided, but the 
government, for whatever reason, is going to persist in ploughing 
ahead with this legislation.
<P>
	The red herring of health effects keeps being mentioned. It was 
brought up during questions and comments after the last speaker.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the health protection branch of Health 
and Welfare Canada, which in 1992 issued a paper on the health 
impact of MMT. It concluded that based on current evidence, 
experts at Health and Welfare Canada are confident that the risk to 
human health from MMT derived manganese is extremely small. 
There is clearly a wide margin of safety between the current intake 
of manganese from MMT and the lowest concentrations of 
airborne manganese known to cause any health effects.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Let us be clear. We are not here debating a health issue, we are 
here debating a dispute between two industrial sectors, the 
automotive manufacturers on one hand and the petroleum 
producers on the other. It has absolutely nothing to do with health.
<P>
	I understand that the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association 
came to the government requesting that legislation be introduced to 
ban MMT. It claims it causes problems to its onboard diagnostic 
systems, which I will hereafter refer to as OBDs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4815"> 4815 </A></B>
<P>
	The government claims it has attempted to negotiate some sort 
of a settlement between the automobile and petroleum industries. 
However, the former environment minister, who happened to 
represent an industrial area in southern Ontario, promised a ban 
on MMT before any fruitful talks could even take place. Clearly 
this has prejudiced any negotiations from the outset.
<P>
	To encourage the government to move forward with legislation 
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association informed the 
government that if MMT is not removed from gasoline its 
members will void warranties for new model cars, thereby 
inconveniencing thousands of Canadians who become car owners. 
And to ensure its point is appreciated and to exert a little bit of 
blackmail pressure, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association 
has threatened to charge Canadian consumers an additional $3,000 
per car to offset the costs associated with OBD warranty claims.
<P>
	The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association claims that it can 
validate its allegation that MMT causes malfunctions of its OBD 
systems. However, it will not make its research publicly available 
for review. It is worth noting that a U.S. court of appeals has stated 
that the automakers evidence, whatever it is, has not come close to 
refuting the Environmental Protection Agency's claim that MMT 
does not contribute to or cause the failure of OBD systems.
<P>
	The claim that MMT negatively affects the functioning of OBDs 
in Canada has to be questioned given that the automakers have long 
been experiencing similar problems in the United States where 
until last year MMT was banned. So in the absence of MMT the car 
companies in the United States have fingered a very wide and 
diverse range of culprits for their problems. And these include 
sulphur in the fuel, which I suspect is probably the major one, cold 
weather, high altitude and road conditions.
<P>
	Are we going to have the government taking action on these 
fronts as well? We could get our national highway system fixed up 
a bit, and a lot of Canadians would really appreciate a federal ban 
on cold winter weather.
<P>
	The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association has also 
succeeded in creating the impression with some of our hon. 
colleagues that the failure of OBD systems contributes to increased 
air pollution. That is false. OBDs are monitoring systems. They 
have nothing to do with the actual emissions of the automobile. So 
it has been necessary for the car makers, in order to cover their own 
failings in the design of their OBDs, to link this problem to the 
environment because otherwise they would not have got through 
the doors of the various Liberal ministers responsible. We had 
Liberal ministers of the environment introducing some very ill 
conceived legislation.
<P>
	In theory one would expect that a minister of the environment 
would have very little in common with  automobile manufacturers. 
After all, what is the leading cause of smog? It is the automobile. If 
we take MMT out of automobile fuels, we will have more smog. 
That, at least, is beyond scientific dispute.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	On the other side of this issue there is the petroleum industry, 
which uses MMT to boost octane to make a cleaner burning 
gasoline, and there are the producers of MMT. They dispute the 
claims of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and point 
to scientific research done in the United States as part of one of the 
most extensive testing programs to date conducted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA test results 
demonstrated conclusively that MMT in gasoline does not cause or 
contribute to the failure of any emission control device or system.
<P>
	The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, which represents the 
majority of petroleum refining and marketing entities in Canada, 
has stated that it is strongly opposed to the proposed ban and has 
made efforts to have the Minister of the Environment see its 
perspective on this issue.
<P>
	Here it is, two of the most powerful corporate lobbies in Canada 
both fighting for the attention of the minister on this issue, both 
presenting scientific data. We do not know really how much of the 
scientific data are valid because we have not properly addressed the 
issue.
<P>
	The committee is where this should be dealt with. There should 
be a lot of witnesses coming in. We should not be jumping into this 
with both feet and playing favourites between these two groups of 
corporate giants.
<P>
	The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute wants the Minister of 
the Environment to allow industry, both parties, to examine the 
effects of MMT through a facts based joint assessment conducted 
by impartial scientific observers. The minister has ignored calls for 
an independent testing program and is still forging ahead with this 
legislation.
<P>
	I fail to understand how the Minister of the Environment and his 
colleagues can justify taking our time to review a situation when 
what obviously needs to happen is that the Canadian Petroleum 
Products Institute and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
Association should solve their own problems between them. We do 
not need government intervention on this.
<P>
	Why does the government, specifically the Minister of the 
Environment, feel so compelled to get involved in an industry 
dispute? If the government decided that it did have to intervene, 
one would at least have expected that it would do so based on 
scientific facts and not pander to either one political lobby or the 
other.
<P>
	If we are going to restrict interprovincial trade, which is very 
deeply embedded in this legislation, one would have thought that 
the provinces would have been consulted. Seven provinces, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland, are all resoundingly opposed to this 
bill. Rather than creating green grass, the environment minister
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4816"> 4816 </A></B>
<P>
seems to be expanding his turf war with the provinces by pushing 
ahead with Bill C-29.
<P>
	I would like to quote briefly from examples of some of the 
provincial opposition. A letter dated May 14 from Premier Klein of 
Alberta said: ``I am deeply troubled about the unilateral manner in 
which this issue was decided and implemented. There is a need for 
strong federal-provincial agreement and co-operation on national 
environmental issues such as air quality''.
<P>
	On May 1, 1996 the Quebec National Assembly unanimously 
approved the following resolution: ``That the national assembly 
request the postponement of federal Bill C-29 concerning the 
gasoline additive MMT as long as environmental studies have not 
been conducted in a conclusive manner''. I might add, not 
conducted in a properly scientific manner.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	About 10 days ago Manitoba and Newfoundland joined with the 
other provinces in requesting that this very ill thought out 
legislation be slowed down. It is the provinces that will bear the 
direct deleterious result of the removal of MMT from gasoline 
which is the significant increase in emissions of nitrogen oxide. It 
seems reasonable to think that they should therefore have a voice in 
this decision.
<P>
	In fact, the ban of MMT will mean that the provinces will be 
required to forfeit the most cost effective method of reducing smog 
causing agents in gasoline, and they will be required to 
accommodate anywhere from a 16 per cent to a 20 per cent increase 
in nitrous oxide emissions.
<P>
	Calls to the government to identify what will replace MMT are 
still unanswered. No scientific testing is planned and it is difficult 
to predict what is going to happen next. Surely the government has 
something in mind to replace MMT.
<P>
	Clearly all Canadians hope the members opposite will not 
support this bill without putting forward a credible plan to deal 
with increased urban smog.
<P>
	We have made good progress toward reducing our nitrous oxide 
content of emissions in this country, but with this legislation we run 
the risk of wiping out those gains and saddling ourselves with 
increased problems. We are clearly moving in the wrong direction.
<P>
	Therefore rather than construct environmental policy on 
speculation and half baked voodoo science, what is needed is some 
leadership from the government. If we are to address the problem 
of worsening air quality in Canada the auto companies and the oil 
companies must work together. It is equally clear that there is a 
need to  have the federal and provincial governments co-operate on 
environmental issues of this nature.
<P>
	The way to accomplish this is obvious. Withdraw this bill, do 
some decent scientific work and come back to this House when you 
know what you are doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is something I would like to make clear right at the 
outset, because viewers might have the impression that those who 
care about environment are sitting on that side and those who do 
not care are sitting on this side. This is an oversimplification.
<P>
	I want to say right away to people joining us for the debate that it 
has to do with the fact that the government is proposing a bill 
seeking a ban on a gas additive, which would have as a major 
impact substantial adjustment costs for whole segments of 
industrial sectors, such as oil refineries, without any scientific 
studies to back it up.
<P>
	The official opposition, first through its critic, the hon. member 
for Laurentides, and through successive members, wants to make it 
clear that, when the environment minister or any other independent 
third party will be able to table in this House rigorously scientific 
and conclusive studies showing that this additive called MMT 
harms the environment or damages antipollution systems in 
vehicles, the Bloc, as well as the Reform Party surely, will 
reconsider its position.
<P>
	It is unthinkable that an environment minister, with a 
carelessness that is out of keeping with the seriousness of this 
issue, would ask Canadian members of Parliament to pass 
legislation that will impose substantial adjustment costs on 
industrial sectors that are already in difficulty, on the basis of 
representations made by a auto makers lobby. That is not how 
things should be done.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to take part in this debate because, as 
you know, I am one of the members from Montreal, more 
specifically from East Montreal. When I was younger, East 
Montreal had six refineries. Today there are only two left, because 
of a number of problems which are international in nature but 
sometimes have a more national resonance.
<P>
	I cannot accept, and I fail to understand how the government can 
do a good job when it asks us to pass a bill that, I repeat, involves 
considerable adjustment costs for the oil refinery sector, without 
thorough, scientific and conclusive studies to support its decision.
<P>
	It does not make sense to have jobs, jobs, jobs as a political 
mantra when you create problems for those who want to save jobs. 
In the case of East Montreal, I would like to point out that the two 
remaining refineries that continue to operate-when I was a kid 
there were six-employ 4,000 people. I would like to include in my 
speech a point of view that is typically Montreal and a  flavour that 
is East Montreal by sharing with you two letters I received from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4817"> 4817 </A></B>
<P>
interest groups that represent their community and have a stake in 
the local economy.
<P>
	I am not referring to the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society which is our 
ally on sovereignty. I am not talking about the Mouvement national 
des Québécois, but about interest groups, the first of which is called 
Pro-Est. These are businessmen, people who are concerned above 
all about the economic recovery of East Montreal.
<P>
	You will recall that in 1984, there was a wave of business 
shutdowns which led the people of East Montreal to organize. The 
result was a group called Pro-Est, an authorized pressure group that 
tries in various ways to give East Montreal a prosperous economy 
so that people will want to stay there.
<P>
	Pro-Est is concerned about the subject matter of Bill C-29. I 
would like to share this short letter with you, and I would like to 
recommend its contents to the attention of the government side, so 
they will understand that the reaction to Bill C-29 goes back to 
what is at stake in the economy of a number of communities, 
including East Montreal.
<P>
	The letter says: ``Pro-Est wants to express its concerns about the 
possible adoption of Bill C-29 regarding MMT as an additive in 
gas''. It goes on to say: ``In fact, the passage of this bill would have 
a negative impact on the competitive position of the industry''.
<P>
	The words competitive position really mean something from the 
economic point of view, and I hope the government side will 
appreciate that. So the letter reads: ``The passage of this bill would 
have a negative impact on the competitive position of the refineries 
of East Montreal. The withdrawal of MMT would oblige refineries 
to compensate in other ways, which would represent an additional 
cost of seven or eight million dollars annually for the refineries in 
East Montreal alone''.
<P>
	So seven or eight million dollars annually for the refineries in 
East Montreal alone, and earlier we heard a figure of about $40 
million for the entire petrochemical sector in Quebec.
<P>
	The letter goes on: ``We remind you that the petrochemical 
industry is one of the cornerstones of economic development on the 
east side of the island of Montreal. The takeover of Kemtec by 
Coastal, the high placement rate of graduates of the Institut de 
chimie et de pétrochimie and the viability of the Petro-Canada and 
Shell refineries are a good indication of the consolidation of this 
sector in our region. Because of these important economic 
spin-offs and the considerable number of secondary jobs, the 
petrochemical industry is a key sector in the economic recovery of 
the greater Montreal area''.
<P>
	As you probably know, the environment is an important issue for 
Pro-Est, and I may point out that Pro-Est is a group that has 
identified the environmental sector, the whole issue of plastics 
recycling, as a sector to be developed in this region. So we cannot 
accuse them of not being sensitive to this problem.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I will continue reading the letter: ``Hence, we agree with several 
other Quebecers who are suggesting to defer the passing of Bill 
C-29 until independent experts can clearly show that MMT is 
environmentally safe. We thank you for your interest-'', and so 
on. That letter is signed by Pierre Bibeau, chairman of the Pro-Est 
group.
<P>
	I also heard the same thing from the chairman of the chamber of 
commerce of eastern Montreal Island, Alain Riendeau. When the 
businesspeople and all the stakeholders who are concerned about 
economic growth and who want to ensure the communities remain 
competitive join together to make representations, something they 
can do within our system, I hope the majority in office is listening.
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague, the hon. member for Peterborough, said 
that a few years back no one would have imagined that lead could 
become such a problem and a health hazard. Again, when studies 
carried out by independent third parties show that there is cause for 
concern, that will be the time to take concrete measures. But this 
cannot be done on the basis of non-scientific allegations and on the 
basis, finally, of representations by a local lobby, which naturally 
has the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of 
the Environment who are both Ontario members.
<P>
	It takes some nerve to come here and tell us that our concern 
today is for public health. In that case, let us remind ministers that 
they gave this issue to the wrong minister. If it were a public health 
issue, if the health of Canadians was really in jeopardy, I would 
hope that the health minister, the hon. member for Cape 
Breton-Richmond-East, would stand in this House and explain to 
us, parliamentarians and, thus, to all Canadians, how this concerns 
his department and what remedies he intends to take.
<P>
	Let us go a little further. If this is a toxic substance, why is it that 
the federal government has not taken any measure so far to ban it 
and why are imports at issue here? If this substance is a toxic 
substance, then it is so everywhere. Be it within a province or in 
interprovincial trade, the toxic content remains the same.
<P>
	You know, as the last speaker for the Reform Party also said, I 
think, what we are talking about here are representations by 
lobbyists, by people who are settled in Ontario and are concerned 
with the automotive industry.
<P>
	If auto makers have decisive studies on the operation of 
anti-pollution systems, and the resulting impact on their 
competitiveness, that should concern us as parliamentarians, let 
them make these studies public. In a democracy, the best way to 
oppose an idea 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4818"> 4818 </A></B>
<P>
is to suggest a better one. That is how things can be done 
democratically.
<P>
	How accurate was the auto makers' demonstration? What did 
they contribute to the debate? Not much. They are unable to make a 
clear and significant demonstration of the dangers that should bring 
us, as members of Parliament, to ban MMT.
<P>
	I really want to be very clear about the possible consequences of 
such a ban in a community like Montreal, where the petrochemical 
sector has already been under considerable strain for the last ten 
years. Investments of $7 million to $14 million will be needed to 
adjust to new production equipment. This is the first reality to keep 
in mind.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	If the Minister is the sensible man I believe he is and anxious to 
start a dialogue, there is a second reality that should at least be of 
some concern to him. Right now, there are seven provinces in 
different regions, with governments of different political stripes, 
and with different economic bases-that is quite a number of 
provinces-that have taken a united stand and ask the federal 
government to review its position and delay the adoption of this 
bill.
<P>
	I think the government ought to be impressed by some of the 
arguments that have been made. If the government cares about the 
quality of our environment, it will see to it that we make decisions 
based on accurate and scientifically recognized studies and that we 
pass legislation based on documentation that is really useful to us 
in our debates.
<P>
	I cannot resist temptation. You know how disciplined I am, but 
sometimes I like to let my imagination go, especially on a difficult 
Friday such as this one, given the difficlut issue of the referral to 
the Supreme Court. You know that nothing is simple in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Things will change now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I see my colleague from the Reform Party shares 
my opinion. I would like to share with you a letter that was sent to 
the government by the natural resources minister in the Bouchard 
government, François Gendron. Let me draw your attention to one 
aspect of this correspondence. The minister writes: ``I am writing 
again, on behalf of the minister of state for economy and finance, 
Bernard Landry, and of the transport minister in charge of 
Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Jacques Brassard, and on my 
own behalf, to state the firm position of the Quebec government on 
the bill being studied''.
<P>
	He continues: ``That bill, the Manganese-based Fuel Additives 
Act, will reach the third reading stage in the House of Commons in 
just a few months. It seems your government is quite determined to 
follow through with that bill. That bill concerns the importation 
and selling of  MMT in Canada. It seems the Canadian government 
wants to pass this bill because the auto makers claim that gasoline 
containing MMT will cause damage to the pollution control 
equipment in new cars''.
<P>
	This is getting interesting, it should shake up government 
members a little. It goes on: ``With free trade between Canada, the 
United States and Mexico, recent developments in the United 
States and Mexico are pointing in another direction''.
<P>
	What does it mean? You will remember that in the past few years 
the Environmental Protection Agency has been trying to have the 
use of MMT banned in the United States. The case was dismissed 
by a district of Columbia appeal court which ruled that the 
evidence presented was not conclusive enough.
<P>
	Not only were the United States defeated, not only was the EPA 
defeated, but now the regulation banning the use of MMT as a fuel 
additive in the United States can no longer be enforced, and in 
Mexico-as you might recall, the Mexican president sat in your 
chair and made a speech to Canadian parliamentarians-they are 
faced with the same situation.
<P>
	So, when we are told that if the bill is not passed, we will no 
longer be competitive, there is something not quite right with 
government members' logic, since the production and use of MMT 
as a fuel additive will now be allowed in the United States, our 
major trading partner-and you know how strong our commercial 
ties are with them, especially when it comes to the automobile 
industry. And not only in the case of the United States, but also in 
the case of Mexico.
<P>
	So, this is a situation of ministerial stubbornness. The minister is 
stomping his feet with a rather childish stubbornness saying we 
must go in that direction, with some sort of determination that is 
almost unreasonable, no, I correct my words, that is not reasonable 
at all.
<P>
	What must we do, as members of Parliament, to convince the 
minister? What efforts must we make when seven provinces are 
opposed, when the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute is 
opposed, when entire industrial sectors are at risk, particularly in 
regions that cannot afford to lose jobs if they want to maintain their 
economic prosperity. Of course, I am talking about East Montreal.
<P>
	So today, we must send the environment minister a cry from the 
heart so that, for the sake of rationality, he can go beyond partisan 
considerations and find a reasonable compromise. And this 
reasonable compromise can only be the public tabling, for debate, 
of much more substantiated studies commissioned by third parties 
and focusing on the potential or not, on the beneficial or deleterious 
nature, of using MMT in gasoline.
<P>
	I do not think what we are asking today is unreasonable. I do not 
think the consensus of the seven provinces, regardless of any 
partisan leaning, is  unreasonable. It seems to me if the Minister of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4819"> 4819 </A></B>
<P>
Environment is concerned with the environmental issue, there are 
other bills, other problems that should hold his attention.
<P>
	We have been told about the pollution in the Great Lakes. There 
would be something there that could be very interesting from a 
legislation viewpoint.
<P>
	So why take up the time of the House to deal with poorly defined 
problems, with untested propositions, on an issue where almost 
everyone is not convinced by or satisfied with the evidence tabled 
by the minister.
<P>
	I intend to take a very firm stand on this. Again, there used to be 
six refineries in the east end of Montreal. The petrochemical sector 
used to be prosperous, but with measures such as those proposed 
today-I have a feeling my time is running out, so I make a last 
appeal to the minister to use common sense and defer his bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from June 3, 1996, consideration of the 
motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider amending the Income Tax Act to provide a Care-Giver 
Tax Credit for those who provide care in the home for pre-school 
children, the disabled, the chronically-ill or the aged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Private Members' Motion No. 30. 
The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending the 
Income Tax Act to provide a Care-Giver Tax Credit for those who provide care in the 
home for pre-school children, the disabled, the chronically-ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of this motion is to help people who greatly need to 
be helped. The disability tax credit is a tax measure that exists at 
the provincial level, at least in Quebec, and at the federal level. It is 
a non-refundable tax credit.
<P>
	In 1994, this credit amounted to $4,233. It is to be noted that it 
was originally established to help those who became disabled 
during the war. In order to be eligible for the credit, the applicant 
must submit, with his income tax return, a Revenue Canada form 
duly completed by a doctor or an optometrist.
<P>
	There are currently a number of tax measures designed to help 
families that take care of elderly or disabled people. However, we 
believe these measures are not enough.
<P>
	The numerous flaws of the current taxation system make me 
quite angry at times. How can this government turn a deaf ear to 
such a motion, while seeking to smother the scandal of family trust 
assets transferred tax free to the United States? Two billion dollars 
left the country tax free, while ordinary taxpayers are being taxed 
to the hilt.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and 
official opposition finance critic, mentioned recently that Liberals 
question the qualifications of the Auditor General and his team by 
refusing to answer his questions, and suggesting that Mr. Desautels 
has stepped outside his terms of reference.
<P>
	Liberal members of the finance committee are trying to demean 
an institution whose main goal is to make sure the government is 
held accountable.
<P>
	I am also quite sensitive to the treatment of older people, in my 
capacity as the official opposition representative for seniors 
organizations. I have taken the floor many times in the House to 
uphold the rights of seniors. We should not forget the Canadian 
population is growing older.
<P>
	A 1991 survey on aging and self care has shown that nearly one 
third of Canadians were 45 or older in 1991, with 19 per cent being 
between 45 and 64 and 11 per cent 65 or older. As the baby 
boomers grow older, we can expect a rapid increase in the number 
of seniors.
<P>
	Projections over the 1991-2001 period tell us that the population 
growth in the 45 plus group will be almost three times faster than in 
the general population, that is 32 and 13 per cent respectively.
<P>
	The well-being of the aged, as measured by their health, their 
revenue and their degree of integration in society, seems to be 
strongly related to the quality of housing and the ability to move 
around in their community. Seniors and the disabled very often 
prefer to stay in their community with the assistance of a member 
of their immediate family or another relative.
<P>
	It appears quite reasonable to give a tax credit to a taxpayer who 
can work full time and give appropriate care to a dependent person. 
People who do not have to move into residences run by strangers 
experience a better quality of life.
<P>
	Seniors are often seen as a burden in our communities. They are 
socially dead. But if they remain in their own community, these 
people can be part of their community and feel more secure, 
financially or otherwise.

<P>
	I also rose in this House to have a grandparents' day celebrated 
every year and also have a grandparents' year designated, to 
recognize the role these people play in the family unit, especially 
in child rearing.
<P>
	These people are often the link between the past, the present and 
the future. Therefore, you will understand why Motion No. 30 is of 
particular concern to me and why its implementation raises several 
questions in my mind.
<P>
	Today's edition of <I>Le Devoir</I> includes highlights of the report of 
the Auditor General of Canada, Denis Desautels. It says that 
Revenue Canada has laid itself open to fraud by not sufficiently 
controlling or assessing the GST credit program and the child tax 
benefits, which combined and replaced the old family allowance 
and child tax credit. These programs cost $8 billion every year.
<P>
	It adds that among the issues that were raised was the fact that 
Revenue Canada does not require a birth certificate before granting 
the tax benefit. The assessment of the applications for disability 
benefits paid by the Canada Pension Plan is inadequate. The total 
amount of these benefits has tripled in the last 10 years, increasing 
from $841 million to $3 billion. In comparison, disability benefits 
paid by the Régime des rentes du Québec have remained almost 
stable during the same period.
<P>
	The report also concluded that a general improvement of 
government phone services was in order. Too often, the lines are 
overloaded and the information given by the operators is incorrect. 
Revenue Canada has a particularly poor performance, in this 
regard.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	How can we not worry about potential fraud, since there are 
people who abuse the system, unfortunately.
<P>
	Moreover, if the government gives the tax credit to people who 
stay at home and take care of preschool children or handicapped, 
chronically ill or senior members of the family, it could be tempted 
to reduce benefits, in particular the old age security or the child tax 
benefit.
<P>
	To conclude, Motion M-30 brought forward by my colleague for 
Mississauga-South is valid in principle, but it would require 
increased vigilance to avoid potential fraud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be here this afternoon to debate this motion tabled by the 
member for Mississauga South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending the 
Income Tax Act to provide a Care-Giver Tax Credit for those who provide care in the 
home for pre-school children, the disabled, the chronically-ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is, of course, a very valid proposal, a step in the right direction, 
and we can all subscribe to its objective.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion proposes that the government augment its existing 
tax credit system for caregivers. This motion, because it identifies 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged is 
not unlike some of the proposals I have made in the past. I would be 
hard pressed not to support my colleague and that is what I intend 
to do philosophically in the direction in which he is going.
<P>
	I want to review some of the things we have in place today. 
There are a number of very laudable programs that not everyone is 
aware of. These were reviewed by the hon. member for St. Paul's 
but I want to share some of them briefly with my colleagues.
<P>
	With respect to the disabled and the aged, the disability tax credit 
is aimed at benefiting those with a severe and prolonged mental or 
physical impairment. There is also medical expense tax credit 
which provides assistance to those with exceedingly difficult 
medical expenses. This credit benefits families helping to care for 
elderly or disabled relatives. There is the infirm dependant credit 
which helps to reduce the federal tax for supporting relatives.
<P>
	With respect to preschool children the child care expense 
deduction assists parents with modest incomes with child care 
expenses. The supplement to the child tax benefit assists those who 
remain at home to raise their children. It is a form of assistance to 
families with modest incomes who have to stay at home to care for 
their young children without utilizing child care. There is the 
working income supplement, a non-taxable benefit which helps 
low income working families with child care expenses and 
transportation costs.
<P>
	I believe we need to offer credits to assist caregivers. In fact as I 
indicated previously I have suggested motions which deal with tax 
credits in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the purpose of this motion is very commendable and that 
each of us agrees, at least in principle, on the necessity of providing 
such assistance. On the other hand, there may be different ways of 
dealing with this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past I proposed a motion to change the child related tax 
benefits and child care deductions. I felt that they should be based 
on need irrespective of care. I also proposed a motion that was 
aimed at assisting single income families. I thought this was 
particularly important and I still do so today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4821"> 4821 </A></B>
<P>
	Our tax system is continually evolving to meet the changing 
needs of our population. Let us look at this motion specifically. 
Some people have suggested that it may not be specific enough 
and that the motion may not have sufficient details so that we can 
deal with it appropriately.
<P>
	I want to share with my colleagues a couple of observations with 
respect to experiences I have had recently in dialoguing with fellow 
Canadians and experts of different disciplines who have a great 
deal of knowledge about our Canadian population.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	I had the good fortune to meet with a number of individuals of 
diverse backgrounds to discuss the future of government in 
Canada. We wanted to see how government might operate and how 
it might respond even more sensitively than it does now to 
changing needs. Clearly that could be done if we had a better 
picture of how the Canadian population is changing.
<P>
	I must confess these discussions have been rather fascinating. A 
number of themes emerged during this exchange, but one of the 
common threads that came about was the flexibility of government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Without this great flexibility, whether it be at the federal, 
provincial or municipal level, we will have serious problems. 
Why? Because it is obvious that the needs of the population vary 
greatly from region to region. It is true that there are common 
needs, but it is also true that, depending on the population, the 
needs can vary considerably from province to province, from 
region to region, from territory to territory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Interestingly, the discussions have identified numerous support 
mechanisms, some of which are very innovative. We have to stop 
thinking that it is only the federal, provincial and municipal 
governments that can assist citizens. There are a number of 
organizations out that that do laudable work with very little 
investment from Canadians, that is very little investment relatively 
speaking. However, I am targeting that which we refer to as 
community groups. We need to take a look at that and see what else 
they might provide in services to improve the quality of life of all 
Canadians who need special assistance.
<P>
	When I talk about support I am using the term loosely. I do not 
say that pejoratively, but in a very broad sense because it can mean 
a lot of things. It can mean flexibility, which I have already 
mentioned, in the workplace to allow time, for example, away 
during difficult periods without the threat of a job loss. It can mean 
the expansion of health care services to provide better, long term 
care in the community and elsewhere. It  can mean flexibility to the 
CPP. It clearly could mean tax credits, but these are not the only 
solutions.
<P>
	I guess where I am at right now, I would argue that a study would 
need to be carried out to examine exactly what the $1.4 billion in 
existing assistance means to Canadians. Do they know that this is 
happening? Are they sufficiently familiar with these programs? 
Are individuals currently aware of what credits for which they are 
all eligible? Is the current system being utilized appropriately? We 
have talked about some people misusing the system but there are a 
number of people, which I think has been documented, who are not 
aware of the systems and programs that exist.
<P>
	When we look at this holistically, we need to ask where the gaps 
are. Clearly there must be some. There are weaknesses in the 
system. What measures are required to fill these gaps and be more 
responsive to Canadians and their needs? Maybe tax credits are 
required. Perhaps there are other solutions that need to be explored.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Basically, the point I want to make this afternoon is that it is a 
good idea as such, an idea we all support. However, before going 
any further, we should look at all the programs I have mentioned 
and others in order to determine how well they meet the needs for 
which they were designed. Then we will be able to determine if the 
system is deficient, if certain programs need to be strengthened, 
changed, eliminated or replaced.
<P>
	What my colleague is proposing is simple, but it is something 
that we should do only after having reviewed all programs, after 
having gained a better understanding of the needs of Canadians 
across the country and after having made sure that future changes 
in the Canadian population are taken into account in the measures 
we propose.
<P>
	You certainly know-if I am not mistaken, we are talking about 
a population over 65 years of age representing 11 or 12 per cent of 
the total population in Canada-that the senior population is 
expected to double over the next thirty years or so. Women, who 
already live longer than men, are expected to live even longer. And 
even men will also live longer.
<P>
	What does that means as it relates to health, entertainment, 
work? What does it means when we look at this new Canadian 
population which will be different from what it is today?
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Incidentally, I should point out that this solution is not so 
different from what can be found in a number of European 
countries.
<P>
	I suggest that we keep in mind the idea put forward by my 
colleague from Mississauga South until we have an opportunity to 
thoroughly review all the programs. We can then look at the 
shortcomings and determine if  changes are required, if some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4822"> 4822 </A></B>
<P>
programs should be altered or if the solution proposed by the hon. 
member is the best alternative.
<P>
	And this concludes my remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
debate this important private member's motion. First, I would like 
to support the idea of the private member's motion. I read a bit of 
history not long ago and found that in times past Parliament was 
taken up essentially with motions and bills brought forward by 
private members.
<P>
	Over time, this has eroded to mostly government initiated bills 
and motions. If the government says go for it, then fine. If the 
government is against it, it would not bring in the bills or motions. 
Consequently, the legislative agenda is greatly limited.
<P>
	I appreciate the concept of private members' motions. I 
sincerely hope that we will not see in this private member's motion 
the kind of interference from the government side that we did in the 
previous one earlier this week. I hope, sincerely, that members of 
Parliament will be able to assess the merits of this motion on its 
own and to vote freely, without interference from the government 
side.
<P>
	Specifically the question is one of taxation. This topic comes up 
over and over again in the House. It is a problem, I suppose it 
would be proper to say, that has seized the attention of Canadians.
<P>
	I was married 35 years ago. I would like to congratulate my wife 
for having stayed with me for that long. It is a miracle in itself. A 
friend of ours said recently: ``She deserves a medal'', and I would 
concur with that.
<P>
	When we were first married in 1961, my salary was a little over 
$400 a month. My income tax deduction was $35 a month, about 8 
per cent. On that salary, I was able to provide for my family. At 
first we had a rented house. We went from that to purchase a house 
on a single income.
<P>
	I was able to provide enough groceries. People can see over the 
years that I, as the representative sample of our family, have not 
suffered in the starvation department. We have been able to manage 
quite well.
<P>
	We are one family who made the choice that, when our children 
were young, mother would be a full time mother. She would be the 
manager of the home. She would be there for the children in the 
morning when they were off to school as they grew older. She 
stayed with them, of course, full time before they went to school. 
She was there when the children came home from school in order 
to give a solid, loving home base to the children as they were 
growing up. Consequently, we lived on my income only during 
those years.
<P>
	Unfortunately, times have changed during these 35 years. To my 
view, they have changed to the detriment of the family. For most 
Canadians over half their income is spent for them by politicians 
and bureaucrats at the three levels of government. No longer do we 
have an 8 per cent rate of taxation. We now have a 50 per cent rate 
of taxation, plus GST. People cannot get away from that. No matter 
where they turn to purchase anything, there is the GST.
<P>
	I had to buy a part for my vehicle the other day. I ended up 
paying $10 in GST. The part was quite expensive. I said to myself, 
why should I pay a penalty of $10 to some federal program that is 
wasting my money because I have to repair my vehicle so that it 
will run.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The motion underlines the fact that we are taxed to death. In 
particular, as families we are being taxed to death. It is no longer 
true that families have a choice, as we had, to say that one member 
will stay at home full time. They cannot live on one income. The 
reason is very simple. So much of a family's earnings are now 
taken away from it by the coercion of taxation that the amount that 
it has left is insufficient to provide for shelter, clothing, food, 
education and then some of those other things that are valued.
<P>
	It is wonderful if children, as they are growing up, can learn 
more than what is taught just in the home and in the school. I 
benefited from piano lessons. My parents sacrificed so that I could 
learn to play the piano. I love playing O Canada when we go out to 
some of the meetings in my constituency. I always say: ``Make sure 
there is a piano there so that I can play it''. My parents sacrificed 
for that. More and more families cannot do that.
<P>
	I spoke recently with parents who said they have no choice but 
for both of them to work. Otherwise they could not afford to have 
shelter, clothing and food. They are hard pressed to provide some 
of those other things which are so valuable in the development and 
the growth of children.
<P>
	This motion says there should be a tax credit for those who 
choose this particular lifestyle. In principle, I agree with it. The 
principle is that we want to reduce the tax load on families so that 
they can, with their own earnings, provide the care for their 
families. That is a commendable goal. In principle, I am in favour 
of what this bill says.
<P>
	At the same time I seriously ask the question of whether this is 
the best way to go. First, governments at all levels should sharply 
reduce their demands for money to be shipped to Ottawa by the 
truckload, trainload or however it is brought here. The federal 
government over spends. There is no doubt about it. Too large a 
proportion of government expenditures are going to interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4823"> 4823 </A></B>
<P>
	It is absolutely mandatory that the government reduce not only 
its annual borrowing so that the debt goes up more slowly, it is 
far beyond the time already when it should have reduced the 
deficit to zero. Government should be living within its means, 
including the payment of interest on the present debt. Members 
should start looking at reducing the debt which would reduce the 
amount of interest so that Canadians can be given a tax break. 
Consequently those Canadians would have more of their own 
money to spend as they see fit. If parents value the ability to 
choose that one of them stays home, then they should be able to 
afford that.
<P>
	It is true that in the present system the greatest amount of future 
planning, retirement planning and family budgeting has to do with 
meeting the tax budget and the tax demands. I attended a seminar 
some time ago on retirement planning. I was appalled when I 
realized that about 10 or 15 per cent of the time was spent making 
wise investment decisions and things like that and about 85 per 
cent was used on how to either postpone or avoid paying taxes. It 
points out the fact that taxes are too high.
<P>
	This bill says let us give a tax credit to those families in which 
there is only one wage earner. Let us make it easier for families to 
make that choice. Not long ago there was a poll taken and it showed 
that fully two-thirds of parents of young children said if they really 
had the choice they would choose for one or the other of them to 
stay home full time with the children. They feel they do not have 
the choice and inasmuch as this motion is a step in the right 
direction, it would be wise of us to support it.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Motion No. M-30 which 
would give a tax credit to home caregivers.
<P>
	It is particularly a pleasure to speak to this motion because it 
gives me an opportunity to demonstrate to Canadians who may be 
interested that we who are members of political parties, be it the 
Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois or the Liberal Party, are not 
necessarily ideologues, that we do not necessarily follow or hold 
all the views of our respective parties.
<P>
	In this case I am referring to the position taken by my own 
Liberal Party on day care during the last federal election. The 
Liberals came out very strongly in support of government 
subsidized day care. The NDP came out even more strongly. If I 
remember correctly, the NDP promised to spend $1 billion on 
subsidized day care which the NDP said would create some 70,000 
jobs. The Liberals promised much less than that; their program was 
a couple of hundred million dollars which would create about 
10,000 jobs if I recall correctly.
<P>
	From the outset I was opposed to both concepts in principle. I 
made it very clear when I ran for election that  I did not support 
everything in the red book, and I certainly did not support the 
Liberal position on day care. The fundamental reason was that in 
my mind the promise of 70,000 jobs for $1 billion was a promise of 
70,000 marginal jobs basically for women to look after children 
other than their own. I did not see the practicality of that.
<P>
	The desire for subsidized daycare has its origins in the socialistic 
movement of the previous decades, of the 1960s and the 1970s. It 
was based on two premises. One premise was that parents, 
particularly women, should not have to sacrifice for their children, 
for raising families. The premise was that they should be able to 
have children and also have a worthy job. The other premise, an 
important one, was that the state could provide some fundamental 
social caregiving like the family in looking after children.
<P>
	It has become very clear in the course of the 1980s when we see 
what has happened to the great totalitarian socialist states like the 
former Soviet Union and even communist China, that 
institutionalized family services do not work. In the end they create 
problems. They create young people who become adults who are 
not effective citizens.
<P>
	The services become unmanageable in their actual 
implementation. Look anywhere in the experiences of the Soviet 
Union and communist China and lesser so in some of the Nordic 
states and we will find there have been many problems in trying to 
successfully implement state run family care. It is not a concept 
that we recognize as being very successful any more.
<P>
	The proof of the pudding is in my own riding. When I 
campaigned from door to door particularly on Hamilton Mountain, 
a great number of the lower income families obviously had both 
parents employed. As I went along the streets, I saw that block after 
block the streets were empty, the houses were empty. The 
driveways usually had spaces for two automobiles. Most of these 
parents probably had their children in day care if they were not in 
school.
<P>
	As the member for Mississauga South pointed out, the 
emancipation of the other spouse, be they male or female, basically 
puts two people in a position of marginal income at the sacrifice of 
the children. The statistic is basically that a person earning $25,000 
with two children in day care makes a net profit of $100 a week. I 
submit that is not worth the trial, tribulation and even the damage 
which it inflicts on young children.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	In my area there are some subsidized day care facilities. I have 
visited them as a member of Parliament. What do we do when we 
enter a subsidized day care facility and see the children playing not 
on real grass but on plastic grass? Money has been raised to support 
these day care centres and in someone's incredible wisdom the  
things which children relate to have been removed; simple things 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4824"> 4824 </A></B>
<P>
like real grass and real dirt. In other words, the paid caregivers do 
not want the children to get dirty. I would say that has the potential 
of being a traumatic experience for children. I cannot accept it.
<P>
	I have three children. I have also been the parent who has stayed 
at home while my wife worked. I have been the primary caregiver. 
My children were preschoolers. I worked at the Toronto <I>Star</I>. I 
would come home very late at night. I made a point every night 
before the children were in school to go directly home to read fairy 
tales to them. Actually, I can imitate just about every voice in every 
fairy tale. I can do Pinocchio, I can do the good fairy and all of 
those voices. Also Long John Silver. The pay off was that my 
children were capable of reading by the time they were in grade 3. 
They were reading fluently all the books which they had before 
them. I submit that was because I was the caregiver who read them 
those stories.
<P>
	I have had occasion to go to schools to read to children after 
school was out. They could not go home because their parents were 
working. They did not have their own mom and dad to read to 
them, so they had to rely on a stranger. In this case the stranger was 
a member of Parliament. It is not the same thing. It is not as good.
<P>
	What the motion directs us toward is looking once more at where 
we stand as a country with respect to traditional family values and 
the importance of the family. The motion is a direction to 
Parliament to set aside the socialist ideologies of the past and to 
look to the future, remembering that there are genuine values in the 
traditional family. As we go into the next century these values are 
going to be even more accentuated.
<P>
	We have now entered the computer age. I live in a little village 
far from Toronto, a remote village in southern Ontario. It does not 
have a lot of amenities. There is a mother who lives across the 
street who has developed a tremendous business as a computer 
troubleshooter. She has one room set aside in her home and she is 
on the phone with businesses all over the world. She makes a good 
wage.
<P>
	That mother is also the primary caregiver. She has three small 
children. She is able to look after those children. She has a career 
and a sense of worthiness, a sense of participating in society, and 
she also has the opportunity to give her children the natural care 
which they deserve. I do not see any reason for the government not 
to recognize the value which she is contributing to society by being 
at home and looking after her children.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	The present situation is that when one member of a couple, be 
they male or female, elect to stay at home, the government gives 
them nothing. The present tax situation is such that the government 
encourages both parents to  work and as we have seen, it is only to 
marginal advantage.
<P>
	Finally, tomorrow I face an audience of about 300 people in one 
of the largest halls in my riding to discuss the Young Offenders Act. 
There was a terrible shooting in my riding about two months ago in 
which a young man was seriously wounded by teenagers with a 
handgun which fired a hollow nosed bullet. The young man is now 
paralyzed. This has raised an enormous concern in my riding with 
respect to possible amendments to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	We will discuss the act. But behind our discussion about 
changing the Young Offenders Act and increasing the penalties and 
the opportunities for rehabilitation for young people is the 
fundamental problem that in the past 20 years we have left the 
family unit behind and we have failed our young people. I think 
that shows up in the increased incidents of youth crime.
<P>
	I support the motion 100 per cent. It is a fine motion and I 
congratulate the member for Mississauga South for bringing it 
before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the 
concerns of the hon. member for Mississauga South, which have 
prompted his Motion No. 30. This motion proposes an amendment 
to the Income Tax Act to provide a caregiver tax credit for those 
who provide care in the home for preschool children, the disabled, 
the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	You are, no doubt, aware that women generally invest more time 
than men in the care and nurturing of children, and this, for many 
of them, results in increased difficulty in entering the work force 
and in reduced earnings. During their lifetimes as well, they 
generally devote more time than men to the care of dependent 
members of their extended families, the sick, the disabled, or the 
elderly.
<P>
	According to Nancy Guberman, in <I>Actes du colloque</I>, the 
proceedings of a symposium held in Montreal on May 5, 1995, 
women are responsible for 85 per cent of the assistance provided 
within families. According to <I>Canadian Social Trends</I>, in 1992 
virtually all of the 3.4 million people whose principal activity was 
caring for the family home were women.
<P>
	An examination of these statistics clearly shows that the 
measures in Motion No. 30 would, for the most part, affect 
Canadian and Quebec women. It is therefore important to compare 
the demands being made by those most concerned by this with the 
objectives of the motion we are addressing at this time. But serious 
attention must also be given in particular to the means which will 
be used to achieve those goals.
<P>
	The aim of the motion proposed by the member for Mississauga 
South is to recognize the child-rearing done  by the parent at home. 
We entirely agree with the member regarding the need for society 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4825"> 4825 </A></B>
<P>
to recognize the considerable value of unpaid work performed by 
women at home, on the farm or elsewhere, whether it be 
housework, the care and nurturing of children or providing care to 
the aged.
<P>
	People who work at home are extremely resentful of the lack of 
understanding and social respect from which they still suffer today. 
Changes are therefore necessary in order to attach more value to 
unpaid work and to the social role that those people play. This is 
what Motion No. 30 proposes. This why we support the motion of 
the member for Mississauga South, which responds with good 
intentions to the legitimate claims of those people.
<P>
	But, in order to achieve these goals, the government must be 
guided by two key principles: the search for equity or social justice 
and the search for an efficient allocation of resources.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	We support this motion, although we still have some concerns 
about its implementation and implications.
<P>
	It would be unacceptable, for instance, if this motion were to 
send women back to their kitchens, that is to say encourage them to 
stay home and discourage those who are working outside the home.
<P>
	It is important to support women's legitimate aspiration to full 
participation to society, whatever their place of work.
<P>
	Women are free to choose to stay home to take care of someone 
in their immediate family, but they are also have a fundamental 
right to work. We must recognize that being away from a paid job 
has long-term consequences, because women who leave the 
workforce not only have to do without the income but, upon 
returning to work, they will never earn as much as they would have 
if they had not left.
<P>
	Motion M-30 would help make up for this loss of income. In 
most cases, women work outside the home because they are single 
mothers, have to supplement their partner's income or because they 
want to contribute to society the knowledge and skills they have. It 
is important to support those who work at home, but it is equally 
important to support women who are in an occupational setting or 
would like to be.
<P>
	Our second concern has to do with the adverse effects the 
changes proposed in Motion M-30 could have if they are not 
implemented with care. Yes, we should help women working in the 
home, but it is important to watch out for a tax system that would 
introduce further inequality and exclusion. We must categorically 
oppose a system that seeks to realize savings by eliminating jobs, 
and reducing the demand for daycare places and services. Such a 
system would be a disincentive to jobs and training, and would 
limit women to the status of part-time workers or make them 
dependent on their spouse or the government.
<P>
	Today, and there are a number of reasons for this, the care and 
raising of children no longer usually require the full-time presence 
of the mother in the home for the greater part of her working life. 
We tend to have fewer children, and our children leave home for 
school at an early age. The phenomena of separation and divorce, 
and the increase in single parenthood, have also meant that a 
woman's ability to earn her living has become the best guarantee of 
economic security for women and children. But let us never forget 
that this ability is strongly dependent on academic training and 
work experience and whether women have sufficiently 
remunerative work.
<P>
	Motion M-30 is rooted in a good intention, in wishing to provide 
a tax credit for those looking after relatives at home. It is a way of 
promoting the equality and autonomy of these women. But let us 
take care that measures such as those proposed in M-30 do not lose 
sight of the fact that women are people in their own right and not 
dependents of a spouse, or people whose identity is lost in that of 
the family.
<P>
	My third reservation concerns the beneficiaries of the assistance 
proposed in Motion M-30. Such measures must, of necessity, be 
directed towards individuals working in the home. In the 
demographic and economic context we are now facing, the tax 
system and transfer payments must support the movement of 
women towards economic autonomy, by encouraging them to take 
training, to acquire relevant work experience and to develop their 
knowledge and know-how on a life long basis. We must be wary of 
fixating on measures that force individuals to maintain family 
solidarity, and remember the importance of basing the tax system 
on individuals first and foremost. The work of a person providing 
care in the home for children, the chronically ill, the disabled or the 
aged must be recognized independently of family income.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Any measures likely to slow down women's participation in the 
labour market and to increase their economic dependency on their 
spouse or on the government risk having a high social cost over the 
long term.
<P>
	Motion No. 30, I repeat, should not be used as an excuse for 
confining women to home nor as a justification for removing 
government commitment, which could reduce the benefits already 
enjoyed by certain categories of people such as seniors or 
handicapped people.
<P>
	It should not be used either to make savings on the backs of 
workers who could lose their jobs because of a decrease in the 
demand for services. This is no way to create jobs.
<P>

	Finally, the Bloc Quebecois reiterates its comments on how 
important it is for Quebec to give itself a comprehensive family 
policy, something it cannot do right now within the federal system. 
Indeed, the existence of two levels of government in many areas 
affecting women's life is cause for overlapping and duplication 
of programs and structures and, as a result, a waste of taxpayer 
money.
<P>
	As for me, I think the interest of Quebec women would be best 
served if there were only one decision maker and only one provider 
of funds. For Quebec, it would mean that it would be possible to 
give itself a consistent and comprehensive policy dealing with the 
status of woman and the family.
<P>
	We are convinced that only sovereignty for Quebec will allow us 
to reach these goals.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today in favour of Motion No. 30 brought 
forward by my colleague from Mississauga South.
<P>
	At the outset I would like to say that I have not looked at all of 
the financial implications of this motion and, from that perspective, 
we must bear in mind that this is a motion and not a bill. What we 
are really trying to do is encourage the government to look for ways 
to fulfil the objectives the member for Mississauga has in mind. I 
am very pleased to see that there is so much support on both sides 
of the House for this motion.
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that there is a growing sense among 
Canadians that governments at all levels place less value today on 
the role parents play in raising children. One may argue that it is a 
personal decision to have children and that society already plays a 
large role in the development of those children. We can look at 
health care and education as two examples of general tax revenues 
being used for the indiscriminate benefit of all of us.
<P>
	The fact that all taxpayers contribute to the education system 
demonstrates that society has historically recognized that well 
educated children and, as a consequence, a well educated 
workforce and citizenry are good for the well-being of the whole 
community.
<P>
	The decision to have children means years of financial sacrifice 
for parents. There is a further loss of income if one parent stays 
home to look after the children. I have long believed that income 
splitting would be the preferred way for governments to recognize 
the costs involved when a parent stays home to care for a child or 
children. My colleague from Mississauga South has already 
introduced a bill which proposes that to the government and I still 
believe this approach should be looked at by the government when 
it is looking for ways to help families.
<P>
	In the past 50 years we have seen a dramatic change in the 
Canadian family. In 1968 only 30 per cent of families had two 
incomes. In a 1994 study by Statistics Canada 60.4 per cent of all 
families were dual earners. Now more often than not both parents 
work outside the home. One of the reasons for this change often is 
that both parents have vital careers and want to continue their 
professional lives.
<P>
	However, as a recent Angus Reid survey showed, over 70 per 
cent of parents where both were working and had preschool 
children said that if they could they would choose to have one 
parent stay at home to provide for their children. However, this 
choice is not available to all families. The realities of today's 
economy force many parents to both work just to make ends meet.
<P>
	Being a dual earner family causes other problems, in particular 
the extra expense of child care. This additional child care expense 
is substantial. For example, when a second spouse is working and 
earning $25,000 with two children in child care the net pay is less 
than $100 per week. In many cases it does not justify the family 
hardships and sacrifices made when both spouses are working.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I would like to read a letter from one of my constituents whom I 
have spoken with at some length. He has written to me recently 
again, Mr. Don Bell from Kanata, Ontario. I will quote one 
paragraph from his letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Existing income tax laws provide day care rebates to the lower income earner in a 
family, rebates which increase as salary increases. This encourages the second wage 
earner to work full time, even overtime, to maximize benefits. A custodial parent 
with children finds it easy to obtain welfare benefits after divorce, making marriage 
break-up financially attractive. What incentives are there for parents to stay home 
and care for their own children, or to stay married and assume responsibility for each 
other's care? Sadly, there are none. Dependent child deductions have disappeared 
from the income tax form. The spousal deduction has been so eroded by inflation 
that even a small part time income wipes it out, again leading both parents to work 
and burn themselves out full time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As the tax system stands now, there are no significant benefits 
for stay at home parents. Motion No. 30 would help remedy this 
oversight. By providing a caregiver tax credit, the federal 
government would be making it possible for many parents to 
decide whether to work or stay at home.
<P>
	I would actually go beyond what is in the motion. I would not 
limit this to preschool children. It is important that we have parents 
available throughout a child's development through school and try 
to avoid problems of latch key kids coming home from school 
when there is nobody home.
<P>
	I am not sure why this was limited to preschool children. Perhaps 
this is looked on as the art of the  possible, but if government is 
looking at using the tax system to help families raising children, it 
really has to look at supporting families right through to the end of 
high school for children.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4827"> 4827 </A></B>
<P>
	One could also argue there would be immediate economic 
benefits if the government is to adopt Motion No. 30, assuming that 
it encourages people to stay at home. Those parents who choose to 
stay at home to raise their children will immediately free many 
jobs. This would lead to a lowering of the unemployment rate and, 
in addition, will open more quality child care spaces. This will 
ensure that the children of dual earner families have professional 
care givers looking after them. Those child care workers are 
individuals who have the education and training to make a child's 
preschool years a rewarding experience.
<P>
	More important, this motion will have a substantial positive 
effect on the next generation. As we all know, children are the 
future of our country and we, as today's parents, have an important 
influence on the shaping of their character and beliefs.
<P>
	Study after study shows that the early years of life are 
instrumental in the development of a child's lifetime character. One 
of the latest of such studies, published in April 1996 by Dr. 
Steinhauser of the Caledon institute of Social Policy, concluded 
with the statement that society needs to develop a system: 
``designed to help all families better meet the critical 
developmental needs of their children while increasing their sense 
of mastery and control of their own and their children's lives. Then 
and only then can we be confident that the next generation of 
children will have the good early childhood experiences that will 
enable them to achieve, for themselves and for society, their 
potential for personal success and for both human and economic 
productivity''.
<P>
	This motion does not deal only with the raising of children. It 
also recognizes the needs of people caring for the disabled, the 
chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
	We are each aware of people whose lives are affected totally by 
the demands placed on them by caring for loved ones who are ill or 
disabled.
<P>
	In particular I think of an elderly woman who spoke at one of my 
town hall meetings on health care whose husband has Alzheimer's 
disease. Essentially this woman, who is not all that well herself, 
finds herself up all hours of the day and night tending to her 
husband's needs. She loves her husband and wants to keep him at 
home as long as she can but she is burning herself out. She feels 
there is absolutely no recognition of the fact that she is providing 
this care.
<P>
	There are many others out there as well. I am involved with the 
Alzheimer's Society. This is a growing problem. We will continue 
to see this grow in the future.
<P>
	If there is any possibility of keeping someone out of a public 
institution, we should look for ways to support those who are 
willing to make all those sacrifices involved in looking after 
somebody 24 hours a day in the home.
<P>
	This is important for parents to know that society recognizes 
their contribution. Those who provide care to the ill, the disabled or 
aged also have this need.
<P>
	The financial aspect is extremely important but also the fact that 
society recognizes what people are going through. These are stories 
we rarely hear about because they are behind closed doors in 
people's homes. There are tremendous struggles going on out there. 
We need to in some way let people know we appreciate what they 
are doing. The demands on our chronic care system are only going 
to continue to grow over time.
<P>
	I wish to again congratulate my colleague from Mississauga 
South on this motion. He is being consistent and persistent when it 
comes to raising these problems with us. I hope with the goodwill 
of the House we will have this motion passed when it comes time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will call for resumption of 
debate. Seeing that there is a member ready to speak and also in 
consideration of the time on the clock, I will not put the question 
because the member for Lisgar-Marquette wishes to speak.
<P>
	When this business comes back to the House it will be the 
Reform Party which will have the next opportunity to speak to this 
motion. With the agreement of the House I will call it 2.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
