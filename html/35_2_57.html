	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as stated 
by the Minister of Labour on Monday, eliminating accidents in the 
workplace is both a social and economic necessity. Canadian 
Occupational Health and Safety Week lets us focus on the 
tremendous toll that these accidents take on human life and 
productivity.
<P>
	This year's theme of ``Training-Target Zero Accidents'' shows 
that training is a key factor to eliminating accidents. How do we 
target zero accidents? In response I say by integrating occupational 
safety and health in our day to day activities, for example by 
choosing the right equipment, learning to lift things properly and 
taking the time to speak to our workers and co-workers about safer 
practices.
<P>
	We can reduce the grim statistics through teamwork. In that 
spirit I would like to congratulate the Canadian Society of Safety 
Engineering for sponsoring this annual event. I encourage 
Canadians to participate in events this week and to work together to 
make our workplaces safer and more productive.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, June is 
the month when the hearts of many young adults become twitter 
patted and marriage is soon to follow. In fact many young couples 
have made that move just prior to June, including my son and his 
new wife.
<P>
	On May 25 I attended another wedding of a young couple, Krista 
and Jerry, and was asked to give a toast to the bride. As a member 
of Parliament, I took the opportunity on behalf of the Prime 
Minister and the House of Commons to wish Krista and Jerry the 
very best in their marriage.
<P>
	Realizing that during the rest of 1996 there will be thousands of 
Canadians joining in holy matrimony, I thought it would be nice if 
members would take a second for all of us to collectively wish the 
very best to all newlyweds of 1996. May you live a long prosperous 
life and may your marriage be fruitful. God bless each and every 
family on behalf of all members of Parliament.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALTRANSPORTATIONWEEK">NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, National Transportation Week is on until June 8. It gives 
me great pleasure to draw attention to this event, especially since 
federal transportation policies provide us every day with more 
reasons to wish for Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	If a single government had jurisdiction over transportation, we 
would never have faced the uncontrolled development of road 
transport without first making better use of existing rail and 
shipping services. Rail transport comes under federal jurisdiction 
while road transport is a provincial responsibility. Because of this 
artificial division of powers between the federal and provincial 
governments, intermodality could not become a major tool for 
government action.
<P>

considerable surprise and has raised a large amount of public

<P>
	It is quite legal under the Yukon Quartz Mining Act to do this

	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can 
halt the claims. He can stop them today. I therefore urge the

<P>
	This government and others continue to ignore the single 
unifying cause of the destruction of our agricultural lands, water 
quality and ozone that combine to make our environment 
increasingly compromised. The primary cause of the 
environmental degradation I speak about is our own population 
growth rate, with its increasing consumption of our dwindling

populations under stress. This is a vicious cycle that no one is 
looking at because they are not prepared to deal with the politically 
incorrect topic of our own reproductive growth rates.
<P>
	Our own reproductive success is destroying the beautiful home

Mr. Speaker, the hon. Minister of Natural Resources has indicated

development budget goes to Quebec.
<P>
	The time has come to set the record straight. When the minister 
says that 25 per cent of the funds are spent in Quebec, she is 
distorting reality by not including in Ontario's share the funds 
allocated to the national capital region, when in fact a large portion 
of this region is located in Ontario and 60 per cent of her 
department's expenditures in research and development are made 
in that region alone.

	The fact of the matter is that, in 1995-96, only 14.9 per cent of 
Natural Resources Canada's research and development budget, or 
$7.8 million out of an overall budget of $52 million, went to 
Quebec.

Speaker, the consequences of the American Helms-Burton Act, 
which has extra-territorial effect and is intended to strengthen the 
U.S. embargo against Cuba, are extremely serious, since Canada is 
Cuba's major economic partner. Yesterday, the countries of the 
Organization of American States reached an unanimous decision to 
present a draft resolution against this American legislation.
<P>
	Given that Canada and Mexico are partners in both the OAS and 
NAFTA, and given that the Prime Minister is scheduled to be 
meeting with the President of Mexico in a few days, does the Prime 
Minister intend to make use of the economic and political clout the 
two countries wield with the U.S. and to propose to his counterpart 
a joint strategy in defence of this American legislation?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as everyone here knows, we have protested on behalf of 
Canada right from the beginning. Later, I went to meet with the 
Caribbean heads of government and convinced them to adopt a 
joint resolution. Mexico has protested against this act. We have 
had occasion to discuss it with the European community, and it 
is my belief that the Americans are totally isolated in this initiative 
to adopt extra-territorial legislation.
<P>
	We shall be keeping up the pressure on the American 
government. I myself have spoken with the President, and the 
matter will certainly be raised, as the hon. member has suggested, 
with our Mexican partner because we most firmly believe that it is 
absolutely contrary to both the letter and the spirit of NAFTA.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister. Following along in the same 
vein, during the Prime Minister of France's visit to Quebec and 
Canada, which is scheduled for next week, does the Prime Minister 
intend to discuss the matter, in order to have it placed on the agenda 
of the next G-7 summit, which will take place at Lyon at the end of 
June?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that the French government has protested, as has 
the European Community in general. I believe that all the countries 
have protested, or at least the community as a whole. Every time 
we have the opportunity to meet with our foreign counterparts, we 
raise this problem, and I am sure I shall have the opportunity to 
discuss it with Mr. Juppé. He will, perhaps, be able to bring 
pressure to bear on the President of France, who is the current head 
of the G-7, so that the problem may be raised during his term.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, following along again in the same vein, since the 
extra-territorial nature of the Helms-Burton Act is contrary to 
international trade arrangements, can the Prime Minister tell us 
whether Canada has taken any steps to take this dispute before the 
World Trade Organization?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know there is talk of its being submitted to NAFTA and 
the International Trade Commission, but I do not know if this will 
take the form of a Canadian initiative or not. All the countries have 
protested, and I am sure that the organization will be apprised of 
this in one way or another.
<P>
	I have personally raised the issue with the U.S. government on a 
number of occasions. I think the President will be making a 
statement on this matter shortly. We believe the Americans will not 
be able to continue along this path. Here in Canada we are looking  
at the possibility of amending some of our legislation to counteract 
the effects of the American legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Helms-Burton legislation is having considerable impact. This 
August, a provision will come into effect that may lead to 
thousands of cases of prosecution against businesses with interests 
in Cuba. We are talking about nearly 6,000 legal claims including a 
number involving Canadian businesses.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How does he intend 
helping businesses that will be prosecuted under this legislation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I just indicated, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister for International Trade and perhaps others are studying 
possible reforms that might encourage or at least help the victims 
of any suits brought against Canadians.
<P>
	As I understand it, the American administration has some 
leeway in applying certain parts of the law. We have made 
representations to the American Secretary of State and to the 
administration in general in the hopes that they would use the 
flexibility available to them to chield Canadians or at least leave 
them out of this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
all very well, but time is of the essence. There are only two months 
left.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister implement a realistic strategy to 
prevent Canadian business from feeling the effects of this 
legislation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada has very little sway over the 
United States Congress, which is empowered to pass legislation. 
What we did, and I am happy to have been the first government 
leader to raise the issue, was to stimulate interest in the 
international community.
<P>
	As I just said, we contacted Mexico immediately. We also had a 
motion passed by all the Caribbean prime ministers, we are raising 
the matter at all public forums, and I think that the Americans are 
beginning to realize the legislation has little sense.
<P>

electoral period, it will perhaps be a little easier in November.

<P>
	Meanwhile the minister continues to build and reinforce 
roadblocks that prevent Canadian farmers from developing new 
export markets to help reach his goals.
<P>
	Let me give an example. The Canadian Wheat Board has stooped 
to biting and scratching in its attempt to protect its monopoly while 
bungling barley sales for the last two years and going on a witch 
hunt if farmers dare to challenge the board's right to be the sole 
marketing authority of their grain.
<P>
	Will the minister make changes now, not some future vague 
time, that will allow farmers to develop new export opportunities 
for their wheat and barley outside the Canadian Wheat Board if 
they so choose?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
</B><B>Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party continues to 
make demands for pre-emptory changes in the Canadian grain 
marketing system.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman will know opinions in western Canada about 
best methods of grain marketing are divided and those on both 
sides of the question hold their opinions very sincerely and 
strongly. There has been a debate on this issue in western Canada 
for many months. Much of that debate has generated over time far 
more heat than light.
<P>
	For that reason we have attempted to bring some focus and some 
logic into the discussion by establishing the western grain 
marketing panel, within which all of the various points of view can 
be addressed in a thorough, logical and transparent manner.
<P>
	The membership of that panel, including nine prominent 
Canadians, includes every range of opinion on grain marketing 
from one extreme to the other. The panel is working very hard and 
very well together.
<P>
	We expect to receive the report from the panel by the end of this 
month. Once we have that report we will all be in a position to 
make logical, fair and decent decisions for the future. I think it 
would be highly inappropriate to pre-empt that process now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that was a swing and miss. We will miss our target by 
at least $2 billion or $3 billion with that type of answer.
<P>
	Let us try another tact. The minister of agriculture has failed to 
establish a whole farm NISA arrangement with all the 
provinces-another failure. The agriculture sector is becoming 
more vulnerable to the interprovincial trade barriers we have seen 
in the past. Ontario veal producers are being hurt by provincial 
companies in Quebec. Alberta's farm income stabilization plan has 
Saskatchewan cattle feeders worried. The list is getting longer and 
longer.
<P>
	Will the Liberal government exercise its rightful role, a federal 
role, to prevent or remove interprovincial trade barriers on 
agriculture goods so the industry can flourish and actually meet the 
minister's targets for export rather than scrapping internally 
between the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the representations contained in 
the latter part of the hon. gentlemen's question I am sure will be 
music to the ears of the Minister of Industry, who is responsible for 
internal trade negotiations.
<P>
	I hope the hon. gentleman would use his good offices in a 
constructive manner to encourage the provinces, which have the 
jurisdiction in a number of the areas to which he has referred, to 
co-operate constructively with the Government of Canada so we 
can make progress in a reasonable timeframe toward greater 
internal trade freedom.
<P>
	It is an anomaly when there are more internal trade restrictions 
within Canada than there are between Canada and some foreign 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	Specifically on the issue of our trade performance, I am happy to 
report the most recent statistics indicate our agri-food exports have 
now surpassed $17.4 billion worth. We are well on our way to the 
$20 billion target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows he can attribute that to higher 
commodity prices and if the prices drop he will fall far below his 
targets. The minister is not a farmer and with the way he sucks and 
blows at the same time it is good he is not a veterinarian either.
<P>
	Let us try another tact. The United States has launched a NAFTA 
challenge against Canadian tariffs on supply managed goods. 
Hopefully we will win this dispute, but in the long term and in the 
interest of reaching his goal the roadblock must be removed in 
order for dairy and poultry industries to gain access to the U.S. 
market. He can be certain the-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Will the minister recognize the Americans 
will eventually gain access to our markets? For the benefit of the 
industry, knowing that freer trade will be forced upon them, will 
the minister have a plan to reach his export targets by allowing the 
supply managed industries to access U.S. markets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, buried in this series of questions is 
an ongoing attack by the Reform Party against institutions like the 
Canadian Wheat Board and against marketing systems like supply 
management.
<P>
	We are vigorously defending the Canadian supply management 
system because we believe our position is legally correct as a 
matter of trade law, because supply management over the last 25 
years has served Canadians, both producers and consumers, very 
well, and because we undertook to Canadian agriculture that we

based economy. It was shown at the Cotonou Francophone Summit 
that Quebec has the expertise in developing francophone contents 
destined for the information highway.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister intend, at his meeting with his French 
counterpart scheduled for next week, to promote the key role of 
Quebec in this sector and to draw the attention of the French Prime 
Minister to this expertise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is what we did in Cotonou in our presentation before 
all heads of government and heads of state of francophone 
countries.
<P>
	There was a demonstration in which Canadians showed that we 
can use the Internet in both languages, English and French. This 
demonstration was put on by Canadian technicians using Canadian 
products, to my great pride. People could thus see that here in 
Canada we can work in English and in French, something that other 
francophone countries want to be able to do in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the Cotonou Summit, Canadian expertise was indeed 
recognized: the technique came from New Brunswick, but the 
content came from Quebec.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister therefore undertake to see that, should 
multimedia development agreements be signed with France, 
Quebec's expertise with respect to content will be recognized and 
given a significant role to play?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member has just taken the words right out of my 
mouth. It was New Brunswick and Quebec together who succeeded 
in showing the Francophonie how to go about it.
<P>
	In this sector, there is expertise in Quebec, and there is also 
expertise in New Brunswick and in Ontario; that is what Canada is 
all about. We have francophones in Canada who have to work in 
both languages and who can modify any American program in the 
field for use in French.
<P>
	It was with great pride that I was able to demonstrate this to 
member countries of the Francophonie, all of whom have English 
speaking neighbours, such as in Africa, and who wanted to benefit 
from the expertise of Quebec, of New Brunswick and of Ontario. 
We will continue this promotion and show that Canada is a country 
that can run well.

recently the Minister of Natural Resources was before the standing

that Quebec refuses to allow Labrador to wield power through its

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I have explained to the hon. member on a number

question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The credibility of the Chief of Staff, General Jean Boyle, is once 
again questioned by the Somalia inquiry commission.
<P>
	Indeed, the general claimed he was informed of the falsification 
of documents last September 22, when in fact he may have known 
about it as early as September 15. The general is also said to have 
signed 68 falsified documents. Worse still, he is even said to have 
met with the department's former director of public relations to 
discuss an eventual testimony before the inquiry commission.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that General Boyle signed the 
same falsified documents as Colonel Haswell but got away with it, 
while Colonel Haswell is facing several charges? Is there a double 
standard in military justice?

Development.
<P>
	Many Canadians with disabilities are frightened and concerned 
that they have fallen through the cracks of government policy. 
Previously programs in support of disability employment measures 
were primarily the responsibility of and were co-ordinated by 
various federal government initiatives.
<P>
	Under the new employment insurance regime persons with 
disabilities must have a previous attachment to the labour force to 
be eligible for training.
<P>
	What is the government's responsibility to unemployed 
Canadians with disabilities and what does the minister envision his 
personal role to be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will know I 
am appearing before the committee this afternoon which is charged 
by the House of Commons with matters relating to Canadians with 
disabilities.
<P>
	With respect to the question of funding, as the hon. member 
knows, the Government of Canada in the speech from the throne 
and on a number of occasions has indicated its intention to 
withdraw from the area of manpower training.
<P>
	One thing we will have to determine in our conversations with 
representatives of the disabled community is how we can achieve 
the objective demanded of us by the provinces to withdraw from 
labour training but still ensure persons with disabilities are taken 
care of, as well they should be and as I believe they should be.
<P>
	When the hon. member asks me how I envision the 
responsibility of the Minister of Human Resources Development, it 
is our responsibility as a national government to make sure those 
individuals who need assistance, help and support receive it. In our 
negotiations with the provinces we will ensure that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, persons with disabilities and groups representing persons 
with disabilities feel orphaned and vulnerable and have felt that 
way for some time. They feel that perhaps the minister's 
department does not have the same commitment to persons with 
disabilities that he obviously has.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	If Canada is not to become a patchwork of standards as it relates 
to persons with disabilities, federal leadership is absolutely 
necessary. That leadership has been exemplary for the last 15 or 20 
years. We have been world leaders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	As the minister stated, the Canada Health and Social Transfer 
Act devolves responsibility to the provinces. Will the minister 
assure the House that he will use his office to ensure that disability 
related concerns are placed on the agenda at the forthcoming first 
ministers' conference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we have to be very 
careful when we speak. Whether they are Canadians with 
disabilities or not, one has to recognize that Canada, as a 
federation, is very much a patchwork.
<P>
	Provinces deliver the educational programs made available to 
Canadians whether they have disabilities or not. The same thing 
applies to health programs, rehabilitation programs and vocational 
training programs.
<P>
	I understand and I hope that we will be able to find a mechanism, 
in co-operation and consultation with the disabled community, that 
will allow us to maintain that national visibility, and make sure that 
these problems are addressed.
<P>
	The community affected by the changes taking place will also 
have to make its voice heard by the provincial premiers and their 
governments. It should not keep coming to the Government of 
Canada looking for leadership when the services are being 
delivered to a very large degree by the provinces, as has been the 
case in the past. We have to make sure we are all working 
co-operatively to try to find appropriate solutions for the disabled 
community, and for that matter for all Canadians who have needs in

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Secretary of State responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development in Quebec.
<P>
	On several occasions, the City of Saint-Hubert made 
representations to the minister, including one for the obtention of a 
fund to promote and maintain employment in the region. We now 
know that the closing of the land force command headquarters and 
of the other facilities in Saint-Hubert will result in the loss of 1,400 
jobs.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if his government intends to 
provide a fund to promote and maintain employment in the region, 
to make up for the negative impact of this closure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did have 
an opportunity to meet the mayor and some officials of 
Saint-Hubert, regarding the closure  of the base. A number of 
facilities have been closed across Canada, and it is essentially up to 
the Department of National Defence to ensure that everything is 
done in a normal and appropriate fashion for the communities 
concerned.
<P>
	During my last meeting with the mayor of Saint-Hubert, I told 
him we would set up a local investment fund of about $1 million. 
This investment fund, to be used exclusively to restructure local 
economic interests, seemed acceptable. Other matters were also 
raised by the mayor of Saint-Hubert, including payments in lieu of 
taxes and the fixed assets involve. All these issues are being settled 
the way they are elsewhere in Canada, with a corporation taking 
charge of the infrastructures.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, $1 
million is almost a joke. Why is the minister saying he is giving $1 
million, considering the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency did 
not hesitate to grant a $7.5 million fund to make up for the closing 
of the Cornwallis base, in Nova Scotia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, closures 
were made all over the country. Each case was reviewed on its own 
merits. We took into consideration the location of each base, as 
well as the impact of its closure on the whole community.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Saint-Hubert is in a very good location, close to Montreal. The 
investment fund of $1 million which we are setting up will fully 
serve the needs of the community and will greatly help it face the 
minor economic impact that may result from the closing of the 
military base.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

people. At any given time 15 negotiations are taking place, from 
the Micmacs of Nova  Scotia to the Northwest Territories, as well 
<P>

as the B.C. treaty process. These negotiations tend to have a life of 
their own.
<P>
	Within the last couple of months many encouraging things have 
happened. The municipalities will sign an agreement with First 
Nations in Calgary on Monday. This will be a first in Canada. 
Aboriginal recognition day is to be celebrated June 21. These are 
people.
<P>
	The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which is composed 
of people, is entering into an agreement with the First Nations of 
New Brunswick, as is the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 
Saskatchewan. Business organizations from Montreal are meeting 
in Kahnawake with the Kahnawake Mohawks in two months. They 
had the biggest meeting they have ever had with the aboriginal 
people in Montreal just a couple of months ago.

<P>
	While the grain terminals cut costs, CN Rail, the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the Prince Rupert Port Corporation have failed to 
provide a competitive, efficient service that would see more grain 
going through Prince Rupert.
<P>
	Why has the government which is responsible for the Canadian 
Wheat Board, the Prince Rupert Port Corporation and the new 
Canadian Transportation Act failed to implement efficiencies that 
would keep Canada's closest grain terminal to the Pacific rim open 
for business?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the principal difficulty affecting 
Prince Rupert this year is a common difficulty that is affecting all 
Canadian grain ports and that is, quite frankly, a shortage of supply.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman will remember that a couple of years ago the 
predicament was exactly the opposite with a huge volume of grain 
and congestion in the grain handling and transportation system.
<P>
	The good news in this situation is that supply and demand have 
become far more balanced. It is far more favourable from the 
farmers' point of view. The volumes in Canada at the present time 
are lower than they have been historically. In fact, around the world 
grain supplies are probably at a 20-year low. As a result of that, 
prices have increased dramatically to the farmer's advantage.
<P>
	The difficulty facing Prince Rupert is that grain supplies are 
lower now than they have been in a long time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is talking about a lot of things, except freight rates, port 
costs and a few other things which are contributing to this.
<P>
	Individuals in Prince Rupert are being laid off. Farmers continue 
to be brow-beaten by this inflexible government. The ministers of 
agriculture and transport should make the changes necessary to 
improve transportation so that grain will continue to move through 
the port.
<P>
	Why is the government making working Canadians and Prince 
Rupert pay the price for a government controlled uncompetitive 
grain transportation system?
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, whatever the marketing system, if 
the grain supplies are low and the volume of grain is simply not 
there to move, there is nothing that either the government or the 
opposition can do to magically increase the volume.
<P>
	I would point out that we are anticipating a good production 
season in 1996. We anticipate Canadian grain volumes will be 
substantially improved. With prices in the world, that is once again 
good news for farmers.
<P>
	Recently the House enacted amendments to the legislation 
pertaining to transportation generally, and grain transportation in 
particular. Those changes in legislation should improve the 
regulatory system to make sure that we are evolving toward a 
system that is faster and cheaper and more efficient and one in 
which the benefits are fairly shared among farmers, shippers and 
the railways.

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Who came in first?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> The NDP came first. He will also be aware that the 
premiers of the western provinces have asked that he withdraw 
from the GST harmonization scheme.
<P>
	Will he now recognize that this is the wrong course to take, 
follow the advice of the western premiers and pull out of that GST 
harmonization scheme?
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I should quote from Robert Shepherd, a columnist for the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> referring to what has been done. I do not often 
quote from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``Sure the feds are using other 
provinces' tax revenues to ease the harmonization clause for New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, just as they did to top 
up Ontario's coffers when the floor dropped out of its tax base 
during the 1991 recession or Alberta's when energy prices fell 
suddenly''.
<P>
	He could have gone to talk about the support the federal 
government provided western grain farmers in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba when they required help.
<P>
	Let me simply say national unity is not helped with provincial 
premiers engaged in empty fed bashing or attacking other 
provinces. National unity is helped when the country recognizes 
the regions come together to help each other.

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week Canada is celebrating Environment Week. 
While we take this time every year to acknowledge the importance 
of a healthy environment to Canadians, this year we also take pride 
in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Department of the 
Environment. Therefore it is both a time to reflect on our successes 
as a nation and take stock of the challenges that still confront 
communities across Canada.
<P>
	There is a very simple equation we must understand. A healthy 
environment will add to the health of our families and 
communities, while an unhealthy environment will hurt us all.
<P>
	Pollution Probe states that 6 per cent of all respiratory 
admissions to Canadian hospitals are smog related. Doctors and 
health practitioners in urban areas tell us smog and air pollution 
cause increased health problems to heart and respiratory disease 
sufferers.
<P>
	Yesterday in the air summit organized by the government of 
metropolitan Toronto this was very clear. It also costs our health 
care system over a billion dollars a year, conservatively, for these 
respiratory ailments. Polluted drinking water has an even more 
noticeable cause and effect.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	So is it not time we all started making healthy choices for our 
environment and for ourselves? All Canadians and all levels of 
government need to subscribe to strong national standards of 
environmental quality for all Canadians in all regions of this great 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After all, what we are really talking about is making a choice for 
healthy neighbourhoods; a choice for clean water to drink; a choice 
for beaches where our children can swim; and a choice for clean 
air.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a choice we have to work for. It is a choice in lifestyle, a 
choice in how we recycle and reuse. It involves how we get to work 
as well as how we work, and of course how we use our resources to 
promote our economy without sacrificing a renewable resource and 
source of jobs and wealth for our citizens.
<P>
	Everyday Canadians are making those choices and there are a 
great many individuals among us who are working to promote a 
healthier Canadian environment. A few of those individuals are 
with us today in the public gallery who moments ago the House and 
the Chair recognized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, I have the pleasure of announcing the winners of 
Canada's Healthy Environment Awards. We had over 200 
nominees this year, all of whom have shown a dedication to the 
environment which is quite remarkable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Of course I cannot mention them all by name, but they range in 
age from their teens to their seventies. They are both municipal and 
corporate leaders as well as students and teachers. To give an idea 
of the kinds of achievements we are celebrating here today, let me 
point briefly to the youth leadership winners.
<P>
	Thirteen-year old Jean-Dominic Lévesque-René of Quebec has 
worked hard to promote awareness about the link between 
pesticides and cancer, while secondary student Sara McEachern 
from British Columbia helped produce a video about what children 
can do to save planet earth. These are but two examples of the 
choices young Canadians have made to improve Canada's 
environment.
<P>
	The environmental citizens we honour today, the environmental 
patriots really, have proven that irrespective of their walks of life 
all Canadians are empowered to make an individual contribution to 
a healthier and more sustainable environment.
<P>
	We talk in the House about all the things government should do 
for the environment but we tend to forget that it is the individual 
who often makes the critical difference. Without great fanfare or 
publicity they do it quietly, powerfully and effectively. They are 
people who take responsibility for their neighbourhoods and 
ultimately their country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3494"> 3494 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments must therefore do their part to promote this brand 
of environmental citizenship. The House will be dealing with a 
number of important environmental concerns in the coming days 
and months, not the least of which will be a revitalized Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, the main tool box Canada has at 
its disposition in terms of controlling what goes in our air and in 
our water.
<P>
	There is also endangered species legislation which Canadians 
tell us constantly at all levels is important to preserve because of 
the animals and plants we care about. If we do not take care of them 
we are not taking care of ourselves.
<P>
	We are also maintaining the international leadership Canada has 
been able to forge worldwide, which means honouring our 
commitments and taking leadership roles on issues such as climate 
change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will also continue our environmental partnership with the 
United States and Mexico in a meeting of the Commission for 
Environmental Co-operation in Toronto at the end of June.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In many ways our environment goes straight to the heart of what 
makes us a nation. Our respect and love for the land and sea is part 
of our national and natural heritage. It is a source of national pride 
and it continues to attract people from all corners of the globe. 
Consequently we must plan for the future in order to protect this 
irreplaceable resource.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said the environment must become one of 
the major priorities for this government as we prepare for the 21st 
century.
<P>
	Please join me in congratulating some of the Canadians with us 
here today who are helping to make that pledge a reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to rise in this House today to recognize Environment Week.
<P>
	I agree with the Minister of the Environment that it is important 
to draw attention to the success stories of individuals and 
corporations that have understood how vital it is for our common 
future that we protect and enhance our biophysical environment.
<P>
	Like the minister, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> noted yesterday the 
outstanding contribution to the cause of the environment of 
individuals like David Suzuki, NGOs like Greenpeace and 
Pollution Probe, and corporations like Cascade.
<P>
	For my part, I would like to recognize the contribution made by 
all those who, while they may not win a prize for it, make sure, on a 
daily basis, to reduce their energy consumption, to recycle and to 
buy fewer overpackaged products, in a word, to act in a way that 
respects the integrity of the natural environment they feel 
responsible for.
<P>
	I am confident that, in the near future, these Canadians and 
Quebecers will succeed in imposing their wishes and values on the 
government as well as on those corporations still refusing to make 
the environment a priority.
<P>
	On the one hand, I share the minister's hopes to see 
environmental citizenship develop among Canadians and 
Quebecers of all ages. On the other hand, I must dissociate myself 
from him, when he talks about the most effective means to achieve 
our common goal.
<P>
	In his speech, the minister referred to the 25th anniversary of 
Environment Canada. While it is true that, since it was established, 
this department has contributed to the protection of the 
environment, we must nevertheless recognize that what it has done 
mainly is cause a great deal of duplication and overlap, much as the 
minister stubbornly denies it. But interference by the federal 
government has been condemned time and time again by 
successive Quebec governments, along with the inefficiencies it 
causes and, more importantly, the lack of respect for regional 
uniqueness it reflects.
<P>
	Documents, such as the environmental framework entitled 
<I>Cadre de référence sur le partage des rôles et responsabilités entre 
Québec et le gouvernement fédéral en matière d'environnement et 
de faune</I> published by a certain Liberal government in August of 
1994, show the negative impact of overlap on the management of 
government responsibilities with regard to the environment.
<P>
	In his speech, the minister referred to the future Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act and to the endangered species 
legislation he intends to introduce in this House by next year.
<P>
	I hope that the minister has learned from past mistakes and that, 
in an effort to better protect our health and our natural heritage, he 
will consider the comments humbly submitted to him by the 
official opposition as well as by provincial governments, including 
that of Quebec, which fear another federal attempt to unilaterally 
impose its will on the provinces, which already play a credible role 
in this area.
<P>
	The recent conference of federal and provincial environment 
ministers gives us some hope that Ottawa may adopt a new, more 
flexible approach.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is happy to see the positive results of that 
conference, including an action plan on climatic change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3495"> 3495 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, the minister's recent comments before the standing 
committee on the environment suggested that the CCME was no 
longer a useful working tool for the federal government.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to add that, in 1996, no government, 
department, business leader or other decision maker should ignore 
his or her responsibilities or, even worse, hurt the cause of the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Each decision must therefore be made in light of its impact on 
the delicate balance of our global environment. The health of our 
children and of all future generations is at stake.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to respond today to the environment 
minister's statement on Environment Week.
<P>
	Our environment is very important. It continues to top opinion 
polls as one of the most important subjects to British Columbians 
and I think to all Canadians who are very proud of our environment 
in Canada. We want to make sure that our healthy environment is 
maintained.
<P>
	As has been pointed out, a healthy environment also leads to a 
healthy economy. Certainly anything we can do to enhance our 
economy, look after our economy, as well as look after our 
environment is a tremendous tag team approach. That is important 
to our whole country.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are very proud of their land. They 
have a very close association with the land. Canadians are proud 
when visitors to our country comment on our clean streets, our 
clean water, our clean surroundings. Our visitors are envious of our 
environment and we have a tremendous responsibility to make sure 
it is maintained.
<P>
	Living very close to the Canada-U.S. border as I do, I often hear 
comments from our American visitors who come up to admire 
Cultus Lake and other clean bodies of water in my riding. They are 
very pleased to visit Canada. It is a tremendous tourist attraction to 
have a clean environmental record.
<P>
	Canadians themselves are to be congratulated on maintaining a 
high level of environmental awareness and environmental 
excellence. This has been achieved through hard work on behalf of 
most Canadians who share that concern.
<P>
	The minister mentioned that his department received over 200 
nominees for the Canadian Healthy Environment Awards. I was 
exceptionally proud to see a group from my own riding as one of 
those nominees. Student representatives as well as the kitchen crew 
from Kent Elementary School in Agassiz, B.C. were nominated. 
With only 23 candidates from the entire  province, they can be very 
proud to have been nominated for this award.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister forgot to mention that there was a little 
contest on the Hill today for the greenest, most environmentally 
aware parliamentary office. I was very pleased that he gave the 
Reform whip's office the award for the cleanest and most 
environmentally sensitive office on the Hill. I know the minister 
will try harder next year in order to achieve that award for his own 
office.
<P>
	The minister said in his speech that the significance of this week 
is to reflect on our successes. If he was referring to the successes of 
Canadians who have gone the extra mile to make improvements to 
the environment, then he is very correct. The evidence is in the 
environment awards presented to the 200 nominees. However, if he 
was referring just to the successes of his own department, then I 
would argue it was not so obvious. Since assuming power, former 
environment minister Sheila Copps and the present minister have 
talked a good talk about the environment but have not always been 
able to follow through.
<P>
	Sheila Copps, who today is fighting for re-election in Hamilton, 
is clearly embarrassed by her record in her own riding. Whenever 
the issue of the Taro dump comes up, Ms. Copps refuses to 
comment on it. Again last night there was a debate on that subject. I 
think the reason is that for over two years she had a chance as the 
environment minister to do an environmental assessment on the 
Taro dump site and she refused. Today the residents of Hamilton 
are judging her byelection campaign in part on her lack of action in 
that area.
<P>
	As mentioned by the member for Fraser Valley West, in Sydney, 
Nova Scotia the tar ponds are a real problem. They are laden with 
PCBs. Is the minister going to move to clean that up soon? He 
knows the site. He has been there. The talk is right but we need 
some action on the Nova Scotia tar ponds problem. Although we 
are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Department of the 
Environment today, I hope it does not take another 25 years to 
clean up the tar ponds. We have to get moving on it rather than just 
talking about it.
<P>
	Another problem the minister is aware of is off the coast of 
Prince Edward Island. On the ocean floor is the <I>Irving Whale</I> oil 
barge with its 4,000 tonnes of heavy bunker sea fuel oil. Last 
summer the government spent more than $12 million in an attempt 
to lift that barge only to discover that the barge also contained 
6,800 litres of PCBs.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Again, not the current minister but the minister at the time, Ms. 
Sheila Copps, said she did not know that PCBs were on board but 
the operation had to be stopped halfway through. As the member 
for New Westminster-Burnaby and the Reform Party pointed out, 
Ms. Copps had actually tabled a brief in the House  of Commons 
that she did know about this but had not taken it into account before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3496"> 3496 </A></B>
<P>
she started the lifting project. It was really a $12 million failed 
experiment to lift the barge.
<P>
	Today the minister said that a healthy environment will add to 
the health of our families and our communities. I would hope on 
the projects I specifically mentioned the minister will realize that 
those specific sites are making people in that area nervous about 
their health and their communities as well. I hope he will take 
action on those sooner rather than later.
<P>
	The minister also stated that governments must do their part to 
promote the idea of environmental citizenship. He is right. They 
must take part and it must be very much a leadership role. I know 
he is working with the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment to try to reduce the duplication to make sure that 
while the environment is protected, the regulatory mess does not 
become an impediment to environmental clean-ups and to find 
ways to work with the provinces to make sure it happens 
efficiently.
<P>
	I know he has spoken the right words. I hope he will take that 
lead and make sure the agreement between the environment 
ministers actually results in a cleaner environment for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	In closing, let me again congratulate all those who received the 
achievement awards as well as all those who were nominated. 
Through these people we see that actions speak much louder than 
words. I extend my congratulations to them and to the minister for 
initiating and handing out those awards. I wish the best of luck to 
the minister on next year's office award.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As the New 
Democratic Party environment critic, I would like an opportunity 
to respond today as well. I wonder if you would seek unanimous 
consent from the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am pleased to do so. Is there unanimous 
consent to allow the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake to respond?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the will of the House to allow me to say a few 
words today on Environment Week. I congratulate the Minister of 
the Environment for his strong words in support of the environment 
and I congratulate those who this week have been recognized for 
their environmental achievements.
<P>
	There certainly are a great number of people across Canada who 
are actively engaged in environmental projects, activities and 
educational matters. They are doing a great deal to further the 
interests of this planet. I congratulate each and every one of them.
<P>
	A great number of people are concerned about the future of the 
environment, about the future of the  habitat on Earth and indeed 
about the planet itself. They may not have been able to participate 
in local projects or to initiate them, but they want to see those who 
are able to work on environmental matters have the resources to do 
so. They want to see the federal government take the necessary 
action to ensure there is a good strong federal presence on 
environmental issues.
<P>
	I noticed a slight change today in some of the language the 
minister is using. I simply want to take a minute to point out a 
couple of things. Recently the minister has talked about the need 
for a strong federal role on the environment. The other day in 
question period I took the opportunity to congratulate him on his 
stand on a strong federal role. Following the meeting of the 
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, the minister is 
now talking about strong national standards instead of the need for 
a strong federal role. The ministers have begun to talk about 
national standards rather than the presence of the federal 
government in the field.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Members of the public will recognize there is a big difference 
between the need for strong national standards, which we all adhere 
to, and the need for a strong federal role, a governmental presence 
in environmental issues. I can stress that by pointing to a couple of 
specific areas that need some attention, particularly when we look 
at what will be happening in the near future.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development recently issued a report on the review of the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The government response 
to the CEPA review fell short of expectations.
<P>
	The amendments to CEPA that the government must put forward 
should be coming forward in the very near future. It is very 
important to people concerned about the environment across 
Canada that the message which was sent to the government by the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development be fulfilled. That message was about the need for a 
strong federal role in dealing with toxic chemicals and other 
regulations under CEPA.
<P>
	On the biotechnology chapter, to actually consider moving 
biotechnology to agriculture from the environment so that those 
who are promoting the business of biotechnology will also be 
charged with enforcing regulatory compliance makes absolutely no 
sense. We have to keep these matters within the context of the 
environment.
<P>
	I do not want to abuse the time the House has given me today 
because I appreciate it very much. I mentioned the Fisheries Act in 
a question the other day. I want to reiterate that to the minister.
<P>
	At the Canadian Environmental Network meeting in Hamilton 
on the weekend, the minister received a strong  statement about the 
federal role in the environment which was signed by 100 
organizations across Canada. I would ask the minister to review, 
support and act on that statement from CEN.

<P>
	The petitioners say that abolishing judicial review for convicted 
lifers under article 745 of the Criminal Code will only serve to 
increase both the human and economic costs of the criminal justice 
system and increase public fear and misconceptions about crime 
among the Canadian public.

automatic release and is actually carried out by a jury made up of 
members of the community. They say that if there are concerns that 
the individual under review poses a risk of committing violence in 
the community, that person is not released.
<P>

of article 745 and to launch a concerted public education campaign

rose on May 27, 1996 and I do so today with respect to Question 
Q-19, a question on the Order Paper for over 45 days, since I tabled 
it on March 6.
<P>
	Yesterday, I met the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in 
committee, he appeared to be very  knowledgeable when answering 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3499"> 3499 </A></B>
<P>
my questions. Since this is a question that relates directly to his 
area of responsibility, it does not take a rocket scientist and 200 
officials to research it.
<P>
	I would simply like to know if, in the past five years, there 
existed-within the Privy Council, the Department of the Solicitor 
General of Canada, or elsewhere in the federal government-an 
emergency measures co-ordinating unit, and if so, who and what 
are its past and present members, budget meeting dates, and 
subjects of discussion at each meeting? Has this unit drawn up 
plans for emergency situations or not, and, if so, what are those 
plans?
<P>
	This sort of thing, in a department that spends millions of 
dollars, ought to be easy enough to answer quickly.
<P>
	I ask the government opposite when it will answer my question. 
These questions are easily answered. Millions of dollars were spent 
on the referendum, and on Canadian unity. Surely they can 
calculate figures and do accounts. They should be able to answer 
such simple questions.
<P>
	I warn the representative of the Liberal government, that I will 
ask this question every week. Perhaps that will not please the 
minister before me, the member for Hull-Aylmer. Perhaps you do 
not find it pleasing because some of the money was spent while you 
were Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Perhaps we should find out how you spent this money, and how 
much you spent in Quebec. Answer the questions, if you have 
nothing to hide. Instead of answering me directly, while your 
microphone is not on and we cannot hear your stupid remarks-

is available. We are attempting to get the information clarified and 
it is certainly our hope to provide the information to the member as 
soon as it becomes available.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government for its regressive research 
and development policies in regard to Quebec, in particular its unilateral 
decision to cut the federal contribution of $7.2 million planned for the Canadian 
Centre for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

my 20-minute period with the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The non-votable motion put forward by the official opposition 
for debate today is about research and development.
<P>
	For a few years, the Bloc Quebecois has been deploring the fact 
that Quebec is being underfinanced by the federal government in 
the area of research and development. Year after year, the figures 
clearly show that Quebec does not receive its fair share of the 
money invested in research and development by the federal 
government. More recently, the latest round of federal cuts has 
widened the gap, especially the federal government's withdrawal 
from the only major scientific project in Quebec, the Varennes 
tokamak project.
<P>
	My motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government for its regressive research 
and development policies in regard to Quebec, in particular its unilateral 
decision to cut the federal contribution of $7.2 million planned for the Canadian 
Centre for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to set the record straight on a completely erroneous 
piece of information often used by the Minister of Natural 
Resources in answering the official opposition's questions. In fact, 
my colleague from Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies pointed this out to 
the House this afternoon during statements by members just before 
question period.
<P>
	When the minister compares Quebec's share with that of the 
other provinces, she never includes the amounts allocated to the 
national capital region, almost all of which is located in Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3500"> 3500 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look a little more closely at this situation, in light of a 
study done by the Quebec Ministry of Industry, Trade, Science 
and Technology on federal spending in research and development.
<P>
	Between 1979 and 1991, six out of ten provinces were 
overfinanced, Ontario, of course, coming out ahead with a $3 
billion surplus.
<P>
	During the same period, Quebec was seriously underfinanced by 
$2.5 billion, followed by Alberta with $1.5 billion, British 
Columbia with $369 million, and Saskatchewan with $124 million. 
In the last few years, however, the situation has been getting a little 
better in Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta.
<P>
	The most common indicator showing how intensive the research 
and development effort was is the ratio of net domestic R and D 
expenditures to gross domestic product.
<P>
	On that score, if the federal government had been fair, this ratio 
would have been 1.82 per cent, instead of 1.71 per cent in 1991.
<P>
	Research and development funding is usually divided between 
intra- and extra-mural expenditures.
<P>
	On the subject of intra-mural expenditures, that is to say 
expenditures for federal laboratories, the study showed that, for 
one thing, only 13.8 per cent of intra-mural expenditures went to 
Quebec, compared to 57.7 per cent to Ontario.
<P>
	The high concentration of federal laboratories in the Ottawa 
region only partly explains why Ontario received such a large share 
of the funding. In the areas of natural science and engineering, the 
federal government has been carrying out more intra-mural 
research outside of Ottawa, but still within Ontario, than in any of 
the four other major regions of Canada, namely Quebec, British 
Columbia, the prairies and Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is also estimated that, between 1963 and 1991, Quebec lost, in 
intra-mural funding alone, more than $5.3 billion in 1991 dollars.
<P>
	In addition, in 1991, the relative scarcity of federal research and 
development laboratories in Quebec translated into a shortage of 
more than 2,230 person-years, or eight times the combined staff 
level of the Biotechnology Research Institute and the Industrial 
Materials Institute, two of the main federal laboratories in the 
Montreal area.
<P>
	Finally, as regards assistance to businesses, or extra-mural 
expenditures, the study concluded that, with its $32 million deficit, 
Quebec was the only province to have incurred in 1991 a 
significant deficit in terms of federal industrial research and 
development expenditures.
<P>
	There is an unmistakable connection between the location of 
federal research facilities and the allocation of federal business. It 
is therefore little wonder that, over  the 1979-1990 period, Ottawa 
businesses were awarded more contracts and that the annual 
amounts paid to each of them for federal research and development 
work were much higher than anywhere else.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	A June 1995 study commissioned by the INRS, Quebec's 
national institute for scientific research, came to similar 
conclusions. The authors of the study also pointed out that only 25 
of the 156 federal laboratories in Canada are located in Quebec. 
This means 16 per cent of them, compared to 62 per cent for 
Ontario, or a 40 per cent difference. Laboratories in Quebec only 
employ 3,002 of the 22,360 scientists and technicians working in 
federal facilities, barely 13.4 per cent of the total, compared to 49 
per cent for Ontario.
<P>
	The authors of the study also pointed out that, since 1980, the 
Government of Canada has been favouring the advanced 
technology sector. The effect of this policy is that the four federal 
laboratories in Quebec simply do not compare with the new ones in 
Ontario and Manitoba. For example, a huge federal facility 
employing 2,227 researchers in the nuclear energy sector was set 
up in Ontario, while another one employs 925 people in Manitoba. 
There is simply no comparison with the situation in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec's largest laboratory was established in the airspace 
sector. It employs 268 people, while another facility located in 
Ottawa recruited 297 people. It would have been much simpler to 
centralize, for once, the aerospace industry in a single Quebec 
location.
<P>
	A new communication and information techniques facility hired 
180 people in Quebec, but three similar laboratories located in 
Ottawa employ 566 people. The authors of the study also indicated 
that the proportion of contracts awarded in Quebec under the 
federal contracting out policy went down from 21.6 per cent to 13 
per cent over a period of about 20 years ending in 1994.
<P>
	Since 1985, this proportion never exceeded 15.5 per cent. In fact, 
barely 4 per cent of Quebec companies active in research and 
development get federal contracts in the science and technology 
sector. In Canada, there does not seem to be money available for 
science, research and knowledge. Yet, these will be the keys to 
success in the 21st century. By contrast, the federal government can 
afford to spend over $7 million on flags and kites, as pointed out 
yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	I ask the government to reread the letter written by the president 
of the Canadian Association of Physicists, Mr. Vincett. Before 
concluding, I will read a few excerpts of his letter. In reference to 
the background, Mr. Vincett writes:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3501"> 3501 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Your government has consistently stressed the importance of 
science and technology to Canada's economic future. You have 
kept cuts to the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council 
to a level less than that suffered by many agencies. More recently, 
your government's report `Science and Technology for the New 
Century' has again emphasized the critical role of science and 
technology''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In reference to the issue, the president says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Recent deficit reduction efforts have obliged Natural 
Resources Canada to concentrate on its core mandate which is not 
of course science and technology. Yet the budget which supports 
science of broad national importance has not been transferred to 
Industry Canada. As a result, major national science facilities will 
lose their funding. This together with the likely effects on the 
university research infrastructure of cuts to the transfer payments 
and the significant closures which are occurring as a result of cuts 
to the national science and engineering research council place your 
entire science and technology strategy at serious risk and endanger 
the future health of the economy as we move into a knowledge 
based world''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In reference to the importance of basic science, Mr. Vincett 
writes:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The threatened damage to Canada's basic effort will be a 
disaster for future economic growth since basic science is the 
foundation upon which most technological and economic advances 
depend. As the chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia said in 1994: 
`Public support for science-is one of the very few categories of 
government spending that deserves to be increased-studies have 
shown conclusively that the overall return to society from 
investment in knowledge creation is extremely high'''.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The solution proposed by the president is the following:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``This issue transcends individual government departments. 
Unlike most of the developed world, Canada does not have a 
co-ordinated policy for the establishment, operation and closure of 
national scientific facilities. As a result, actions in one department 
can have a devastating effect on programs in another. I strongly 
urge you to establish an expert committee to report to  you quickly 
on what such a co-ordinated policy should contain''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It would be in the interest of the ministers who received a copy 
of this letter, and the Prime Minister, to read it over again, to make 
sure Canada is not headed for an even worse economic future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you may be sure that if the official opposition has decided 
to dedicate one of its opposition days to research and development, 
it is because we have very serious reasons for wanting to see 
corrective action taken. I hope that the Minister of Natural 
Resources, who we just heard is going to take part in the debate, 
will understand fully the gravity of the situation.
<P>
	Before going into detail, I know that my colleague, the member 
for Verchères, will give a complete picture of the discrimination 
being suffered by the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion, since, 
as you know, the government is getting ready to close down 
unilaterally what is undoubtedly one, if not the, major natural 
sciences facility in Quebec.
<P>
	I hope that the minister will take advantage of this debate to 
honour a commitment she made when she appeared before the 
natural resources sub-committee, and give a solemn undertaking to 
find alternative funding, because that is the solution.
<P>
	We can understand that the government must put its fiscal house 
in order. But why is it that for decades now-in fact, it started with 
the creation of the National Research Council of Canada in the 
1950s-Quebec has systematically and consistently lost out when 
it comes to research and development?
<P>
	So that it is very clear what we are talking about during the 
debate, I would like to propose that we define research and 
development as work that is creative in nature and that is carried 
out in a systematic fashion in order to increase the stock of 
knowledge or devise new applications for this knowledge.
<P>
	Why is research and development so important and why have all 
industrialized countries that have taken charge of their 
development been concerned with having a rigorous and consistent 
policy, which incidentally is not the case for Canada, which, as we 
speak, still has no systematic research and development policy? 
Unbelievably, its policy is completely ad hoc.
<P>
	Research and development is important because it adds to 
knowledge, and it adds to value added, obviously enabling us to 
establish links with the important export sector.
<P>
	It is nonetheless very obvious that Canada's research and 
development performance is very weak, and I am anxious to hear 
what the Minister of Natural Resources has to say about this, 
because all industrialized countries do R and D. On average, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3502"> 3502 </A></B>
<P>
industrialized countries devote 2.3 per cent of their GDP to 
research and development policies or investments.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Imagine, for a few years already, Canada has been stagnating 
with investments amounting to 1.5 per cent. Simply put, of all 
industrialized countries, only Italy, Iceland and Ireland show a 
worse performance than Canada. Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, the 
United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Finland, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and Austria perform 
better than Canada with regard to R &amp; D.
<P>
	What is worrisome and should bring Quebec ministers to spring 
into action is the systemic discrimination against Quebec regarding 
R &amp; D. Some would say that, looking at the system as a whole, 
there might be some discrepancies in certain sectors, which is 
acceptable.
<P>
	But who in the government, which minister is going to be frank 
and lucid enough to explain to us how it is that there is a four 
billion dollar a year difference between investments made by the 
federal government in a province like Ontario and its investments 
in Quebec? How can that be explained?
<P>
	I know that the Minister of Natural Resources will be at a loss to 
explain this. How can she explain that, year in and year out, there 
are between 25 and 30 federal research laboratories in Quebec and 
close to 80 in Ontario? Are there factors we should know about 
which could explain this state of affairs?
<P>
	I will give you more precise numbers to show that, if the official 
opposition has decided to talk about R &amp; D, it is not on a whim, it is 
not because we think that this is only a bad stretch we have to go 
through.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources, who is the most incendiary 
of all ministers in this government, must be aware of the 
discrimination Quebec has been the victim of for the last three 
decades. The government's systematic interventions and policies in 
this respect started in the 1950s and have been going on now for 
three, almost four decades.
<P>
	It found a way to concentrate most of its investments in what the 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata rightly called <I>intra muros</I> 
projects; namely, the federal government spends around seven 
billion dollars on its R &amp; D policies according to two principles. It 
does it in its laboratories, the number of which is estimated at about 
177.
<P>
	The natural resources minister will certainly share the 
indignation I feel when I see that the government did not see fit to 
establish a regional development policy in the area of research and 
development. Had it been serious, it would have ensured that 
Atlantic Canada, western Canada, Ontario and Quebec could 
benefit equally from investments in R and D.
<P>
	I understand this is not a mathematical question. But when there 
is a difference such as the one that exists between Quebec and 
Ontario, a difference supported by the government, what are we to 
think? I challenge the minister. When we analysed the merits of the 
Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion project, which involved 
Hydro-Quebec and the Institut national de la recherche 
scientifique, what scientist in Quebec would have thought that 
somebody would be foolhardy enough-and I think irresponsible 
would be the right word to use here-to cancel such a project?
<P>
	Everybody agrees that the minister was a brilliant lawyer in the 
past and I challenge her to rise in this House and name one scientist 
in Quebec who supports her decision. The fact is that there are two 
major research and development projects in Quebec: the Canadian 
Space Agency, whose $300 million budget was reduced to about 
$200 million, and the Varennes project.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	It is quite simple: in the area of research and development, 
especially natural sciences, whenever we looked for examples of 
major projects, we had two of them before us: the Canadian Space 
Agency, which was cut, and the project under the responsibility of 
the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	The merits of this project were unanimously recognized, first of 
all, because $70 million was invested in infrastructure and second, 
because 100 researchers with Ph. D.'s in engineering, in physics 
and in other fields that are extremely important to economic 
development were involved.
<P>
	Everyone was in favour. The whole scientific community had 
hopes of a promising future for this project. Then, without warning, 
the government had the nerve to unilaterally and shamelessly cut 
one of Quebec's most promising projects. That is what federalism 
means in the area of research and development: the inability to 
arbitrate, to strike a balance that could have helped Quebec in the 
past and that could still help it today.
<P>
	What corrective measures is the government proposing? In fact, 
the whole history of research and development since the 1950s is a 
history of systemic discrimination against Quebec. Let me say, in 
closing, that only in one program did Quebec play a significant 
role: the Defence Industry Productivity Program or DIPP, which is 
understandable since the Canadian aerospace and aircraft 
manufacturing industries are concentrated in Montreal. Believe it 
or not, this government has the nerve and the chutzpah to dismantle 
this program, so that Quebec is now losing out in all areas of 
research and development.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to respond to the 
comments made by my hon. colleagues on the other side of the 
House.
<P>
	First let me thank my colleague for his reference to me as a 
brilliant lawyer. I believe it is undue flattery as will be revealed in 
the coming minutes. Anyway, I thank him for that.
<P>
	It is an honour for me to be able to respond to the motion by the 
hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. If I understand the 
motion, the hon. member wants to condemn the Government of 
Canada for ``its regressive research and development policies in 
regard to Quebec''. She then goes on to criticize a decision to cut 
the federal contribution to the Canadian Centre for Magnetic 
Fusion in Varennes.
<P>
	I submit that the hon. member does not want, will not look and 
does not want to look at the federal S and T strategy in the broader 
context of what it means for all Canadians. This is obviously the 
hon. member's prerogative.
<P>
	Evidently she is not interested in science and technology policy 
beyond the borders of her home province. Nor does she want to put 
the Government of Canada's spending on science and technology 
in the context of the overall strategy to reduce the deficit. She 
ignores the federal deficit in the same week that her former leader, 
the premier of Quebec, has gone to the investment community of 
New York to tell American investors that his number one 
preoccupation is to cut Quebec's deficit.
<P>
	Perhaps she will take the advice of her former leader, the now 
premier of Quebec, if she will not listen to what we have to say on 
this side of the House. I am certain that the premier of Quebec will 
tell her that deficit reduction requires tough choices. He will tell 
her that she has to assess her priorities. Not every program can 
continue to receive funding if we want to bring the deficit under 
control.
<P>
	I will argue that the federal government cannot provide funding 
for fusion R and D at this time because fusion research does not 
meet our current criteria for funding. There is every indication that 
it will take at least another 30 years of research before energy 
supplies from fusion technology can be realized on a commercial 
basis.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	We have had to make tough choices. We know we have had to 
cut funding for some programs that we would otherwise want to 
maintain. Above all, we have to make strategic decisions on how 
best to invest the $5.5 billion that the Government of Canada 
spends on science and technology.
<P>
	Out of that S and T budget, the Government of Canada spent 
$3.1 billion on research and development initiatives in 1992-93. 
Did Quebec get a fair share of that investment? Did the federal 
government, as the hon. member accuses, implement a regressive 
R and D policy for Quebec? Members will find that Quebec 
received $692 million in federal R and D spending in that year. 
Another $13 million was spent on the Quebec side of the border in 
the national capital region.
<P>
	Taking the national capital region out of the formula, as many 
industrialized countries do in calculating regional distribution of R 
and D spending, we find that the $692 million spent in Quebec 
represents 28 per cent of all spending outside the national capital 
region. I would suggest that is more than fair. More to the point, I 
do not see how the hon. member opposite can complain that the 
federal government has regressive R and D policies with regard to 
Quebec.
<P>
	The amount of $692 million is a very sizeable investment in 
Quebec R and D. It comes from a tax base into which all Canadians 
pay. An independent Quebec would have to come up with a similar 
amount, in addition to its current provincial spending, if it wanted 
to maintain the current level of R and D in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	In addition, members across and all Quebecers should carefully 
consider the investment that the Government of Canada has made 
into new research facilities over the past number of years.
<P>
	Let me cite only a few examples. In 1987 Quebec got the Food 
Research and Development Centre and the Maurice Lamontagne 
Institute. In 1989, it got the space agency, a research agency, I 
believe it is fair to say, of which all Canadians are immensely 
proud. All Canadians were proud to see Canadian astronaut Marc 
Garneau on his second shuttle mission two weeks ago.
<P>
	The true measure of federal investment in R and D is not 
measured even by such major investments as these. It is also 
measured by R and D grants and contracts to industry and 
universities. Quebec receives 30 per cent of that type of funding. In 
addition, Quebec gets a higher than average share of R and D tax 
credits because of the concentration of R and D in that province. 
According to a recent report from Simon Fraser Institute, Quebec 
based firms claimed 41 per cent of all R and D tax credits claimed 
in Canada in 1992.
<P>
	Since 1981 the investment of the federal government in fusion 
research at the Tokamak de Varennes alone has amounted to $90 
million. This investment has helped to develop scientific and 
industrial research in Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government is continuing to fund research and 
development of energy technology in the province. It will be 
primarily, and I have said this in the House before, in areas of 
energy efficiency and renewable energy systems at Varennes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3504"> 3504 </A></B>
<P>
laboratories, which opened  four years ago. This program has an 
annual budget of $6 million and employs approximately 50 people.
<P>
	In nuclear energy, the mandate of Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited is to seek to maintain a viable, competitive business in 
supplying and servicing Candu reactors at a reduced cost to the 
federal government.
<P>
	Electricity generation from Candu nuclear energy technology is 
an economic reality today. Candu is already a success and has a 
good chance of achieving even greater success internationally. 
High technology industries in Quebec will continue to benefit from 
the nuclear industry through contracts developed from Candu sales 
to Korea and through the good performance of the Gentilly-2 
Candu reactor. Consultants' studies show that a typical Candu 6 
sale overseas could bring over $100 million in contracts to Quebec 
and generate about 4,000 person years of employment.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member opposite again; how in light of 
these numbers, in light of these benefits to Quebec, can she make 
the case that the federal government has regressive R and D 
policies for Quebec?
<P>
	Let me broaden the scope of my argument for the benefit of all 
members of the House and put the decision regarding federal 
funding for fusion R and D in the context of overall federal 
priorities and the priorities for federal participation in science and 
technology activities.
<P>
	As all members know, the Government of Canada faces the 
challenge of reducing the deficit in order to manage the debt and 
maintain a stable foundation for new jobs and growth across the 
nation. We are determined to meet our objectives, and as we all 
know, we are making progress toward our objectives.
<P>
	In addition, at this time we are living up to our commitment to 
all Canadians to be fair and compassionate in our decision making 
by putting in place new building blocks for security and prosperity.
<P>
	The criteria that my department is using to determine its 
priorities for research and development activities mirror the overall 
emphasis on jobs and growth in the near term that the federal 
government is focusing on as a whole. Specifically, the energy R 
and D priorities at Natural Resources Canada are sustainable 
development, energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, the 
science of climate change and non-conventional hydrocarbon 
resources.
<P>
	Every thoughtful Canadian who is concerned about the vast 
range of services provided by the federal government and the 
equally vast cost of providing these services knows that the 
government must set priorities and must make difficult decisions. 
That is why this government was elected, to make these decisions, 
to allocate our limited funding accordingly and to take action. The 
federal government must concentrate its  resources on its highest 
priorities and strive for their success.
<P>
	The focus of the federal government is on activities that will 
bring results in the near to medium term. As I noted earlier, 
commercial generation of electricity from fusion is uncertain. 
Assuming that an economically viable technology could be 
developed, it is at least 30 years away.
<P>
	Last March, following extensive consultations with Canadians 
the Government of Canada introduced a science and technology 
strategy that lays the foundation for the decisions we must make in 
prioritizing S and T in Canada.
<P>
	The strategy demonstrates concretely how the federal 
government is getting its house in order so that it will be a better 
partner to the other players in Canada's innovation system, the 
private sector, academic institutions and other orders of 
government. The strategy sets out the Government of Canada's 
priorities in four key areas.
<P>
	First, it defines national goals for science and technology. These 
goals are sustainable job creation and economic growth, improved 
quality of life and advancement of knowledge.
<P>
	Second, it describes the federal government's core S and T 
activities.
<P>
	Third, it outlines a new system of governance within federal 
departments that bring science and technology to the centre of the 
decision making process in cabinet.
<P>
	Finally, the S and T strategy provides operating principles to 
guide federal departments and agencies.
<P>
	Keeping in mind these over-arching principles, let us return to 
the question of energy R and D. Canada is amply endowed with a 
variety of resources for the generation of electricity, including 
hydro, fossil, nuclear and renewable energy sources. We have 
assigned a high priority to research into efficiency gains in the 
current production and use of energy.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	The national fusion program is a good program but it does not 
rank as a high priority in the federal government's overall science 
and technology objectives. Cuts are planned for federal funding for 
fusion research in both Ontario and Quebec. There will also be cuts 
to the basic science program of Atomic Energy Canada Ltd., 
mostly in Ontario.
<P>
	For a number of years the federal government has co-funded 
research and development of fusion, the national fusion program, 
in partnership with Hydro Quebec and Ontario Hydro. Recently the 
annual cost has been $7.2 million for the Quebec part of the 
program and $4.4 million for the Ontario portion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3505"> 3505 </A></B>
<P>
	More than 70 Canadian high technology companies and 6 
universities have benefited and will continue to benefit well into 
the future from the fusion research program. As I mentioned, in 
drawing up the 1996-97 budget the government decided not to 
provide funds for research and development of fusion beyond 
March 1997.
<P>
	The agreements among the partners stipulate one year's notice 
for ending contributions to the program. We have exercised that 
right. This provides for an orderly transition. The other partners 
have a year in which to make adjustments.
<P>
	Hydro Quebec and Ontario Hydro have the option of continuing 
with the program independent of federal funding. Most of the 
industrial and commercial benefits of such work would be in 
Ontario and Quebec. If these provincial utilities consider fusion to 
be a priority it is reasonable to expect that they devote more 
resources to this priority.
<P>
	As I mentioned in committee last week, I have asked my 
officials to facilitate discussions to help the utilities and other 
interested parties during the transition to seek alternative sources 
of funding. I make it clear again this afternoon that there will be no 
more funding from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Taxpayers would like the government to participate in many of 
the outstanding projects which merit public support, but informed 
and concerned taxpayers also know as never before that 
government resources are limited. They elected this government to 
make tough decisions. Our decision to terminate funding for fusion 
R and D is one of those decisions.
<P>
	I believe I have established a solid argument that justifies the 
Government of Canada's decision to terminate federal funding for 
fusion R and D. The government is doing all it can to meet its 
overall priorities of addressing the deficit and improving the 
climate for jobs and growth. Meeting these objectives will provide 
substantial benefits for present and future generations of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We are determined to meet our objectives and we are making 
progress toward our objectives. We have identified clear and 
consistent criteria on near term goals to priorize our spending and 
we are making the tough and necessary decisions keeping us on 
track to meet our deficit reduction targets and, as important, to 
meet our objectives in terms of encouraging jobs and growth.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is making a substantial contribution 
to R and D in Quebec. I do not think anything could be clearer in 
light of the numbers I discussed earlier. Simply put, however, 
fusion does not meet our criteria but we are working on many other 
programs in the province of Quebec and all over the country that do 
meet our S and T criteria.
<P>
	This is not a regressive policy for R and D in Quebec. This is a 
policy with a clear vision to encourage jobs and growth for present 
and future generations of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the minister had to 
say and my conclusion is that she would be well advised to find out 
more about Quebec. It is clear that she has been unable to identify 
accurately the difficulties facing Quebec, and in particular has 
failed to make the comparisons that must be made concerning 
investment in Ontario as opposed to Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I have two questions for her. Is the minister prepared to admit 
that, when Quebec and Ontario are compared, there really is a 
difference between research contracts awarded to federal 
laboratories? Does she agree, and on what figures does she base her 
answer? And if she does not agree, can she tell us why and on the 
basis of what figures? The first department to identify this 
difference was the Quebec Federal Office of Regional 
Development. It funded a study that mentioned a $4 billion 
difference.
<P>
	I think that the minister will have to agree with the official 
opposition's evaluation of R and D spending. Can the minister 
again tell us what she intends to do to find alternative funding, 
which can come from the National Research Council of Canada or 
the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council? These 
are, after all, organizations that give out grants and have budgets of 
close to $400 million.
<P>
	I would like the minister, out of respect for Quebec, for its 
scientific community, and for the R and D deficit it is assuming, to 
rise today in her place and promise, as she did before the 
committee, but to now do so clearly here in the House so that it 
really means something, and so that among our fellow 
parliamentarians we can keep our promises. I would like the 
minister to rise and tell us what she intends to do to find alternative 
funding so that we can save the tokamak facility. This is why we 
are here as the official opposition and I think that we are fulfilling 
our responsibilities. That is the only real way to defend the interests 
of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows since he 
and I have talked about this on numerous occasions, I have 
undertaken to nominate someone from my department who will be 
available to work with other stakeholders, if requested, to find 
alternative funding for the Tokamak fusion project. I made that 
statement in committee last week. It is a policy which we pursue in 
relation to all areas where the federal government is withdrawing, 
changing or restructuring its role, and there is a transition period 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3506"> 3506 </A></B>
<P>
involved. I will nominate that  person. If that person is requested to 
participate in a multi-stakeholder project, so much the better.
<P>
	I have to make it very clear, as I did in committee, there is no 
alternative funding within the federal government for this project.
<P>
	I return to a point I have made before. Fusion research is not 
commercially viable at this point. However, fusion research is 
pursued for commercial applicability and there are some entities in 
this country that stand to gain much more than others if fusion 
research sometime in the future, in the next 30 or 40 years, does 
become commercially viable. Hydro Quebec is one of those 
entities. Ontario Hydro is another.
<P>
	The Canadian taxpayer has incubated fusion research for some 
20 years. The federal government and the Canadian taxpayer have 
spent $90 million incubating fusion research in the province of 
Quebec and some $42 million incubating fusion research in the 
province of Ontario. If fusion is a priority for these two provinces, 
for the two utilities or for other elements of the private sector, I 
suggest Canadian taxpayers have done their part. It is now time for 
others, for whom this research may provide direct economic gain in 
the future, to pick up the shortfall and make fusion research a 
priority.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to return to a point I made in my address, 
which was in reference to the letter from Professor Vincett stating 
that, contrary to all of the evolved countries in the world, Canada 
has not established a co-ordination policy. The professor said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``As a result, action in one department can have a devastating 
effect on programs in another. I strongly urge you to establish an 
expert committee to report to you quickly on what such a 
co-ordinated policy should contain.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	``In the meantime, to avoid unintended damage which could take 
decades to repair I appeal to you to provide at a minimum bridge 
funding to the centres involved until an integrated policy is in place 
or alternate financing has been found. If clear action is not taken in 
the next month or two, the researchers involved will take jobs 
abroad and our investment in most of these programs will be 
irretrievably lost''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Such is the advice of a Canadian expert, the president of the 
Canadian Association of Physicists, which groups together 1,500 
of Canada's top brains.
<P>
	What does the minister have to say in reply? She received a copy 
of the letter, as did the Minister of Finance, as did the Secretary of 
State for Science,  Research and Development, as did the Prime 
Minister, as did the Minister of Industry. What reply can she give 
us on this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for the 
opinions expressed in that letter. Let me reiterate a point I have 
made before in the House. No one is suggesting the science that 
was done at Tokamak was not good science. No one is suggesting 
the people who have done that research are not fine scientists. That 
is not the issue here.
<P>
	The issue is one of the appropriate role of the federal 
government. We need to consider and define that role in the context 
of the fiscal situation in which we find ourselves. Unfortunately it 
is not possible for the government to continue to do everything it 
has done in the past. It has become necessary, perhaps cruelly 
necessary, for the government to make very tough choices and to 
priorize the limited funds we have available.
<P>
	Therefore I return to the priorization of our energy research that I 
outlined in the remarks I made a few minutes ago. We have 
determined our energy R and D priorities within the federal 
government: sustainable development, energy efficiency, 
renewable energy sources, the science of climate change and 
non-conventional hydrocarbon resources.
<P>
	We also have to think about the nation. We are an energy rich 
nation, unlike some others. For example, our friends, the Japanese, 
have very few energy sources. Therefore it would make perfect 
sense for them to pursue research into an area like fusion. They are 
net importers of energy and therefore that becomes an issue of 
national security for them. They want to have within their country 
the means to be secure relating to energy production.
<P>
	Canada is a net exporter of energy, whether it is oil, natural gas, 
hydro. The province of Quebec has tremendous hydro resources. It 
probably has some of the world's best research and development as 
it relates to the production of hydro power. We have wind, solar 
power. We have a wide variety of indigenous energy sources.
<P>
	We need to do more research in relation to those energy sources. 
We need to understand the impacts on the environment of the 
extraction of oil, natural gas. We need to understand the effects of 
the development of hydro dams on surrounding areas, communities 
and indigenous peoples. We need to understand more about how we 
can use energy more efficiently.
<P>
	We are a large nation with a very small population base. We use 
energy intensely to travel, to transport goods and people, to heat 
our homes in the worst conditions of winter. We need to spend a lot 
of our research efforts in relation to energy efficiency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3507"> 3507 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what we have done. Those are the priorities we have 
established based on our strengths and on our challenges. They 
are not the same priorities for other countries that do not have the 
wealth of energy sources that we have.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	We have prioritized our energy research. We have thought long 
and hard about it. It was not capricious nor frivolous. We have to 
maximize the benefit of our limited resources for all Canadians. I 
believe we have done that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the wake of the catastrophic decision by the Minister of 
Natural Resources, namely the closure of one of the most 
outstanding of scientific projects, I would like to know whether the 
minister visited the Varennes installations before making her 
decision.
<P>
	If not, would the minister agree, by asking the MP concerned to 
organize a meeting, to make an on site visit to the tokamak 
installations? Perhaps the minister is one of those people who 
learns best by seeing things, and she needs to actually go there. If 
she goes to the Varennes region and meets the people there, perhaps 
she will change her mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows, based on 
our previous discussions which are always most enjoyable and 
vigorous, that I have not visited the facility, nor do I think it is 
necessary to visit the facility to establish the federal government's 
priorities in relation to energy research.
<P>
	I have outlined why we have established the priorities. Those 
priorities are not based on this facility or that facility. They are 
based upon the energy strengths of the nation and our short to 
medium term energy research needs.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his invitation and hope that 
sometime in the future-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> If it is not closed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Let me just say that the decision rests in the 
hands of those who stand to benefit the most: the province of 
Quebec, Hydro Quebec and private sector companies.
<P>
	To return to the point I made before, we cannot do all things. In 
the present fiscal situation we have had to make difficult choices.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's has expired. Is there 
unanimous consent to allow her to continue?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion presented in the House today, rightfully  draws attention to 
the fact that the government is guilty of yet again of acting against 
Quebec's interests. This time we are talking about inadequate 
funding for research and development in Quebec. The current 
imbalance between Quebec's demographic load and the amount of 
money invested in the province is really indecent. Quebec, 
representing nearly 25 per cent of Canada's population, receives a 
mere pittance from federal department coffers.
<P>
	By way of example, Fisheries and Oceans Canada invests only 
11 or 12 per cent of its research and development budget in 
Quebec. It is the same story with Transport Canada, which invests 
only 17.6 per cent of its research and development money there. 
We could name a host of federal departments, but I think it would 
be appropriate to describe the injustice we currently face in the 
riding of Verchères. I am of course talking about the forward 
looking tokamak project in Varennes.
<P>
	Managed by the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion in 
Varennes, Quebec, this project is vital not only for the people in the 
riding of Verchères, not only for Quebecers, not only for 
Canadians, but for everyone in the world, in the long run.
<P>
	I will explain. You know that the Canadian Centre for Magnetic 
Fusion in Varennes has been trying for a number of years to 
develop a new form of energy that would not negatively impact the 
environment: nuclear fusion.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Within the context of international co-operation the likes of 
which probably have never been seen with countries like Japan, 
Australia, China, the member countries of the European Union, 
Russia, and so on, Canada is a partner, albeit it a very modest one, 
in the development of this form of energy. Since all the work is 
co-ordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication, each research 
centre around the world works on one aspect of the research and 
shares its knowledge with the others.
<P>
	Canada therefore clearly benefits from international expertise in 
this area and from the resultant transfer of technology. 
Withdrawing from nuclear fusion research at this point may mean 
missing the boat when this form of energy starts to be used. This 
form of energy would come from nuclear fusion, not from the 
traditional nuclear fission which produces radioactive waste 
material.
<P>
	For your information, let me tell you that the word ``tokamak'' is 
a contraction of the Russian words for toroidal chamber, which 
refers to the shape of the reactor bearing that name. But, now this 
large scale and forward-looking project, full of promise of a 
pollution-free future, may now disappear, at least in Canada, 
because of a lack of funding and, in fact, of a lack of vision.
<P>
	Indeed, following the last federal budget, the Department of 
Natural Resources, which finances  Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited, which in turn finances the Canadian Centre for Magnetic 
Fusion, announced that after March 1997, it would no longer 
finance this large scale program, cofinanced equally by Hydro--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3508"> 3508 </A></B>
<P>
Québec, the Institut national de la recherche scientifique and, of 
course, Natural Resources Canada.
<P>
	This unilateral decision, without any consultation with the 
interested parties in this project, sends the message that this kind of 
joint project cannot work in Canada. Indeed, how can there be 
partnership or concertation, when one of the parties may withdraw 
at anytime, without warning, without explaining the reasons for its 
withdrawal, without any consultation?
<P>
	The figures involved should be kept in mind. If this decision to 
put an end to the $7.2 million funding is maintained, it will not be 
without consequences. New material for $11 million will never be 
used. Twenty years of development and $70 million infrastructures 
will be wasted. The minister was speaking earlier of an amount of 
$90 million and she was crediting herself with it, but it must be 
understood that the federal government provides 50 per cent of the 
funding for the tokamak project. About 100 direct jobs will be lost, 
over half of them being highly qualified scientific or engineering 
positions, no to mention the indirect jobs generated by the 
Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion.
<P>
	This research centre does not operate in isolation. A study done 
in October 1995 by INRS Urbanisation showed that businesses and 
laboratories had developed new expertise after having been 
awarded contracts with the centre. It seems that 18 small 
businesses in Quebec have developed new high technology 
expertise that they did not have before. They all gained greater 
credibility as corporations following their co-operation with the 
Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion.
<P>
	Let us take one of the numerous examples of the spinoffs that 
co-operation with the centre can generate. One of the small 
corporations which worked with it, Technologies MPB, was 
awarded a $62 million foreign contract thanks to the expertise 
acquired while working on the tokamak project. This is why I find 
it absurd and unreasonable to cut off the funding for such a 
structural project, despite the minister's explanations that these 
cuts come at a time of budgetary constraints.
<P>
	I remind the House that we are discussing a project that costs the 
federal government only $7.2 million, because there are other 
partners. And, speaking of budget cuts, last year, the federal 
government increased its funding to the TRIUMF project in British 
Columbia from $19.3 million to 34.3 million, all federal money.
<P>
	In Ontario this time, the federal government is maintaining the 
same level of funding for the ambitious neutrino research program 
in Sudbury.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	While cutting $7.2 million, in the name of fiscal restraint, from a 
structuring project which is sure to create jobs and generate new 
technologies, the federal government is sinking $10 million worth
<P>
of taxpayers' money in a flag waving campaign. It is going to 
distribute flags and kites while cutting hundreds of jobs in Quebec. 
This is an outrage.
<P>
	I see the minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec. I hope he is taking note of the debate going 
on here today.
<P>
	It is again in Ontario that the development of the CANDU 
reactor is taking place; the economic spinoffs of this project, which 
would be definitely less in Quebec than in Ontario, have not yet 
been established.
<P>
	Fielding questions from the Bloc Quebecois, the minister first 
said, in this House, that Quebec receives over 25 per cent of the 
regional R and D budget. The key word in this is ``regional''. The 
minister is referring to regional expenditures and, believe me, it is 
extremely difficult to understand what is included in this new 
accounting method the minister seems to have invented.
<P>
	Having asked for explanations on numerous occasions, we 
finally learned that expenditures in the national capital region 
appeared nowhere. In fact, it is as if some kind of 11th zone had 
been created, an 11th region, 11th province for which all 
expenditures would be erased. We believe the minister is playing 
with figures dangerously because her method for recording her 
department's expenses shows some intellectual dishonesty and, 
thereby, a total lack of respect for Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	What is certain is that the sums allocated to R &amp; D in Ontario are 
considerably higher than those invested in R &amp; D in Quebec. For 
example, again, a 1993-1994 list of all federal research centres in 
natural sciences and engineering shows that, in the National 
Capital Region, there are 40 centres and 6,138 jobs in Ottawa and 
its suburbs on the Ontario side. Compared to that, only two centres, 
and 111 jobs, are located in Hull.
<P>
	If the Department of Natural Resources reflects the rest of the 
federal government, and we know it does, Quebec is definitely a 
loser in the area of amounts invested on its territory.
<P>
	Fortunately, we have figures that depict a reality quite different 
from that of the minister. The Syndicat des professionnels 
scientifiques of the Institut de recherche en énergie has shown that 
only 17 per cent of the R &amp; D budgets of Natural Resources Canada 
are spent in Quebec.
<P>
	If the department maintains its decision to reduce its share of 
financing and finally brings the Tokamak project to a close, that 
percentage will drop to 12 per cent only. If we include in these 
numbers the budgets of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, 
Quebec's share goes down to  8 per cent and, without the Tokamak 
project, it is reduced to 6 per cent, for a population that represents 
25 per cent of the total population of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	After looking at these numbers, it is easy to understand why such 
a wave of protest came from Quebec. All the people closely or 
remotely involved in the project have shown or have tried to show 
the federal government how illogical its decision was and have 
expressed their frustration and their inability to understand such an 
unacceptable decision from the government.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was the first to ask the minister, in the 
House and in committee, about the reasons of her decision, which 
seems unjustified to us. The Quebec government even passed a 
motion unanimously on this federal decision on April 17.
<P>
	We have seen the Quebec government join the Bloc Quebecois to 
defend this important issue of the Tokamak project in Varennes, 
and even the federal Liberal Association of Verchères riding added 
its voice to ask the federal government to review this nonsensical 
decision. The Quebec and Canadian scientific community, which is 
generally very low-key, also protested against this absurd decision. 
Besides political interventions, we have seen all kinds of groups 
getting involved so the minister would reverse her decision-
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Your time is up. We must now move to 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On a point of order, but I hope it is not a 
request to speak longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would merely need a minute to 
conclude. May I ask for consent to allow me to finish my speech?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to extend the 
hon. member's speaking time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. members for 
allowing me to finish my speech.
<P>
	Several associations, coalitions and municipalities in the riding 
of Verchères also believe that the minister's decision in this case 
defies logic. The scope of protests is striking. All 15 municipalities 
in the Société de développment économique de la Rive-Sud 
unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Canadian Centre 
for Magnetic Fusion.
<P>
	In Varennes, both the Corporation de développement 
économique and city officials passed resolutions supporting the 
tokamak project. Thinking that this sizeable support for the 
continuation of the project had woken up the minister, we were 
delighted to hear her undertake before the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources on May 30, to consider various options to find 
new sources of funding.
<P>
	But yesterday, during question period, the minister seemed to 
indicate that she had not made any commitments. We could not 
believe that the minister would shamelessly go back on her word. 
She must be reminded of how important project tokamak is for 
future generations. That is why we feel the minister must do all she 
can now to correct this decision, this mistake, that her department 
should never have made in the first place.
<P>
	Varennes' tokamak project is one of the few major energy 
development projects in Quebec to which Ottawa contributes. That 
is why the federal government must reconsider, to show that it is 
not totally lacking in vision as far as long term energy development 
is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague spoke very passionately and with solid reasoning 
about the tokamak project. True, we did question the minister at the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources to try to change her 
mind and make her understand that this project was very important 
for both Varennes and Quebec as a whole.
<P>
	When the minister talks about 25 per cent of the research and 
development budget going to Quebec, she always excludes the 
national capital region yet, as you know full well, most of the 
research work is done in this region.
<P>
	There are other very important issues relating to research and 
development. I, however, realize more and more that this 
centralizing government has no respect whatsoever for provincial 
jurisdiction. When it can take something away from Quebec, I 
would go so far as to say it takes great pleasure in doing so.
<P>
	For many years, this government did not hesitate to use its 
so-called power to spend, which is more like its power to get us 
into a $600 billion debt. There are some alarming expenditures. 
Spending $2 million to celebrate Canada Day is all fine and good 
but, when jobs are being cut in regions with research and 
development facilities, especially in Varennes, it is unacceptable.
<P>
	The government is ignoring the Constitution and getting 
involved, often despite the opposition of Quebec and the other 
provinces, in areas in which it has no business. There are areas it 
should never have stepped in. When the time comes to invest 
money, it gets cold feet. But at other times, it is only too happy to 
butt in.
<P>
	Again, when the minister tells us that 25 per cent of the budget 
goes to Quebec, we very often ask her to give us some figures 
supporting her statement. The committee asked her to submit these 
figures in writing. We never received them. I am the Bloc critic on 
natural resources, and a Liberal member told me that Bloc 
members' comments are imbued with poetry. I am sorry, but I now 
want to produce some numbers.
<P>

<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In 1979, Quebec received 14.9 per cent of the federal funds 
allocated for research and development. Do you know what was 
Ontario's proportion? It was 53.4 per cent. I can give you the 
figures for 1980, 1981 and 1982. In 1980, Quebec received 15 per 
cent, compared to 53.9 per cent for Ontario. I will skip a few years, 
so as not to bore you.
<P>
	In 1984, 17.6 per cent was awarded to Quebec and 47.9 per cent 
to Ontario. In 1988, it was 19.6 per cent for Quebec and 50.5 per 
cent for Ontario. In 1990, Quebec got 18.8 per cent and Ontario 
50.8 per cent. In 1991, Quebec received 20.6 per cent and Ontario 
49 per cent. On average, Quebec got 18 per cent during these years, 
while Ontario received 50 per cent. These are Statistics Canada 
figures, catalogue No. 88,001.
<P>
	We are speaking on behalf of Varennes, and I am personally 
speaking on behalf of the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute, located in 
my riding, in Sainte-Flavie. The institute is a very modern facility 
where researchers from all over the world come to show fellow 
researchers what can be done in the fishery sector. They come to 
the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute to meet our researchers and to 
seek their advice, and the government wants to reduce its funding. 
Again, this is taking place in Quebec. Again, this is taking place in 
a rural community. We have the unique opportunity of having 
researchers in a rural community and the government is making 
drastic cuts.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will agree that this is not acceptable. 
Quebecers cannot understand such a measure. The government 
seems to take pleasure in cutting its support to institutions which 
are the pride of Quebecers, namely the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean, the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion, and the 
Maurice-Lamontagne Institute. If at least they were cutting 
assistance rationally and spreading the cuts over four or five years 
in order to help people recover, take stock of the situation and carry 
on. But no. Almost overnight, they say sorry and cut assistance 
everywhere. Perhaps it is true that they are cutting everywhere, but 
one would be mistaken in thinking that the amount cut is fair. It is 
not fair for Quebec. I just proved that, according to the figures for 
the 1979-1991 period, not one year only but over a full 13 year 
period, Quebec got 18.6 per cent compared to 50 per cent for 
Ontario.
<P>
	However, we, in Quebec, have been spoiled in some areas. We 
have been spoiled with unemployment insurance that, since the 
new reform, I call poverty insurance. There are no jobs yet, as 
everyone knows, the contributions to this plan come from 
employers and employees.
<P>
	I just came from a committee meeting, where the president of the 
Canadian forest producers was five minutes ago. He told me the 
way the eastern plan subsidies in Quebec had been cut-and this is 
the  president talking-is completely unacceptable because the 
forest industry in particular, an industry I know very well, is very 
profitable for the government. It is profitable in two specific ways: 
through taxes and income taxes collected and through the 
unemployment benefits that do not have to be paid out. The 
government does not have to pay for it, but we know the 
government seems to get upset when someone gets unemployment 
benefits, which is why it set such very harsh standards. Assistance 
for the forest industry has been cut.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Back home, in the community of Causapscal in my riding, a 
forestry school opened recently and is doing very well. I was just 
told that research is still carried out at that school. In Rimouski, we 
had a centre on the Eastern Plan, where new technologies were 
developed. Everyone came to see what was going on there and was 
delighted, the owner could see how many species he had on his 
property, what was going on, if the trees were mature or not, what 
forestry activities he could undertake and what he could expect 
over a five or six year period.
<P>
	We also wanted to get involved in genetic research. As you well 
know, there is a lot of genetic research needed in the forestry area. 
Sometimes, more than one generation is needed before a tree can 
be harvested. A lot could be accomplished through genetic 
research. We started, but $6.5 million were cut overnight and we 
were told that the Eastern Plan was a thing of the past.
<P>
	As we know, research and development play a key role in the 
economy of modern societies. Everybody knows that. Since 
Confederation, Quebec has never received its fair share, never. 
This year, with all the programs being cut, what little Quebec has 
will again be reduced. I talked earlier about the Lamontagne 
Institute. That institute stands to lose 30 per cent of its subsidies 
and that is totally unacceptable. This is the only federal centre with 
such a mission in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I could quote numerous studies on this issue that prove beyond 
any doubt that Quebec has unfortunately been taken in, year after 
year. Some people tend to believe or want the rest of Canada to 
believe that Quebec is the spoiled child of Confederation. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.
<P>
	If Quebecers are not given the opportunity to carry out research 
and development, they will come to understand that they need their 
own country to do what needs to be done. Then, they will be able to 
get involved in research and development and to hold their heads 
up high.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As colleagues may have noticed, the

there would be a disposition to give consent to have the Reform

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for allowing that change. I am sure their 
patience is conditioned by the fact that I have not yet given my

opinion.
<P>
	The motion before the House today reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government for its regressive research 
and development policies in regard to Quebec, in particular its unilateral 
decision to cut the federal contribution of $7.2 million planned for the Canadian 
Centre for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am honoured to speak to this motion on behalf of my party. 
This is not my usual area of specialization. I will not speak long, 
but I have been asked by my colleagues from Okanagan Centre and 
Fraser Valley East, who know much more about this, to speak on 
their behalf.
<P>
	What is the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes? 
Varennes is a very nice place on the south shore of Quebec, 
northeast of Montreal. I had the pleasure of being there last 
summer. It is a very nice community.
<P>
	The Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion is a joint venture, 
funded by Hydro Quebec, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. and the 
National Institute of Scientific Research. It carries out research in 
the field of fusion, which hopes to provide a source of energy using 
fusion of elements such as heavy hydrogen. This energy source is 
readily available and would provide pollution free energy. The 
problem is this technology is not commercially viable.
<P>
	The project at Varennes has yet to produce energy because so far 
creating the reaction uses more energy than it gives off.
<P>
	Financing has been provided thus far by the federal government 
and by the Quebec government. The annual provincial government 
budget is about $14.4 million, where the federal portion is half of 
that, $7.2 million per annum.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The most recent promised federal funding for the project was 
given in 1992 for five years. Therefore this funding has been all 
along set to expire in 1997. This has been understood from the 
beginning and there should be no surprise with these developments. 
There was a small reduction in federal support for this project to 
the tune of $2 million per annum beginning in 1994.
<P>
	On a worldwide scale the amount of federal spending on the 
project at Varennes amounts to about three-eights of one per cent of 
worldwide spending in this area. This is an important fact to 
mention because these are projects where economy of scale is very 
important. There is a worldwide trend to cut much of this research. 
Funding for fusion in the United States has dropped by about  $100 
million per annum. The European Union project is about to 
undergo a review and will likely see some spending cuts.
<P>
	The federal government in Canada, along with its partners, has 
put in over 20 years of money into this project, about $70 million of 
infrastructure money, although frankly I and my party would doubt 
this equipment has held its value. I am quite sure the present value 
of this is significantly lower.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources has slashed Varennes funding 
but it is important to note this has been done along with similar cuts 
in other areas, also slashing the fusion program in Mississauga. We 
have seen other such cuts in western Canada. The KAON particle 
accelerator has been cut. A similar project, the ITER project in 
Ontario near Pickering, has not been funded, although in our view 
there is a possibility of considerable international investment at no 
cost to Canadians if that goes ahead.
<P>
	There is in spite of this cut to funding an $11 million upgrade 
now underway which can be viewed as either a complete waste of 
money or a giveaway to Hydro Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has raised the issue of cutting funding to 
Varennes is a very isolated issue. It has raised it in neither the broad 
context of science and technology policy in Canada nor in the 
broad context of regional fairness and regional allocation of 
development and other funds in Canada.
<P>
	Instead, as is repeatedly the case, the Bloc Quebecois has raised 
this issue simply as a Quebec issue, pointing out that Quebec has 
been cut something and therefore we are making this an issue. This 
is repeatedly the role of the Bloc Quebecois in Parliament. Not that 
I dismiss all these concerns but I wish they were presented in a 
broader context. I think it would be much more helpful if they were 
analysed in a broader context.
<P>
	I think sometimes there are reaches. Earlier today Bloc members 
suggest Quebec only gets its share of money if we count the 
Quebec portion of the national capital region. It escapes me why 
we would not count the Quebec portion of the national capital 
region, but that assertion was made.
<P>
	Some of these general concerns, though, about federal priorities 
and how they impact the regions I think are value. Before I become 
more critical let me comment on that a little. There has been a view 
in the country historically, which my party has spoken about, that 
the central core of the country is its industrial engine and to treat 
the other regions of the country as simply markets and simply a 
source of cheap resources. This has been a longstanding pattern. It 
goes back to the foundation of the country and it continues at times 
to be reflected in federal policy, I think with some frustration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3512"> 3512 </A></B>
<P>
	In the Mulroney era that attitude was demonstrated in spades 
when the current regional development agencies were set up. At 
the time the Mulroney government had established the two major 
regional agencies in Atlantic Canada and western Canada.
<P>
	We took some amusement at the original alignment of those 
agencies. The government announced the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency-the carefully selected word 
opportuntiy-coupled at the time with the minister of public 
works, a very traditional view of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	The western diversification initiative-keying in on the western 
word diversification-was put under the minister of grains and 
oilseeds at the time and funding for regional development in 
Ontario and Quebec remained with Industry Canada under science 
and technology. The symbolism of that spoke spades about the 
government's view of the country and its economic development.
<P>
	There have been a lot of problems in these kinds of projects and 
these kinds of allocations. I have not seen recent analyses, but it 
was stated some years ago that companies that received western 
diversification initiatives were making contributions to the 
Conservative Party at the rate of 85 per cent. I suppose it is 
coincidental that all of the qualified companies were Conservative. 
I suspect that has changed since 1993.
<P>
	If we want to take a broader view of resource allocation there are 
other examples where the grievances being aired by the Bloc today 
do not hold up.
<P>
	In recent days the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia has pointed out that CIDA gives a huge 
percentage of its contracts and resources to companies based in 
Quebec. Seventy per cent of the top 20 CIDA contracts went to 
Quebec based firms. It also turns out that most of these firms were 
making donations to the Liberal Party. This is another trend. As I 
said, the government changes office and suddenly all the 
competence in the country seems to change partisan stripe as well. 
In 1995, 57 per cent of CIDA contracts were undertaken by Quebec 
firms.
<P>
	I point this out not to say these Quebec members are not making 
reasonable grievances here, but I am not clear that this can be 
analysed in an isolated case by case context. We all know the 
airline and aerospace industry has been concentrated in Quebec 
with not insignificant federal government help in that outcome 
over the years.
<P>
	I am not sure what the Bloc Quebecois is really suggesting with 
this motion other than to point out Quebec is not getting this project 
and that therefore this is injustice. I do not know what it is 
suggesting the solution is. We have never heard any suggestions 
from the Bloc Quebecois about a systemic solution. We have never 
heard any suggestion that we would have, as was suggested by our 
party, published analysis by the federal  government of its regional 
allocation to spending and taxation measures across various 
government departments. It is simply suggesting Quebec is not 
getting its fair share in this area. This is based on very specific 
numbers of dollars spent in Quebec specifically by Atomic Energy 
Ltd. of Canada.
<P>
	Are Bloc members suggesting every province should have a 
nuclear reactor or fusion facilities? I do not think this is necessarily 
a realistic suggestion.
<P>
	Let me make some concerns about how the Bloc is approaching 
these problems which it believes to be serious. I think with proper 
analysis we could reach a solution to these things. However, let us 
not forget whenever we hear one of these grievances about a 
Quebec project this is coming from a sovereignist party. What 
exactly is it about sovereignty that would help this situation?
<P>
	Let me make three concerns that I think would be raised 
instantly. First, sovereignty would reduce the economies of scale of 
Canada and Quebec. In economies such as these economies of scale 
in major advances of scientific and commercial research are very 
important. I cannot see how either Canada or Quebec would be 
better off with smaller economies of scale, which would result in 
these areas after separation.
<P>
	Second, and I have pointed this out repeatedly, if Quebec were 
not part of Canada it would have no money whatsoever in these 
project areas from the federal government. It would be receiving 
nothing, zero. I think that needs to be repeated.
<P>
	Sovereignists are using these projects as lamp posts rather than 
street lights; in other words, for support rather than enlightenment. 
I suggest that if the Variance project were to be funded that would 
not in any way change the inclination of the sovereignty movement 
to pursue its objective. Once again, I think this is a justification 
rather than a real motivation.
<P>
	Finally, and I do have to ask this on behalf of my own 
constituents who ask this constantly, if the Bloc Quebecois raises 
concerns like this, and if it really wants to leave Canada and asserts 
that it will leave and furthermore will leave without any 
commitment to leave legally or without any commitment to pay its 
full 25 per cent share of the national debt when it does leave, why 
in the world would the federal government or other Canadian 
taxpayers want to make a long term capital investment in Quebec 
in any case? These are serious questions being asked in the rest of 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I conclude without dismissing the broader concerns entirely. I do 
not think they are addressed by the motion and obviously the 
Reform Party will not associate itself with the motion.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
been listening carefully to the hon. member for Calgary West, a 
young man who seems quite reasonable and moderate in his 
remarks. Listening to him has helped me understand how true it is 
that we have two solitudes in this country, the French speaking 
community in Quebec and the English speaking community in the 
rest of Canada, two communities that do not understand each other.
<P>
	I do not know if the hon. member is well versed in history, but if 
he knew the history of his country and of mine, he would know that 
Quebec and the other provinces which first founded this country 
invested a lot of money in the development of Western Canada. My 
colleague is from Calgary, Alberta, a province which is quite rich 
today, but was poor for a long period of time. Quebec, Ontario and 
other provinces invested a lot of money in the development of 
western provinces. Today, Alberta is rich.
<P>
	My colleague should understand that Quebecers do not in any 
way resent the fact that western provinces are rich. We simply want 
our share. I have here figures on research and development that 
demonstrate conclusively that Quebec does not get its fair share.
<P>
	Let me remind my colleague that Quebec taxpayers pay $30 
billion in taxes in Ottawa annually. We should also receive some 
money from Ottawa, and we do. Unfortunately, the money we 
receive is for welfare, because our province is now poor. Why? Due 
to the policies of the central government.
<P>
	Canada is built in such a way that Ontario always gets the 
biggest piece of the pie, that is, 50 per cent of the research and 
development funds. Quebec has everything it needs to be as rich as 
Ontario, except an English-speaking majority. I will tell my hon. 
colleague that a minority that does not control its economy has to 
rely on the majority.
<P>
	I heard him say: ``Why, if they do not really want to separate, are 
they still making claims?'' This is part of our mandate. As long as 
the Bloc Quebecois is in Ottawa, we will protect Quebec's rights. 
We, the 53 Bloc members, were sent here mainly to protect 
Quebec's interests. And, under the British system, we formed the 
official opposition.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that the claims we make are for 
ourselves, are not directed against Western Canada at all. I think 
Western Canada must also get its fair share and this is important 
but when we look at the figures, we see that Quebec received only 
18.6 per cent of research and development monies from 1979 to 
1991.
<P>
	With this, which is more a comment than a question, I am trying 
to explain Quebec's history to the hon. member who may not know 
it. Perhaps he knows his own province's history.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	We, in Quebec, took part in the development of Canada. What 
we want now is to get back the 24 per cent we contributed and not 
only social assistance and unemployment insurance. Cuts are made 
there also. We want what is rightfully ours. We are here to fight for 
Quebecers.
<P>
	I do not have a question for my colleague but I would appreciate 
his telling us what he thinks about all that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I believe the 
hon. member has expressed an opinion. I forgot that this is an 
instance, an incident, a cut that the Bloc Quebecois is taking, 
without any proof, as the representation of federalism in Canada 
and of the history of this country. I believe we need more than a 
single incident to prove a point.
<P>
	The hon. member said there are two solitudes. I take note of his 
words. There are two solitudes: Quebec and the rest of Canada. The 
Bloc Quebecois feels it must defend Quebec's interests against the 
rest of Canada. It is a regrettable perspective, in my opinion, 
because I believe there are more than two solitudes in Canada. 
There are very different regions and perspectives in Canada, and 
that is why the Reform Party exists in the west. I believe it is 
difficult to represent the rest of Canada as only one bloc ready to 
attack Quebec. I believe this sovereignist perspective is a rather 
simplistic and incorrect.
<P>
	We recognize that the country started in the east. I admit that the 
east took part in the west's development. I do not quote the Prime 
Minister often, but the Prime Minister himself said that the rest of 
Canada and Quebec profit from the development of Alberta's tar 
sands. It is important to recognize it.
<P>
	If we talk about the development of Quebec, we must make an 
analysis of the sovereignist movement's impact in this 
development. If we consider the economic slow-down that 
occurred, especially in the last generation, we must ask ourselves if 
the sovereignist movement helped or impeded economic growth in 
Quebec. I think it is obvious.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard went to the United States this week and, in order 
to attract investments in Quebec, he himself felt the need to assure 
Americans that he would not hold another referendum in the next 
few years. If the Bloc Quebecois is truly concerned about 
development problems in Quebec, the sovereignist movement is 
not helping to solve this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for my colleague from Calgary West. I would like 
him to put himself in my place this afternoon and imagine that he is 
the hon. member for Saint-Jean, if only for one minute. I have a 
concrete example for him and it is not a sovereignist example but 
an economic example.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3514"> 3514 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year, the federal government decided to invest $2 billion 
in armoured vehicles. It gave that money to a GM factory in 
London, Ontario, saying: ``You are the Canadian centre of 
excellence for armoured vehicles''.
<P>
	Now, there will be a turret on the armoured vehicles and the 
Canadian centre of excellence for turrets is Oerlikon, in my riding.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I ask my colleague from Calgary what his reaction would be if he 
were the member for a riding which happens to be the centre of 
excellence for turrets and saw the contract given to a company 
outside his riding. That is negating the existence of an international 
centre of excellence. In Quebec, we foot 24 per cent of the bill but 
we get only 17 per cent back.
<P>
	I am talking about research and development funds. Ontario 
received $2 billion because it has a centre of excellence but our 
own centre of excellence, which could do its part of the contract, 
was told that it will get nothing. This is a typical example. How 
would the member react if he were representing a riding that was 
the victim of such an injustice?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this 
debate. It is important that we focus on exactly what this is all 
about.
<P>
	This is not about a fair share for one part of the country or a fair 
share for another part of the country. This is about governing. It is 
about the Minister of Natural Resources standing up to her 
obligations. It is about the Minister of Natural Resources doing her 
job. It is about the Minister of Natural Resources understanding 
that government is about setting priorities and acting on those 
priorities. That is what this decision is about.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with one part of Canada getting this and 
another part of Canada getting that. This is an understanding. The 
Minister of Natural Resources, in conjunction with members of 
Parliament and with members of her department, have decided 
what is and is not a priority in terms of R and D in Canada. They 
have made hard and tough choices.
<P>
	We are in a climate of fiscal restraint. We are in a time when 
government has to make choices. The minister has made sound 
choices. She has made good choices. She has made choices that are 
in the best interests of all Canadians, regardless of where they live 
from coast to coast to coast. That is what this debate is about. That 
is what this decision is about. It has nothing to do with fair shares in 
different parts of the country. When members opposite try to 
suggest that it is, I would suggest they are wrong.
<P>
	Let us look at R and D in Canada and in particular that which 
comes out of NRCan. A great deal of it takes place all across 
Canada, including in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	For example, there is a new research and development impact 
network that is going to be helping research organizations in 
Quebec measure the results of R and D. The network will refine 
and adapt tools for measuring the social and economic impacts of 
research and promote the exchange of best practices. This will 
enhance the ability of Quebec scientists and others to strengthen 
their contacts across Canada and around the world.
<P>
	Another example is the national topographic data base. This is a 
mapping service developed by Geomatics Canada and based in 
Sherbrooke, Quebec. It provides sophisticated information on such 
geographical features as rivers, lakes, mountain ranges, vegetation, 
cities, railroads and roads.
<P>
	Another example is Canada's network of model forests. It makes 
Quebec industry, non-governmental organizations and aboriginal 
groups partners in the sustainable management of forests. News 
about successful new techniques is shared quickly among all 
partners, including those in Quebec through an extensive 
information network.
<P>
	There are many more examples. The government established the 
Canadian Space Agency in 1989 to promote the peaceful use and 
development of space for the social and economic benefit of 
Canadians. In June 1993 the space agency moved to St. Hubert, 
Quebec, bringing 350 high technology jobs to that province.
<P>
	All of us in this House and across Canada take great pride in the 
visible accomplishments of our space program and the scientists 
who are in this Quebec based organization who support it.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	This past week, we had the example of astronaut Marc Garneau 
returning from outer space, a Quebecer who demonstrates clearly 
that participation in this important program is from across Canada.
<P>
	There are other examples. Let us turn to the mining sector. 
Mining is a big and important part of northern Ontario. The natural 
resource department undertakes its research across Canada, 
including in Quebec.
<P>
	In mining, the department administers the mine environmental 
neutral drainage program, as an example. It was established in 
1988. The program brings together a consortium to co-ordinate 
research into ways of reducing the impact on the environment of 
drainage from mining sites.
<P>
	This is an important environmental concern. New methods have 
been developed to neutralize the effects of acids from tailings and 
waste rock. This research, which is carried out in co-operation with 
20 mining companies  across Canada, helps ensure that neighbour-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3515"> 3515 </A></B>
<P>
ing properties, lakes and rivers in Quebec as well as in the rest of 
Canada, can be protected.
<P>
	Since 1989, a total of $1.5 million has been spent or committed 
on the mine environmental neutral drainage program in Quebec by 
NRCan and a further $650,000 is going to be spent in that province 
in the next few years.
<P>
	Another important example is research in the area of energy, 
which is taking place at the energy diversification and research 
laboratory in Varennes, Quebec, a joint enterprise in association 
with the Institut de recherche d'Hydro Québec, Institut national de 
recherche scientifique, ABB, the international engineering firm 
and 20 other partners.
<P>
	This facility has staff of almost 50 scientists, engineers and 
technicians and has an annual budget of almost $6 million. The 
mission of the laboratory is to conduct applied research into energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and to do so in close co-operation 
with industry.
<P>
	This facility, which operates in the province of Quebec, has a 
long list of achievements: the development of a high efficiency 
absorption heat pump designed for small commercial buildings, 
new catalytic gas combustion system with greatly enhanced 
efficiency and a new study on converting the conventional diesel 
system used in remote locations to a new hybrid photovoltaic wind 
diesel system.
<P>
	What this demonstrates to the members of this House, to people 
from across Canada whether they live in Ontario, in British 
Columbia or the province of Quebec, is that the minister and the 
government do not make their decisions based on geography. They 
do not make their decisions based on trying to make an absolutely 
equation so much in, so much out. That is not how Canada 
operates.
<P>
	This demonstrates that the government undertakes its job, in this 
case research, across Canada. It does not make its decisions based 
on whether it makes sense geographically. It makes its decision 
based on what it should do. Does it make sense scientifically? Is it a 
Canadian priority? Is it a governmental priority given what the 
science and technology of the day is? Is it a priority that we can 
deal with in terms of the fiscal environment, the fiscal context 
within which we are operating?
<P>
	That is what the government does. That is what the minister has 
done. To suggest somehow that this is a plot or some devious way 
of withholding funding from a province just is not so. It is not that 
at all.
<P>
	I have clearly demonstrated that when we look at where we 
undertake this activity. It takes place in Ontario. It takes place in 
the west. It takes place in the maritimes and it takes place in 
Quebec as well. That is important for the people who live 
everywhere in Canada, including the people in Quebec, to 
understand. The  suggestion that this withdrawal of funding is some 
sort of plot is simply wrong.
<P>
	There are priorities today in research. Fusion research is 
something that could have great returns, but that is not going to 
happen for quite some time, 20 or 30 years in the future. The 
minister has had to make a decision based on what our priorities are 
today and based on our ability to have a return on that investment in 
the short term. That was an appropriate decision for the minister to 
make. It was an appropriate decision for the government to make.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I believe all Canadians should applaud what is being done here. 
We are making those tough choices that have to be made and we are 
allocating those resources in the best interests of all Canadians, 
regardless of where they live, from coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I feel 
that the question I asked was an excellent one, but unfortunately 
there was no time to answer it. I am therefore leaping at the 
opportunity I now have to ask it again, but I shall adapt it in light of 
what the hon. member from Ontario has just said.
<P>
	I do indeed have the statistics here. He claims geography is not 
important, that what is important is how the money is invested and 
what return there is on it. I would, however, just draw his attention 
to the fact that his province receives 50 per cent of all of these 
research projects, and Quebec only 18.6 per cent. That is just a 
coincidence. It is probably why he believes that geography is not 
important.
<P>
	But I will take another tack, picking up on my example from 
before. There are several centres of excellence in Canada. Often the 
government states that it will give contracts to these centres of 
excellence. There is one such centre for armoured vehicles in 
Ontario, GM in London. As I said, these vehicles need to be fitted 
with a specific turret and turret gun. The other centre of excellence 
in Canada is Oerlikon Aerospace, which is in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	I would ask whether he considers it fair that $2 billion are being 
given to the centre in London, Ontario, which decides to have its 
turrets manufactured by its affiliates, which are in the U.S. 
moreover, with Delco getting some $600 million, whereas the 
department ought to insist the turrets be manufactured at 
Saint-Jean. From the geographical point of view, then, I have 
trouble understanding how such an uneven distribution can be 
made.
<P>
	As for expertise-and this is my question-why has the 
government not awarded the turret part of the armoured vehicle 
contract to Oerlikon? If the hon. member from Ontario were in my 
shoes, I think he too would be offended that things were being done 
this way. This is, therefore, one example related specifically to his 
address, in which he states that expertise and return on investment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3516"> 3516 </A></B>
<P>
are what count. Let him explain to us, then, why this was not the 
case with Oerlikon and GM in London, and the turrets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, I will give a broad response to 
that question.
<P>
	Let us think about the model the hon. member is suggesting. We 
heard about this not too long ago in the House with respect to 
another matter. The hon. member is suggesting that if it makes 
sense to invest money in a particular part of Canada what we would 
have to do is say let us put that money there because it makes sense. 
Then, because we have to worry about geographic concerns and a 
claim saying it should have been somewhere else, we would have 
to invest similar amounts in Quebec, in the maritimes, in British 
Columbia and in the prairies simply to keep an equal balance 
because there would be a concern that one part of the country was 
receiving more than another part of the country. As an ex-banker I 
can say it would not take long with that kind of scenario for the 
country to become bankrupt.
<P>
	If there is a $2 billion project in Ontario that makes sense, the 
member is suggesting we would have to invest $2 billion in 
Quebec, $2 billion in the maritimes and $2 billion in the west to 
keep everybody happy. We would have to spend $8 billion to have a 
$2 billion project.
<P>
	That is not the way things will work. That is not the way they 
should work. It certainly is not the way the minister is to work. It 
certainly is not the way the government is to work.
<P>
	I relate this to something I debated with a Bloc member in a 
previous debate. Think about a family. I know the Bloc may have 
difficulty with this, but Quebec is a part of the Canadian family. It 
is a proud part of the Canadian family. So is Ontario and so are all 
the other parts of the country. We are a family. We have been a 
family for 129 years and it has worked well. It has not been without 
problems, but it worked well. I am a parent and I have a number of 
children. We provide resources, not necessarily equally divided, 
but resources which are in the best interests of the family. We 
provide resources that move us forward. We provide resources 
based on the overall good of the family.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	As a government that is what we are doing. We are providing 
resources in the best interests of all Canadians, making sound 
economic decision, sound investment decisions, decisions which 
make sense in the economic environment in which we find 
ourselves and that are good for Canadians, regardless of where they 
live in this great and united country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate.
<P>
	I feel it is most important to put into context the decision of the 
government to discontinue the funding of the national fusion 
program. In program review, the most necessary examination of 
priorities of all programs, the government of Canada made some 
extremely difficult decisions.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned, at Natural Resources Canada it was 
decided to give priority to research and development in energy 
which improve the efficiency of oil, gas and electricity and the 
development of renewable energy technologies such as 
biotechnology, solar and wind energy. Fusion does not come under 
any of these priorities.
<P>
	To expedite the advancement of the strategic directions decided 
by NRCan the department is fostering the sharing of scientific 
knowledge throughout the country and working with parties in 
specific priority areas. I will provide some examples.
<P>
	It uses the information highway to transfer high quality science 
and technology quickly to users. NRCan is making a major 
contribution to the highway by facilitating the supply and exchange 
of digital data organized and retrieved by geographical location. 
Such geo reference data are produced by a variety of government 
and industry sources. All are based on the fundamental systems 
created and maintained by the department.
<P>
	NRCan works with the Government of Quebec and other 
provinces to define and develop the national spatial data 
infrastructure, this part of the information highway dealing with 
the management and exchange of geo referenced data. Called the 
geography lane, it covers all applications with significant 
geographic content. The department's geo route project also 
provides access to the network at the entry level for students, 
researchers and businesses for anyone in Quebec or elsewhere 
looking for geographical information.
<P>
	The national atlas information service offers electronic samples 
of national atlas products and allows users to select a theme such as 
minerals, transportation or population density to create a 
customized map. The atlas is available on the Internet as a 
worldwide web site. The site won a gold medal at the 1995 
technology in government week.
<P>
	The department takes full advantage of the Internet to 
disseminate information. For example, anyone may obtain 
immediate access to national information regarding forest fires. A 
daily fire and weather index provides data crucial to controlling 
and managing forest fires in Quebec and across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3517"> 3517 </A></B>
<P>
	Partners and clients now have regular access to geo scientific 
data bases throughout the Internet and dedicated information 
centres set up in provincial facilities. Residents of Quebec may 
conduct searches, obtain reports and read public files. People are 
now buying maps via the Internet.
<P>
	Internationally the department is strengthening its overseas links 
to create and expand markets for companies in Quebec and other 
provinces to improve access to foreign technologies and 
collaborate on global projects.
<P>
	Canada works with other countries to develop international 
standards, scientific criteria and indicators and certification 
systems for global sustainable forestry. Without such certification 
fostered by NRCan Quebec forest products could encounter future 
trade barriers because of environmental requirements. As the 
leader of Canadian geomatics teams, NRCan is playing a strategic 
role in winning business abroad.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Most of these international projects involve Quebec firms. 
Under a $22 million contract Quebec based companies are 
modernizing Mexico's national mapping system. The leader of this 
project is SNC Lavalin. Subcontractors are Photosur-Geomat of 
Montreal and Le Centre canadien de geomatique of Sherbrooke. 
Another two-year contract is underway in Saudi Arabia. With 
funding from the Canadian International Development Agency, the 
department is working with a consortium of Canadian companies 
on a digital mapping project in Russia.
<P>
	Companies involved with projects in Russia include DMR 
Group of Montreal, Tecsult of Montreal and Roche of Quebec. 
Working in Romania are Tecsult, and Pro-Sig and Sima of 
Montreal. Other overseas projects where Quebec companies are 
providing leading technology are in Lebanon, Burkina Faso and 
Argentina. As part of the efforts to pursue the marketing of energy 
and technology abroad, the department is leading a hydro 
technology mission to Poland.
<P>
	NRCan keeps Canada at the forefront of geoscientific research 
through active participation in the international ocean drilling 
program. Canadian proposals for deployment of a drilling ship 
have resulted in more than $20 million of scientific drilling 
immediately offshore of Canada.
<P>
	The department also provides administration for the 
International Union of Surveying and Mapping, an organization 
which provides a forum for exchanging science and technology 
information in geomatics.
<P>
	Another example is an agreement with European community for 
the exchange of information on technologies in key areas of 
mining, mineral processing, metals recycling, waste reduction and 
related environmental issues.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada communicates the importance of 
science and technology to students all across this great country of 
ours. The geomatics professional development program matches 
recent university graduates with potential leaders in Geomatics 
Canada in a two-year program. NRCan personnel receive an 
infusion of fresh ideas and innovations. The graduates gain 
valuable work experience. The industry obtains graduates who 
have been trained to apply the latest academic and scientific skills.
<P>
	A new link of growing importance is SchoolNet, which connects 
more than 15,000 schools across the country via the Internet. 
NRCan provides maps, geography databases and community 
profiles. Through this network a school in Jonquiere could obtain 
detailed geographic information about Montreal or anywhere else 
in Canada. For one project, an atlas of Canadian communities, 
created in partnership with the Canadian Association of School 
Principals, youngsters collected maps, photographs and stories 
about their communities. These were compiled in an atlas, 
packaged on a compact disc and provided through SchoolNet.
<P>
	Another program, the youth science awareness program for 
schools, is designed to develop interest and capabilities of youth in 
science and encourage the pursuit of careers in scientific fields. A 
junior energy program was aimed at children in grades four, five 
and six. ``Conserving Energy in Canada'' explains this important 
priority to grades seven to ten. Scientists from NRCan also serve as 
part time professors at universities, providing strong links between 
the department's research laboratories and students.
<P>
	This is a short description of the many and varied ways Natural 
Resources Canada is meeting the scientific needs of a whole range 
of Canadians from each province, including Quebec society. This 
includes students from primary school through university, teachers 
and professors, researchers, scientists, technicians, public 
administrators, business people, those engaging in mining, 
forestry, energy and geo-science, public interest groups and 
environmentalists.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada is investing its limited resources to 
meet the most pressing, present and future needs in science and 
technology. As a science department of the federal government, 
Natural Resources Canada is amply fulfilling its mandate to serve 
the needs of all Canadians, ensuring the place of all Canadians in 
the future and prosperity of Canada.
<P>
	In view of these many ongoing programs, directly and indirectly 
benefiting all Canadians, the difficult decision to end funding for 
the national fusion program was appropriate, wise and entirely in 
keeping with the best interests of all the people of Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3518"> 3518 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks of my Liberal colleague. He 
recited a list of many things the government has done, a sort of 
litany that tells us very little about percentages.
<P>
	In August 1995, the Quebec department of industry, commerce, 
science and technology produced a study on federal R and D 
spending. The main conclusions of the study, which analysed 
specific federal spending in this sector using a grid with a number 
of criteria, are that between 1979 and 1991, six provinces out of ten 
were overfunded in R and D.
<P>
	Ontario, of course, was at the top of the list. For the last 10 years, 
it has received 50 per cent of the funding. According to the study, 
during the same period Quebec came last, with underfunding of 
$2.5 billion, the amount it would have received if it had been 
treated equitably.
<P>
	This study concluded that if federal funding had been equitable 
in 1991, the relationship between gross domestic spending on R 
and D and GDP, the indicator most often used to show the intensity 
of R and D effort, would have been higher in Quebec than in any 
other Canadian province.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask my colleague is this: Can 
Quebec reach its full potential? In other words, by remaining in 
Canada, can Quebec hope to receive its fair share? We think it 
cannot. Recent history says it cannot. Quebec is not receiving its 
fair share.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, what we get from the federal government 
is social transfer payments. The central government has no policy 
for developing a specific region, as I see it, except that if you are 
part of the majority and you live in Ontario, you could care less. 
They say you should go where the getting is good, and the getting is 
almost always good in Ontario.
<P>
	Does the member think that Quebec can hope to develop by 
staying within Confederation? I think not, and I would like the 
member to prove otherwise. If he cannot, this discourse that we 
have been listening to for 30 years and that is slowly but surely 
destroying us has got to stop.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question which is very specific and pointed.
<P>
	Today we are talking specifically about funding to a particular 
project within Quebec, the magnetic fusion project. There has been 
some discussion about the amount of resources going to the 
province for science and technology.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member, coming from a province like 
Saskatchewan, that we are not overly financed in the area of 
research and development, probably less so than the province of 
Quebec. I believe this to be more than likely an accurate statement. 
It strikes me as being a bit like the hon. member complaining 
because he has no shoes. I am complaining because I have no feet.
<P>
	The hon. member should keep all these things in perspective. 
Each of these different programs goes on in different regions across 
the country. Sometimes one area or another, for very legitimate 
reasons, will be a larger beneficiary of specific resources. 
However, after taking into account all the things the federal 
government does in all parts of the country, we are all well served.
<P>
	When the maritime provinces have a need, the government is 
there to assist in meeting the need. As well, the people of other 
provinces share in meeting that need. It is the same with the 
province of Quebec. When there is a need in that province, people 
from the rest of Canada are there to assist in meeting that need. 
However, the people in Saskatchewan receive next to nothing in 
research and development dollars.
<P>
	When taking into account all of the benefits we have in being 
Canadian, I am very proud to be a Canadian citizen. I am proud to 
be part of a country that cares about every region, where we share 
our wealth one with other so we all can benefit.
<P>
	At different times in our history different provinces have had 
needs. Before oil was discovered in Alberta, it needed help from 
the rest of country and received that help. Now Alberta is helping 
other areas of the country.
<P>
	When we look back over our history all regions of the country 
have needed assistance from time to time and all regions of the 
country have received it. When we consider our history and all of 
the difficulties and challenges that the different regions have had, 
we have all been well served by Confederation. As a result of this 
kind of caring, sharing and working together, I can say that I am 
very proud to be a Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in accordance with 
international law, be willing to consider  negotiating with any secessionist claim in 
the event of a future referendum, if and only if the following criteria are met: (1) 
the secessionist unit be comprised of a ``people'' meeting international standards; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3519"> 3519 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the people must have been subject to a denial of political freedom or human 
rights in a discriminatory manner; (3) the seceding unit must demonstrate in practical 
terms that it has and can create a practicable and governable state which can assert 
effective control over a reasonably well defined territory; (4) a clear and precise 
question is asked as to whether the population in question wishes to secede from 
Canada; and (5) two-thirds of the population vote in favour of the clear and precise 
question.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to introduce 
Motion No. 206 today. This motion would be unnecessary if the 
government had had a plan to deal with the national referendum 
issue that still haunts us to this day.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	The national unity issue that we thought would be finished at the 
end of last year is unfortunately in front of us once again. The 
separatist leadership in Quebec continues to pursue a course and is 
trying to carve up this beautiful country that we know as Canada. 
The separatist politicians in Quebec are trying to seduce the 
population in Quebec, to try to lead them to the holy grail of 
separation.
<P>
	The purpose of this motion is to put forward some terms of 
secession, some identifiable groundwork for the criteria for 
secession. What is patently evident from last October 30 is that the 
federal government did not have a plan A or a plan B. It did not 
have a plan if it was a yes vote and did not have a plan if it was a no 
vote. Sadly, after discussions in the House over the last two weeks 
and on questioning the government, it has repeatedly demonstrated 
that it still does not have a plan as our country moves inexorably 
toward the edge of a cliff of separation.
<P>
	I have put forward Motion No. 206 in which I have tried to use 
the criteria under international law that is commonly respected 
throughout the world. The premier of Quebec has said that 
international law will be respected over internal law. The Prime 
Minister has said that international law will be respected. The 
attorney general of Quebec has said the same thing. No one has 
defined what it is in international law that allows an area to secede.
<P>
	That is what Motion No. 206 is all about. It states that an area in 
Canada can secede if it meets the following five criteria: (1) that 
the secessionist unit be comprised of a ``people''; (2) these people 
have been subject to a denial of their political freedom or human 
rights in a discriminatory manner; (3) the seceding unit must 
demonstrate that they can create a government; (4) that a clear and 
precise question be asked; and (5) that the question be passed by a 
two-thirds majority.
<P>
	Those are the terms of secession. Those are the criteria which are 
required if the international community is going to recognize a new 
country. It is being applied all over the world. It was applied in the 
case of Czechoslovakia. The Slovak Republic could not secede 
from Czechoslovakia because it could not meet these criteria.
<P>
	If Quebec or another part of this country wishes to secede it will 
have to fulfil these five criteria also. If it does not then it will not be 
recognized as a country in the international community.
<P>
	I am appalled that the government chose not to make my motion 
votable. Incidentally, this is the only OECD country in the world 
that has non-votable private members' motions. What a waste of 
time and money. It costs the taxpayer $25,000 an hour to keep this 
place open, and for what? I caution the government in the future to 
be democratic, give members the power to represent their people 
and make these private members' motions, all of them, votable.
<P>
	This motion came from the lack of desire, will and courage by 
the government to demonstrate and define for the Canadian people 
what it takes to secede. Does Quebec meet the five criteria that I 
mentioned? Let us take a look.
<P>
	Part of the criteria is that the rights of the people in Quebec have 
to be abrogated. They claim that their rights have been abrogated. 
They claim that somehow they became second class citizens. One 
can only become a second class citizen if one allows it to happen. I 
am completely fed up with the whining that takes place from the 
separatist politicians and I know the members of this House are 
also.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the facts. Are Quebecers second class 
citizens? Have the people of Quebec had their rights abrogated? 
For 24 of the last 26 years the prime ministers of this country have 
been Quebecers. Three out of the ten supreme court justices are 
from Quebec. Quebec's separate civil code is respected by the rest 
of the country. Quebec is allowed to have its own pension plan. It 
has opted out of the CPP. It is tolerated by the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at the cold, hard economics. Members of the 
Bloc have said that the people of Quebec have not received their 
fair share. Let us look at the facts.
<P>
	Since 1972 the province of Quebec has received $2.6 billion, at 
least, in excess of what it has paid out. From 1961 to 1991 the 
province of Quebec has received net transfers of $160 billion, 
funded by the rest of Canada. It is funded by the same part of 
Canada the separatists believe they are being abused by and treated 
as second class citizens. If that is being treated as a second class 
citizen, count British Columbia in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3520"> 3520 </A></B>
<P>
	Firms have been encouraged to operate in Quebec. Eighty-five 
thousand people in Quebec work in federal government jobs. A 
further 25,000 work in Ontario. Is that second class citizenship? 
Is that having their rights abused? I challenge anybody to name 
another country in the world where the people are supposedly 
having their rights abused because they receive economic and 
constitutional benefits. Those are the facts that Quebec has had 
to endure.
<P>
	I ask the separatist politicians who keep complaining about their 
lot in life as a part of Canada to put themselves in the shoes of those 
living outside Quebec. They should put themselves in the shoes of 
the people who live in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Ontario or Newfoundland. How do they feel about 
having to give their tax dollars to Quebec? That is a measure of 
tolerance. What we have seen in this whole debate is a measure of 
great intolerance. If we demonstrate that, this country will surely 
fracture.
<P>
	What has been the response of the separatist politicians in 
Quebec? What did they do after the referendum? They blamed their 
defeat on the immigrants. They closed down hospitals in the 
immigrant populated areas of Montreal. That was not by accident; 
it was done deliberately to drive out the immigrant population that 
voted for a united Canada. That is absolutely disgusting.
<P>
	Imagine a bill similar to Bill 101 being implemented in Ontario 
or in British Columbia. The people of Quebec and in fact 
non-English speaking people would be absolutely furious, and 
rightly so. It is discrimination.
<P>
	That has been the response of the separatist politicians in Quebec 
to the non-francophones in that province. Is that care and 
consideration? Is that showing tolerance? Is that showing 
understanding? Is that trying to build a united country that is fair to 
all its members? I think not.
<P>
	I presented Motion No. 206 because of the muddled, 
unco-ordinated approach made prior to the referendum by the 
federal government. Its lack of understanding continues to spiral on 
the national unity issue. I want to add an element of understanding 
and define the rules of the terrible game we are playing.
<P>
	What must we do to keep Canada together? The first thing is the 
Prime Minister has to understand that the separatist leadership has 
no interest whatsoever in being a part of Canada. The separatist 
leadership wants only one thing: a separate country called Quebec. 
If we recognize that, then we also have to accept the fact that 
negotiating with the separatists will not keep this country together. 
The Prime Minister can stand on his head and spit distinctive 
society clauses all he wants but it will not keep Canada together 
because the separatist politicians do not want to be in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	What must the Prime Minister do? He has to go directly to the 
people with a plan for a new federalism. He has to build bridges of 
tolerance and understanding between the people of Quebec, not the 
politicians, and the rest of Canada. He has to build bridges of 
tolerance and understanding between Quebecers themselves.
<P>
	A few weeks ago I was in Montreal for a national unity rally and 
I was shocked, saddened and appalled. There is a polarization 
between the yes and the no sides. These individuals are reacting 
violently toward each other. Bridges of understanding are not 
developing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister must go into Quebec with all members of 
Parliament who want to keep the country together and bring forth a 
plan for a new federalism. It must involve a decentralization of 
powers to the provinces including Quebec. By decentralization I do 
not mean making a weak federal government, but being intelligent 
about it. Powers should be given to all the provinces in areas that 
they can manage more efficiently and cost effectively. We should 
keep within the federal government in Ottawa the powers that a 
strong federal government can manage better. That is for the sake 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has to dispel the myths which have 
developed between the separatists and people in the rest of Canada. 
In the last referendum half of the people who voted yes believed 
they would still have Canadian passports. They believed they could 
send members of Parliament to this House. They believed they 
could use the Canadian dollar. They believed they would be part of 
NAFTA and that business would continue as usual. That is a 
complete distortion of the truth.
<P>
	In Mr. Bouchard's speech on television on October 26 he 
stressed in English that the vote was about sovereignty and the rest 
of Canada must be prepared to recognize the results. In French he 
emphasized that the offer of political and economic partnership be 
made to the rest of Canada. Those are two very different ideas on 
the same very important topic. This has to be dispelled. The Prime 
Minister must outline very clearly to the people of Quebec what 
separation means and dispel the myths coming forth from the 
separatist politicians.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard likes to say that the economic situation in Quebec 
is going to be better than it is currently with Quebec as part of 
Canada. That is simply not true. Before the referendum his own 
financial analyst said that in the event of separation the people of 
Quebec would suffer dire economic and social consequences. That 
information was deliberately suppressed by the separatist 
leadership in Quebec. The Prime Minister must explain in no 
uncertain terms to the people of Quebec the consequences of 
separation.
<P>
	The premier of Quebec likes to say that the people in an 
independent Quebec would enjoy a situation such as  exists in 
Europe under the Maastricht treaty. The fact is the Maastricht 
treaty would provide Quebec with less monetary and fiscal control 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3521"> 3521 </A></B>
<P>
than what it has today. In fact, I cannot see an independent Quebec 
taking its monetary and fiscal orders from Ottawa but that is 
exactly what a Maastricht treaty would provide for a separate 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	I fear if the national unity issue is left up to the politicians, 
Canada is going to fracture. The Prime Minister has muddled 
through this issue. He is not prepared to lay it on the line, not only 
to the people in Quebec but also to the rest of Canada. If he believes 
he can muddle through this, if that is what his advisers are telling 
him, he is dead wrong because this country will fracture.
<P>
	The Prime Minister must deal with the people and work with all 
other politicians in this House. He must go into the trenches. He 
cannot stay in Montreal and Quebec City and deal with the 
separatist media there and expect to get his message across. He has 
to go eyeball to eyeball, flesh and blood, right into the rural areas of 
Quebec. He must meet with the people, understand their concerns 
and get the good ideas from Quebecers. He must address their 
concerns and their needs to preserve their beautiful language which 
is an integral and important part of the Canada we all know and 
love.
<P>
	It is important to preserve Quebec's distinctiveness and culture. 
If the Prime Minister gives the responsibilities of language and 
culture to the province of Quebec, then Quebecers are going to be 
the masters of their own cultural and linguistic destinies. Whether 
their language and culture survive will be entirely up to them. 
Personally, I deeply hope they do because they enrich all of us.
<P>
	The Prime Minister must also understand that if he is going to 
put forth ideas that are somehow unequal and are only for the 
people of Quebec and not for other Canadians, he faces the risk of 
having other areas in Canada fracture and separate.
<P>
	British Columbians are absolutely fed up with pandering to 
Quebec. They want equality for all people. They want Quebec to 
stay in Canada because from the bottom of their hearts they believe 
that the culture, language and contributions Quebec and Quebecers 
have made are invaluable to the definition of our country. Quebec's 
beautiful language and culture enriches us all.
<P>
	British Columbians do not want Quebec to stay in Canada as a 
group with special privileges and special laws and regulations that 
the rest of Canada does not enjoy. One of the problems we see in 
the world is that any time one group is given special privileges over 
another, disunity rather than unity is created.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will have to show a great deal of 
statesmanship if he is going to keep this country together.  It could 
be his legacy if he is effective in doing that. He must put a plan 
together on the national unity issue. I encourage him to look at the 
Reform 20-20 plan which has a plan A and a plan B. It has a 
sensible plan on the devolution of powers from the federal 
government and the separation of powers for all the provinces.
<P>
	We need to bring Canadians together. We are standing at a 
crossroads. The Prime Minister must lay down the guidelines for 
secession. I hope he uses this motion to define the terms of 
secession for the people in Quebec and outside Quebec. He must 
state the consequences of secession for all Canadians. He must 
include all MPs in this House. He must define and describe a new 
federalism. He must dissipate the intolerance that is taking place 
within Quebec. Mark my words. The intolerance that is brewing 
now is going to ultimately boil over in violence. That is not 
Canadian. If he does not realize it, I challenge him to go back on 
the streets and find out.
<P>
	I challenge people across the country, inside and outside Quebec, 
francophone and anglophone, to put themselves in their 
neighbour's shoes and understand where they come from. Together 
and united, we will build a stronger future for all of us. We must 
use our differences with respect and understanding to build a 
stronger country for all of us.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Motion No. 
206 proposes that in the opinion of the House the government 
should establish conditions for secession.
<P>
	The government has been persuaded that the hon. member 
introduced this motion with the best of intentions. The prospect of 
Quebec's separation, while not imminent, is certainly real. 
However, when he refers to the concept of distinct society as 
special privileges and refers to violence we fear that he shows the 
Reform Party's lack of understanding of the issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This past October 30, a majority of Quebecers said ``no'' to 
separation. Some of us hope that Canadians will not be confronted 
with the spectre of the secession of Quebec. Unfortunately, the 
Bloc Quebecois and its secessionist allies are the ones who refuse 
to recognize Quebecers' wishes.
<P>
	Last month, Premier Bouchard stated in the National Assembly: 
``If Canada rejects our outstretched hand, if Canada wants to 
impose vetoes on us, wants to keep us within Confederation against 
our will, we will withdraw by proclaiming sovereignty unilaterally. 
We have the right to do so, and we are going to exercise that right''. 
Premier Bouchard did us a favour when he made that statement 
because he made his true intentions very clear.  We must take Mr. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3522"> 3522 </A></B>
<P>
Bouchard at his word. The Government of Quebec has matched this 
statement with legal action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Premier Bouchard did us all a favour when he made that 
statement because he made his true intentions very clear. We must 
take Mr. Bouchard at his word. The Government of Quebec has 
matched those words with legal action.
<P>
	Quebecer Guy Bertrand is a founding member of the PQ. Mr. 
Bertrand says he became convinced of the tolerance of Canada and 
the benefits for Quebecers within Confederation when he realized 
Canada would allow a separatist party to sit in the House as the 
loyal opposition. So convinced was he that he decided to take the 
Government of Quebec to court.
<P>
	Mr. Bertrand hopes to force the provincial government to 
explain to Quebecers how Quebec could be taken out of Canada 
with only a magic wand and to expose this charade for what it is. 
The Government of Quebec is trying to have Mr. Bertrand's case 
dismissed.
<P>
	The provincial government told the Quebec Superior Court that 
the Constitution of Canada would not apply if Quebec seceded. 
Canadian courts would have no jurisdiction. That is an 
extraordinary statement coming from the government of a 
Canadian province.
<P>
	Consequently the government understands some of the thinking 
and shares some of the concerns expressed on these issues in the 
House and elsewhere. It understands why the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca drafted the motion we are debating 
today.
<P>
	However, while the federal government understands and is 
facing these challenges it is at the same time committed to acting in 
the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada has made its position very clear. In 
the throne speech in February, we renewed before Parliament our 
commitment to rise to the challenge of Quebec secession resolutely 
and with renewed energy and commitment.
<P>
	First and foremost, the government has put into place a true 
program of reform, a program that will be ongoing. Certain 
measures have, in fact, already been presented by the government 
and debated in this House, including the distinct society resolution, 
the regional veto, and the transfer of manpower training to the 
provinces.
<P>
	However, given the long term objectives of Premier Bouchard, 
the federal government also promised that: ``-as long as the 
prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, the Government 
will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the debate is 
conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of the 
process are fair, that the consequences are clear, and Canadians, no  
matter where they live, will have their say in the future of their 
country''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government has shown its resolve in response to a 
reply to the motion filed by the PQ government in the Bertrand 
case.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Let me restate what the federal position is not. The federal 
government does not agree with Mr. Bertrand on many things. The 
federal government does not wish to interfere with the capacity of 
the provincial Government of Quebec to call a consultative 
referendum on any subject, including separation. The Minister of 
Justice and other have been very clear on this matter before the 
House and Canadians.
<P>
	However, before the results of any referendum were used by a 
secessionist government as a political mandate to leave Canada, at 
a minimum the federal government would insist the question be 
clear and the consequences explained to voters. All participants in 
the debate among Quebecers would have to understand the 
fundamental consequences of their actions.
<P>
	Were this mandate ever achieved, Quebec would not have a right 
to secede unilaterally. There is simply no legal foundation for this 
under either Canadian or international law. This is not new or a 
surprise. Quebec's own commissions and inquiries have been 
consistently told the same thing many times.
<P>
	Some would argue so what, how can the law keep people in 
Canada? If the people speak, if the people choose, what is the law if 
not the will of the people? Would not a law seeking to deny people 
this fundamental right somehow be anti-democratic? That line of 
reasoning is deeply flawed. The rule of law is not an obstacle to 
change but provides a framework for change.
<P>
	The rule of law would allow secession to take place in an orderly 
fashion and to preserve important protections for all. If we begin as 
governments or citizens to discard the rule of law what remains 
would be chaos where we make up the rules as we go along, where 
we set aside protections in the law, where at best we would enter 
into an unknown, and that is not what Canadians want and not 
action the federal government, any federal government, would ever 
support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada cannot remain united if some of us say clearly, in 
response to a clear and fair question, that we want to leave Canada. 
After all, Canada is built on values of compromise and tolerance 
promoting our national identity.
<P>
	Since 1867, we have shared the burdens and the joys of 
nationhood. We have gathered together the fruits of this country, 
which many describe as the best in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3523"> 3523 </A></B>
<P>
	In this same vein of tolerance and compromise, however, 
Canadians would insist that any secession would have to be by 
negotiation and not unilateral. This is the objection of the federal 
government and many Canadians to the route chosen to date by 
Mr. Bouchard and other secessionists.
<P>
	Canada can be divided. It is certainly no prison. No one is forced 
to remain a Canadian or in Canada, but, at the same time, no one 
should have their rights denied arbitrarily, without due process of 
law. If Quebec were ever to secede, 30 million Canadians would 
expect, and no one would demand, that the governments would 
move beyond their differences, find a common ground and 
continue to create an environment favourable to all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member's motion touches on some of these themes. It 
may even use the federal government's statements to date as 
inspiration, but Reform would go further and faster than the federal 
government chooses. The federal government has made its 
approach clear and it stands by those decisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before speaking directly to Motion M-206, I 
would like to set the record straight regarding an aberration often 
heard in this House. It originates with the member who moved 
Motion M-206, the member for Esquimalt-Juan-de-Fuca. He said 
something to the effect that nearly only in Canada, a beautiful and 
democratic country, are sovereignist groups allowed to have a say.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I would like to remind him, just in case he does not know, that in 
Belgium there is a right wing Flemish party, called Vlaams Blok, 
which promotes independence for Flanders. Out of 150 members 
sitting in Parliament, 11 advocate independence. In Italy, the 
Northern League has sent separatists members to the Parliament. 
They number 59 out of 630. In Spain, there are three separatist 
sovereignist parties. Taiwan and the United Kingdom also have 
sovereignist parties. Canada is not the only country where this is 
allowed. This is democracy.
<P>
	If there is something totally undemocratic, it is Motion M-206. 
If you were to ask me to describe this motion in a few words, I 
would tell you that it is useless, it lacks intellectual rigour and is 
provocative.
<P>
	It is useless, because when you read it, you see it has only one 
purpose, namely to impose the will of the majority, not of 
Quebecers, but of Canadians, on Quebecers. This is not the first 
time we have said this, and I will say it again very calmly, Quebec 
sovereignty will be decided by Quebecers alone, not by English 
Canada, not by the rest of Canada. Quebecers will decide.
<P>
	This motion does not make any sense, especially when 
everybody uses the expression the ``people'' of Quebec.  Even the 
Prime Minister, last week, answering a question I had put to him, 
used the expression the ``people'' of Quebec. Everyone in this 
House, except perhaps for a few Reformers and a few Liberals 
sitting in front of me but who would probably feel more 
comfortable sitting beside me with Reform members, recognize 
that Quebecers are a people.
<P>
	It is obvious that the secessionist unit is comprised of a people 
meeting international standards, as stated in the motion, but it is 
also obvious that Quebecers are a people. So this motion is 
unnecessary in that regard.
<P>
	This motion lists five criteria, and I will go over each of them. 
The first criterion is that the unit be recognized as a people. This is 
unnecessary, as everyone in this House recognizes that we 
Quebecers are a people. We also showed in the last referendum that 
we were a responsible people, since we proposed the term 
``partnership'', which is very fashionable these days in the House.
<P>
	I am not saying that we invented it, but I think it was the first 
time the term ``partnership'' was used in this House. The Minister 
of Finance and the Prime Minister then turned around and used it at 
every opportunity. All this to tell you that we are a responsible 
people and that we have already proposed a few things.
<P>
	The motion says that the government should consider 
negotiating with any claim. Again, this is unnecessary because, if 
the hon. member had followed the referendum campaign a little 
more closely, he would have seen that this is in the standards, in the 
concrete measures proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, the Parti 
Quebecois and all the sovereignists in Quebec. They propose that 
some things be negotiated to benefit Quebec, of course, but also the 
rest of Canada. There are major issues to be negotiated.
<P>
	The third criterion in this motion is also quite ludicrous and 
unnecessary. I think this motion is wasting the very valuable time 
of the House. I would also say that, on the basis of the points I 
raised earlier, this motion lacks intellectual rigour. Indeed, this 
motion addresses several issues, including democratic rights and 
international law.
<P>
	This motion makes a grab for powers vested in legislative 
assemblies, as-and I think the hon. member did not make any 
secret about this-its sole purpose is to prevent Quebecers from 
voting again on their future, or at least to try to put up roadblocks 
by imposing an endless selection process. All this just for Quebec, 
to grab powers belonging to the Quebec National Assembly, among 
others, to try to subvert set rules and to interfere with the political 
judgment of a people.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3524"> 3524 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I think that these are extremely important criteria and that trying 
to legislate and put them down on paper results in the kind of 
nonsense we have here in Motion M-206.
<P>
	I also smiled when I read the second point, which says that ``the 
people must have been subject to a denial of political freedom or 
human rights in a discriminatory manner''.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, until there is evidence to the contrary, 
Canada is a democratic country. I think that everyone agrees to say 
this is one of our finest values, to which the people of Quebec, 
Ontario and the other provinces have all contributed. Correct me if 
I am wrong, but it is the democratic people of Quebec who will 
achieve sovereignty and, similarly, it is the democratic people of 
the rest of Canada who will negotiate a partnership with the 
newly-formed country called Quebec.
<P>
	It is also to lack intellectual rigour to try, through a motion, to 
interfere with the judgment passed on the wording of the 
referendum question. I am referring to here to item 4 of the motion, 
which states: ``a clear and precise question is asked as to whether 
the population in question wishes to secede from Canada''.
<P>
	If anything was made clear in the last referendum, this was it. 
The issue of sovereignty has been discussed extensively, and not 
just since 1995. I can remember, when I was elected in 1993, 
making speeches on sovereignty and promoting Quebec's 
independence; that was part of my mandate. Come on, this is really 
to ascribe to us intentions we do not have.
<P>
	The question will be clear. In fact, it was clear. But the important 
thing is that it is not up to the federal Parliament, to the Ontario 
Legislative Assembly, or to other provincial legislature to phrase 
the question. It is up to the Quebec National Assembly, as in the 
case of Newfoundland. Indeed, referendums are not held only in 
Quebec. Over the years, some also took place in other provinces. 
Never did the federal government, or a provincial government, 
interfere in the process.
<P>
	In 1948, Newfoundland joined Confederation with 52.34 per 
cent of voters supporting the idea. Did anyone claim it was not 
enough? If we can join Canada with 52.34 per cent of voters 
supporting the idea, we can certainly leave it with the same 
number. The Avalon peninsula said no to Confederation in a 
proportion of 67.18 per cent, but eventually joined it. There was no 
talk of partitioning.
<P>
	As you can see, this motion lacks intellectual rigour, to say the 
least. More importantly, it is pure provocation. To say that 66.6 per 
cent of the population must vote in favour of sovereignty is to 
provoke Quebecers. In the last federal election, some members in 
this House got elected with barely 35 per cent of the votes. Do we 
question their legitimate right to represent their riding? No, 
because this is democracy.
<P>
	When democracy speaks, there is not a parliament, an MP, or a 
constitution that can oppose the will of the people. This is what 
democracy is all about.
<P>
	Motion M-206 goes squarely against this principle. Fortunately, 
it is not a votable item and we will not see how many Reform 
members, and perhaps Liberals members, would have been 
tempted to support it. We would have voted strongly against the 
motion.

	If we are to solve the Canadian unity problem, it will not be by 
adopting such a motion. It will be by having dialogue. I would like 
to have a dialogue with the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
	One positive element of his speech, despite the Reform Party's 
lack of understanding of Quebec's needs and problems, was the 
language the distinctive culture in Quebec. He touched on the 
valuable contribution that Quebecers have made to the creation of 
this country. However, I still have serious doubts because when it 
came time for the Reform Party to recognize that great language 
and culture that make Canada unique and the efforts of Prime 
Minister in response to the passionate plea we made on October 27, 
the member and his party voted against the government's efforts to 
recognize Quebec's distinct society and the regional veto.
<P>
	We are on a dangerous treadmill. This is what I want to point out 
to the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. When he uses words 
like intolerance and violence they preoccupy me immensely. The 
member from the Bloc Quebecois implied the motion is 
provocative and may induce violence, that is exactly what I fear.
<P>
	The member also said his province is fed up with pandering to 
Quebec, again another form of intolerance, another form of 
showing we are not open to dialogue.
<P>
	Prior to the referendum premiers were begging Quebecers 
passionately, saying ``we will work hand in hand with you, your 
aspirations and concerns are our concerns''. However, the member 
today measured his province by how much we benefit in economic 
terms from the federation and how Quebec is being pandered to and 
how people are fed up with always responding to Quebec's 
demands.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3525"> 3525 </A></B>
<P>
	I remind the hon. member we made concessions to 
accommodate provinces when they joined Confederation. We 
made a concession for his province of British Columbia. We 
promised British Columbians: ``Join our family and we will build 
you a national railway''. That dream was realized in 1892, 
contributed to by the many immigrants who came to this country 
to help build that dream.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member where would British Columbians be if 
that national dream had not been realized. Would the prosperity the 
province realizes today have been realized? I doubt it.
<P>
	We made concessions for P.E.I., the smallest province of 
Confederation. We said: ``Join our family and we will make sure 
you are represented in the House of Commons and the Senate and 
we will build you a fixed link''. Quebecers paid for that national 
railway and for the fixed link. Quebecers did not say ``where is our 
fair share''?
<P>
	I am disappointed the member is not here. I believe if we are to 
solve the Canadian unity problem we must show respect for each 
other and have dialogue and understanding. I ask Reform Party 
members, who are now suddenly showing up in Quebec, being 
political opportunists, receiving petitions in my riding and other 
ridings, that if they are sincere why were they not involved in the 
unity debate during the entire referendum? Where were they?
<P>
	They talk about their 20-20 vision. I think this motion is 
unfounded, very dangerous and very intimidating.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, our government supports co-operation with the 
provinces and all our partners in order to develop new approaches 
and find constructive solutions.
<P>
	The Government of Canada does not intend in the slightest to 
promote confrontation, as is suggested in this motion, because it 
could undermine the renewal of federalism and especially our 
social harmony.
<P>
	We want to unite Canadians, not divide them. We have launched 
a process of national reconciliation and federation renewal. We 
have taken some concrete measures by implementing initiatives to 
restore the balance within our federation, to reinforce our economic 
union and enhance our social solidarity and to further define the 
devolution of powers, just like the hon. member himself wanted us 
to do.
<P>
	Canadians outside Quebec are open-minded and try to draw 
closer to their fellow citizens in Quebec, by recognizing that their 
differences are what makes our country's strength. If we work 
together to ensure our federation goes forward and meets the 
expectations of Canadians, we will have reached our goal without 
having to hold another referendum on secession.
<P>
	We believe we can work constructively with the Government of 
Quebec, given the open-mindedness shown by Premier Lucien 
Bouchard, as we do with all the other provincial and territorial 
governments. It is our duty, our responsibility.
<P>
	The next first ministers conference will deal with restoring the 
balance within our federation. It will give the federal and 
provincial governments the opportunity to discuss the priorities 
Canadians want us to set. This is why the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca seems inconsistent with 
our government's action plan. And this is why I do not support this 
motion and I urge my colleagues not to support it either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Motion M-206 brought forward today by my colleague 
from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca says that the government should 
establish beforehand five specific conditions with regard to any 
secessionist claim.
<P>
	I can understand why this motion is being debated. I can even 
say that, in a sense, I agree with my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca that the unilateral secession of any 
province is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the government was quite clear on 
that. We went to court to defend the rule of law. The federal 
government's intervention before the Cour supérieure du Québec is 
the direct result of the motion presented by the Government of 
Quebec. It claims that the secession of Quebec does not fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Canadian courts or the Constitution and that 
it is solely a matter of international law.
<P>
	The matter is now before the courts and a ruling will be made at 
the appropriate time. In the meantime, we are concentrating, as we 
have always done, on issues of interest to all Canadians, namely the 
economy, employment, growth, the renewal of the federation, 
equality, social justice as well as national reconciliation, which the 
Reform Party obviously has no interest in.
<P>
	Far from creating an environment favourable to national 
reconciliation, the positions adopted recently by members of the 
third party underline the fundamental issues that divide them.
<P>
	When did our colleagues from the Reform Party contribute to the 
debate with positive arguments, constructive solutions? Instead, 
they seem to be on the path of division and confrontation.
<P>
	While conditions for secession seem to be ``the'' main concern 
of Reform members, our government has clearly indicated its 
priorities in the throne speech. We are focusing our efforts on 
positive action that will prepare Canada for the challenges of the 
new millenium.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3526"> 3526 </A></B>
<P>
	Economic prosperity, employment, equality, social justice and 
national reconciliation, these are the issues of concern to 
Canadians. These are also the priorities established by our 
government.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	During the first half of its mandate, the government took some 
measures to set economic and budgetary conditions that would 
foster sustained growth and job creation. It undertook a major 
administrative reform, reduced the deficit, and took some trade and 
international investment initiatives.
<P>
	It is in this context that, since it assumed power, our government 
has created more than half a million jobs and reduced the 
unemployment rate by two points, so that, for the first time in five 
years, it is under 10 per cent.
<P>
	Thus, our government has made major changes in the past two 
years and it continues to put forward the measures announced in the 
throne speech to improve the workings of the Canadian federation. 
In this regard, let me remind the hon. member of the initiatives on 
which our government is focusing.
<P>
	First of all, our government promised to limit its spending power 
in exclusively provincial areas. Never before has the federal 
government offered to limit its powers outside formal 
constitutional negotiations.
<P>
	Moreover, at the request of its provincial counterparts, the 
government says that it will not create any shared cost program in 
sectors under provincial jurisdiction, without the agreement of a 
majority of provinces. Non participating provinces implementing 
such a program will be compensated. We believe that, with such 
co-operation and openness, we will promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	Secondly, our government is determined to find new avenues for 
cooperation with provinces to maintain national standards in social 
programs without imposing conditions and without unilateral 
implementation. It must be reminded that our social programs 
guarantee all Canadians access to comparable levels of service no 
matter where they live. That is what our government's commitment 
to social solidarity means.
<P>
	Thirdly, the government took the commitment to define more 
clearly the responsibilities of the different levels of government. 
This is done in cooperation with the provinces. We began 
withdrawing from areas which are more directly the responsibility 
of the provinces, municipalities and other stakeholders.
<P>
	In this regard, the proposal put forward last week by our 
colleague, the human resources development minister, is a concrete 
example of the fulfilment of a major commitment for our 
government and for most of the provinces, which had been seeking 
increased authority over manpower training for a long time. The 
announcement also signals a new co-operation between  both levels 
of government in the area of manpower training.
<P>
	Therefore, provinces, if they wish, will be able to have their own 
programs of employment measures, such as wage subsidies, 
income supplements, job creation partnerships as well as 
manpower services such as employment counselling and job 
placement.
<P>
	This is a practical example of the ability of federalism to adjust 
to the claims of its various partners and to the regional needs in the 
best interests of Canadians everywhere in Canada. We are also 
continuing with our plans to withdraw from a number of other 
activities, such as forestry, mining and recreation.
<P>
	Fourth, the federal government will continue to promote 
economic union. In order to ensure greater protection for individual 
and common interests, our government has undertaken to work in 
concert with the provinces, in order to reduce obstacles to internal 
trade and manpower mobility. We are also proposing to create, in 
co-operation with the interested provinces, a Canadian Securities 
Commission that will facilitate the circulation of capital.
<P>
	Fifth, the federal government is in favour of including in the 
Canadian Constitution a regional veto and recognition of the 
distinct identity of Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, on the question of conditions of secession, which seem 
to be the Reform Party's main preoccupation, the government has 
indicated that it would ensure that the rules regarding the question 
and the consequences of secession are clear for everyone, which 
was obviously not the case in the referendum last October 30.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that the next first ministers' 
conference is part of that process for the modernization of the 
federation. That meeting will be the perfect opportunity to examine 
ways to improve the workings of our federation and to bring about 
the changes that all Canadians want.
<P>
	Here is how our government intends to revitalize the Canadian 
federation: by proposing some positive answers to the concerns of 
Canadians, in an atmosphere of co-operation, dialogue and respect. 
This is also how we should, and we will, implement a more 
harmonious federation based on a larger consensus.
<P>
	Therefore, we ask the Reform Party to join in with the federal 
government, in order that we may work constructively towards the 
renewal of the federation, as all Canadians want us to do.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hour 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has 
now expired. This item is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until next Monday at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.).
