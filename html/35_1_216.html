	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of introducing right to know legislation for the protection of 
firefighters and other public servants who, in the course of duty, are confronted 
by fires or disasters involving potentially harmful substances such as toxic 
chemicals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to urge the 
House to support the motion. It has not been deemed votable but 
nevertheless it could be voted on and passed if there were a will 
to do so. The House can do this by unanimous consent. The 
procedure by which resolutions or private members' bills are 
deemed votable was designed so only a minimum number of 
motions and bills would be votable. It was not designed in any 
way to prevent more than the required amount from becoming 
votable, if the House chose to do so. I urge the House to do that 
today if there is a will on the government side to allow the 
motion to go forward. I will explain why I think that should be 
done.
<P>
	I thank my seconder in this instance, the member for 
Kamloops, for helping me today and also the International 
Association of Firefighters with which I have worked closely 
over the last little while in developing this motion, along with a 
couple of others, a notification protocol for infectious diseases 
and the public safety benefit.
<P>
	The motion urges the government to improve the safety 
regime for firefighters and other emergency response personnel. 
Firefighters as well as other emergency response personnel are 
often called on to risk their lives to deal with accidents and 
emergencies involving highly volatile and toxic chemical 
substances at great personal risk not just in the immediate sense 
but also in the long term sense. Studies have shown firefighters 
have higher vulnerability and a higher incidents of certain 
diseases associated with exposure to these kinds of toxic 
chemicals.
<P>
	They need to have rapid, accurate and complete information 
about these hazardous materials where lack of information can 
cost lives. It is the responsibility of the federal government to 
ensure all reasonable measures are taken to provide that 
information. That is what this motion is about.
<P>
	I take the opportunity of this debate to make a specific 
proposal. If the government is looking for something it could get 
behind in a concrete and practical way the passage of this motion 
would create a context in which it might do so.
<P>
	I will make a specific proposal for this kind of problematic 
situation involving toxic substances, accidents that occur during 
the transportation of hazardous materials. In other words, it is 
not only with respect to transportation that these things happen 
but in the transport sector we could, as I will go on to suggest, 
have a pilot project.
<P>
	Firefighters have been calling on the government to take the 
first steps in the development of a state of the art system to 
provide emergency response personnel with the information 
they need by taking advantage of the latest computer 
technologies and software.
<P>
	This is an issue on which there is clearly little occasion for 
partisan politics. I hope members from all sides of the House 
will support this motion and that the government will let it come 
to a vote if someone on the government side near the end of the 
debate could seek unanimous consent to have this go forward. I 
am not aware of any members of the House who are opposed to 
this. It is after all only a motion which asks the government to 
consider the advisability of it. For the House to pass this motion 
would afford Transport Canada an excellent occasion to move 
this important file forward.
<P>
	Accidents involving hazardous materials pose a number of 
special challenges to emergency response personnel. On the one 
hand the consequences of not reacting quickly and in the 
appropriate manner can result in the death or injury of not only 
emergency personnel but of large numbers bystanders if 
accidents occur in densely populated locals.
<P>
	On the other hand because such accidents occur relatively 
rarely, giving personnel very little experience in dealing with 
such emergencies and involve highly complex chemical 
compounds, it is often difficult for personnel to react quickly in 
the appropriate manner. Immediate access to information about 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13560"> 13560 </A></B>
<P>
contents of  containers and the necessary procedures to be 
followed is the key to improving this safety regime in Canada.
<P>
	The current system which uses placards on containers to 
identify the contents is not one that fulfils all the needs of 
emergency response personnel. Firefighters told us when we 
met with them recently at their national lobby in Ottawa that the 
placards do not always provide sufficient information to aid 
emergency workers and that these placards are often missing or 
destroyed by virtue of the very accident that has called them to 
the scene in the first place. We are in urgent need of an upgrade 
in the reporting system for these emergency response situations.
<P>
	Fortunately there is an emerging technology which would 
prove to be very useful in filling the gaps in the current system. 
Computer software along with communications links between 
firefighters and police dispatch stations and the transport 
companies is now being developed which would allow 
emergency response personnel almost instantaneous access to 
detailed information to be taken directly from transport 
companies' data bases.
<P>
	Not only could such a computer linkup provide firefighters 
with precise information about the contents of a container, it 
could also provide detailed guidance about the necessary safety 
precautions to be taken when dealing with the material in 
question.
<P>
	It has also been shown that such a computer linkup could help 
emergency response personnel in the event of train derailments 
involving passengers trapped in damaged rail cars. The linkup 
could provide rescue workers with detailed plans of how these 
rail cars are constructed with blueprints which could aid them in 
their search for trapped passengers.
<P>
	While this network is now a technological possibility it is up 
to the federal government to take a leadership role in developing 
the specific computer software and communications networks 
and putting a system in place.
<P>
	The International Association of Firefighters has been urging 
the government to begin the development process by 
establishing a pilot project in concert with industry, labour and 
local government stakeholders. It is proposed that such a pilot 
project take place in a major transportation centre that would 
permit the stakeholders to experiment with the new software and 
communications links and to demonstrate the system's 
effectiveness for later use across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Winnipeg with its thriving rail and truck traffic has been 
suggested as an ideal choice for such a project not by me but by 
those interested in this project; although Winnipeg is not always 
as thriving as I would like it to be on the rail side.
<P>
	I hope my fellow colleagues from the Winnipeg area would 
help make the case to the government for passing this motion 
and also that if there were a pilot project to follow the 
government consider very seriously using Winnipeg as a place 
where this project might proceed.
<P>
	The primary aim of going forward with such a project in a 
timely manner is to save lives, the lives of the firefighters who at 
present work in dangerous situations without all the information 
they need and the lives of residents in communities where 
accidents occur.
<P>
	There is also an important international dimension to this 
question. The American department of transport has already 
begun work on developing such communications networks and 
it is helping fund a pilot project in the Houston, Texas area 
called operation respond. All indications are that the experiment 
is proceeding well and that the department of transport will be 
moving to set up a national system of regulations for the 
transportation of hazardous materials.
<P>
	In the context of NAFTA, Canadian export and transport 
industries will be directly affected by such regulations and there 
will no doubt be pressure for harmonization. It is therefore 
imperative that Canada develop its own system which meets 
particularly Canadian needs so that in the future we will not be 
obliged to adopt uncritically or simply out of necessity the 
American regulations by default because we did not have the 
foresight to apply the available technology to a pressing safety 
issue in Canada on our own.
<P>
	I believe all members of the House will want to do whatever is 
in their power to improve the safety of firefighters and their 
fellow emergency response workers. Here is a case where the 
hype about the possibilities of the new information revolution 
might actually live up to expectations and do something 
concrete in terms of human health and human safety.
<P>
	Who would deny firefighters access to state of the art 
technology in situations in which they are laying their lives on 
the line? Who would deny them the right and the means to know 
exactly what they are handling in these very dangerous 
situations?
<P>
	Support for this motion would be an excellent means for 
members of the House to convey to firefighters on behalf of all 
Canadians we are grateful of the often heroic service they 
provide, and to convey our support for their efforts to improve 
safety in their work environment.
<P>
	I hope the government will allow members of the House to do 
this by passing this motion; allow members to convey the 
grateful support of Canadians to firefighters by using its 
discretion collectively speaking to allow this motion to come to 
a vote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13561"> 13561 </A></B>
<P>
or to be passed by unanimous consent. I cannot imagine that we 
would divide on the matter. Either we will pass it by unanimous 
consent or it will be talked out.
<P>
	I understand the government believes the wording of this 
motion is too vague and without specific reference to the 
transport of hazardous materials to be allowed to come to a vote. 
I have talked to the Ministry of Transport about this.
<P>
	I suggest to the contrary this motion simply conveys to the 
government the House's desire that it take action on improving a 
firefighter's safety and would give the government a welcome 
boost in the ongoing discussions between labour, industry and 
government stakeholders on the appropriate way forward.
<P>
	By letting this motion go forward the government would 
supply itself with an excellent spur to move a file forward which 
members on all sides of the House think should be moved 
forward. I hope the government has rethought its position over 
the course of the weekend. This is after all only a motion. If it 
passes, all the government is obliged to do is consider the 
advisability of bringing in this system. It would create the 
context, it would create a little parliamentary momentum.
<P>
	Last year I had a similar motion on a completely different 
topic and at the end of my speech I asked for unanimous consent 
that the motion be put to a vote at the end of the hour. Some may 
recall it was a motion having to do with the creation of a medal 
for Dieppe veterans.
<P>
	The procedure we followed at that time is the one I am 
suggesting could be done now, that we could decide now that the 
motion would come to a vote. People could speak to the motion 
and at the end of the hour we could allow it to pass.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	With that precedent in mind, knowing this is procedurally 
possible and that firefighters were here not so long ago reporting 
that no one disagreed with this suggestion, I seek unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I interpret the member 
correctly, is he asking for unanimous consent at this point in 
time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe we could agree now that 
at the end of the appointed hour the motion be put, if there were 
unanimous consent to agree to do that. If there is not, then we 
could seek it at the end of the hour, but we have to seek it at some 
point if there is a will in the House to allow the motion to pass.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I trust I get not only the 
intent but the spirit. The unanimous consent being proposed at 
this time by the member for Winnipeg Transcona would be that 
this motion become votable at the end of this hour of debate on 
this motion.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent. Resuming debate, the hon. member for St. Boniface.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to speak to this motion. I applaud my colleague's 
initiative, because he raises an extremely important issue, which 
must be discussed and eventually resolved.
<P>
	I myself have a particular interest in this motion because, for a 
number of years, I participated in conferences on this very issue. 
My greatest wish is for us to find an equitable solution for all 
concerned.
<P>
	As you know, the motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of introducing ``Right to Know'' legislation for the protection of 
firefighters and other public servants who, in the course of duty, are confronted 
by fires or disasters involving potentially harmful substances such as toxic 
chemicals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As was pointed out, this is an all encompassing motion. I 
assume it includes not only firefighters but also ambulance 
attendants and police officers. As I proceed to raise questions I 
do so in the spirit of trying to strengthen the motion, focus it, and 
come to some sort of resolution.
<P>
	No doubt it encompasses police officers and ambulance 
attendants, quite apart from firefighters and perhaps others. It 
might be useful to try to define those. No doubt it is also 
intended to cover goods transported by rail and truck, but it is 
important not to exclude air and marine modes as well.
<P>
	As to potentially harmful substances, this is very broad and 
may require further definition. For example, I believe it 
includes infectious diseases and infectious material. However, 
that remains to be discovered; perhaps it does not.
<P>
	When I have discussed this initiative on different occasions a 
number of questions have arisen. People want to know 
specifically what is to be accomplished. They want specifics. 
They want to make sure no one is excluded, that all who might 
benefit from this or a similar initiative are identified.
<P>
	The authorities also suggest there are some systems in place, 
which my colleague has mentioned, that respond at least in part 
to some of the concerns that have been voiced here. For 
example, there has been reference to the Transportation of 
Dangerous Goods Act. There has also been a reference to the 
CANUTEC system, an initial emergency response guide, which 
is really quite common, popular, and useful. It is available in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13562"> 13562 </A></B>
<P>
English and French  throughout Canada and the world. I am told 
it is a useful reference and useful tool as well.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The federal authorities also point out that it need not be the 
federal government by itself but that there are other partners 
involved, for example, the provincial and territorial 
governments, local governments, and perhaps even the private 
sector. Those are questions that need to be resolved before we 
can in fact proceed with a definitive proposal.
<P>
	With respect to an initiative on the part of the federal 
government, I want to tell my colleagues that the government is 
monitoring the pilot projects. The government is concerned with 
the scope of the project, what it is attempting to do and what it 
has in fact accomplished. They are also obviously concerned 
about cost. In today's world one has to be particularly prudent 
about taking on additional initiatives and cost is obviously a 
high priority.
<P>
	The federal government also wants to make sure there are 
partners, all of those people involved who could potentially 
benefit from the initiative. I have mentioned the various levels 
of government, but I should also mention that the private sector 
indeed is involved in certain sectors and needs to be involved.
<P>
	I want to study what is happening in the U.S. and elsewhere. I 
give my assurance I shall continue to be extremely supportive of 
such an initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, the transport department officials I spoke to felt 
that the proposal was perhaps a little too broad and not specific 
enough. I think, however, that my colleague is on the right track. 
We can provide extra protection to firefighters and others likely 
to be involved in disasters or difficult situations.
<P>
	The other extremely important consideration is the need for 
additional, clear information on pilot projects under way 
elsewhere. I felt that before moving in that direction, the 
government wanted to know all the facts, including how much it 
would cost and who the partners would be. It wanted to ensure 
that this would lead to something that would help not only 
firefighters but all those involved.
<P>
	For my part, I participated in a number of forums over several 
years. This is something I care about and a most important issue. 
We must realize that we will eventually have such a system. The 
basic question for me is not only the issues I raised, but how we 
could proceed, when, with whom and at what cost. I hope that 
the questions I just raised will be answered soon.
<P>
	I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but one of my colleagues across the 
way felt the need to shout to someone, and I lost my train of 
thought. Unfortunately, some people are not as polite as others. I 
now get back to the motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I said, I am interested in pursuing this proposal and I will 
do everything in my power to try to find some sort of solution. 
Clearly not today but hopefully in the near future we can come 
up with specifics with regard to a pilot project where the 
partners will be identified, where the costs will in fact have been 
found as well, and perhaps we can go forward and do something 
meaningful for our firefighters, our ambulance attendants, our 
police officers and others involved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as Bloc 
members, we are pleased to support this motion made by our 
colleague, the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	This is what we could call a forward-looking motion mainly 
concerned with the interest not only of a trade, namely 
firefighters, but also of the public in general.
<P>
	For one thing, the government has a role to play in the area of 
occupational safety. In fact, it can play several key roles by the 
influence it has, the example it sets and the legislation it passes.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Through its influence, the government can encourage 
employers to adopt more adequate safety measures. For 
instance, under existing legislation, since legislation does 
already exist-we may not find it adequate but it nevertheless 
exists-the government can check and make sure that safety 
standards are complied with in many areas, such as 
construction. The most common areas where risks are still high 
are the agri-food industry, the environment, transport and, of 
course, sites where explosives may be handled.
<P>
	Through the way it deals with its own employees, the 
government plays a crucial role. Naturally, as I said, the 
government must set the example, for the entire population is 
governed by the occupational safety legislation it enacts.
<P>
	Safety standards for government employees must also be 
monitored closely and, above all, the government must afford its 
employees the opportunity to put standards in place so that they 
are well protected. In addition, by introducing new legislation, 
the government can strengthen those standards which may seem 
inadequate or at the very least deficient at this time.
<P>
	In our view, this is a fundamental role of government, 
especially since new technologies, such as nuclear energy and 
all the related areas, have developed rapidly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13563"> 13563 </A></B>
<P>
	This fundamental role has become even more essential with 
the proliferation of chemicals and toxic substances used in 
various industries to develop new products. Many 
environmental disasters in recent years have shown how 
important government action is when it comes to protecting 
those government employees responsible for managing such 
disasters.
<P>
	We need only think back to the explosion-in other countries, 
but we cannot be spared forever-of the nuclear power plant in 
Chernobyl or the oil spill off the coast of Alaska. These two 
examples clearly show the kind of hazards to which government 
employees are exposed.
<P>
	Closer to home, the fairly recent devastating fire in 
Saint-Basile-le-Grand and the lead contamination incident in 
Saint-Jean are other examples which show that legislation is 
crucial in this field, whenever chemical and toxic products are 
used.
<P>
	The Bloc will therefore support the motion. We were hoping 
that there would be a vote on it but, unfortunately, the required 
unanimous consent was not reached. Again, the government 
must be a leader in the protection against dangerous products. It 
can, through its attitude toward its public servants and the 
public, and also by tabling a new bill, make the job of many 
workers much safer.
<P>
	Firefighters associations, including the International 
Association of Firefighters, have been urging the government 
for years to set up a national computerized information system 
on dangerous products.
<P>
	With such a system, as soon as the alarm went off, firefighters 
would have information on the location of the fire and would be 
able to react accordingly so as to prevent greater damage or 
make sure that they did not pointlessly endanger their lives and 
their health or those of the public.
<P>
	The presence of dangerous products on the site of a fire can be 
extremely costly, even fatal, for those involved. Recently, in a 
small village in Quebec, firefighters answered a call to put out 
what looked like an ordinary barn fire. However, because they 
did not have adequate information concerning the premises, the 
firefighters used normal techniques to put out the fire, without 
being aware of the danger to which they were exposed 
themselves.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	There was a propane tank inside the barn, that no one had any 
reason to suspect was there. After they set up their equipment 
and started fighting the fire, the tank exploded. Seven 
firefighters were killed instantaneously in the blast and several 
others were injured. This catastrophe could easily have been 
avoided if the firefighters had known that the barn concealed a 
deadly bomb.
<P>
	Seven lives were lost, and the only thing the speaker who 
preceded me, an hon. member from across the way, was 
concerned about was the cost. Do other lives have to be lost 
before they take action?
<P>
	Another bill is currently before the House, Bill C-68 on 
firearms. Why is the government in such a hurry to take action? 
It is in such a hurry because 14 students were murdered at a 
university in Quebec by a lunatic who was in legal possession of 
a firearm. Because 14 human lives were lost, the House is 
debating a bill on firearms, and the cost of implementing and 
administering it are of no concern to the government. What it is 
trying to do is protect the lives of Canadians, protect 
everybody's life.
<P>
	There are other causes of loss of human life each week in 
Canada: toxic spills during transport by rail, oil spills on the 
ocean, the use of chemical fertilizers which pollute or certain 
toxic substances, such as pesticides or insecticides. Many toxic 
substances which are widely used, sometimes carelessly, are 
decidedly very dangerous in the long run.
<P>
	We are proposing preventative measures, which sometimes, 
actually not just sometimes but almost always, are less costly 
than deterrents.
<P>
	In the opinion of the International Association of Fire 
Fighters, the computerized system currently in place, 
CANUTEC, is not well adapted. Towns with firefighting 
brigades have already put in place their own systems. I know 
that, before the new year, cities are going to convert to this 
system which will inform them before they respond to a fire 
alarm whether dangerous goods could be at the site. Towns are 
already absorbing the cost of these systems, so, there is no 
reason for the government to claim that additional costs will be 
involved. Local organizations will already be assuming the bulk 
of them.
<P>
	Therefore, through such legislation, the government not only 
would increase the safety of workers but also would give peace 
of mind to all citizens who have to live near or deal on a daily 
basis with such life threatening products or environments, 
which would improve their standard of living and protect them.
<P>
	For these reasons, we support this motion and hope that it will 
become votable as soon as possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Motion 136, proposed by the 
hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of ``Right to Know'' legislation for the protection of firefighters 
and other public servants who, in the course of duty, are confronted by fires or 
disasters involving potentially harmful substances such as toxic chemicals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a very broad statement. I am surprised we are talking 
to such a statement because to my mind it would be a given that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13564"> 13564 </A></B>
<P>
kind of information would be available or  that there would be 
processes in place to provide such information.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion was developed out of a genuine concern for the 
safety of firefighters. These people seem to be lacking the 
necessary information so they can do their jobs effectively or as 
effectively as they would like to do it. I equate it to an 
emergency department in a hospital. Emergency staff really do 
not know what they are dealing with until the patient gets there.
<P>
	I commend the member for Winnipeg Transcona for bringing 
this problem to our attention. Because of the nature of the 
firefighters' job it is not often they are actually in the news 
unless some very unfortunate situation occurs. Several recent 
incidents highlight the danger of the nature of the firefighters' 
job.
<P>
	Recently in Ottawa firefighters had to respond to a fire that 
turned out to be in a house that was used mainly for drug 
purposes. When the firefighters arrived at the fire they rushed 
into the building to put the blaze out. They moved as quickly as 
possible according to procedures for firefighting. They were not 
expecting or necessarily looking for exposed needles and other 
dangerous drug paraphernalia. The irony is that the local police 
were aware it was a drug house but because of concern at 
overstepping the bounds of privacy, the information was not 
shared with another emergency response group. I find it 
phenomenal that they cannot work in partnership and share 
information that relates to an incident.
<P>
	That is a concern we must definitely address, if not through 
legislation proposed in this motion, then the government should 
be looking at other ways to get around the letter of the law and 
use some common sense. Information should be shared among 
the principal players that are addressing the same concerns, 
especially when safety is involved. We must be practical and use 
some common sense on the issue.
<P>
	Another issue which relates to the whole attitude of how 
emergency response personnel deal with injured persons would 
be to keep in mind today's environment in relation to infectious 
diseases. HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis are two diseases that 
come to mind that can cause a great deal of concern not only to 
firefighters but any other emergency response personnel.
<P>
	In response to these valid concerns, groups such as the 
International Association of Firefighters have done a lot of work 
in researching the problem. That research is available to us to 
pursue. The association has called on the government to take 
steps to protect firefighters while they are performing their 
duties. One of the arguments put forward is that firefighters 
deserve to know what hazardous materials may be present at any 
incident. That follows logic. If firefighters are called to a 
potentially hazardous situation, it sounds very logical to be able 
to pass on information about what they are facing and what they 
are dealing with.
<P>
	That is a principle we can address by looking at a better 
communication and perhaps addressing the Privacy Act or 
situations involving that act.
<P>
	A second principle would be access to reliable information 
that will save lives by ensuring that firefighters use the most 
effective response techniques at any incident. The previous 
speaker talked about a propane tank in a barn. If somebody was 
aware the tank was there, that information should have been 
available to the firefighters responding to the fire.
<P>
	Both arguments put forward by the IAFF are certainly valid. 
The principles involved in them are certainly worth looking at. 
They are very timely. There must be numerous options for 
addressing the proposals by the association that we can look at 
and it is time we did. This motion presents a couple of 
suggestions in relation to ways of addressing that.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The IAFF supports the establishment of a computerized 
national emergency response. This is one suggestion on how to 
address these issues. It would provide accurate information to 
firefighters at the scene of a hazardous material incident. The 
system would provide not only information for stationary 
incidents such as the propane tank in the barn, but also for 
hazardous materials that are on the move.
<P>
	A system which deals with materials in stationary structures 
should certainly be looked at for a couple of identifiable 
reasons. We are already doing one through the women's program 
in many institutions such as hospitals, et cetera. The other one 
would be to prevent firefighters from going into the barn 
without knowing about the propane tank.
<P>
	I would like to move on to the computerized system for 
materials in transit. A system is already in place which requires 
little placards to be put on vehicles. One of the problems 
occurring with that is that the placards may not be up to date. 
Therefore, firefighters can arrive at a derailed train and find the 
placard is not up to date or they may not even see the placard 
because of fire. There are situations in the system which really 
do not address all the problems.
<P>
	A computerized system seems to be one very good answer. 
However it will only be as good as the information being put into 
it. The government is suggesting that this system is not up to par 
in relation to providing the kind of information that would 
facilitate the problem that firefighters have.
<P>
	In the world of technology today, I am suggesting that system, 
if it is not here now, is not far away. We should be looking at it 
very seriously as a possible solution. We should be doing some 
research and investigation of it and figuring out what the cost of 
it is going to be. If it is plausible it should be implemented on a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13565"> 13565 </A></B>
<P>
test basis some place to see whether or not it will address the 
problem.
<P>
	The motion deals not only with small aspects of the problem 
but is all encompassing. It deals with stationary situations, 
movable situations, health and all other aspects. Therefore, 
because of the nature and broadness of this motion and the fact 
that it is a problem that should be solved, we should be looking 
at it. It is not an isolated type of thing. It is a general thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to make a few comments on private 
member's motion M-136 presented by the member for 
Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	The motion urges the government to consider the advisability 
of introducing right to know legislation for the protection of 
firefighters and other public servants who in the course of their 
duties are confronted by fires or disasters involving harmful 
substances.
<P>
	Let me first commend the member for bringing the issue up 
for discussion through his private member's motion. I 
personally know the member to be a politician of vision and 
passion and a vigorous and eloquent defender of worker 
interests.
<P>
	Those of us on this side of the House share the concern he 
brings to occupational safety and health. We too are appalled by 
the number of accidents and fatalities that annually occur in our 
workplaces. We also believe that work in Canada ought to be a 
rewarding and satisfying activity that does not pose undue risk 
to those who must perform it.
<P>
	The good news is that because many innovative measures 
have been taken over the years, considerable progress has been 
made in the area of occupational safety and health.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The intent of the member's motion is something upon which I 
think we can all agree. However, its fatal flaw is that it does not 
fall under federal jurisdiction. If I may say so, the member is 
knocking on the wrong door. Labour related matters including 
occupational safety and health issues are mainly a provincial 
and territorial responsibility. Requiring employers to provide 
information on hazardous substances to emergency response 
personnel is a matter which provincial and territorial authorities 
need to address.
<P>
	As the member may know, occupational safety and health 
legislation in Canada is based on the internal responsibility 
system. This arrangement recognizes the employer's right to 
manage an enterprise in an efficient manner as well as the 
employer's responsibility to protect the safety and health of the 
employees. It also recognizes three fundamental rights of 
workers: the right to participate, the right to refuse dangerous 
work, and the right to know.
<P>
	Since 1988 Canada has had in place a nationwide system to 
provide information on hazardous material being used in the 
workplace. Known as WHMIS for workplace hazardous 
materials information system, it established a uniform 
identification system for dangerous ingredients in the 
workplace. It came about because in the early 1980s business, 
labour and government realized that Canadian workplaces were 
woefully lacking the kind of information necessary to handle 
safely the kind of materials and equipment which were being 
introduced in the workplaces of Canada.
<P>
	The system was comprised of four features: labelling 
requirements, the provision of material safety data sheets, 
worker education, and protection for confidential business 
information. WHMIS ensures that the hazardous materials 
produced, imported into or used in Canadian workplaces are 
adequately identified by suppliers using standard criteria. It 
requires the data sheets on hazardous materials to be transmitted 
by suppliers to employers and subsequently to employees. It 
obliges employers to provide their employees with adequate 
professional training on how to use the materials.
<P>
	By effective dissemination and information through WHMIS, 
employers and workers get the data and knowledge required to 
communicate with one another, making possible the kind of 
co-operative efforts necessary to enhance safety and health in 
the workplace. Because employees have firsthand knowledge of 
the workplace, their involvement is essential. For employees to 
be able to assume responsibility for workplace safety and health 
they must be able to recognize what is going on and understand 
the changes occurring in the workplace. WHMIS ensures that 
workers have the information they need to make the decisions 
which they must make. In short, WHMIS is a response to the 
right of employees to know the hazards of the materials with 
which they work and the way to safely handle such substances.
<P>
	It would not be an exaggeration to say that WHMIS is the 
most advanced information system in the field of occupational 
safety and health in the world. It is a system which works and, if 
I may say so, it is a system we can proudly speak of 
internationally. It should also be mentioned that WHMIS was 
the result of an extraordinary collaborative effort which brought 
together not only the governments in Canada but also organized 
labour and the business community. No one sector, no one 
government acting alone could deal with this issue in an 
effective and efficient manner.
<P>
	WHMIS legislation in each of the jurisdictions throughout 
Canada is harmonized legislation based on a model regulation 
which was developed during the consultative process. 
Regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction ensure compliance 
within its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13566"> 13566 </A></B>
<P>
boundaries. WHMIS has been successfully implemented in all 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	I think most officials and informed observers believe that its 
successful implementation was due to the fact that potential 
problems were identified by the stakeholders during the design 
stage when steps could be taken to minimize any possible 
adverse impacts in the workplace. Although the process was 
time consuming, its participatory nature made possible a 
relatively smooth implementation.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	As I indicated, most emergency response personnel, that is, 
the employees alluded to in the member's motion, come under 
provincial jurisdiction. Those who fall under federal 
jurisdiction, including firefighters, receive their WHMIS 
information and training as required by part II of the Canada 
Labour Code, the part that deals with occupational safety and 
health issues and by the provisions of part X of the Canada 
occupational safety and health regulations.
<P>
	The member might be interested to know that presently a 
committee of labour and business representatives and 
government officials is reviewing part II of the Canada Labour 
Code. Among other things it is considering a recommendation 
that part X of the Canada occupational safety and health 
regulations be changed to indicate the local health and safety 
committees which would participate in the development of an 
inventory of hazardous substances. This inventory would then 
be made available to health and safety committees, health and 
safety representatives to the fire department and to the 
employees' physicians on request.
<P>
	At the present time only the province of Ontario has a 
provision in its occupational safety and health act requiring 
employers to provide a material's safety data sheet to fire 
departments and local medical officers of health upon request.
<P>
	Ontario is to be commended for taking the lead in this area. 
The member might consider approaching the other provinces, 
perhaps beginning with British Columbia and Saskatchewan to 
urge them to consider implementing the kind of legislation he 
has asked this House to implement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the hon. 
member's motion.
<P>
	I want to express my very deep concern for the welfare of this 
country's emergency response workers who risk their lives to 
protect ours. Most Canadians cannot begin to conceive the 
nightmare these individuals must be living through wondering 
in doing their jobs to the best of their abilities whether they have 
put their own health in jeopardy. We cannot imagine the fear and 
trepidation all emergency workers must feel when they respond 
to a call never knowing what danger awaits them.
<P>
	Canada owes a great deal to the dedicated men and women 
who put their lives on the line each day for our health and safety. 
I can reassure the House this government does not take their 
risks lightly. These risks are taken so seriously that this 
government along with our provincial counterparts, industry 
and labour have for some time now been developing programs to 
protect not only emergency response workers but also those in 
the transportation sector and those handling hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace.
<P>
	Under the transportation of dangerous goods regulations, for 
example, a United Nations number or product identification 
number and the shipping name of a commodity must be on the 
label and the shipping document. Even in the absence of a 
shipping name or a product identification number or a placard or 
label the product may be identified by contacting the Canadian 
Transport Emergency Centre or CANUTEC using any of the 
following information: the flight number; the call sign if the 
goods are being transported by ship; reporting marks and car 
number if it is being transported by rail; carrier and truck or 
trailer number and carrier and licence plate number if it is being 
transported by road.
<P>
	In the event of an emergency, the firefighter can call 
CANUTEC which has an inventory exceeding 320,000 material 
safety data sheets. CANUTEC is a national bilingual advisory 
service provided by Transport Canada to assist emergency 
response personnel in handling dangerous goods emergencies. 
CANUTEC has established a scientific data bank on chemicals 
manufactured, stored and transported in Canada. It is staffed by 
professional chemists experienced in interpreting technical 
information and providing advice which can be obtained by 
calling collect on a 24-hour basis.
<P>
	CANUTEC is able to immediately provide the relevant 
information by accessing its database through the use of key 
words such as the UN number, the product identification number 
or shipping name required on the transportation of dangerous 
goods shipping label and shipping documents.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, part VII of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act 
requires that shippers and importers of certain dangerous goods 
have an emergency response assistance plan, ERAP, approved 
by Transport Canada. Currently there are approximately 14,000 
such plans covering over 4,000 organizations entered into the 
transportation of dangerous goods directorate's national 
registry. All of these plans are audited.
<P>
	Due to the seriousness of safety and health problems of 
hazardous chemicals used every day in the workplace, the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed following 
a consensus proposal developed through extensive consultation 
with industry and labour representatives to implement a 
workplace hazardous materials information system. This 
system is a national  program to reduce workers' deaths and 
injuries by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13567"> 13567 </A></B>
<P>
providing workers and employees with health and safety 
information about hazardous workplace chemicals. This system 
is implemented through interlocking federal and provincial 
legislation under the hazardous products act and in response to 
the workers' right to know the hazards of the materials with 
which they work.
<P>
	Under the hazardous products act, suppliers of hazardous 
materials must provide precautionary labelling and material 
safety data sheets to employers. Complementary provincial 
legislation requires employers to develop appropriate 
workplace labelling and other forms of warning about hazardous 
materials produced in their workplace processes and make data 
sheets available to their employees and provide for worker 
education on the safe use of hazardous materials.
<P>
	Furthermore in the province of Ontario, the Ontario 
Occupational Safety and Health Act requires that employers 
provide fire departments with data sheets upon request. There is 
no question we must continue to address the needs and concerns 
of emergency response personnel, such as firefighters as well as 
all other workers using hazardous chemicals.
<P>
	Our goal is where possible to continue improving the systems 
of hazard communication for the benefit of all workers. We want 
emergency responders to have access to the most up to date 
information on prevention methods available. We are 
encouraging close co-operation between employers and 
employees to ensure that they have appropriate training and 
equipment to deal with out of control situations.
<P>
	It is clear that the protection of Canadians, particularly those 
whose job it is to protect the general population is tremendously 
important to this government. In co-operation with the 
provinces, industry and labour we are doing everything within 
our jurisdictional power to provide emergency response workers 
with the necessary vital information to assist them in carrying 
out the dangerous work in as safe a manner as possible.
<P>
	The intent of the motion is an honourable one. The 
government will support any strategy or technique that will 
provide protection for our citizens involved in such an 
honourable and extremely dangerous endeavour. The intent of 
this motion can become a reality with the co-operative efforts of 
the federal and provincial levels of government plus the others 
concerned and involved in the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to participate in what probably is one of the most 
important private members' debates we have seen in this session 
of Parliament. We are making an effort to listen to the lobbyists 
for the firefighters particularly but also the police forces and 
ambulance services across Canada which have been asking for 
this initiative for many years.
<P>
	I want to speak enthusiastically in favour of the initiatives 
taken by the member for Winnipeg Transcona. If this motion 
passes by all of the parties in the House of Commons, it will go a 
long way in saving lives and making the work that the 
emergency response personnel carry out much safer.
<P>
	Previous speakers have acknowledged that emergency 
response personnel, particularly firefighters, are often called 
upon to deal with volatile and toxic chemical substances. If 
there has ever been a time for rapid, accurate and complete 
information about these hazardous materials, the time is now 
more than ever before.
<P>
	Accidents involving hazardous materials pose a number of 
special challenges to emergency response personnel. By not 
acting quickly the result can be death and injury, to say nothing 
about bystanders, particularly if the accident takes place in a 
densely populated locale.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	It is sufficient to say that we have had the debate. We have 
heard from all parties in the House of Commons. We have heard 
enthusiastic support for an initiative that simply calls upon the 
government to consider appropriate legislation and to take 
appropriate action.
<P>
	I seek unanimous consent for the motion to be accepted to 
allow the initiative to continue forward.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the hon. member for Kamloops. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like the record to show that government members said no to this 
private member's motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest respect 
to the member for Winnipeg Transcona and the important 
motion he raised before the House today, that is not a point of 
order.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the 
order is dropped from the Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In view 
of the extraordinary number of amendments and in view of the 
fact there is a limit on the debate today, I think you would find 
unanimous consent to deem the motions in each group put to the 
House when they have been put as you have just said.
<P>
	If you indicate to the House that we will be debating Motions 
<I>x</I>, <I>y</I> and <I>z</I>, the motions would then be before the House for debate 
without your having to read the motions to the House. They are 
deemed moved and seconded.
<P>
	Similarly this evening, when it comes to the votes, the same 
would apply. The Speaker could say the question before the 
House is on Motion No. 26, for example, and the vote would 
follow on that motion without having to put the motion. It would 
save us a lot of time today in view of the very large number of 
motions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the parliamentary secretary. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just to be helpful to the 
House, in group No. 1 Motions Nos. 1, 10 and 158 stand in the 
name of the member for Algoma; Motion No. 167, the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville; Motion No. 266, the hon. 
member for Kamloops; and Motion No. 267, the hon. member 
for Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	I will begin the order of debate by recognizing each of these 
four members and then we will follow the normal sequence for 
debate. I will begin with the member for Algoma, followed by 
the member for Yorkton-Melville, the member for Kamloops 
and the member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. Then we will 
follow the normal sequence of government, opposition and so on 
and so forth, according to the wishes of whoever may be seeking 
the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after many 
months of discussion and debate we have come to an important 
point in time as far as Bill C-68 is concerned.
<P>
	My three motions in this group deal with one of the most 
fundamental issues I have tried to express over past months both 
in this place and in my constituency. They concern the need to be 
respectful toward the legitimate gun owning community in 
Canada. I am speaking particularly of the many hundreds and 
thousands of legitimate gun owners in my riding of Algoma who 
feel strongly with pride about their firearms ownership. They 
believe as I do that they properly own and use firearms.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	My first motion deals with the title. The current title of the 
bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An act respecting firearms and other weapons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is my proposal in this motion that we simply refer to the act 
as an act respecting firearms and related matters. The inclusion 
in the title of the word weapons places a negative nuance on the 
legitimate gun owning community in Canada. In the hands of 
legal gun owners firearms are not weapons. They are only in the 
hands of criminals.
<P>
	It is important to send the right message. In so doing if we 
could amend the title by simply saying an act respecting 
firearms and related matters we would send the right message.
<P>
	My second amendment in this group relates to the purpose 
clause. I am proposing an amendment to the purpose clause 
which I should like to read to the House. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.1) generally to promote firearm safety and reduce firearm related crime 
without jeopardizing the reasonable uses for firearms in Canadian society or 
imposing an undue administrative and financial burden on Canadian taxpayers, 
including legitimate firearm owners;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The message that I have consistently tried to convey 
throughout the months leading up to this point is that we have 
many situations where firearms are misused or are improperly 
stored. The message the government wants to give is that those 
who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13570"> 13570 </A></B>
<P>
commit crime and in so doing use a firearm need to be dealt with 
swiftly and firmly.
<P>
	The message must also be that those who legitimately own 
firearms and use them for recreational or sustenance hunting, 
for target shooting, for collecting or for use in occupations 
deserve our respect. They represent Canadians across the 
country who properly own and use firearms.
<P>
	I would have preferred a preamble to the bill, but that not 
being possible I believe this statement in the purpose clause 
would clearly state to Canadians, to the legitimate firearms 
community, that the bill is not intended to be a punishment for 
them because they happen to own firearms. The bill is to deal 
with crime and criminals. The provisions that deal with the legal 
firearms community are simply part and parcel of a bigger 
program to deal with crime and firearms abuse.
<P>
	The final amendment in the group I am putting forward, 
seconded by my colleague from Parry Sound-Muskoka, is that 
there should be a periodic review of the legislation by the 
minister. This is to acknowledge that no piece of legislation can 
be perfect. It must be our duty in this place and the duty of the 
minister to look on a regular basis at how effective and how 
efficient the legislation is operating, on the one hand as it 
operates in relation to the legal gun owning community, and at 
on the other hand how it is operating with respect to the criminal 
abuse and misuse of firearms.
<P>
	Periodic review is very important. it cannot start tomorrow 
because the bill has not yet passed. It cannot start on January 1, 
1996 because the first stage of the program will just be starting. 
However I believe a few years after the program is in place there 
should be a first review. I suggest the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>112.1 (1) The minister shall periodically conduct a review of this act and the 
regulations and shall table a report on the review in the House of Commons 
within 12 months of commencing the review.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The first review must be conducted no later than December 31, 2003-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And every five years thereafter.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	I have chosen the year 2003 because it is the end of the first 
five-year period after the beginning of the registration program.
<P>
	I am hopeful that this set of amendments, which I encourage 
my colleagues to support me on, will help to assure the legal 
firearms community that there will not be reams of red tape 
involved in what I expect to be a simple and inexpensive system 
for firearms owners; that it is not a tax grab by government; that 
it will not be an untoward invasion of privacy; and that it will not 
lead to the mass confiscation of firearms.
<P>
	Instead of discouraging young people from entering target 
shooting sports or recreational hunting, the various provisions 
in the act will continue to encourage the pursuit of those very 
legitimate and honourable undertakings.
<P>
	I encourage the House to look seriously at these amendments 
and I look forward to the House's support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of my constituents and all the responsible 
firearms owners who have written me over the last year and a 
half, it is an honour and a privilege to be one of the few members 
of Parliament who will have an opportunity to speak during the 
six hours of limited debate granted to us by the arrogant and 
dictatorial Liberal government.
<P>
	While I have the privilege of representing my constituents in 
the debate against Bill C-68, literally dozens of members of 
Parliament will be denied that right because of the six-hour time 
allocation imposed by the tyranny of the Liberal majority.
<P>
	Voters send their MP to Ottawa to be their voice in 
Parliament, and what do the Liberals do but take the voters' 
right to be represented away from them by using 
anti-democratic measures like time allocation and closure and 
by making MPs vote according to the wishes of the Prime 
Minister, not the people of their riding. It makes me sad and it 
should make every Liberal member who did not oppose this 
abuse of power sad too.
<P>
	The Liberals abuse their majority to do anything they want 
because they know there is nothing voters can do to stop them 
until the next election. I know there are about seven million gun 
owners who are just waiting for the next election. Considering 
what happened to the Liberal Party in Ontario last week, I think 
there are some Liberal backbenchers who are pretty worried 
about the direction in which their party is taking them.
<P>
	Last Thursday the Liberals abused their power by limiting the 
time for debate on three bills, Bills C-68, C-41, and C-85. In 
doing so the Liberal government limited debate on three of the 
most controversial issues ever to be debated in the House, gun 
control, sexual orientation and MP pensions. By forcing time 
allocation the Liberals have declared their highest priorities to 
be gun control, MP pensions, and including sexual orientation in 
the sentencing legislation.
<P>
	Personally, I do not believe these controversial issues are 
priorities for the people of Canada. I am sure that if the people 
knew how democracy was getting a kick in the teeth here in 
Ottawa there would be a lot more concern expressed. I wonder if 
the Liberals are hoping voters will forget this by the time the 
next election is announced.
<P>
	Today I am introducing two amendments to Bill C-68 that 
would automatically repeal any and all gun control measures in 
five years unless the provisions have proven to be cost effective 
by the auditor general in improving public safety and reducing 
violent crime committed with firearms. If any gun control 
measure is not cost effective in improving public safety and in 
saving lives, it should be discontinued in favour of more cost 
effective measures. Is that not common sense?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13571"> 13571 </A></B>
<P>
	It will be difficult for the Liberals to argue against my sunset 
clause amendment because they will have to argue that they 
support gun control measures even though the auditor general 
cannot find any evidence to show the measures to be cost 
effective at reducing violent crime involving firearms. If the 
Liberals oppose this amendment it will be clear to everyone in 
Canada that public safety is not their primary purpose in 
bringing forward this gun control bill.
<P>
	Will the Liberals really stand up and say they support gun 
control measures that do not work? Will the Liberals tell 
Canadians they do not care whether gun control measures are 
cost effective or not? Will the liberals tell Canadians they cannot 
afford to implement new criminal justice measures that would 
save more lives because they are wasting money on ineffective 
gun controls?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	There should be a sunset clause in all legislation. We have too 
many laws. If they are not cost effective, they should be tossed 
out. We are creating a huge bureaucracy and we need to spend 
money in this place more carefully. We are the stewards of the 
public purse, and all legislation should be examined to see if it is 
cost effective, not just the gun control measures.
<P>
	The reason we need a sunset clause in this legislation is 
because gun control in general and most of the measures 
proposed in Bill C-68 defy all logic. First of all, gun control will 
not improve public safety. It will do the exact opposite. Gun 
control and registration of all firearms will mean more crime, 
more injuries, more expense, more deaths and more victims. I 
wish I had time to prove each of these, but the debate is very 
limited.
<P>
	The justice minister says he has no intention of confiscating 
guns and then he proceeds to ban over 550,000 handguns and 
19,000 rifles. What are the people to believe, the minister's 
assurances or his actions? The justice minister says he no longer 
believes that only the police and military should have firearms, 
and then he proceeds to give himself the power to prohibit all 
firearms in Canada without bringing any of the prohibition 
orders before Parliament. The people do not believe the 
minister's slick lawyer talk because his actions speak louder 
than his words.
<P>
	Bill C-68 will give drug dealers more rights than law-abiding 
responsible firearm owners. This bill will run roughshod over 
every Canadian's fundamental rights and freedoms, including 
their right to own, use, and enjoy private property; their right to 
be secure from unreasonable search and seizure; their right to 
remain silent; their right to be assumed innocent until proven 
guilty; their right to legal counsel; their right to freedom of 
association; their right to be represented in Parliament; their 
right to be treated equally before the law; and their right to 
privacy. All of those rights will be run roughshod over by this 
bill. Bill C-68 will not withstand a charter challenge on many of 
these points.
<P>
	Bill C-68 also intrudes into areas that are the sole 
constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces, namely 
administration of justice, regulation of private property, issuing 
of licences, assessing of licensing fees and user fees, education, 
and contributing to increases in provincial income taxes and 
municipal property taxes. Bill C-68 will not withstand a 
constitutional challenge by the provinces.
<P>
	The final piece of illogical behaviour is the government's 
claim that they have broad public support for the measures 
proposed in Bill C-68. If this is true, then why is the government 
ramming this through Parliament? If the support is so broad then 
why not let democracy run its course? If there is broad public 
support then why not allow free votes? If there is such broad 
public support, why discipline liberal backbench MPs who are 
voting their constituents' wishes? If the public support is so 
great, why impose time allocation during second reading debate 
and leave at least 30 MPs waiting to speak?
<P>
	If the public supports this bill, why did the standing 
committee on justice limit the amount of time for public 
hearings and deny to hundreds of people who wanted to be heard 
the opportunity to be heard? If support is so great, why did the 
standing committee refuse to hear expert testimony from 
individual independent experts in various areas? For example, 
we have been in contact with the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurance Association and the Insurance Bureau of Canada and 
have learned that insurance companies do not ask their 
applicants if they own a gun because they are not an identifiable 
risk group. There are so many people who wanted to come 
before this committee and were denied the opportunity. We have 
a problem.
<P>
	This proves the justice minister and his supporters are wrong 
when they say gun owners are a risk to themselves or others. If 
gun ownership represented any risk or liability, insurance 
companies would charge gun owners a higher premium for life, 
health, and property insurance. They do not. This is just one of 
the many areas that have not been fully explored by the justice 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	If the minister is so convinced that the public supports his 
proposals, then why is he not prepared to do the rigorous 
evaluation recommended by the auditor general before 
implementing further gun controls? Let us see if the measures 
implemented in Bill C-17 are working before spending even 
more money on measures that are not cost effective in achieving 
the stated objective of improving public safety. If there is broad 
public support, why invoke time allocation at report stage?
<P>
	I am introducing this amendment so that we will always 
evaluate this gun legislation to see if it is working, if it is 
effective. Those parts that are not working or not effective 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13572"> 13572 </A></B>
<P>
should be repealed. Everything the government does defies 
common sense.
<P>
	This sunset clause should be supported by all members of the 
House. I cannot think of any reason they would oppose it. I hope 
we will have some common sense when we examine it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation.
<P>
	As my colleague, the previous speaker, has indicated, it is 
unfortunate that many members of Parliament will not have an 
opportunity to speak at report stage, since the government has 
introduced closure and will limit the debate at this stage of the 
legislation. However, I am pleased to have an opportunity to say 
a couple of remarks about the bill itself.
<P>
	I am certainly not a spokesperson for what people would refer 
to as the gun lobby. Yes, I have been a fur trapper with my own 
trapline. Yes, I have been a big game hunter. Yes, I have been a 
recreational shooter, but that was some years ago.
<P>
	The fundamental question I asked myself was whether this 
legislation will curtail the number of people who are killed each 
year by firearms. That is fundamental.
<P>
	I looked at the details and noticed, for example, that about 
1,400 people die of gunshot wounds each year, which has fallen 
substantially over the last number of years. How does the 1,400 
break out? Eleven hundred people die as a result of a firearm 
wound through the commission of suicide. In other words, 
people who have decided to take their own life are using a 
firearm. If that firearm were registered would the person 
interested in committing suicide likely not commit suicide? I 
could only conclude that it would probably have little effect at 
all, recognizing that suicide is a fairly thoughtful process and 
that people normally think about it for some time. That takes 
care of 1,100 people who die of firearm wounds.
<P>
	About 150 people die each year as a result of domestic 
violence, when one partner decides to shoot the other partner. 
Would that be reduced if firearms were registered? Would 
people not shoot their spouse or their partner? I concluded that 
probably would not have any effect either. If things have 
deteriorated in a relationship to that extent, whether the .22 is 
registered someplace will probably not deter the person from 
committing the act.
<P>
	Then I noticed that about 100 people each year die who I will 
define as gangsters. I suspect that gangsters do not register their 
sawed off shotguns or pistols, so I concluded that would not 
have much of an impact.
<P>
	About 50 people each year die in Canada as a result of 
shooting accidents. A shooting accident will take place, I 
presume, whether or not a firearm is registered.
<P>
	When I looked at the 1,400 people who lose their lives each 
year as a result of firearms, I could only conclude that no one 
would not die as a result of the legislation.
<P>
	Will our streets, neighbourhoods and country be safer because 
of the legislation? We have to acknowledge we will tie up the 
work of the RCMP and police forces, which will spend hundreds 
and thousands of hours doing evaluations and filling out forms. 
When I talked to many of the RCMP officers in Kamloops, I did 
not find a single one who actually supported the legislation. 
With respect to the tens of millions of dollars that will go into 
the registration system, they said put more members of the force 
on the street and it will make Canada a safer place, as opposed to 
a gun registration system that by and large will not be effective. 
Then I listen with interest to some of the aboriginal members of 
Parliament when they say the law ought not to apply to First 
Nations peoples.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	When there are people in the Senate and in the House of 
Commons saying this legislation should not apply to First 
Nations people, what kind of system will this be in the end?
<P>
	I will give the Minister of Justice credit. I suspect he was 
honourably motivated when he brought this legislation forward. 
I believe he thought it would make Canada a safer place as a 
result of many people urging him to take some kind of action. 
Will Canada be a safer place? By and large, no. I wonder if it 
does not get the government members off the hook so they can 
go across the country saying: ``Look at the tremendous action 
we have taken to combat crime in our streets''.
<P>
	The legislation is by and large a smokescreen. It is a scam, it is 
a sham, it is an illusion the government is taking action against 
crime when very little change will occur. I will not say there is 
nothing good in this legislation, of course there is. Every year I 
have been here I have supported changes to Canada's firearms' 
legislation but not this one. This is a phoney piece of legislation 
that gives the impression of real action when very little is taking 
place at a tremendous cost both in terms of abusing the lives of 
legitimate firearms owners and, more important, taking so much 
time of the RCMP and other police forces.
<P>
	Is it a priority to tie up hundreds of thousands of person hours 
in this type of activity? That energy, time and money are 
misdirected. I assume because of the muscle the government is 
using in Parliament that the legislation will pass. That motivated 
me to put forward this amendment. I will read the amendment: 
``In the year 2000, no later than June 1 and every three years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13573"> 13573 </A></B>
<P>
thereafter, a comprehensive review of the provisions of this act 
shall be undertaken by such committee of the House of 
Commons as the House may designate for that purpose''.
<P>
	I appreciate that the previous speaker indicated the interest in 
the auditor general's evaluating legislation prior to action. I 
support that because the auditor general has said on numerous 
occasions that in his judgment the present legislation has not 
been evaluated to see whether it is effective.
<P>
	Even the justice department has stated time and time again the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of present legislation has simply 
not been done. Why then is the government so determined to 
proceed with a whole set of changes on existing legislation that 
has yet to be evaluated in terms of cost effectiveness?
<P>
	Basically this is an attempt through one of 267 amendments to 
say that if the government is to proceed with this anyway as a 
result of its parliamentary muscle, let us at least include a 
provision so that this changed legislation is evaluated on a 
regular basis to see if it is effective, whether the registration 
system is effective, whether the whole initiative is cost effective 
and presumably to identify areas that need improvement.
<P>
	It is meant to improve the legislation. I hope government 
members take it seriously and give some thought to building in 
some type of process by which this legislation can be reviewed 
on a regular basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to talk at debate on 
Bill C-68 on my amendment which, like a couple of the others 
presented, calls for a review of this legislation. I have suggested 
a period of five years.
<P>
	The purpose of the legislation, the intent of the minister and 
of the government to attempt to curb violence in Canadian 
society is a worthwhile objective and the legislation in many 
respects addresses that.
<P>
	There are items in the legislation that have beyond a shadow 
of a doubt proven to have an opportunity to do that; increasing 
the penalties for the commission of certain violent acts with a 
firearm, increased penalties for possession of stolen firearms, 
increased penalties for smuggling, all of which most of us 
accept. The idea of more policing of the borders is a proven 
thing which most people would support.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand there is the question of universal 
registration of all firearms, going beyond what we have now 
which is for handguns only. There is an open question whether 
that provision will achieve the purpose of the bill which is to 
reduce violence in Canadian society.
<P>
	I and many Canadians believe that with any piece of 
legislation there has to be a balance. There has to be a 
relationship between what is being done, the cost and what the 
result will be. There are four areas we should take a look at and 
which I intend to address briefly in this speech. We must look at 
what registration is likely to do and what is not likely to do, what 
it will cost and what it  may do. There is a difference between 
what it will do and what it may do.
<P>
	What is registration attempting to do? It is trying address 
what we know, that a firearm normally begins its life as a legal 
firearm and through its lifetime it goes through a process and 
becomes illegal. Registration is an attempt to arrest that 
process. It is not an attempt once a firearm becomes illegal to 
stop somebody from using it in a certain way. That will not 
happen. It is an attempt to stop the process of going from legal to 
illegal. It does that a number of ways.
<P>
	A large number of thefts occur from bulk shipments. 
Registration will record those items as they reach the border and 
then can be tracked to their point of destination and hopefully 
stop theft from those shipments.
<P>
	It will give police an opportunity better enforce prohibition 
orders issued by judges. Under this legislation and previous 
legislation a judge can put a prohibition order on individuals to 
stop them owning firearms based on their past behaviour, for 
instance being convicted of a serious criminal offence. 
Registration will make it easier for a police officer to know 
exactly what firearms they want to collect and execute the 
prohibition order.
<P>
	On safe storage, if somebody has a firearm stolen from his or 
her dwelling and it is used in a criminal offence there will be the 
possibility to trace it back exactly from where it came. That 
might encourage certain people to practise better safe storage.
<P>
	The licensing part of the registration system will give 
authorities the opportunity to examine somebody's past 
behaviour and to determine whether it should preclude them 
from owning a firearm. Those are some of the things registration 
is likely to do.
<P>
	There are some things it will not do and people should be clear 
on this as well. Once a criminal has a firearm in their possession, 
whether it is registered is very unlikely to stop them from 
committing a criminal act. That is not what registration will do. 
Anybody with that in their mind is probably mistaken.
<P>
	If somebody is intent on doing harm to themselves and is in 
possession of a firearm, that the firearm is or is not registered 
will probably not have a lot to do with the actions of that person. 
The registration part is to stop the process from becoming 
illegal. Once the firearm is illegal the legislation will not have a 
lot of impact.
<P>
	There are some concerns about what it may do. I am 
concerned it will increase the cost of hunting. A lot of 
individuals in my riding hunt. It will preclude them from 
participating in that sport. On a more broad basis, hunting is an 
important economic activity in my riding which is pursued by a 
lot of people. A lot of individuals come into the area and spend 
their money on lodging 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13574"> 13574 </A></B>
<P>
et cetera. The concern is whether it will decrease the number of 
people who will participate in that.
<P>
	The fear of many legitimate firearm owners is whether this 
system of registration in the hands of a future government may 
be used to prohibit firearms normally used in recreational 
activities. It is a concern they genuinely hold and one we need to 
address and take into account when looking at this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We must look at cost. The cost individually to begin with will 
not be that high, $10 for up to 10 firearms plus acquiring an FPC. 
There is the concern that if that is the opening cost what will the 
cost be in five years, ten years, fifteen years. It is a legitimate 
concern not just with firearms but with anything that has a fee 
attached to it.
<P>
	There is also a concern about the global cost for it. It is set at 
$85 million to implement and then there will be a cost to keep it 
in place. That has to be a concern in a day and age when we have 
fiscal challenges facing us as a government.
<P>
	There are a number of considerations we have to take into 
account. We have to take into account what registration will do. 
We have to understand what it will not do. We have to 
understand what it may do or at least have an appreciation of 
what it may do. We also have to understand what it may cost. We 
need to evaluate considering all of those components.
<P>
	Will it stop violence? Will it be reasonable? Will it hurt 
legitimate firearms owners? Those are the things we need to 
know. Those are things being debated in the House, things quite 
frankly that have been debated for the last year. I do not think it 
will possible at this point to get any clear consensus on that or a 
clear understanding.
<P>
	In that respect I have proposed an amendment which will 
mandate a review after five years so we will have an opportunity 
as Parliament to understand whether the legislation is achieving 
its objective to curb violence in society and understand whether 
we need to modify or change it to make it more effective in order 
to have an understanding as to whether some of those negative 
consequences or concerns put forward will take place.
<P>
	Therefore I urge my colleagues in the House today to help and 
assist me by voting for this amendment requiring a review of the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to advise the House 
that we have gone through the first round of debate and I 
recognized the speakers under whom the motions stood. Now to 
a more general debate I will look to the government, followed by 
the official opposition, the government and the third party. We 
will see who might be seeking the floor at any time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak 
on Bill C-68 at report stage.
<P>
	I listened to the suggested amendments put forward by 
different members. The member for Yorkton-Melville worked 
on the committee and spent a good deal of time with other 
members of the committee working on this bill which I feel is a 
much better bill as a result of the work of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	I do not agree when members say we tried to shut down 
debate. We have had a lot of debate on this subject. We will have 
report stage today and third reading tomorrow. Members may 
want to speak to the bill at this stage. The important thing is 
members have spoken to us about their concerns on this bill and 
their thoughts and ideas have been taken into consideration; not 
all but a lot. As a result changes are reflected in the revised 
edition of the bill before the House today at report stage.
<P>
	I will speak to the amendments that have been brought 
forward. The first amendment is by the member for Algoma who 
wants to change the title from other weapons to related matters. I 
understand what he is trying to do but unfortunately the wording 
he wants to use is too general. What we want to do here is relate 
it to weapons.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	There is not a negative connotation meant in this this bill 
relating to the use of weapons. A weapon is not something that 
has a negative connotation in the opinion of the government. If it 
had not been for weapons we would not have our free society 
today after the first and second world wars and the Korean 
conflict. We are not trying to downgrade or malign weapons. 
This is not something we want to do. For that reason we feel the 
wording as stated is what we would like to use.
<P>
	He also mentions in section 4 on page 4 that the wording is 
ineffective because some of the objectives are not stated. He 
wants certain objectives stated. The problem is that while some 
of the objectives are stated by the hon. member in his 
amendment, other objectives are not. We feel that the section to 
which he refers adequately states what it is the government is 
trying to do.
<P>
	I turn to Motion No. 158 relating to the review: ``The minister 
shall periodically conduct a review of this act and the 
regulations and shall table a report on the review in the House of 
Commons within 12 months of commencing the review''.
<P>
	The review is something many members wanted to see in the 
bill and it was given a good deal of study. The problem is that we 
will be registering the gun owners from January 1, 1996 until 
December 31, 2001 and firearms themselves from January 1, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13575"> 13575 </A></B>
<P>
1998 to December 31, 2003. That is when the act will really be in 
place. Any time after that would be the logical time for a review 
if  one were to be brought forward. If we are looking at a five 
year review the year 2008 presumably would be the time for a 
review.
<P>
	It is not felt at this time that a review should be included in the 
bill. We want to give the bill a chance to work. We want to have 
the bill passed, to have Canadians understand what is in the bill 
and to have an opportunity to look at the regulations.
<P>
	There certainly will be an election prior to the registration of 
the firearms commencing on January 1, 1998. This could be a 
subject of debate during the next federal election. I am sure all 
members will be prepared to discuss this subject and I welcome 
that. I think that is the way it should be. We would then have the 
opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of the act and 
regulations which Canadians will have had an opportunity to 
review and of which they will be better aware. To leave that out 
at this time would be the most appropriate course.
<P>
	The member for Yorkton-Melville has stated in Motion No. 
167: ``Sections 3 to 129 expire on December 31, 1999 unless 
prior to that date, with respect to each section the auditor general 
has prepared and caused to be laid before Parliament a report on 
whether the section has been or will be a successful in the cost 
effective use of public funds to achieve an increase in public 
safety and a reduction in the incidence of violent crime 
involving the use of firearms''. Certainly a review in my opinion 
would be preferable to this.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	We have stated we want Parliament to have the control over 
legislation, particularly this legislation. The motion gives the 
powers over the act to the auditor general. While the auditor 
general has a very worthwhile and important function in our 
system of government, he is not an institution to which we want 
to give control over our legislation and control over whether 
legislation is going to be successful or not.
<P>
	The member is placing the responsibility on one man and one 
man's report as to whether or not legislation is going to 
continue. This is not a review by Parliament but a review by one 
person. If this precedent were instituted and followed up in other 
legislation then Parliament might as well stop functioning. It 
might as well shut down because the auditor general would 
declare whether he or she thought bills should continue to be in 
effect.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 266 and 267, one by the member for Kamloops 
and the other by the member for Parry Sound-Muskoka, once 
again call for reviews of the act and I would say the same thing. 
This is not an appropriate time to implement a review. If it is felt 
there is still a lot of concern with the act later on, it could be the 
subject of an amendment perhaps after the next federal election.
<P>
	The act has to be given the opportunity to work. We have to 
see the regulations. Many members of Parliament will be very 
pleasantly surprised.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-68 is about public safety. To ensure the safety of the 
public we need certain measures that will not necessarily please 
everyone.
<P>
	When restrictions are set on our freedom of choice or freedom 
of action, most of us start asking questions and there is bound to 
be some protest against new measures. Only time will tell 
whether these measures are effective.
<P>
	Firearms registration is one such measure that has raised a lot 
of controversy. Apparently harmless, this measure has caused 
one of the most emotional debates I have ever seen and in which 
I have taken part. At the time, even Bill C-17 did not seem to 
raise arguments that were so emotionally charged.
<P>
	One that recurs ad nauseam is that the measures adopted in 
1991 were entirely adequate and that it is unnecessary to change 
anything at all in the existing legislation. However, during the 
debate on C-17, the pro-gun lobby argued that the proposed 
measures were redundant and would put an additional burden on 
honest gun owners.
<P>
	Apparently, the pro-gun lobby has managed to live with the 
provisions on storage, display and transportation of firearms. If 
they are satisfied with the existing provisions, it is because they 
are effective, and only time will tell whether a legislative 
provision produces the expected results.
<P>
	Perhaps I may draw another analogy. I well remember the 
controversy that it raised in Quebec when the government 
wanted to make wearing seat belts mandatory. A whole range of 
arguments was raised against this decision. It was an attack on 
individual freedom, was one argument we often heard. First 
prove it will save lives, was another one. The government has no 
right to make me buckle up, people said. I am a responsible 
driver and never had an accident. Does that sound familiar?
<P>
	However, according to the statistics, seat belts have saved 
lives. Especially since a car is not supposed to kill but to carry 
passengers. I could apply the same analogy to making helmets 
mandatory for motorcyclists.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	All these measures were adopted by governments for the 
well-being of the community, to protect public safety. I agree 
some measures restrict our individual freedoms, but it is a small 
price to pay for the benefits down the line. So much for 
analogies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13576"> 13576 </A></B>
<P>
	Now back to the motions concerning safe storage. The 
motions I proposed would make it mandatory for the 
manufacturer, importer and exporter of a firearm to install a 
secure locking device on the firearm. A secure locking device 
means a device that cannot be opened or unlocked except with an 
electronic, magnetic or mechanical key or an alphanumeric 
combination lock. Once installed, the locking device must 
prevent the firearm from shooting.
<P>
	The amendment I proposed, which will probably be discussed 
later on, is entirely appropriate in a bill on public security. 
Access to unlocked firearms is far too easy. Guns without a 
trigger lock and ammunition that is not securely stored are 
immediately available to the individual who gives in to suicidal 
or violent impulses. When guns and ammunition are not 
immediately available, the individual has time to think and calm 
down.
<P>
	The statistics on deaths caused by firearms are horrifying. In 
1991, suicides represented 77 per cent of 1,445 deaths caused by 
firearms. Out of 732 homicides recorded in Canada in 1992, 246 
were committed with a firearm. Most homicides during the past 
ten years were committed with shotguns or hunting rifles. In 
three cases out of four, women killed by their spouses were shot 
with a shotgun or hunting rifle.
<P>
	The statistics are there. A trigger lock could have helped 
reduce the number of suicides and homicides committed with a 
gun. Just like making the wearing of seat belts mandatory, this 
measure would help us save lives.
<P>
	An amendment like the one we proposed would impose few 
restrictions, considering the benefits that would ensue. 
Equipping all firearms in circulation, including shoulder arms, 
with a trigger lock is an indication that firearms are dangerous, 
that they can kill and that owners should use them responsibly.
<P>
	Firearms involve too much risk to be ignored. The mere 
presence of a firearm in a home increases the risk of suicide five 
times and the risk of homicide three times. The risk of accident 
is greater in a home where firearms are kept than in a home 
where there are none.
<P>
	The improper use of firearms must be reduced by showing 
that guns mean danger and that firearms must always be used 
carefully and in accordance with the law and the requirements of 
safety.
<P>
	The mandatory trigger lock would permit this. A way must be 
found to inform users who do not even know there are gun 
storage regulations. Those primarily concerned, that is the 
owners, are not even aware that gun storage regulations exist. A 
survey by Léger &amp; Léger confirms this disturbing discovery. It 
was done between September 1 and 13, 1994 and involved 515 
gun owners living in Quebec. In response to a question on 
knowledge of the existence of the regulations, only 53 per cent 
believed there was legislation on storage; 31.8 per cent said the 
opposite; and 15.1 per cent were  undecided-they did not know 
there were any regulations on the safe storage of firearms.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	At the very least, a trigger lock and targeted advertising are 
required and just as essential as a national registration system.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is not intended to stigmatize firearms owners, but, 
rather, to promote a form of social accountability. This is why 
we must oblige manufacturers, importers and exporters to equip 
firearms with a secure locking device.
<P>
	These are my comments on the amendments before us at the 
moment, since, unfortunately, I believe some members will try 
to use the time and prevent us from discussing other motions. 
This is why I chose to discuss mine now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Further to the comments 
by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, it is not up to me to plan 
strategy for anyone in this House. So long as no one questions 
the relevance-we know how complex it can be to resolve-we 
will continue the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very important issue for many people in the rural areas 
of the country.
<P>
	I have considered this question over the last several years. In 
my previous life as an opposition member we had a debate on 
this issue. In fact we have debated the matter a number of times. 
I was here when Bill C-17 was debated, which was brought in by 
the former Conservative government.
<P>
	That bill was supported by the hon. member for Kamloops 
who stood in the House today to say that he was upset with the 
fact that time allocation had been imposed. During the previous 
debate that member was the House leader of the New 
Democratic Party and he supported the government, in fact all 
the parties, in limiting debate and supported not having a vote at 
second reading. I find it somewhat surprising today that the hon. 
member for Kamloops would stand in his place and criticize the 
government for imposing time allocation.
<P>
	We have debated this bill for the last year. I am sure all hon. 
members in the House have had or should have had the 
opportunity to express the views of their constituents, not only 
on the floor of the House but across the country. Certainly in the 
last year there have been opportunities for constituents to 
express their views of the issue. I have travelled across my 
riding. I have been to gun rallies. I have met with different 
groups.
<P>
	This past weekend as I debated how I will vote on the issue I 
had the opportunity to speak with many of my constituents, 
especially a number of the mayors and regional councillors. In 
my constituency a number of motions were put forward by 
regional councils and a number of municipalities outlining their 
concerns with the legislation. I have also had an opportunity to 
speak to  a lot of my gun guys. I call them the gun guys because 
they are the ones who have formed different shooting clubs. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13577"> 13577 </A></B>
<P>
They are members of anglers and hunters groups and they have 
come together to fight the bill. I say gun guys because the 
membership is made up of guys. I have been out west and I have 
discussed this issue with people in various ridings.
<P>
	I took issue with the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville 
when he talked about the view of Ontarians on the issue. He 
seemed to suggest that somehow the Mike Harris sweep meant 
that people were against gun control in Ontario. That is simply 
not true. Take the example of northern Ontario for instance 
where there is the strongest disagreement with this bill. It went 
Liberal and NDP. In two of the three ridings of the members of 
this party that voted against the government on second reading, 
those ridings went Liberal.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I find it hard to believe that the Reform Party, as it 
does in my riding, tries to take credit somehow for the Mike 
Harris victory in this past election. As members know, that is 
simply not true.
<P>
	I have had difficulties on this issue in my own riding simply 
because I have had the opportunity of getting around and talking 
to a number of people. If one talks to people generally on the 
street, what they will say is that a lot of people are against this 
legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party in my riding likes to build this up. The 
Reform Party comes forward. Its past candidate writes letters to 
an editor at a newspaper saying they will use this and fight the 
member on it.
<P>
	Most people in my riding know my views on this issue. They 
know that I fought hard to make changes. What they do not know 
is how the Reform Party says it is speaking out on behalf of its 
constituents but when you look at the numbers and the polls, it 
shows that many of these members are being two faced about the 
issue. They are claiming to represent their constituents and they 
are not.
<P>
	There are only a few brave members of the Reform Party who 
are standing up for what their constituents want. I find that to be 
in contrast with what the Reform Party promised in the last 
election. I have always in the House taken very strongly the 
views of my constituents and tried to put them forward.
<P>
	What the Reform Party never tells you when its members talk 
about free votes-we have not seen very many free votes from 
these people-is what you do in the House when-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind members on both 
sides that all interventions must be made through the Chair, and 
not directly to one other. In that way we might continue to have a 
very parliamentary debate on a very serious matter before the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the Reform Party never tells 
its constituents when it talks about free votes is what to do in a 
situation where your views on an issue are different from your 
constituents.
<P>
	If one looks at the polling across the country, one poll may be 
different, two polls may, but when all polls across the country 
show support for this legislation it is difficult.
<P>
	A poll taken in my own riding by the Simcoe Reformer asked 
a number of questions. It said: ``Are you strongly in favour, 
somewhat in favour, or opposed to the registration of all guns?'' 
Those who strongly support were 33 per cent. Those who 
strongly opposed were 23 per cent. For somewhat support, there 
were 26 per cent and somewhat opposed, 19 per cent.
<P>
	The question I have to look at is: ``How do you think your 
member of Parliament should vote on this issue: For or against 
the proposal on gun control legislation?''
<P>
	Of those who had an opinion, 60 per cent said that their 
member of Parliament should vote for the legislation and 40 per 
cent said that he should vote against the legislation. That poll 
was taken in my riding.
<P>
	It has been difficult to get a good grasp on what the majority 
of constituents think on this issue. What I did was call around. In 
fact, I talked to some of the gun control opponents in my riding. 
They said that they had been taking polls too. It showed 70:30. 
The numbers were not only true but they were stronger.
<P>
	It makes it difficult for all hon. members. I know tonight as we 
vote on this Reform Party members will too be looking at how 
their constituents think about this issue. On this issue we are 
talking about a five-year review, which I totally support and 
which I have put forward. The minister is here today and he has 
indicated in the past that this might be a proper thing to do, to 
review the legislation to make sure it is working.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I> had an editorial which 
essentially said the same thing. Let us see whether or not the 
registration of guns will do what the government says it will do. 
That is why I support the motions. I would put the year for 
review at 2008 as the hon. parliament secretary has done. That 
would be a good way to do it.
<P>
	Since the parliamentary secretary said he supported the idea 
and the minister is here and since the Reform Party agrees with 
this, I wonder if we could get unanimous consent to put forward 
a motion that would use the year 2008, five years after the 
implementation. If there is unanimous consent, the motion 
would say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13578"> 13578 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-68 be amended by adding after line 28 on page 134 the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That no later than January 1, 2008, that the federal minister shall prepare a 
report on the effectiveness of this act in reducing the incidents of indictable 
offences involving the use of a firearm, and lay the report before the House of 
Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I wonder if we could get unanimous consent of the House for 
this motion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the unanimous consent 
for the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
begin by touching on the inconsistencies that I see and the 
reasoning behind this bill.
<P>
	Inconsistencies always bother me because fact should support 
fact and truth should support truth. An inconsistency indicates 
that fact is not supporting fact. I am concerned about that.
<P>
	The two inconsistencies are these. If the justice minister and 
the government truly believe that the registration of rifles and 
shotguns will reduce the criminal use of those firearms and save 
lives, why are we waiting until the year 2003 to make it 
mandatory? Why are we waiting that long to begin to save lives 
and create a safer society?
<P>
	The other inconsistency is that 58 per cent of the handguns 
that have been legally acquired and legally held are to be 
banned. Why? Because they pose a danger to society. Yet those 
handguns are not to be taken from society, they are to left in 
society. They are to be grandfathered.
<P>
	Why would the government, if it honestly believes that 58 per 
cent of handguns held today in society are a danger to society, 
then why would it allow them to remain in society?
<P>
	I will have more to say at third reading about the bill. I will 
begin my address to Bill C-68 at report stage by taking 
cognizance of those two very glaring inconsistencies behind the 
rationale of the bill as presented by the government.
<P>
	I am opposed to a system of registration of rifles and shotguns 
as outlined in Bill C-68. I am also opposed to the draconian 
inspection powers and the absurd penalties provided for anyone 
who fails to register a rifle or a shotgun.
<P>
	Canada has some of the most stringent gun regulations in the 
world now. Some 60 pages in the Criminal Code deal with the 
acquisition, ownership and use of firearms, and we want to add a 
whole bundle more.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	We do not need further controls on law-abiding gun owners. 
We need the enforcement of the present laws and to get tough 
with the criminal use of firearms. Canadians have been 
demanding changes to the justice system in this country for 
years. All they have received are weak-kneed, bleeding heart 
policies that further erode the objective of justice, which is to 
reduce crime.
<P>
	The present and past governments have used gun control to 
make Canadians believe they are doing something about crime 
in Canada when they are not.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is not a gun control bill. It is not going to control 
guns; it is going to register them. There is a huge difference 
between the two.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is nothing more than a pretence that the government 
is making our homes and streets safer and getting tough on 
criminals.
<P>
	I recall Lynda Haverstock, the leader of the Saskatchewan 
Liberal Party, when she appeared before the standing committee 
stated in effect that the federal government was spreading 
misinformation by claiming Bill C-68 would reduce suicide and 
domestic violence that involved firearms. I agree with this 
observation.
<P>
	The bill creates false hopes in the minds of Canadians about 
what it will do in terms of making our homes and streets safer, 
hope that will never be realized through this bill because it does 
not address the cause of suicide or the cause of domestic 
violence.
<P>
	As the auditor general concluded in his 1993 report: ``Our 
review of the new regulations indicated that important data 
needed to assess the potential benefits and future effectiveness 
of the regulations were not available at the time the regulations 
were drafted. The government proceeded with new regulations 
for reasons of public policy''.
<P>
	The government is doing exactly the same thing. There is not 
a statistical justification for bringing in a universal registration 
system, and yet we see that as the central pillar in Bill C-68.
<P>
	The voters have awakened. They cannot be placated by 
pretentious pieces of legislation. Canadians want concrete 
measures effectively aimed at reducing crime. The Ontario and 
Manitoba elections demonstrate quite clearly that the citizens of 
these provinces reject the Liberal form of justice. They reject 
the Liberal tendencies to make offenders' rights supersede the 
rights of victims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13579"> 13579 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians must be able to see that the measures introduced by 
the government will meet the objective of reducing crime before 
legislation is passed, not after. Through common sense appraisal 
of the law they must be able to see that it will be of benefit to 
them, their families and their communities.
<P>
	The justice minister has not provided any statistical 
information to justify the implementation of these draconian 
measures in this bill, although he has repeatedly been asked to 
do so. He has not effectively demonstrated the link between 
registering firearms and a reduction in crime. That is what the 
attorneys general from the three western prairie provinces 
addressed when they appeared before the standing committee. 
There was no linkage they could see between the registration of 
rifles and shotguns and the reduction in the criminal use of these 
firearms.
<P>
	Not one witness who appeared before the standing committee 
could provide any substantive evidence that registration would 
reduce the criminal use of these firearms. No one could 
demonstrate how registration, the banning of .25 and .32 calibre 
handguns, the new licensing regime or the intrusive inspection 
powers will diminish the number of firearm crimes in this 
country.
<P>
	What they did inadvertently illustrate was an unrealistic fear 
of firearms and an idealistic notion that by restricting ownership 
of firearms, criminals, those people who thrive on obtaining a 
valuable object to sell on the black market, would somehow be 
thwarted by such regulatory acts aimed at honest citizens, 
people who have owned and used firearms for years in a safe and 
legal manner.
<P>
	To date it seems the only impetus for Bill C-68 is to fulfil the 
justice minister's original and unrealistic thought to have only 
the police and military possess firearms in this country.
<P>
	Time today does not permit me to address and debate each of 
the Reform's amendments. The time allocation imposed by the 
Liberal government with the co-operation of the separatist Bloc 
party for both the report stage and the third reading of this bill 
denies me and my colleagues the opportunity to present 
evidence to substantiate our amendments or to represent the 
concerns of our constituents.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I object to the shameful and undemocratic methods employed 
by the government to ram this bill through Parliament. It is no 
secret that the government is having trouble keeping its caucus 
together on this issue. The threat of being kicked off a 
committee is hanging over every Liberal's head if they dare to 
represent their constituents by voting against the government 
and in accordance with the will of the majority of the people 
they represent.
<P>
	I think the government is terrified to allow its MPs the 
opportunity to go home for the summer to consult constituents 
on Bill C-68, Bill C-41, or the government's  pension bill. It 
knows that the more Canadians learn about Bill C-68, as was the 
case for the Charlottetown accord, the stronger the opposition 
will grow.
<P>
	So much for the competence of the government. So much for 
the rhetoric that it has the support of Canadians. If it had the 
majority of Canadians on its side it would not be moving so 
quickly to have this bill passed, especially given the fact it will 
not be implemented until the year 2003.
<P>
	Reform is opposed to Bill C-68 in many of its forms. 
Therefore, we will be voting against the vast majority of this bill 
at third reading. Our amendments tabled before the House are an 
attempt to make this draconian legislation more palatable for 
those firearm owners who will be burdened by red tape, costly 
controls of privately owned property, and intrusion into their 
lives.
<P>
	Reforms' amendments in no way concede to the principle of 
more gun regulations in this country. We still maintain and are 
adamant that there is no need for the registration of rifles and 
shotguns.
<P>
	I will have more time at third reading to address the concerns 
of our party with regard to this bill, which are reflected by the 
people all across the country.
<P>
	I was in Stratford this weekend, and last weekend I was in 
Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. I have spoken to approximately 
35,000 to 38,000 Canadians across the country who have all 
expressed the very same views and concerns. They are prepared 
to do whatever is reasonable and underlaid with common sense 
to bring about a safer use of firearms. However, they do not 
believe this bill will do that. They believe that it will do quite the 
opposite and simply encumber law-abiding citizens when it 
ought to be directing its efforts at those who would use firearms 
in a criminal manner.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this bill and particularly to 
the amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. But first I 
must say that I am somewhat surprised by the debate 
surrounding this bill, which, at first sight, should bring us 
together in support of the goal that was set.
<P>
	Without accusing anyone-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have a little bit of a 
problem. I simply want to clarify something with the hon. 
member and all my colleagues. We are currently debating the 
first group of motions on Bill C-68. Otherwise, if we broaden 
the debate-if I can use that expression-, if this is what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13580"> 13580 </A></B>
<P>
House wants, the Chair will certainly acquiesce to its request. 
However, at this time, I am seeking some guidance from my 
colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, tell me if I am mistaken, but I 
understood that, given the limited time available to discuss each 
group of motions and the number of members scheduled to 
address the first group-as you can see, there is no Bloc 
amendment in this group-, we would be allowed, while 
speaking to the first group, to argue on any amendment moved 
by any other member. I am one of the movers of an amendment 
that will come up only in the fourth group and, if I am not 
mistaken, I think that this group will not pass.
<P>
	I do not know, Mr. Speaker. It is up to you, but I understood 
the House agreed to broaden-as you say-the debate on this 
group of motions. It is up to you, of course.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As you know, the Chair is 
not involved in those discussions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If there has been some agreement reached by the parties as to 
how this debate might proceed, you would be in full knowledge 
that the Chair is not a participant in those deliberations and is 
consequently unaware of any such agreement, which is not to 
say there is not one.
<P>
	All I am attempting to do is facilitate the debate in the 
traditional fashion for colleagues on both sides of the House. I 
seek your guidance. If there is something the Chair is not aware 
of, please make us aware.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no agreement on the 
content or to change the format.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hubert talked generally about 
trigger locks and things that were not related to group one. The 
hon. member for Crowfoot did likewise. I can understand why 
they would do it, because we do not know how far we will get in 
this debate.
<P>
	However, with both parties having had an opportunity to put 
points of view on the record, I would hope that not all members 
are going to talk generally. I would like to adhere to the 
groupings so we will be able to discuss the merits of the 
amendments. I am not saying we have to adhere completely to 
that, without deviation, because we do have a time limit and all 
members have a right to be heard on the subject matter at report 
stage. I hope we adhere to the groupings as best we can so we 
give an airing to the motions that have been put forward. If not, 
then why have these motions at all?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I appreciate the 
intervention from the hon. parliamentary secretary. Certainly 
we are all cognizant that a great deal of work goes into 
formulating these groupings to facilitate the debate and to bring 
a certain focus to amendments within a certain grouping.
<P>
	I will join the parliamentary secretary and everyone else in 
the House in appealing to everyone to keep their remarks and 
participation as much as possible within the context of the 
groupings. Otherwise, I will react to whatever the mood of the 
House is at any time during this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, in this case, I will simply 
pass my turn and wait for my amendment to come up before 
taking the floor. I will also wait for third reading to denounce the 
government.
<P>
	In that sense, I think that, given all the amendments and the 
time limit on debate, the government could have shown good 
faith and allowed the opposition to present arguments, as was 
done before I rose. I was not the first member to speak to this bill 
in a general way. I will give up my turn, given the government's 
way of proceeding.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I very much appreciate 
the understanding shown by the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. True, he was not the first member to 
discuss the bill in a more general way, but I did react to a 
previous speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Certainly I will attempt to the best of my ability to conduct the 
debate in the fashion that will be most acceptable to at least the 
vast majority of colleagues in the House.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you might find unanimous 
consent to consider that all the questions have been put, a 
division demanded and deferred.
<P>
	I think you would be able to follow this procedure throughout 
the day if we reach the end of a group, simply to save time in the 
House. In other words, we will have a vote on them at the end of 
the day. There is no need to call the yeas and nays at this point 
and then defer the vote.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House has heard the terms of the motion of 
the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Does the House agree that the Chair should defer the 
questions instead of putting the motions in group No. 1 to a 
vote?
<P>
	Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	We will move to group No. 2. I want to apprise the House the

withdrawn.

	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could we 
have a clarification on the withdrawal of those other motions? I 
am unaware of any withdrawal.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The mover or movers of 
those other motions within group No. 2 have decided to 
withdraw their motions. That is the only explanation I can offer 
the House at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand some of those are my 
motions and I have not withdrawn any. I am not aware of anyone 
withdrawing them on my behalf either.
<P>
	I was looking at a past Order Paper, not today's. I am in error 
and I withdraw my intervention.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
from Crowfoot for his co-operation. Certainly we were looking 
for whether we had given less than accurate information. I 
would not want to do that on any debate, certainly not on this 
one.
<P>
	Now we will go to group No. 2, with only Motion No. 5 and 
Motion No. 145 standing. As I understand, by previous 
agreement I do not have to read the motions.

	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to

Mr. Speaker, I will speak on both of these motions proposed by 
the Minister of Justice. Motion No. 5 relates to clause 2 and adds 
a new subsection (3):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, nothing in this act shall be construed so as to abrogate 
or derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We have heard from many aboriginal groups about the 
importance of firearms in exercising their traditional hunting 
rights. With this in mind the government is in the midst of 
consultation with aboriginal groups so the main tenets of the bill 
can be applied in a manner which is sensitive to the aboriginal 
communities. This motion would simply confirm the 
government's commitment to work in concert with aboriginal 
communities so that the firearms legislation can operate in their 
communities in a way which recognizes and is respectful of 
constitutional aboriginal treaty rights.
<P>
	What we want to do is rationalise the constitutional and treaty 
rights which the aboriginal people already have with Bill C-68. 
That is not to create due rights, but then again it is not to 
derogate the rights aboriginal people already have. We want this 
legislation to work in conjunction with the treaty and 
constitutional rights of the aboriginal people. That is very 
important for the operation of this bill and for the respect of the 
rights of aboriginal people under the Constitution and the 
treaties.
<P>
	Reform members are calling this a two tier justice system. We 
have stated and we state again there is to be the same rights 
applied to all Canadians and that the bill is to apply equally in all 
parts of Canada except where we have stated certain conditions 
would apply to those who hunt for sustenance. We are 
acknowledging that there are treaty and constitutional rights for 
aboriginal people. We want to mesh the application of this bill 
into that.
<P>
	Motion No. 145 strikes out certain lines in the English version 
of the bill. We are proposing an amendment consequential to the 
new lending conditions to be provided in the legislation. Motion 
No. 145 would provide an exception to the summary offence 
provision of possessing a firearm without a registration 
certificate if the person were a sustenance hunter who had 
borrowed the firearm.
<P>
	This is in relation to section 107(1) of the Firearms Act which 
will come into being with Bill C-68. It says someone who has 
borrowed a firearm for hunting for sustenance would not be 
charged because they were hunting with or using an unregistered 
firearm. We think that is applicable and is in keeping with those 
who must hunt for sustenance to feed their families in the more 
remote parts of the country.
<P>
	I put forward on behalf of the government those two motions 
which we feel will add to the bill, particularly to those residents 
of the more rural parts of the country. We are mindful of the 
concerns of those in the rural and regional parts of the country 
and we want this bill to be respected, obeyed and applicable in a 
meaningful way to these regions.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the amendment put 
forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice. This clause was recommended by most of the aboriginal 
groups that came to the justice committee during its hearings on 
Bill C-68. Some specific recommendations were made by the 
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and the Grand Council of the Crees of 
Quebec to include a non-derogation clause in the bill.
<P>
	While the government's position is that the bill does not 
abrogate or derogate from aboriginal and treaty rights, 
aboriginal people want greater assurance and comfort.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Aboriginal groups are happy the government and the minister 
have responded. I thank the aboriginal witnesses for this 
suggestion. I express my deep appreciation to the minister for 
listening and responding to these concerns.
<P>
	I am sure we will have the support of the Reform Party. I will 
quote the hon. member for Crowfoot who quite clearly said 
during one of the hearings that the support is there from the 
Reform Party: ``I find it unacceptable that the government will 
make agreements with our aboriginal people and then violate 
those agreements. This is unacceptable. What is the purpose of 
the agreement and where is the honour of the agreement if it is 
simply to be violated? No wonder the aboriginal people come 
forward. I admire your patience. I cannot get over your patience 
in the face of this kind of treatment''.
<P>
	It is quite clear that when the aboriginal people of Canada 
want a non-derogation clause in the gun control bill the Reform 
Party will be with us all the way on this issue. It would not want 
the Government of Canada to break its treaties with the 
aboriginal people who have negotiated land claims and treaties 
over the past number of years.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Following the process we 
adopted in the first grouping, I have before me a list of the 
movers of the various motions in this grouping. I will begin with 
the hon. member for Annapolis Valley-Hants.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to debate the third group of 
amendments regarding Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and 
other weapons. I also want to thank my hon. friend from 
Carleton-Charlotte for seconding the amendments I have put 
forth. Within this block I have moved four motions for debate 
today, Motions Nos. 4, 76, 92 and 154.
<P>
	Judging by the level of debate in this House, in the media and 
among Canadians generally, this legislation undoubtedly is one 
of the most important bills presently before the House. I am 
honoured therefore to rise today to speak on this motion on 
behalf of my constituents of Annapolis Valley-Hants.
<P>
	Over the past year I have consulted widely with people in my 
constituency. Whether at public rallies, through regular 
correspondence or during many conversations with concerned 
individuals, I have maintained a regular contact with over 1,500 
people on the firearms issue alone. The series of amendments I 
have brought forward represents the culmination of this 
consultation process. The amendments represent the views I 
have heard from many of my constituents. I feel that if adopted 
they will make the bill stronger and more acceptable to a large 
majority of firearms owners.
<P>
	Before outlining the details of these amendments, I want to 
clearly state that I intend at the end of the day to support Bill 
C-68. I believe the majority of the provisions in this bill will 
achieve our government's stated goal in improving public safety 
on the streets and in our homes. Certainly I am not alone in this 
regard. The vast majority of Canadians have expressed support 
for the crime  control elements of Bill C-68. Initiatives 
including stiffer penalties for illegal importation and trafficking 
of firearms as well as cracking down heavily on those who use 
firearms in the commission of crime will indeed improve 
security on our streets.
<P>
	In discussions I have had with my constituents, a common 
theme has consistently emerged. Many individuals have serious 
concerns with the mandatory registration of all long guns. The 
motions I have introduced reflect this concern. They are also a 
reflection of my absolute commitment to represent the views of 
the people of Annapolis Valley-Hants. I have promised from 
day one to work to address their problems with this bill and to 
bring forward realistic solutions in order to mitigate these 
concerns.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The overall objectives of this series of motions is quite 
simple. As I proposed in my written submission to the justice 
committee, I support amending the legislation in order to 
exempt owners of non-prohibited, non-restricted long guns 
historically used in Canada for hunting or sport shooting from 
licensing and registration provisions of Bill C-68. Any new 
purchases or transfers of existing firearms would be subject to 
the requirements outlined in the legislation.
<P>
	This proposal offers a reasonable balance between the rights 
of legitimate owners and users of firearms and our government's 
commitment to strong, effective firearms legislation. We have 
an opportunity to send a positive message to Canadians that we 
understand historical, cultural and economic attachments that 
have governed the use of firearms to this point in time. However, 
we will also be sending an important message that times are 
changing. In keeping with legitimate public concerns, new 
generations of firearms owners will be subject to new rules.
<P>
	Within this series of motions I would like to highlight two 
which are of particular importance. Motion No. 4 would add new 
clause 2(1) to the bill. This clause reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This act does not apply in respect of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any firearm that is not a prohibited firearm or a restricted firearm; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any ammunition that is not prohibited ammunition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion would allow for an exemption from the licensing 
and registration components of the bill for current owners of 
long guns.
<P>
	By supporting the inclusion of this clause, all members of the 
House will have a chance to acknowledge the legitimate rights 
of owners of long guns. It will ensure that these individuals will 
not be subject to undue burden or costs without weakening the 
crime control elements of the legislation. It will allow us to gain 
greater support or at the very least, tacit acceptance of Canada's 
gun owners. After all, without their acceptance or their 
willingness to comply with the new laws we may face problems 
enforcing this legislation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13587"> 13587 </A></B>
<P>
	The second motion I would like to briefly discuss is Motion 
No. 154. This motion would entail the adding of new clause 
110.1 to the legislation. This clause reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Notwithstanding section 2.1, the governor in council may make regulations 
that are applicable in respect of firearms that are not prohibited or restricted 
firearms for the purpose of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) establishing minimum age and safety criteria for purchasers of firearms;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) establishing safe storage and handling standards for firearms; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) regulating the exportation and importation of firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This additional clause responds to concerns over the ability to 
determine whether or not a long gun is owned and operated in a 
safe and legal manner. It has been included to ensure that 
officials have the ability to establish and enforce certain 
standards that must be strictly adhered to in order to legally own 
a long gun. This is not unlike the present system that uses the 
FAC.
<P>
	Through this amendment, the government will have the 
opportunity to implement through the regulations a means to 
ensure the safe and legal ownership of long guns. Any 
regulations would of course have to remain consistent with 
clause 2.1 which provides for the exemption of long guns from 
the licensing and registration components of the bill.
<P>
	I am pleased by the changes made to the bill during the 
committee hearings. These changes do reflect many concerns 
which have been brought forward by legitimate gun owners. I 
would also like to applaud my hon. colleagues who have worked 
so diligently on this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I would now ask my colleagues, as well as the Minister of 
Justice, to support the measures I have brought forward for 
debate today. While we have certainly come a long way in our 
deliberations, I believe we must go further still.
<P>
	These motions represent a modified course of action, a course 
that will in my opinion help gain the support of many firearms 
owners. By adopting this series of motions, I believe we will 
still achieve the overall intent of the legislation without adding 
to the overall bureaucracy or cost. Above all, we will develop a 
bill that addresses the concerns of all people on all sides of this 
issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just to give members the 
information as best I can, we are following the order of the 
movers of the motions in Group No. 3. I will now go to the hon. 
member for Parry Sound-Muskoka who of course we 
anticipate will complete his remarks after question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am cognizant this will be a two part process.
<P>
	The amendments in this third group deal with what I believe 
to be one of the most significant concerns which was expressed 
by my constituents and was expressed generally in much of the 
testimony given in front of the justice committee. They reflect 
to a great extent much of the correspondence most of us in this 
House have received from the Canadian public. Quite frankly, 
they mention the concern that the legislation is not necessarily 
going to do what it is intended to do which is to control violence 
in Canadian society, or it will achieve that to some extent but in 
doing so will affect legitimate firearms owners.
<P>
	There are many activities that firearms owners undertake in 
Canada which are legitimate, longstanding and traditional. In 
my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka hunting has been an 
important sport for many years. It is an important economic 
generator. It brings large numbers of people to our area every 
year.
<P>
	I can see that we are approaching the time for question period. 
I will finish later.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., we will now go to Statements 
by Members.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this House today on this first day of the 
Canadian Occupational Health and Safety Week, the theme of 
which this year is ``Reach Out and Communicate''.
<P>
	It is extremely important to celebrate this week in order to 
make all stakeholders in the work force aware of the importance 
of a safe and healthy work environment.
<P>
	Some fatal or serious accidents could have been avoided. 
Every day, two workers are killed and, every 38 seconds, an 
accident happens which could require compensation to be paid. 
The time has come to tackle vigorously what must not be 
regarded as inevitable.
<P>
	Quebec has adopted very strict measures to limit occupational 
hazards, and the Bloc Quebecois applauds such determination. 
It is now up to the work force in Canada to clearly give priority 
to this fundamental aspect of work.

the government has a unique opportunity to demonstrate its

<P>
	Robert Paul Thompson has applied for early release and 
tomorrow the parole board will hear his application. I will be in

	Let the government and the parole board never forget that

ultimately lost her life in her battle against Thompson.

	Thompson's violent rages are almost incomprehensible. In 
his anger and jealousy he alone was able to overcome three 
others, and with only a knife as his weapon.

65 metres to reach the young boy and placed a lifejacket over his

rescue was also swept into the waters. While towing the first boy

I rise to draw to the attention of all members of the House the 
Transportation Safety Board's report on the crash of an Air 
Manitoba flight at Sandy Lake on November 10, 1993.
<P>
	The report finds that previous to the crash Transport Canada's

maintenance discrepancies that were present''. In general it 
finds serious ``shortcomings'' in Transport Canada's 
``regulatory overview process of air carriers''. It makes a 
number of recommendations to improve the audit.

	Families of the victims of the crash are also concerned that 
when safety infractions are found by Transport Canada they are 
not then made public, depriving crew and the travelling public

	This incident has raised serious questions about the 
effectiveness of Transport Canada's monitoring of safety

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a time 
when the economy is in low gear, with almost zero growth 
during the first quarter, the statistics tell us that for the sixth 
month in a row, there has been no net job creation in Quebec.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the federal cabinet is looking at a new plan for 
reducing unemployment insurance benefits. Clearly, Ottawa has 
decided to reduce its deficit at the expense of the unemployed.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that the federal cabinet is 
putting the finishing touches on a plan to reduce unemployment 
insurance benefits that would cut $1.6 billion from the plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government made a commitment to reform social 
programs. There will obviously be transfers from one program 
to another. At this point, all I can say is that this fall, we will 
have a bill on the subject. The minister is consulting with his 
cabinet colleagues and his provincial counterparts. Hon. 
members will know what the bill is about as soon as it is ready 
this fall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering what was indicated in the last federal budget and 
what was leaked to the newspapers last weekend, the Prime 
Minister should give us some assurances or confirmation.
<P>
	Now that for the past six months there has been no net job 
creation in this country, would the Prime Minister confirm that 
the plan now before cabinet would oblige young people entering 
the labour market to work for 26 weeks full time-six full 
months-before they were protected under the unemployment 
insurance plan? Is that what he has to offer the people of 
Shawinigan, which depends even more than other cities in this 
country on government programs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone knows that in the past 19 months since we 
came to power, the unemployment rate went down from 11.5 per 
cent to 9.5 per cent. We think we can do better. We must keep 
working on creating jobs. With changes like those we want to 
make in existing social programs in this country, we wish to 
provide an incentive for people to work instead of receiving 
social benefits. Social program reform is based on a desire to 
create jobs and help people to find work instead of staying 
home, to give them back the dignity of being able to work, which 
is something I am sure they all want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister can make pretty speeches and juggle the figures, 
but the fact remains that the number of workers who are no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13592"> 13592 </A></B>
<P>
longer entitled to unemployment insurance  because of the 
government's cutbacks and are now on welfare is absolutely 
shocking.
<P>
	That being said, how can he justify the fact that the 
unemployment insurance reform his cabinet, his government, is 
considering will, according to his own analysis, affect people 
with incomes of less than $25,000 annually, in other words, 
workers whose employment status is precarious, who are at the 
bottom of the wage scale, the neediest in our society, and that 
these people may be permanently disqualified from receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits as a result of his cutbacks?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since this Parliament has been in session, we have been 
used to hearing the official opposition make similar predictions 
that have never come true.
<P>
	I would simply ask the hon. member to wait until the bill is 
introduced in the House of Commons. Our objective is to help 
people on low incomes find jobs and to give them a chance to get 
back into the labour market. That will be the objective of the 
reforms proposed by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.

<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The major proposed cuts to the UI program will primarily 
affect women and will do so in a very significant way. Indeed, 
women, who often hold the most precarious jobs, will be 
particularly affected by the proposed cuts.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by increasing the 
number of hours of work required to be eligible for UI from the 
current level of 180 to 300 hours to somewhere between 450 and 
700 hours, he is directly targeting women, who hold the vast 
majority of part time jobs in Canada, and that many of them will 
no longer be eligible for UI benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister said, 
no decision has been made regarding the UI program. A bill will 
be tabled this fall but, again, there has been no decision yet.
<P>
	I consulted Canadians, including Quebecers, and 60 per cent 
of them are asking for a UI reform that will promote work and a 
more equitable distribution of income. This is the purpose of the 
UI reform.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand that the minister is ruling out any cuts to the UI 
program? Or are we to understand that the federal government's 
answer to the women's march, which ended in Quebec City last 
week, is a program of UI cuts which will force women trying to 
re-enter the labour force to hold a full time job for six months to 
be eligible for UI benefits?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to 
the hon. member that in the last several months, for example, by 
the previous changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act the 
government has provided additional benefits for close to 
300,000 Canadians drawing unemployment insurance, of whom 
about 80 per cent were women. They gained an extra $1,000 per 
year income benefit. That was one of the direct results of our 
changes.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec alone we have provided direct 
assistance to over 50,000 women for training and career 
development programs. We are introducing a special program 
for women to go on to graduate school in universities. We have 
established under the self-employment program special 
initiatives for women to set up their own businesses.

admitted that Howard Wilson, the government's much touted 
ethics watchdog, has no teeth and has been relegated to a very 
minor role on ethical questions.
<P>
	She said: ``If there are questions about the ethics of the 
government, the ultimate arbiter of those questions is not a 
bureaucrat, it is the Prime Minister''. Canadians will take little 
comfort in that revelation, given the government's mishandling 
of the Canadian heritage minister's unethical behaviour.
<P>
	Since section 23 of the federal conflict of interest code has 
been violated by the heritage minister without reprimand or 
penalty, and since the Prime Minister is now the de facto ethics

waved around with great flourish at the beginning of the session. 
One section of it says that a public office holder shall take care 
to avoid the appearance of being placed under any obligation to 
any person that might profit from special consideration on the 
part of the office holder. The heritage minister broke this 
guideline. He did not avoid the appearance of conflict of 
interest.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister assumes ultimate responsibility for the 
application of these guidelines, will he hold the heritage 
minister accountable for violating not some general thing about 
fundraising but this specific guideline in his own code of 
conduct guidelines?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we go to any fundraising activities we meet 
people who do business. I do that regularly, ministers have to do 
that regularly, and members of Parliament do that regularly. We 
meet with the Canadian people and some contribute to the good 
functioning of the democratic institutions of Canada. 
Everything is public.
<P>
	The Reform Party is proposing at this time to make it even 
more open than it is today. It would like third party groups to 
finance while they are not running for office, to favour one cause 
or the other.
<P>
	We say if people want to be elected to Parliament and have 
influence, they should run for a political party and raise the 
money according to the laws of Canada. That is exactly what this 
party is doing, the Bloc Quebecois is doing, the Reform Party is 
doing and the Conservative Party is doing. They go to the people 
of Canada and ask for contributions. The contributions are made 
public; everybody has access to these lists, and anyone can 
check at any time of the year. The list for last year will be 
published in the next few days. The Reform Party will check the 
list of people who gave to us and we will check the list of those 
who gave to the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the Prime Minister that every day he pretends 
not to understand what the issue is he strengthens the public's 
suspicion that the government has something to hide.
<P>
	The heritage minister clearly violated the Prime Minister's 
conflict of interest guidelines with his dollars for contracts 
dinner, and the Prime Minister has gone to great lengths to 
pretend that this indiscretion was merely some part of routine 
fundraising, which it was not and is not.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister stop this charade, admit that it is now 
his office that is managing the disclosure or cover up of ethics 
code violations and provide the House with a full and frank 
disclosure of the heritage minister affair-who was invited, who 
contributed what and who got what?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to a very long question there is a very simple answer.
<P>
	There is no cover up of any kind. The leader of the Reform 
Party, the third party, which is about to become the fourth party 
in Canada, knows the names of everyone who was invited and 
contributed. It is all well known. It is all public information. We 
have nothing to hide. We gave the list of the people who were 
present at this party. There is no cover up. They have the names 
of the people and the amount of money that was contributed. 
That is the way we have raised money for political parties in 
Canada for many, many years. That is the way the Reform Party 
does it all the time.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party has a lot of those kinds of 
dinners all the time with a lot of people who contribute to his 
own party.

report published by the Quebec Department of Fisheries, which 
is based on consultations made by the minister, Mr. Beaudry. It 
said that unemployment insurance is not well adapted to the 
realities of Quebec's fisheries and that it currently hinders 
progress and development in this sector to a great extent by 
halting private initiatives and stifling people's dynamic energy.
<P>

reforms to the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister confirm that the federal government is not planning to 
reform the unemployment insurance system by cutting forestry 
workers' benefits by 22 per cent and fishery workers' benefits 
by 33 per cent? Does he not feel that this would hit regional 
workers very hard and that, in fact, the two tier system that he 
said he did away with because it was discriminatory is again 
rearing its ugly head in in his new proposal?

that went on last October.
<P>
	For the hon. member to be citing all kinds of facts and figures

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Regarding the contracts for dollars dinner held for the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Prime Minister stated that all 
the information is public. The Deputy Prime Minister stated that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage would be happy to make 
public all the information.
<P>
	Clients of the department were specifically targeted and 
invited to contribute. We are discovering, one name at a time, 
who contributed and what rewards the minister gave. The 
Liberal whip said the names of contributors have been tabled in 
the House and yet they have not.
<P>
	Who is on the contributors' list that the Prime Minister is 
hiding from us? Who else has been rewarded with contracts, 
grants or appointments for contributing to the minister's debt 
retirement fund?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again that is a completely false accusation. Every 
contribution to the Liberal Party, the Reform Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois or the Conservative Party, which is above $100, 
requires a receipt to be given to that person. This list is made 
public every year. Every contribution which is above $100 is 
published.
<P>
	When I was in the House the other day the minister gave the 
list to her. She has not read it yet. If she needs more information 
we have a procedure. She can table her request in the House of 
Commons and if it is within the responsibility of the minister, 
the request will be met as soon as possible. We have nothing to 
hide because every contribution to the Liberal Party is known by 
anyone who wants to know.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems that everyone in the country knows that the heritage 
minister should resign except the cabinet. Liberal backbenchers 
are saying that the contracts for dollars dinner was unethical and 
so are newspapers and Canadians across the country. The 
Friends of Canadian Broadcasting is asking for the minister's 
resignation. The Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, <I>Le Droit</I>, the <I>Citizen</I>, the

<P>
	We have learned on the eve of the G-7 Summit that Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin will be taking part in both political and 
economic discussions with the seven major industrialized 
nations-an indication that Russia is one step closer to 
membership in this exclusive group.
<P>
	Given the many human rights violations in Chechnya and the 
attitude of the Russian President during the Prime Minister's 
visit to Russia last spring, what position does the Prime Minister 
intend to take on Russia's increased inclusion in the group of 
seven?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Yeltsin will not attend the G-7 meeting. He will 
participate in the political meeting of the G-8 on the second day. 
The two meetings are different. The first is the meeting of the 
western world's seven most industrialized nations; the second, 
on the following day, will be a political meeting of the group of 
eight. Mr. Yeltsin will participate in this meeting.
<P>
	Economic discussions will be over. Mr. Yeltsin may choose to 
raise economic issues affecting Russia or other countries at the

wants. However, the G-7 economic summit will be over when 
we meet with Mr. Yeltsin.

	The cost to taxpayers for individual MPs' expense 
allowances, travel expenses and salaries are available for 
voters' scrutiny in the Public Accounts of Canada, volume II, 
part II. However, the cost of individual MP pensions is not there. 
The information commissioner is being forced to take recourse 
to the courts just to obtain a list of MP pension beneficiaries.
<P>
	Why is the government trying to hide how costly the MP 
pensions really are?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, the government is not trying to hide anything. It is 
trying to reduce the cost of MP pensions. Even though we have 
had suggestions to increase the size of the payroll of MPs 
coming from the very party that now asks the question, 
nevertheless we are proceeding on course to reduce by one-third 
the cost to taxpayers of MP pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	The House will notice that minister did not offer to reveal the 
real cost of MP pensions. We know that some Liberal members 
must opt out of the pension scheme in order to fulfil campaign 
promises made in the last election.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	If the government will not commit to publishing the benefits 
of the MP pension plan, will the minister at least agree to 
publish a list of those members who opt in and those who opt out 
or is he trying to hide that information too?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it will be up to each member of Parliament. Once the 
bill has been proclaimed, members will have 60 days in which to 
make a determination whether they want to be part of the plan.
<P>
	If the member wants further information he has only to look at 
the public accounts to determine what goes into MP pensions. 
What is in MP pensions, what is contributed by the taxpayer, the

fact, there has been no net job creation in the last six months.

it is a disaster but if he looks at the figures that his colleague who

level of economic growth of any of the countries of the G-7.
<P>
	The result over the past year has been over 430,000 new jobs 
in Canada. To call that a disaster seems to be turning logic on its 
head topsy-turvy. We are working hard to put in place an 
economic framework that will stimulate private jobs.
<P>
	Eighty thousand jobs have been created in the private sector 
over the past month. That shows that the stimulus is in the right 
place and that is the course we are following.

the answer I just received, does the minister not realize that, as a 
result of this government's first 18 months in power, the 
unemployment rate in Quebec still hovers around 11 per cent, 
the employment level has not moved in six months, 50,000 more 
people are on welfare, and thousands of unemployed workers do 
not qualify for UI benefits?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

economy has created over 219,000 jobs in the private sector, 
30,000 in the month of May alone.

	True, there have been job losses in the public sector because 
governments want to save money so they can spend it on

Following the NAFO meeting, the scope of the 
Canada-European Union agreement was expanded in two major 
ways. The conservation agreement on Greenland halibut, or 
turbot, now includes all Northwest Atlantic groundfish catches. 
As well, the Canada-European Union agreement now extends to 
the 15 NAFO members.

Quebec fishermen sometime.

<P>
	The meeting in Toronto last week in conclusion changed two 
important things. First, the NAFO enforcement rules now cover 
all vessels, not just EU vessels. Second, the new rules cover all 
species of fish, not just Greenland halibut or turbot.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On June 9, the UN secretary general officially recommended 
that the security council approve the deployment of a rapid 
reaction force in Bosnia. While the UN is about to give the green 
light to such an operation, the Canadian government is still 
hesitant about Canada's participation in that force.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister tell us clearly whether a decision has 
finally been made regarding Canada's participation in a rapid 
reaction force in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is still looking at the issue. We are 
waiting for the outcome of the discussions taking place between 
those countries which have already decided to participate, and 
for the UN position. As I said last week, I am personally not very 
enthusiastic about Canadian participation. However, if it is 
necessary, we will participate. However, there is no urgency, and 
a decision does not have to be made immediately.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Over the last three years our country has spent over $51 
million funding post-secondary education in Indonesia. Why 
we are doing this when we have just stripped $6 billion out of 
post-secondary education in Canada? Why are we funding this 
when the Government of Indonesia said it would ask us to pay 
for its students to come over here?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that the hon. member is trying to 
compare apples and oranges. The responsibilities that Canada 
has taken on regarding education are not only acknowledged but 
actually sought by a considerable number of stakeholders. The 
programs which for the most part are run in collaboration with 
Canadian universities and colleges have considerable spin-offs 
in the countries where these programs are in operation as well as 
in Canada itself.

management information systems, information technology, 
rationalization and infrastructure management and that he 
should report his findings at an appropriate time.

petitions containing well over 15,000 signatures of Canadians 
who are opposed to Bill C-68.
<P>
	The petitioners are requesting that Parliament not attack the 
recreational firearms community and that it support legislation 
that severely punishes one who uses a weapon, including a 
weapon other than a firearm, protects the rights and freedoms of 
the law-abiding recreational firearms community to own and 
use firearms responsibly, passes careful scrutiny to see that it 
will improve public safety in a cost effective manner, and 
repeals present firearms control legislation, which features 
tortuous language and has been characterized by the courts as 
one of the most horrifying examples of bad draftsmanship.
<P>
	As we draw to the close of the debate on Bill C-68 this week 
because of time allocation invoked by the government, let these 
petitions serve as a reminder that the minister does not have the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order to ask the government House leader when I can 
expect to receive an answer to Question No. 137, which has been 
on the Order Paper since February 6, 1995. I requested an 
answer from the government within 45 days, and now, as of 
today, 126 days have passed.
<P>
	Last Thursday the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader said once again that I can expect an answer to my 
question soon. I know the government is not interested in a free 
and open debate on the issue of gun control because they have 
invoked time allocation, but I find it hard to believe the 
government does not have the information on the cost of gun 
control readily at hand. My dictionary defines ``soon'' as 
``before long, promptly, quickly''. If the government isn't 
forthcoming with the information on the cost of gun control, 
maybe the parliamentary secretary should find a better word to 
describe this.
<P>
	Will I have an answer before the six hours of limited Liberal 
debate in third reading of Bill C-68? Will I have the information 
so we can properly debate this question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. member 
suggested, timetabling and organizing House business is an 
important aspect of government. In the case of these bills, the 
official opposition and the government agreed that six hours was 
quite a reasonable time to debate the gun control bill at the two 
stages, and that is what we have agreed to do.
<P>
	The government has not opposed this unilaterally, and I know 
the hon. member knows that and would not want to think that the 
government was acting unilaterally in cutting off debate, but we 
are trying to organize the time between now and the end of the 
session. Part of the duty of organizing that time involves getting 
answers to questions.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that a draft answer to this question 
has been seen. It was inaccurate. It is being corrected and will be 
available soon for the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Soon again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says ``soon again'' and that 
is absolutely true.
<P>
	Whether I will have the answer before the six hours of debate 
on third reading ends tomorrow I will have to wait until 
tomorrow to see. I hope so but I am not optimistic. Normally 
movement of the document around the various places it has to go 
to be corrected takes more than 24 hours. However I assure the 
hon. member I am doing my utmost to ensure he is provided with 
full and accurate answers to his questions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to finish my comments.
<P>
	As I was saying before question period, one of the concerns 
that has been brought forward to many members in the House 
has been the issue of the legitimate use of firearms. There is a 
concern that some of the provisions contained in Bill C-68 
could be used to curtail what in essence is legitimate activity by 
legitimate firearms owners.
<P>
	There are a number of activities undertaken that are historical 
in nature, that actually represent a way of life and a lifestyle we 
have come to know and enjoy in rural Canada, in my case in rural 
Ontario.
<P>
	Hunting for sustenance has a long history. Hunting for sport 
has been done in my riding for generations and generations. It is 
important to the psyche where one generation passes its firearms 
and the whole tradition of hunting to the next generation.
<P>
	Hunting is important in terms of economics as I mentioned 
when I spoke earlier. A large number of individuals travel to my 
riding and make use of the great facilities we have there. Of 
course trapping is important as an economic generator. Other 
recreational activities like target shooting are also important 
and for many people the collecting of firearms.
<P>
	It is important we ensure the provisions contained in Bill 
C-68 do not curtail such activities. For the most part they are 
designed to do what I fully support and what I know other 
government members support: control violence in Canadian 
society. That is the legitimate objective of the legislation, one 
that I support.
<P>
	If regulations are put forward that achieve public safety in 
their implementation and that help to reduce violence in society, 
most Canadians and legal firearm owners would be quite willing 
to support that. For the most part many of the regulations in this 
legislation do that. However some legitimate concerns have 
been expressed that need to be addressed and of which we need 
to be cognizant.
<P>
	There is the issue of cost. Many people who participate in 
hunting are not wealthy individuals. They either hunt for 
sustenance or they hunt for sport. We have to be very careful not 
to create a regulatory regime or a costing structure that will 
some day make it impossible for these individuals to pursue 
hunting.
<P>
	Although the government has done a good job in setting out a 
fee schedule that is modest, I have concerns that it stay that way 
and that firearm owners are not going to be faced with high costs 
down the road.
<P>
	I have a concern which I know is shared by many of my rural 
colleagues and by many legal owners of firearms: that 
provisions in this legislation could be used at some point in the 
future. The government has stated unequivocally that it is not its 
intention to do that but there is concern that people can use the 
provisions in the legislation to at some time prohibit firearms 
that are normally used for recreational purposes.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	This is a genuine concern. It is something that has been 
expressed by a lot of people. We need to put something in the 
legislation that makes it absolutely crystal clear that it is not the 
intent of Bill C-68 to restrict the legitimate use of firearms for 
legitimate purposes like hunting, target shooting and collecting. 
It is absolutely essential that we make sure that it is not done.
<P>
	Although most individuals will accept the regulations 
contained in the bill that are designed to increase public safety, 
although most individuals will accept those provisions that will 
ensure they attempt to curtail violence, it is important that we 
place within the body of the bill a safeguard, a provision that 
explicitly states that nothing in the legislation is intended to 
curtail the legitimate use of firearms.
<P>
	I will read the amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That nothing in this act is to be interpreted as prohibiting a person who is 
licensed to own a firearm from using a firearm, other than a restricted or 
prohibited weapon, that has been registered by the person pursuant to this act, 
from</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) using the firearm for recreational or sustenance hunting, target shooting, 
trapping or other lawful activity, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) keeping the firearm in a collection of firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is absolutely essential that we make it clear that nothing in 
Bill C-68 is to be used to curtail the legitimate use of firearms. I 
ask my colleagues to support this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the motions that I am presenting and speaking to on 
behalf of the government are:
<P>
	Motion No. 23 which is a correction of the French text.
<P>
	Motion No. 54 would amend the conditions which attach to 
lending a firearm to better reflect the actual practice. If a 
firearm's owner lends a gun to someone he or she knows very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13603"> 13603 </A></B>
<P>
well, it may not be necessary for that owner to verify the 
borrower's licence each time. If  someone is lending a firearm to 
a brother, his wife, or a wife to her husband, that firearm owner 
has every reason to believe that the person has a licence.
<P>
	Consequently this motion would change one of the lending 
conditions in the bill at the present time. What the government 
would require with the amendment now is: ``having reasonable 
grounds to believe that the borrower holds a licence''.
<P>
	This depends on the actual circumstances and may require a 
lender to request proof of the borrower's licence. For instance, if 
it is a stranger, someone the lender has never met before, then 
the lender would not have reasonable grounds to believe that the 
borrower holds a licence whereas if it was a member of a family, 
the borrower would.
<P>
	Therefore it is a significant change which will make the actual 
practice of using a borrowed firearm much more in line with 
reality.
<P>
	Motion No. 72 would clarify that a non-Canadian business 
wishing to ship firearms in transit through Canada must obtain 
an authorization to export, but need not have a business licence 
in Canada.
<P>
	As has been said before, even if the firearms are in transit 
through Canada, the firearms must be registered. There cannot 
be a shipment in transit, or otherwise, of firearms in Canada if 
those firearms are prohibited weapons.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	A motion was adopted at committee stage which provided that 
in an application to the registrar for an authorization to export, 
the registrar could only request from the applicant such other 
information as is reasonably required. For consistency sake, 
Motion No. 78 would also add the word ``reasonably'' to 
authorization to import. Therefore, the word ``reasonably'' 
would be required not only for export but for import as well. We 
have to look to the business practices of manufacturers. There is 
no reason that they should be giving any information requested 
of them, particularly if it does not have any relation to what is 
required and gives confidential competitive data that would 
only serve to hurt their competitive position.
<P>
	As I mentioned, a very similar motion was introduced and 
adopted at committee stage. However, customs in particular is 
asking for a slight modification in the wording referring to the in 
transit shipments to avoid any future confusion.
<P>
	Motion No. 109 relates to changes introduced at committee 
allowing an appeal of the minister's decision in respect of 
shooting club approval. In it we referred to provincial ministers. 
This change is to make a reference to federal ministers as well as 
provincial ministers. The federal and provincial ministers will 
be able to give approval to shooting clubs.
<P>
	Motion No. 111 is essentially the same as 109. It relates to 
changes introduced in committee allowing the appeal of a 
minister's decision in respect of shooting club approval. The 
minister may be provincial or federal. As I have said, this 
motion is intended to clarify the appropriate minister in the 
appropriate circumstances.
<P>
	Essentially, most of the amendments in group three relate to 
the registry system. A number of motions delete the role of and 
references to the registry right through to the registrar and is 
related to the Reform Party's proposal to eliminate the registry.
<P>
	The second largest area where motions are put forward refer 
to the rationale for a registration system and whether they 
should apply to long guns. The concern is that the registry 
system is put into effect for various reasons for long guns as well 
as for handguns. The idea is so that we will have a record of all 
firearms in Canada. If a firearm is stolen, we want to know 
where that firearm is. We want to have, if not the serial number, 
then certainly pertinent data that would allow us to track that 
firearm.
<P>
	We also want to be able to register firearms immediately on 
their entering the country. We found that when certain firearms 
are brought into Canada initially and not registered, as was 
practice in the past, between customs and the 
wholesaler-distributor, some of those firearms disappear.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, we also want to register firearms even 
when they are in transit through the country. If that is to be an 
inconvenience then so be it, but frankly we do not really want to 
encourage the in transit shipment of firearms through Canada.
<P>
	We also want to be able to impress on people that firearms are 
important and that the owner's care is very important as well.
<P>
	We feel the registration system will be of benefit and will 
reduce death through firearms. We feel there will be a greater 
appreciation of firearms. The minister has stated time and again 
that the costs are going to be minimal for the registration of a 
firearm beginning in January 1, 1998. It may not be anything but 
very shortly it will go to $10 for up to 10 firearms and maybe up 
to $18 for 10 firearms before the end of the five year period.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The minister has been very frank on that. He has stated there 
will not be any cost initially for getting a possession licence but 
for the renewal of an FAC or eventual renewal of a possession 
licence it will be $60 for a five year period. Once a firearm has 
been registered there will not be any need to register it again. 
With respect to the possession licence there does not have to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13604"> 13604 </A></B>
<P>
any course taken if the possession licence is for firearms 
presently possessed and not for the purchase of new firearms.
<P>
	The registration system has been put into effect with the 
lawful gun owner in mind. Supposedly there will be the 
inconvenience of having to register long guns. That is in the eye 
of the beholder. A lot of people who have long guns do not mind 
registering them. It is not, as some people have stated, an idea of 
keeping track of all the long guns with the eventual intention of 
confiscation. That is not the intent at all. If that were the case, 
we would not be spending up to $85 million on the registration 
system.
<P>
	The member for Yorkton-Melville has requested costing. The 
minister provided the costing in committee when he initially 
appeared. He stated why in his and the government's opinion it 
would be $85 million.
<P>
	The idea is to put the possession licence in effect on January 1, 
1996 and the registration certificates for firearms beginning in 
January 1, 1998 to give the system a chance to work gradually. 
Also it is hoped that Canadians will see that the registration of 
firearms and the possession licences are not an attempt to act 
against the lawful gun owner.
<P>
	To know what firearms are illegal first we must know which 
firearms are legal. That makes sense. We cannot just say that a 
particular firearm is illegal unless we have a common 
denominator to say which ones are legal. That is a basic axiom 
and we want to create that basic axiom in the registration of 
firearms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
amendments deal with the registration system.
<P>
	During the appearance of witnesses before the standing 
committee, I recall asking a criminologist how the registration 
of rifles and shotguns would reduce the criminal use of those 
firearms. I was surprised at his answer. He said that we would 
probably see no effect in this area for 15 years. That was the 
closest we could get to seeing any impact on the whole area of 
deaths by gunshot wounds during the four weeks of testimony 
before the committee.
<P>
	When we look at the registration of firearms, before the 
system can register one single firearm we have to licence all the 
owners under the provisions of clause 5 of the bill. Clause 5 
requires the chief firearms officer to take cognizance of the 
criminal record of the individual, the mental health record of the 
individual and a neighbourhood check as to the record of the 
individual to determine whether there is any violence in that 
individual's history. Before getting to the registering of firearms 
the owner of the firearm must first satisfy the chief firearms 
officer that he or she is eligible to own a firearm in accordance 
with the criteria set out.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	When we look at the cost of this it is not unlike the procedure 
followed to obtain an FAC today. If we look again at the cost of 
the FAC the Toronto metro police board did an analysis of the 
cost for an FAC during 1994 and it came to $185. If that is the 
cost to register or license an individual and it is going to have to 
go through a similar process and cost a similar amount, then we 
are looking at three million gun owners multiplied by $185 
which comes to $550 million before a single firearm is 
registered. The cost of this whole thing will be far greater than 
the $85 million suggested by the justice department.
<P>
	Then we have to look at the possibility that a gun owner may 
not meet the criteria. If the gun owner does not meet the criteria 
what happens to his firearms? It means he cannot get a licence to 
own them, therefore he cannot own them. What happens to those 
firearms? We never got a clear response, at least I did not, from 
the witnesses including justice officials on that question. Some 
said they might be allowed to sell them or export them.
<P>
	If a person is not eligible to hold a licence to own a firearm it 
means it would be dangerous to allow them to continue to own a 
firearm. It seems very clear to me that it would be the 
responsibility and duty of the police to remove those firearms 
from the possession of that individual if that individual does not 
meet the criteria to hold a licence. That issue has not been 
clarified well enough.
<P>
	There is the issue of cost before a single firearm is registered. 
If the individual does meet the criteria and receives a licence 
then there is the added cost of registering the firearm. To suggest 
it is going to cost $10 to register a firearm is utter nonsense. 
What can we register for $10 today?
<P>
	Although it may only cost the firearms owner $10 it is going 
to cost the taxpayer a lot more for the police or whoever is 
transferring the information and identifying features from the 
firearm into the system itself and then issuing a registration 
certificate. No one has assured the committee or assured me that 
it is going to cost less than $10. I will have more to say on this 
during the final debate at third reading.
<P>
	We must seriously look at the whole registration system. No 
evidence, not even a smidgen has been produced that we could 
consider from a common sense point of view that the 
registration of a rifle or a shotgun is going to reduce the criminal 
use of that firearm. If all of the firearms in the country were 
registered now, what would stop the suicides? As our hon. 
colleague from Kamloops indicated, what would stop those 
individuals who lose their sense of responsibility through drug 
abuse, alcohol abuse or simple anger and despair? What would 
cause them to be less likely to use a firearm simply because it is 
registered? It does not make sense.
<P>

	I ask all hon. members to consider these amendments that deal 
with that aspect of Bill C-68. We say it is not going to work so 
why go forward with it?
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	We asked the government to bring forward those portions of 
the bill that get tougher on the criminal use of firearms. There is 
not anyone in this House or anyone in Canada who would not 
immediately support that aspect of the bill. The government has 
failed to do so. That saddens me and many of my colleagues on 
this side of the House.
<P>

heard from each of the movers of the motions in Group No. 3.

<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My comments will be on Motion No. 54, the lending 
provisions.
<P>
	I would like to thank Atima Hadlari for lending me his 
shotgun yesterday to go out hunting in Cambridge Bay for geese 
and ducks. He was very nice about it. I know him very well. He 
offered me the use of his .12 gauge shotgun and I obliged.
<P>
	Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal groups who appeared 
before the justice committee expressed concerns about the 
lending provisions of Bill C-68. They talked about the 
impracticality of lending a registration certificate along with a 
firearm when someone is out on the land hunting for food, which 
we were doing just a little over 24 hours ago in Cambridge Bay.
<P>
	This is an issue of concern in my riding of Nunatsiaq. The 
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, the Grand Council of the Crees of 
Quebec, the Council for Yukon Indians and representatives of 
the Government of the Northwest Territories all expressed 
similar concerns. Again, the minister and the government have 
responded to the concern. I express my thanks to the minister for 
listening.
<P>
	Motion No. 54 is a practical one. It would remove the 
requirement to transfer the registration certificate along with 
the firearm when the firearm is being loaned to someone who 
will be hunting for sustenance purposes.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of the Inuit in my riding hunt for food. They may 
supplement it with food from the Bay, the co-op and other 
stores. We do not have grocery stores as such; we have 
department stores. They may supplement the food they get from 
hunting with food from the stores, but they all hunt.
<P>
	I was in my hometown of Repulse Bay two weeks ago. I went 
caribou hunting and got a caribou. I was in Baker Lake a week 
after that. People there depend on caribou. Everyone depends on 
the caribou they hunt. As I said, a little over 24 hours ago I was 
in Cambridge Bay. There because they hunt for food, they are 
always concerned about their neighbours, their friends or 
whoever else may lack hunting equipment, whether it is a 
snowmobile, a rifle, or gas. They lend hunting equipment to 
their neighbours, their relatives, their sons, their daughters or 
whomever. Lending firearms is a common occurrence. In the 
north it is as common as lending a lawnmower or a cup of sugar 
to a next door neighbour.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In doing this the government is acknowledging that we have a 
way of life which includes lending whatever we have to our 
neighbours, sons, daughters or whomever; our firearms in this 
case.
<P>
	It is with deep appreciation to the minister that I support 
Motion No. 54, knowing that he has listened to my ongoing 
concern about that portion of the bill and knowing that he has 
understood that it is a special case.

	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for you. The hon. 
member is speaking to us in a language that I neither recognize 
nor understand. I would like to know if we must continue to 
listen. As far as I know, the hon. member is not using one of the 
official languages.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In response to the point of 
order raised by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, there is 
nothing in the standing orders that would allow the Chair to 
force a member from either side of the House to speak in one 
language or another.
<P>
	Allow me to raise a personal point. In these circumstances, I 
still appreciate the hon. member for Nunatsiaq's using his 
mother tongue and, I take it, translating his words into English 
from time to time. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Does this mean, Mr. Speaker, that hon. members 
of Ukrainian or German descent-our members come from all 
kinds of backgrounds-can now make their speeches in their 
mother tongues?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I can only answer the hon. 
member's question pursuant to the standing orders of the House 
of Commons, which hon. members must comply with. At this 
time, there is nothing in the standing orders preventing anyone 
from using, as you say, a language that is not one of Canada's 
two official languages. In the present circumstances, the hon. 
member for Nunatsiaq may speak in his mother tongue.

<P>
	It is an insult to the people of Canada that some people would 
not agree with our speaking our own language when the Inuktitut 
language in Canada is 4,000 years old and the English and 
French languages are mere hundreds of years old.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> A lot of my constituents are out camping now 
because school is over for the summer. They will not wait 
around for someone to come along and say: ``Here is my 
registration certificate. There is a polar bear coming so you 
better come and get your rifle or lend me your rifle''. There has 
to be an understanding on the issue of lending. This applies to all 
sustenance hunters whether aboriginal or non-aboriginal.
<P>
	The motion will benefit all hunters and trappers because it 
recognizes that there is a different way of doing things in the 
rural areas. I strongly support the motion and urge the House to 
support it.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
this morning I was a little confused about when I was supposed 
to speak and on what, but I think I have it all straightened out 
now. However I am sure you will straighten me out if I do not.
<P>
	I will be speaking to clause 110 and would like to respond to 
the motion made with regard to it. I agree with the member 
across the way who moved the amendment that something needs 
to be done about the clause. I personally believe it needs to be 
totally scrapped.
<P>
	I disagree with the parliamentary secretary who feels there is 
no concern about prohibiting certain firearms, confiscation, et 
cetera, because of the powers in the clause.
<P>
	I have given out several hundred copies of the bill even 
though it cost quite a bit from my budget. I have had responses 
back from a number of people, including legal minds and people 
who support the idea, who say it is a terrible piece of legislation, 
that it is just plain bad and written very poorly. Many of these 
people came to Canada from places like Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary and lived in the days when those kinds of thing 
happened. They know what they are talking about.
<P>
	We all know how much the Liberal government desires power. 
Bill C-68 is a further example of how power hungry the Liberal 
government can be. clause 110 of Bill C-68 gives absolute 
power through order in council to dictate every condition chosen 
to end firearm ownership for reasonable law-abiding people.
<P>
	No matter how many times the minister and the power hungry 
members of his government state that their intention is not to 
remove ownership of firearms from Canadians, the wording and 
the language in the bill read otherwise.
<P>
	We on this side know why the minister and his government are 
invoking closure on the bill. It is just another example of their 
thirst for abusive power. Their attempt at ramming the 
legislation through before the House closes for the summer is 
their own means of protecting their backbench members.
<P>
	As the Ontario election has shown, the people of Canada are 
tired of top heavy government that passes legislation to look 
good rather than to do what the people want. The clock is ticking 
on Liberal style government. As each second passes more and 
more people have read Bill C-68 and discovered that it is a bad 
bill and it is not about public safety.
<P>
	The people of Canada have discovered that Bill C-68 is all 
about giving absolute power in clause 110 to a chosen few social 
engineers and ivory tower intellectuals who believe they know 
what is best for Canada. As the Ontario election proves, the 
people of Canada are tired of dictatorial government of any 
stripe and want a government that mirrors the will of the people, 
not the mandate of closet dreamers.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The clock is ticking and each tick places more and more 
pressure on the minister to push Bill C-68 through the House. 
Each tick of the clock gives more and more Canadians time to 
understand the powers given in clause 110 to the governor in 
council and to make absolute demands upon the people of 
Canada. Each tick of the clock is making the Liberal government 
and the minister weaker among the citizens of Canada. That is 
why they are in such a hurry to get this dictatorial mandate 
through the House.
<P>
	The Liberal government finally understands that the people 
have had enough of false prophesies from a government opposed 
to the wishes of Canadians. Canadians did not agree to firearm 
controls to hamper and incriminate law-abiding friends and 
neighbours who own and use properly stored firearms. 
Canadians want the government to use legislation to deter and 
punish those who believe a firearm can be a useful tool in 
robbery, assault and murder.
<P>
	Canadians want their government to get tough with criminals, 
to make criminals understand that using a firearm will result in 
swift, sure justice with dire consequences for unlawful 
behaviour.
<P>
	As more and more Canadians read and understand Bill C-68 
they find that the legislation does not protect them from 
criminals and law breakers who improperly use illegally 
smuggled firearms. They have found legislation that 
criminalizes their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13607"> 13607 </A></B>
<P>
friends and neighbours at each and every whim of a select few 
and orders in council.
<P>
	Canadians did not elect members to the House so that a chosen 
few among them could dictate their favoured beliefs. Canadians 
elected members to the House because they believed members 
when elected would stand up for constituent wishes over the 
elite who want control over every aspect of Canadian life.
<P>
	During the last election each party promised Canadians that 
they would vote according to constituent wishes, that if elected 
constituents would come first over party politics and the whim 
of a few chosen to rule.
<P>
	The order in council in Bill C-68 shows Canadians that the 
Liberals have broken the most sacred of their promises and that 
the government is without integrity and cannot be trusted to 
maintain its promises beyond the ink drying in the red book.
<P>
	There is no representation by constituents in the bill. 
Constituents asked for input in their governments. The bill 
removes all authority from people and gives total control of the 
people to the chosen few.
<P>
	The clock is ticking and the Liberal government knows it. At 
each tick the government knows its old style government of 
distortion and outright misrepresentation is doomed to failure, 
but the government has cashed too many cheques from its 
special interests and vested groups to back down.
<P>
	As the heritage minister holds special meetings where 
contributions can buy political favours, the justice minister has 
special meetings where utopian idealists convince the 
government they know what is best: ``Give yourself absolute 
power. Use that power to make firearm owning Canadians 
semi-criminals at the least and outright criminals at the most. 
Threaten Canadians with absolute punishment for daring to own 
politically incorrect private property, legally owned firearms, 
and then Canadians will be safe''.
<P>
	Canadians have read Bill C-68 and know that it has little to do 
with public safety. It has little to do with making career 
criminals and first time criminals fearful of our courts. 
Canadians have read Bill C-68 and discovered the government 
wants dictatorial powers. That is why more and more Canadians 
are pushing their Liberal backbench members to vote against the 
bill. The government knows when its backbenchers return to its 
constituencies there will be questions asked. The government 
knows constituents will ask how ill advised spending of tax 
dollars for registering lawful private property will increase 
public safety when study after study states registration will not 
reduce use of firearms by criminals.
<P>
	The government knows constituents will ask their Liberal 
members why they supported a bill the constituents did not 
want, but most of all the government knows constituents will 
ask why backbench members agreed to give the chosen few 
absolute power to dictate to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	The clock is ticking. As Ontario voters proved, the Liberal 
ideal of government by the elite chosen few is over. Canadians 
have chosen to take back their right to govern and the 
government knows it. As I said, too much political capital has 
been granted by the minister and his government to abandon this 
ill advised bill. While the clock is ticking on their style of 
dictatorial government through order in council they are stuck 
with it and they shall be stuck with it during the next federal 
election. They will have to explain to constituents why they did 
not do as promised, why individual MPs in the Liberal Party 
were not listened to, why there were few free votes and why the 
government chose the old style Liberal way of government by 
the few which it stated it would not do.
<P>
	The clock is ticking not only in Ontario but in British 
Columbia and all across Canada where Canadians believe 
government is elected to follow the wishes of the people, not to 
follow the wishes of a selected few chosen to mandate by order 
in council.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is a documented futile attempt at social 
engineering, not criminal justice. This bill affects law-abiding 
citizens more than criminals, demands more from citizens than 
criminals and wastes tax dollars on a non-existent claim of 
public safety.
<P>
	Canadians know this and that is why more and more 
Canadians understand what Bill C-68 means to the democratic 
principles they thought they voted for. More and more 
Canadians will abandon the Liberal government. As the clock 
ticks the Liberal government loses credibility on each count. 
The government that promised integrity but gave Canadians the 
old style of patronage will find its bases thinning.
<P>
	The bill will not reduce the flow of illegal firearms or reduce 
the use of illegal firearms. It is estimated the bill will increase 
the flow and value of illegal firearms while it punishes 
law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	A vote for this bill is a vote against democratic principles. It is 
a vote for absolute power and the worst part of it is those who 
vote for the bill are supporting a minor defeat for democracy in 
this land.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is not about public safety or good governance, it is 
about the manner in which Canadians will be governed. I 
support government by and for the people, not dictatorial 
misadventure, and I believe that most Canadians agree with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I take the opportunity to address these motions. At report stage 
there are some 267 motions to amend the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13608"> 13608 </A></B>
<P>
	I will address the time element because as members begin to 
talk we lose sight of the fact that there has been a great deal of 
discussion about Bill C-68. It has been happening now for well 
over a year. Members have had discussion papers and briefing 
documents. It has taken a great deal of time and now is the time 
to move forward.
<P>
	If the House had to debate each amendment with the 
appropriate time allocation we would be here until next 
Christmas. The government has to move forward. We have had a 
great deal of time to discuss this. The allegation of some 
members that somehow this is ramming something through is 
quite to the contrary.
<P>
	The hon. member for Wild Rose said the government's 
position on Bill C-68 is simply the whim of a few. Yet, as we 
well know, more than two-thirds of Canadians actively support 
this piece of legislation.
<P>
	I want to address the issue of registration. That is certainly 
one of the areas where members have brought forward their 
concerns. In my riding people have asked questions concerning 
registration. I think it is fair to ask the question and to explain 
how registration and crime reduction go hand in hand and cannot 
be split, as hon. members might suggest.
<P>
	Many members have asked why we are going after 
law-abiding citizens and not criminals. Law-abiding citizens 
are law-abiding citizens until they are convicted. There are no 
shades of grey in between.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recently came 
out with a report. I thought it was very useful. Today the law 
requires all handguns to be registered, and law-abiding citizens 
have them registered.
<P>
	One of the interesting facts was that 40 per cent of the crimes 
committed with these guns were registered. That is very 
significant. Members in the Reform Party continue to say 
law-abiding citizens, those who register their firearms, do not 
commit crime. Yet 40 per cent of the crimes committed with 
handguns presently required to be registered were committed by 
registered firearms.
<P>
	This legislation will ask that all firearms now be registered 
including long arms, shotguns and rifles. I found out another 
interesting statistic from this report, that 47 per cent of all 
firearms crimes committed in Canada involved long arms. That 
is the reason long arms should also be registered.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians have to look too far for the facts that 
encourage them to tell their members of Parliament that we do 
value safety. Canadians hear statistics all the time about the 
realities of gun crime; 200 children are shot by guns every year. 
This is appalling to Canadians. There is a problem to be dealt 
with.
<P>
	There a were some 1,400 firearms deaths last year, some 77 
per cent of which were suicides. Only 3 per cent of those 
firearms deaths had anything to do with self-defence. These are 
facts which indicate clearly there  are problems we can address 
to ensure our communities remain safe.
<P>
	Unlike the platitudes and rhetoric I have been hearing from 
the Reform I will give more facts. The Prime Minister was 
recently in the United States. He was asked why people in the 
UN thought Canada was the best country in the world. He said 
the global economy is making us more and more alike. He said 
there were two things that really made Canada distinctive. The 
first is our medicare system. I do not have to explain to hon. 
members how important that is to Canadians. The second is that 
we can walk in our parks safely, unlike in the United States.
<P>
	In the United States there are more gun shops than there are 
gas stations. There are private security officers in the United 
States than there are real police. For every one crime with a 
firearm in Canada there are 100 in the United States. When we 
take into account the 10 to 1 population differential that means 
the situation is 10 times worse in the United States than in 
Canada.
<P>
	With such a vast majority of our population being so close to 
the U.S. border why has the gun problem not moved more fully 
into Canada? There are a couple of reasons. One has to do with 
the American constitution which has effectively the right to bear 
arms, whereas in Canada we do not have that right enshrined in 
our constitution. Ownership of a gun in Canada is a privilege 
subject to certain rules. Those are some of the reasons we have 
such a low relative crime rate with guns.
<P>
	The real question has to do with crime. The members repeat 
the question about what the bill will do about crime. It is an 
excellent question. The importance of the question is how we 
approach it. Do we wait until after we have a problem and then 
start to deal with it or do we do things in advance anticipating 
forces in our society which may result in a greater level of 
crime?
<P>
	We spend 75 per cent of what we do on remedial health care 
and only 25 per cent on prevention. To make sure our health care 
remains affordable and accessible, we have to deal more on the 
preventative side. This bill has an awful lot to do with 
preventing crime. It is not reducing crime; it is preventing crime 
and it results in the same effect.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Since the mid-seventies about 64,000 firearms were reported 
lost, missing or stolen in Canada. We wonder how many guns 
were actually lost, missing or stolen but not reported. This fact 
alone indicates that members who would suggest criminals get 
their firearms only through smuggling really failed to 
understand the facts. So-called law-abiding gun owners are 
major suppliers of firearms to the criminal element. Some 1,400 
firearms last year were reported lost, missing or stolen.
<P>

<P>
	The cost issue has come up in my riding and in the House. The 
parliamentary secretary has done an excellent job to make sure 
Canadians know despite the rhetoric we have heard from others 
that cost is not a major item here. Registration will begin on 
January 1, 1998 and does not have to be fully implemented until 
the year 2003. In the initial phases it will cost something like 
$10 for up to 10 guns for a five year period. Clearly in the first 
period as we go through this process of transitioning to 
registration of our firearms cost should not be a major problem 
for Canadians.
<P>
	With regard to the issue of what gun control will do about 
crime, the most important element is public education. Now that 
we have discussed the issue of crime and firearms for well over a 
year now, more and more Canadians know what a serious 
responsibility it is to own a firearm. They know now they have to 
have a licence, that they have to register, that there are 
restrictions on storage and mandatory criteria for ammunition, 
transportation, et cetera. It is a very serious responsibility.
<P>
	One of the things I am finding from talking to a number of 
serious gun owners and club shooters is they are finding there 
are an awful lot of guns now for sale to collectors and to clubs 
and other owners. A large number of people in Canada who have 
acquired firearms either through an inheritance or on a whim 
really are not very serious. Recent statistics show 60 per cent of 
firearms owners have not shot their guns in the last year and 
some 40 per cent have not shot their guns in the last five years.
<P>
	A lot of people with firearms in their homes probably were not 
totally familiar with the rules and regulations. Now through this 
education process, now that more and more Canadians 
understand the important responsibility of owning a firearm, 
they are getting rid of those guns. That is good in terms of 
reducing the probability of firearms being dumped into the 
criminal markets.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has listened to Canadians. The 
amendments are constructive and address the concerns of many 
Canadians.

agreement made this morning the divisions on the motions are

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to the 
motions under group No. 4, since this series of amendments 
basically deals with the decriminalization of the whole 
registration system for certain categories. In any case, the Bloc, 
under Motion No. 133, for instance, proposes to decriminalize 
failure to register shoulder arms. Let me explain that shoulder 
arms means shotguns and rifles. Contrary to certain comments 
by the government or even by the third party, we do not want to 
decriminalize all guns but only shotguns and rifles, referred to 
as shoulder arms.
<P>
	Throughout this debate, I was surprised to see that although 
both the gun lobby and the anti-gun coalition raised some 
arguments that were very emotionally charged, there was no 
discussion, although there should have been, about what society 
wants out of this bill.
<P>
	I think society wants better gun control. I think it makes 
sense, in a society like ours, that people who own guns should 
register them. But do we really want to make criminals of people 
who, either out of stubbornness or sheer ignorance-although 
all citizens are supposed to know the law, there are a number 
who do not- because they do not know all the details of the 
legislation, will not register their shoulder arms?
<P>
	Does the minister want to make criminals of these people? I 
hardly think so.
<P>
	I was on the committee when the minister came to testify and 
seemed to be willing to open the door to decriminalizing failure 
to register a firearm. I felt the minister was listening very 
carefully. I felt he wanted to make the legislation more flexible 
in this respect, but I also felt that there was a huge lobby out 
there asking the minister not to give in, because the public ought 
to feel the government is very serious about this legislation.
<P>
	With the amendment proposed under Motion No. 133, the 
government could have sent a message showing it was serious 
just the same, since I do not think that giving someone who fails 
to register a criminal record proves anything about the 
government's intentions. Sure, it shows it is being serious, but at 
what price? Some people will be prosecuted for failing to 
register the old twelve-gauge in the closet-this is one of my 
favourite examples-will they have a criminal record, with 
everything that entails? For instance, someone with a criminal 
record may have trouble finding a job or obtaining a passport. Is 
that what the Minister of Justice really wants? I do not think so. 
So why not make this clear in the bill?
<P>
	With this amendment, we could also have sent a very clear 
message to the public that it is a serious matter to fail to register, 
by imposing substantial fines. For the first violation, a fine of 
between $500 and $2,500, which is quite a substantial sentence. 
We could also send a clear message by saying that unregistered 
guns will be seized and the owner will have seven days to 
register, upon receipt of a notice to that effect. The objective is 
to register these guns so that the objective will be met without 
criminalizing a group of people for no good reason.
<P>
	I think we could have achieved the purpose of this bill. But no, 
as I said earlier, there is this debate between two groups at the 
opposite ends of the spectrum, about the same bill. The first 
group says: Listen, the legislation goes too far, it is too 
totalitarian and will cost too much money. What this group 
really wants is no legislation at all.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, the coalition and every other group in 
favour of firearms registration would like the legislation to go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13619"> 13619 </A></B>
<P>
further. The penalties are never severe enough; they are asking 
for pretty outrageous sentences. Basically, what would make 
them happy is for no one to be allowed to own weapons.
<P>
	I think that the Bloc's proposal regarding decriminalization 
makes for a balanced amendment. I think that this kind of 
amendment favours neither the gun lobby nor the coalition. The 
ultimate objective could be served by such an amendment.
<P>
	This bill is certainly a step in the right direction. There is 
obviously a need for the government to legislate in this area. 
This bill meets a need. I think that the statistics showing a large 
majority of voters in Canada and Quebec in favour of increased 
gun control are right.
<P>
	I spoke to my constituents, not only hunters or representatives 
of one group or another, and they have told me that they want 
increased control. But they do not necessarily agree with certain 
specifics, such as criminalization. I think that a considerable 
education effort is still required if we want to know what the 
people really want us to do in this regard.
<P>
	Yes, the people want firearms legislation, but I think this is 
not the kind of legislation they want. In light of the amendment 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois in committee, the government 
has relaxed a number of clauses in its bill along the lines of what 
the Bloc had suggested. Much to its credit it paid attention, in 
certain respects, to the amendments and suggestions made by 
the Bloc Quebecois on Bill C-68.
<P>
	If what the government is looking for is a bill that meets a 
consensus, a bill that will gain the widest support possible, the 
bill before us contains a stumbling block called 
decriminalization and, on this subject, the government should 
consider the proposed amendment carefully.
<P>
	Ten minutes is a very short time to debate these amendments, 
but since I can speak only once and this bill is being debated 
globally, let me say that we cannot address decriminalization 
without addressing something else at the same time. As regards 
the issue of decriminalization, I feel that the minimum sentence 
of four years is unconscionable. To provide a minimum sentence 
of four years for certain offences committed with a firearm is to 
yield to the gun lobby.
<P>
	Why remove the courts' discretionary power? Why remove 
the discretion which judges can use, given the evidence before 
them? The government argues that, on average, the courts 
currently impose a four year sentence for such offences. But 
why force them to automatically impose that sentence? Why not 
let them weigh the evidence? Why not trust the courts and the 
appointed judges, who are supposed to represent the public?
<P>
	Why not let them weigh all the evidence and then impose the 
sentence which they feel, is the most appropriate, given the 
evidence before them? This is an aspect which the Minister of 
Justice should look at very carefully, to comply with the existing 
legislation and to promote Canada's objectives in that respect.
<P>
	There is also the issue of universal appliction of the act in 
Canada. The Minister of Justice repeatedly said that the act 
would apply everywhere in Canada. I hope it does, including on 
Indian reserves. If this act is going to be implemented 
everywhere, why does clause 110, among others, provide that 
the government can exclude a person?
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Since the past is indicative of the future, we are well aware 
that some people, particularly aboriginals, will be excluded 
because hunting is an important activity for their survival.
<P>
	Why not pass legislation which will not only apply 
everywhere, but also to everyone? In conclusion, if the 
government is prepared to listen to Canadians, including 
Quebecers, it will accept the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois regarding decriminalization. This would ensure that 
people are really treated fairly, and it would also ensure that the 
legislation targets those who should be targeted, which is not the 
case right now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
just take a few minutes to address my amendment here. It has to 
do with the subject of decriminalizing the offences that are now 
in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	If we look at sections 91 and 92, we see that the penalties 
under indictment of both of those sections are absolutely 
draconian. Section 92 allows for an individual who knowingly 
refuses or neglects to register his or her firearm to be sentenced 
to a term of ten years. Under section 91 if they proceed by way of 
indictment they can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 
five years.
<P>
	There has been a new section put into the act at committee 
stage, I think it is 107.1, which makes it a summary conviction 
offence. However, the police will have the authority to arrest 
anyone in possession of a firearm under any of those sections, 
even the most draconian, which is under section 92. They can 
arrest them. It is an indictable offence. They can charge them, 
fingerprint them, and then they can reduce or withdraw the 
charge afterwards, while that person's fingerprints are on file.
<P>
	We see the same kind of thing occurring to a certain degree 
under section 85 of the Criminal Code, where they lay charges 
against individuals for using a firearm in the commission of an 
offence and then later withdraw those charges as a plea 
bargaining tool. I see the same kind of power and authority being 
granted through these sections.
<P>
	Therefore, the purpose of our amendments is to eliminate the 
draconian measures and penalties that are included in this bill. I 
might bring to everyone's attention that the idea of sentencing 
someone or making them liable to a penalty of ten years for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13620"> 13620 </A></B>
<P>
deliberately neglecting to register their .22 or their shotgun is 
absolutely absurd and unacceptable.
<P>
	We all remember Mr. Lortie, who went into the Quebec 
assembly and murdered three people. He served ten years. To 
equate that kind of an act and that kind of punishment with the 
failure to register a rifle or a shotgun is to me beyond 
comprehension and absurd.
<P>
	These amendments are designed to decriminalize offences 
where there is no mens rea involved, no intent and no overt act to 
endanger anyone. It is simply that they have failed, whether 
deliberately or inadvertently, to fulfil an administrative act, 
which is to register. It should not be a criminal offence and there 
should be no means whereby the police can arrest the person 
under those circumstances and have that person face an 
indictable offence where the punishment is as much as ten years 
or five years, depending on whether it is under section 92 or 91 
of this act.
<P>
	Those are my comments on that.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to 
speak to the amendments to Bill C-68. The reason I am so 
delighted is that since the government invoked time allocation 
last Thursday, I find myself being one of the chosen few who 
will be able to speak at report stage.
<P>
	The government's motive is one of fear. It knows that many of 
its backbenchers are already going to vote against the bill and 
they are afraid that if Bill C-68 is not dealt with before summer, 
many more of their backbenchers would find themselves having 
to commit that greatest of all sins a Liberal member can commit, 
the sin of representing one's constituents.
<P>
	That is what I am attempting to do with this bill. I am trying to 
gauge the sentiments of my constituents. The bill is one of the 
few issues where people have expressed a great deal of interest. 
In my recently released householder I provided each side of the 
argument with the opportunity to state the case for or against the 
bill. Representing those who support the bill is none other than 
the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	My householder is in the homes of my constituents. While I 
have started to receive responses, the government's artificial 
deadline will prevent many of their voices from being heard. If 
the majority of my constituents wanted registration, given the 
opportunity, I would support the registration portion of Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	It seems the government wants as few voices heard as 
possible. The bill has been rushed through the entire process. 
The schedule to hear witnesses was fixed in advance, ignoring 
hundreds of requests by groups and individuals to appear.
<P>
	The timeframe to enter amendments was rushed, not allowing 
sufficient time to have legislative counsel prepare amendments. 
The clause by clause consideration was rushed, forcing the 
committee to sit until one o'clock in the morning.
<P>
	What can one say about report stage and third reading? The 
tactic of introducing time allocation before debate even starts is 
a tactic that would have made the Mulroney administration 
blush.
<P>
	The Liberals always complained when the Tories introduced 
closure but they have fully embraced the concept themselves. 
What is interesting is that there has never been a hint that the 
Reform Party or anybody else was attempting to filibuster the 
bill.
<P>
	We have played by the rules, trying to improve a poorly 
drafted bill in case it passed third reading. How badly drafted 
was this bill? Let me say that during the clause by clause 
consideration the member for Crowfoot noticed that the wording 
of one clause would make it necessary for anybody wishing to 
buy a box of ammunition, even a box of .22 shells, would have 
been required to obtain prior approval of the chief firearms 
officer of the province.
<P>
	It was interesting to see the look of confusion on the faces of 
the parliamentary secretary and the assistant deputy minister 
when they quickly realized that that was not their intent.
<P>
	The bill has been amended but this is an example of the poor 
quality of legislation that goes through when Parliament rushes. 
Another example of the quality of this bill is the list of 37 
amendments that the Minister of Justice is making at report 
stage. This is in addition to approximately 80 amendments that 
the government made in committee during clause by clause.
<P>
	Government members say: ``So what? Who cares? We are 
sitting so high in the polls''. One wonders if they will remember 
that the Ontario Liberals went into their provincial election 
riding high at 53 per cent in the opinion polls as well. Probably 
not, since Liberals have very short memories. After all, it was 
only in the last Parliament when Liberals were loudly protesting 
over rules by the Tory government to introduce more legislation 
where Parliament would be bypassed with orders in council.
<P>
	However, these protests are now silent as the government has 
created unprecedented provisions for government by order in 
council. There are 75 instances in this bill that call for 
regulations to be introduced. The government's attitude is forget 
Parliament, the cabinet knows what is best for Canada. After all, 
if amendments had to come through Parliament there may be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13621"> 13621 </A></B>
<P>
more of those Liberal backbenchers who may try and represent  
their constituents. The government would not want that to 
happen, would it?
<P>
	Its attitude is: ``Trust us. We know what is best''. Having sat 
through the committee hearings on Bill C-68, it is apparent that 
the government does not know what it is doing.
<P>
	The pretence under which this bill was introduced was that it 
would reduce crime and save lives. Unfortunately there was no 
such substantive evidence presented that indicated this bill 
would do either. The bill was purported to go after the criminal 
use of firearms, yet most of the bill is directed against the 
ordinary law-abiding gun owner.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Those aspects of the bill that do deal with the criminal use of 
firearms are insignificant. That is why I have introduced the 
amendments I have.
<P>
	The government chose to identify 10 serious crimes such as 
manslaughter, attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, 
robbery and to create a minimum four year sentence if a firearm 
was used. However, what difference will these minimum 
sentences make? Not very much because the down side of 
minimum sentences is that they all too often because maximum 
sentences. Unless the minimum sentence is raised to a level that 
is sufficiently higher than the current average sentence, there 
will be no deterrent effect.
<P>
	Will a four year minimum sentence for manslaughter with a 
firearm prevent any deaths? The average sentence for 
manslaughter in British Columbia is currently four years. Under 
current law, if a firearm is used in a death an additional one year 
sentence is added under section 85. How is it possible that a four 
year minimum sentence could have any deterrent effect when 
the average sentence is already five years?
<P>
	That is why I have entered amendments that would increase 
the minimum sentence for manslaughter to eight years. For eight 
other crimes it would be increased to six years and for one 
crime, criminal negligence causing death, we are suggesting the 
minimum sentence should be reduced.
<P>
	Another flaw in the bill is that under these 10 specific crimes, 
it is necessary to prove that the object used in the crime is a 
firearm. While this may not be difficult in manslaughter cases or 
those charged with causing bodily harm, what about cases 
involving sexual assault, kidnapping or robbery? If the gun is 
not fired or if it is not recovered, how does the crown prove that 
the object used meets the legal definition of a firearm? The short 
answer is that it cannot. Thus, in many of these cases there will 
never be a charge of using a firearm because the crown simply 
will not be able to prove that a firearm is used.
<P>
	That is why I am moving the second set of amendments. It will 
no longer be necessary to prove whether the object used was a 
firearm or just an imitation firearm. The victim of a sexual 
assault may not know if the object used is a real firearm or just a 
replica. The terror is equal in any event. To let a sex offender 
walk away from this crime because the victim is unable to state 
whether it was a real firearm or just an imitation is wrong. These 
clauses must be amended.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is bad legislation. It does not do what it sets out to 
accomplish. If this law is not bad enough, the way the 
government has handled it is even worse. How can anyone 
justify closing down debate before it even started on legislation 
that will not come fully into effect for another eight years? They 
cannot.  Arrogant governments believe they do not have to 
explain anything, except when they try to explain to themselves 
why they have been rejected by the voters and have fallen into 
oblivion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in listening to the debate I cannot help but 
wonder why the opposition is all of a sudden so exercised about 
time allocation when in fact we dialogued about this bill for 
almost a year.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice went from coast to coast to coast 
speaking to groups on the bill. The subject matter of the bill was 
brought forward on November 30 and the bill was brought 
forward based on that subject matter on February 14, 1995. 
There has been a lot of dialogue and a lot of consultation.
<P>
	The committee has met, but not all the witnesses who wanted 
to appear could appear. There was a restriction on the number of 
witnesses, but it was done with the belief that those witnesses 
would have their points of view brought forward by either a 
national organization to which they belonged or a similar 
organization which would speak for the the interests of 
witnesses. There were individuals who wanted to come forward. 
That was not possible.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Many people wanted to speak to the bill as with most 
important bills. It is not democracy to hear everybody. That is 
not the way it has been practised since Athens and the days of 
Pericles. The way it is done is to choose representatives to come 
before the committee.
<P>
	Also, we are talking about the amendments today at report 
stage. In some cases we are getting a point of view on these 
amendments and in other cases we are not. The fact of the matter 
is we have third reading yet to come.
<P>
	Perhaps not everybody who wants to speak at third reading 
will be given the opportunity to do so. At committee stage we 
allowed members to have five minute interventions on points 
before the committee, which was requested.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13622"> 13622 </A></B>
<P>
	Members will know that as speakers come before the House 
and speak at third reading that the first speeches are 20 minutes 
and then the other speeches are 10 minutes. Many members are 
giving those 10 minutes speeches here today.
<P>
	Relating to the last speaker on minimum sentences, this area 
has been given a great deal of attention. The member is not 
satisfied that in 10 very serious offences the minimum sentence 
would be four years. She wants it increased to eight years in the 
case of manslaughter and six years in other cases. That is one 
point of view.
<P>
	We have had witnesses before the committee who felt that a 
10 year minimum, and in fact the previous speaker from the Bloc 
condemned the government for having a four year minimum in 
these cases, saying that the discretion should be allowed to go to 
the courts as is the case at the present time. We have heard it 
from both sides. We feel four years is a period of time that is 
defensible in this case.
<P>
	Minimum sentences are never something that a government 
wants to bring forward because it takes discretion away from the 
courts. The courts are put in place to judge the actions of our 
fellow citizens in relation to the laws, both statute and common 
law. They are to use their discretion and they are trained 
professionals in the law and with experience on the bench.
<P>
	To say that we are going to implement minimum sentences is a 
curtailment of that discretion and to say that we are going to 
have a minimum sentence of eight years is an absolute affront to 
that discretion. The question is, would a minimum sentence of 
that extent in fact not be challenged under the charter of rights 
and freedoms. Frankly I feel that it would.
<P>
	We have have a minimum sentence for those 10 situations. We 
have a minimum sentence of one year for illegal importation and 
exportation of a firearm and also for other criminal offences as 
well. We have attempted to impress on Canadians the 
seriousness of the wrongful use of a firearm with these 
minimum sentences. There is a limit to how far we can go and 
many people and institutions have told us we have gone too far 
already. We do not think so but we do not think that going further 
will gain any respect for the law. It is only going to lead to a 
complete and utter disrespect for the law where the law 
arbitrarily is imposing extremely harsh sentences without the 
judge being able to have some latitude.
<P>
	We talk about section 85 and plea bargaining and also about 
section 85 with respect to an imitation firearm. If we are going 
to give four years for a firearm, it is awfully hard to give four 
years to an imitation firearm that is not a danger to the person on 
the other side of the counter. There has to be some discretion. It 
is still possible for the judge to give a stronger sentence. That 
imitation firearm would still come under section 85 where 
robbery is  included. There would then be a subsequent one year 
sentence for the imitation firearm.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The case is also put to the attorneys general and provincial 
ministers of justice as to why these extra charges are plea 
bargained away. This area is within their discretion. It does not 
have to happen in the provincial jurisdiction because the 
provinces have control over the administration of justice. As in 
the case of dangerous offenders they have to say these offences 
are not to be plea bargained away.
<P>
	I want to mention Motion No. 133 as brought forward by a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois. Motion No. 133 would impose a 
simple fine for first and second offences. These are offences that 
would be under clause 107.(1), the new offence under the 
firearms bill which takes the possession of unregistered long 
guns out of the Criminal Code and puts them into the firearms 
act.
<P>
	The member suggests a simple fine for first and second 
offences of not only illegal long guns but also for possession of 
prohibited fully automatic firearms, silencers and prohibited 
ammunition such as armour piercing bullets. Such a lenient 
offence would be a mockery of what we are attempting to do 
under this legislation. Clause 107.(1) attempts to treat leniently 
and with some kind of compassion those who honestly did not 
register their long guns. It is certainly not an intent to excuse 
people with prohibited fully automatic firearms from 
non-registration.
<P>
	The penalties the member would impose under Motion No. 
133 are much less severe than is the case right now. It would say 
to someone who blatantly violates the law that they would not be 
convicted of a criminal offence. As I mentioned, it would 
trivialize the severity of possessing firearms without a licence 
and a registration certificate.
<P>
	We have attempted to bring forward laws and eventually 
regulations that will not minimize the seriousness of the offence 
but which will honestly recognize the honest mistake of 
non-registration. They will also allow those who are in charge 
of enforcing these laws to deal with the offences in a humane and 
a compassionate way relating to the facts of the situations as 
they see them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Waterloo-national defence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to speak to the motions before us in group No. 4, if I 
am not mistaken. I would like to point out that the Criminal 
Code currently provides a number of mandatory minimum 
punishments. The one of interest to us today is set out in section 
85 of the Code. It reads  as follows: ``Everyone who uses a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13623"> 13623 </A></B>
<P>
firearm while committing [-]an indictable offence [-]is 
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment, in the 
case of a first offence, [-]for not more than fourteen years and 
not less than one year, and, in the case of a second or subsequent 
offence, [-]for not more than fourteen years and not less than 
three years''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	As we can see, the Criminal Code already provides a 
mandatory minimum sentence of one year for the use of a 
firearm with criminal intent. It also provides a minimum 
sentence of three years for all subsequent offences. These 
sentences are served consecutively to any other sentence. That 
means that an individual found guilty of robbery, for example, 
would be sentenced for the principal offence-the robbery 
itself-and would then have this sentence extended by one or 
three years, as the case may be.
<P>
	The proposal by the Minister of Justice to increase the 
minimum sentence to four years would not improve the situation 
in any way. At best, individuals would be given only the 
minimum sentence of four years. At worst, the Supreme Court 
would consider the provisions setting the mandatory minimum 
punishment at four years unconstitutional, because it would 
consider such punishment cruel and unusual under section 12 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	At the moment, an individual found guilty of one of the 
offences set forth in the new section 85 could very easily be 
sentenced to a term longer than that contemplated by the 
Minister of Justice. In fact, the combination of a consecutive 
mandatory sentence and sentencing for the principal offence 
could easily exceed four years.
<P>
	Section 85 of the Criminal Code is therefore amended in Bill 
C-68 with the addition of a list of ten violent offences to which 
the provision will apply. We have wondered about the 
seriousness of the minister in establishing this list. It includes 
manslaughter, a crime without criminal intent, but it does not 
include armed assault. Is punishment to be the same, regardless 
of whether the victim survives his or her wounds?
<P>
	Forcible confinement is not on the list either, although 
kidnapping and hostage-taking are. I must say I have serious 
doubts about the deterrent effect of an increase in the minimum 
sentence provided in section 85 and related sections.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the working document prepared 
by the Department of Justice on the present section 85, in 
particular, and on the imposition of minimum sentence in 
general, concludes that the public as a whole is not aware which 
offences carry mandatory minimum sentence. It is hard to see 
how such a measure would deter potential delinquents, since 
they generally do not know what the minimum sentence is.
<P>
	In addition, the same document that the Minister of Justice 
should have examined more closely concludes that mandatory 
minimum sentences probably have very little effect as 
deterrents and on the rate of the commission of serious crimes. 
Robbery is a prime example. And what is worse, apparently 
juries are less inclined to find someone guilty if they know that 
the crime the defendant is accused of committing carries a 
mandatory sentence.
<P>
	If judges choose not to allow sentences for multiple offences 
to be served concurrently, the result would be a substantial 
growth in the prison population. In fact, the minimum sentence 
of four years would be the starting point to which any additional 
period of detention necessary would be added, depending on the 
circumstances surrounding the offence.
<P>
	Obviously, an individual accused of several offences could 
serve sentences consecutively. The Minister of Justice seems to 
believe naïvely that detention centres will be able to hold more 
inmates. He argues, in fact, that his bill will be a deterrent and 
will decrease the number of crimes perpetrated with a weapon.
<P>
	He has no way of knowing what impact his bill will have on 
the number of convictions made under his reformed system in 
the future. Let us not forget that a chain is only as strong as the 
weakest of its links.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	If we increase the minimum sentence provided for in section 
85 of the Criminal Code, we must expect the prison population 
to swell although we do not have the facilities needed to 
accommodate the new inmates.
<P>
	The warning issued by Université de Montréal Professor 
Pierre Landreville is worthy of consideration. In an article 
published in the December 23, 1994 edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>, Mr. 
Landreville outlines the danger of such legislation, and I quote: 
``[-] every year in Quebec, some 1,500 individuals are 
convicted and could eventually be sentenced to a minimum of 
four years in prison, in addition to the sentence given for the 
main offence. Quebec's prison population, which is now around 
4,000, would almost double in the first four years following the 
implementation of this measure''.
<P>
	The increase in the prison population would lead to an 
increase in related costs. Did anyone bother to find out how 
much Bill C-68 would cost, when we know that, in 1992-93, the 
annual cost of keeping a single inmate averaged $56,000 in 
maximum security and $36,000 in medium security?
<P>
	The mandatory minimum sentence is the minimum number of 
years to be served. In a so-called clarification effort, minimum 
punishment was included in the wording of the offence itself. 
That is why we find the phrase ``to a minimum punishment of 
imprisonment for a term of four years'' in 10 different clauses 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13624"> 13624 </A></B>
<P>
listing possible sentences for the offences in question. I am 
talking about clauses 135 through 144 of Bill C-68.
<P>
	The amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois in 
Motions No. 182 and following are all aimed at eliminating the 
mandatory minimum sentence by revoking these clauses. 
Significantly increasing mandatory minimum sentences is an 
ill-advised public relations exercise. There is no better way to 
score points.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice wanted to ease the fears of a generally 
misinformed public and to make the pro-gun lobby swallow the 
pill by claiming that Bill C-68 does not deal with the 
registration of long guns. He failed miserably in both cases.
<P>
	Increasing mandatory minimum sentences involves far too 
many uncertainties, considering eventual tangible benefits. Bill 
C-68 is a bill on public safety and not a marketing operation. 
The Minister of Justice would have been better off explaining 
his bill and answering gun owners' legitimate questions. Had he 
done so, he would not have provoked such a general outcry.
<P>
	I therefore urge the House to support the Bloc motions, which 
reflect the kind of society we all want to live in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity today to express my support for the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois and put them into 
the context of this debate.
<P>
	In this instance the emphasis is mainly on decriminalization, 
and that is entirely in line with the position taken by the Bloc 
Quebecois which is to make this a balanced piece of legislation. 
This seems to have been a rather difficult debate, with some very 
active lobbies on both sides, and I must say that in my case, I got 
some firsthand experience of this in my riding, and with citizens 
who want to make sure that this process produces some effective 
results.
<P>
	So with this in mind, the Bloc worked on this bill and tried to 
come up with some satisfactory results.
<P>
	What is the primary objective? Basically, to improve gun 
control. Prevention is the main thing, in other words, we want to 
ensure that now and in the near and not so near future, we can 
improve the situation. Through better control, we also want to 
reduce the number of guns that are out there but are not being 
used, and a number of examples come to mind. Everyone knows 
people who, somewhere in a closet, have a gun they inherited 
and which they still have but do not use. They still own it but 
hardly ever use it. There are a lot of guns around.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	This bill is rather well received by the general public, 
especially in Quebec. However, the groups that are directly 
affected are more sceptical. They have expressed certain 
reservations and, in some cases, out and out dissent. Generally 
speaking, the people most likely to be affected-and I am 
thinking of hunters, of whom I represent a certain number in my 
riding-are wondering what will happen. There are a lot of 
rumours about what  it might actually cost them. They have 
sometimes felt that the government was out to get them.
<P>
	Many people who use guns, either hunting rifles or revolvers, 
use them responsibly. So we do not really want to brand them as 
criminals, and that is why we would like to see some flexibility 
with respect to criminalization. We are suggesting ways to make 
this position more flexible.
<P>
	In the case of Quebec, the registration of firearms, including 
hunting rifles, has been in effect for a number of years. The 
problem is how the process is used. Now the government wants 
to create a national registry. I realize some people are going to 
say that it is like starting all over again. They say: when I bought 
my gun at the store, they took down the serial number and all 
that. Now, when they want to set up a national registry, for 
Canada, in this case, we have to more or less repeat the same 
process. I agree there are some costs involved in implementing 
the system. The bulk of the cost would be during the start up 
phase, but subsequently, we can assume that the system would 
become much simpler and far more flexible. Nevertheless, there 
are some questions about these new measures.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that we in the Bloc Quebecois support 
the principle of improving gun control. However, we want to 
minimize the impact on the individual, and in this case, the user. 
Since this bill is intended to benefit the general public, it would 
perhaps make sense for everyone to contribute to the start up 
costs. I do not own any firearms and it would not bother me to 
contribute as a citizen, as a taxpayer, to this system's start up or 
to pay for a firearm's registration, if one day I decide to purchase 
one, on the condition, of course, that the fees are reasonable.
<P>
	Throughout the process, we have maintained pressure on the 
government to banish the rumours regarding figures and to 
reassure people that the cost would be reasonable. Because a bill 
is just a bill, its effectiveness relies on the decision of 
individuals to respect the system and the law. It is they who 
ultimately determine how effective a law is going to be. When 
the majority of people respect it, it becomes a standard for 
society. At that point, it becomes easier to enforce. The best way 
to have people respect a law is peer pressure.
<P>
	Therefore, I agree with the statement that we all have to 
contribute and that users also have to do their part. Under the 
current proposal, a $10 fee will be imposed for the registration 
of the first 10 firearms. Most Canadians do not own more than 
10 firearms. These fees seem reasonable. Some people do have 
more than 10, for example collectors, but there are special 
provisions for them. Now, an ownership certificate is also 
involved. To be able to own a firearm, people will have to 
purchase a certificate at a cost of approximately $10 per year, 
payable for a period of five years. It is important to note that this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13625"> 13625 </A></B>
<P>
ownership certificate replaces a certificate that already exists, 
the firearms acquisition certificate.
<P>
	For a good many people, the only fee involved will be the 
initial cost of registering their firearms, $10. I think that this is 
reasonable and so do a good number of my constituents. The fear 
they have is that an amendment will be introduced later which 
will raise costs exponentially. They want reassurances, like the 
one discussed in committee, that the government will not pull a 
fast one on them.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	In this regard, we suggested indexing it to the cost of living, 
which would appear to be one of the most reasonable proposals 
made. We cannot, however, use the same formula, because of the 
way the House works. So, I now propose, instead, that these fees 
be frozen for 20 years, although I still think our first position 
was better and more acceptable to the government.
<P>
	However, we make the point again to the government that this 
would be one way it could ensure the greatest support and the 
least resistance for its bill. I think the people in my region and in 
other regions will accept this system, so long as it means the 
least possible inconvenience for them, including any financial 
inconvenience that may be involved. The registration fee must 
not be seen as a disguised tax on firearms.
<P>
	The other point is to ensure as well that an inefficient 
bureaucracy is not created with the legislation. As members of 
the opposition, we must ensure over time that the system exists 
without accompanying machinery of no practical value and that 
the people working in the system do what they are supposed to 
be do, that is, control weapons, so that we do not end up with a 
system costing more than it should.
<P>
	If these points can be assured, I think the bill will be more 
saleable. Of course, there has been considerable debate about 
the effectiveness of registration. Will it really meet the 
prevention goals? This is, I admit, where debate was perhaps the 
most difficult. People, experts from both sides testified for and 
against registration. We as legislators must make up our minds 
after listening to experts who disagree on this subject and to 
people from both sides who lobby hard to get their message 
across. Some of them even resort to threats, linking this to 
election and political issues, which I find somewhat regrettable 
because there are other, more important matters.
<P>
	That said, we must make up our minds, and I am now one of 
those who have come to support this bill, because I think that we 
must take this step in our social development. Although we may 
have some doubts, are these doubts enough to abstain, in my 
case, or dissent? I think not, and that is why we must support this 
bill.
<P>
	But-and I will conclude on this-we are asking the minister 
to be a little more flexible to ensure that people will rally behind 
this bill, and that any negative impact on those affected will be 
minimal. In this regard, I think that their only concern at the 
present time is the matter of costs. I feel that going along the 
lines of the amendments that follow would allow us to take a 
very important step while being a little more flexible on 
decriminalization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
heard earlier in a speech by one of the government members that 
the objective of the legislation was to improve public safety on 
the streets and in our homes. Every single Reform member in the 
House is out for exactly the same objective, to improve public 
safety on the streets and in our homes. Unfortunately the bill has 
very little to do with that.
<P>
	I have asked a number of people, including members of the 
House, to explain what they think the bill is all about. One 
member suggested that it was the warm fuzzies, the warm 
fuzzies simply being that it makes us feel good, that it makes us 
feel better.
<P>
	The justice minister has been very interesting in coming 
forward with a figure of $85 million to make his creation work, 
$85 million to register seven million guns. We are taking at look 
at the imposition of registration and we are taking a look at the 
expenditure of $85 million. It reminds me an awful lot of the 
idea of what it would cost for transportation of a particular 
entity.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	If we take into account only the capital cost of the car and not 
any of the actual running expenses, we might get a rather 
distorted picture.
<P>
	I do not buy the justice minister's estimate of $85 million by a 
long shot. I do not think it is anywhere even remotely close. At 
best, even if that was the federal cost, what about the provincial 
cost?
<P>
	I asked the justice minister about a situation where 
environmental activist Paul Watson talked about the fact that he 
had used a stun gun in either New Brunswick or the province of 
Quebec, I cannot recall. He rose in the House and made the very 
clear point that the administration of justice was a provincial 
issue, a provincial responsibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13626"> 13626 </A></B>
<P>
	Even if the $85 million figure were believable, which I do not 
think it is, the real cost of administering this useless program 
will fall to the provinces.
<P>
	I also cite from page 13480 of <I>Hansard</I>, June 8, wherein the 
Speaker of the House made a ruling on a point of order raised by 
the House leader for the Reform Party. I recognize that clause 98 
was dealt with in Motion No. 3. Nonetheless this is germane to 
my argument. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Clause 98 as introduced in the House had the concept of ``police officer'' for 
which the concept of ``inspector'' has been substituted by the committee. It still 
remains a provincial ministerial responsibility as to which class of individuals 
shall be so designated. It may well be that a provincial minister decides to 
recruit an entirely new class of individuals for the purpose of clause 98, but it 
clearly remains the decision of the provincial authority to do so. Whether the 
class of individuals are called inspectors or police officers has no direct impact 
on the royal recommendation attached to the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was ruling on the fact, in the judgment of the Speaker, that 
the costs of the program were actually going to be borne by the 
provinces in the same way as the cost of driving the automobile 
once it is purchased are borne by the owner. In actual fact the 
cost to the Canadian taxpayer, even if we could believe the $85 
million as a starting point, is $85 million to buy into the initial 
registration of the program. The enforcement of the program 
will be something quite different.
<P>
	Let us deal with the $85 million figure. I want to restate for 
the third or fourth time that I do not buy the $85 million figure 
even at the federal level. What could we do with money 
equivalent to that?
<P>
	I read in the June 10 <I>Gazette</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RCMP will spend $68 million over the next few years in an attempt to 
curb smuggling along the 700-kilometre border between Quebec and the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The largest number of new officers will go to the Valleyfield detachment, 
near the Akwasasne Mohawk reserve.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Akwasasne, which straddles the Canada-U.S. border and incorporates parts 
of Quebec and Ontario, is considered a key crossing point for contraband.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we are to spend $68 million in that case or if we are to 
spend, as the justice minister has suggested, this impossible 
figure of $85 million, would it not be good if we could actually 
spend it on something that would accomplish that for which it is 
being spent?
<P>
	It seems rather illogical when one refers to the polls that the 
justice minister and parliamentary secretary keep referring to. 
They say that 60 per cent, 68 per cent or 75 per cent of people are 
in favour of registration. That is terrific, except invariably-and 
I will make up a figure-68 per cent of people are in favour of 
registration but 72 per cent of people do not think it will do 
anything. What is the point of the registration program if in the 
belief of Canadians it will not do anything? Why are we getting 
into it in the first place? Why are we harassing ordinary 
law-abiding Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the source of weapons coming into Canada, I 
will read a small part of a very profound report by the 
MacKenzie Institute. It is rather detailed but is also quite 
enlightening.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By the time of writing, 102 weapons which have been sold to the four 
Mohawks were recovered by Canadian police forces. Details on these firearms 
include the following: 65 light semi-automatic pistols; 32 semi-automatic 
pistols; four revolvers; one submachine gun; at least another 21 light 
semi-automatic pistols, 39 semi-automatic pistols and four Cobray submachine 
guns pass through this connection into Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What possible effect did or would the registration program 
have on the passage of this arsenal?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Other weapons that were not traced to Vermont but were seized along with 
those 102 weapons included five assault rifles, two submachine guns, a sawed 
off shotgun, 14 other pistols and 23 unspecified weapons. At least five of these 
were also smuggled in from the United States. Of the 102 weapons, various 
Canadian police forces have provided information on the crimes the firearms 
were associated with, and/or the history of the suspects who had been in 
possession of the firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The arms provided by the four Mohawks were linked to the 
following crimes and criminals. Again, I am only going to read a 
small part of the list. ``Thirty-five were associates and/or 
members of the Russian Mafiya, Armenian thieves'', and it goes 
on and on.
<P>
	The connections are amazing. The point I am trying to make is 
that our border at this point is no bar to guns. A registration 
program is going to have no effect in changing that situation. 
This is underscored and underlined even by the Canadian Police 
Association.
<P>
	My point is why are we going after targeting law-abiding 
Canadian citizens when the surveys themselves which 
supposedly support registration say that people recognize 
registration will make no difference. We are going after the 
wrong people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
far from happy with Bill C-68 in its present form. As usual, I 
think the government has turned a deaf ear to the various 
motions in amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. Once 
again, the government has missed a wonderful opportunity to 
improve its bill by incorporating the findings of the various 
committees, the conclusions reached at public hearings or quite 
simply the views contained in letters sent in by our constituents 
throughout this country.
<P>
	One thing is for sure: for or against, this bill leaves no one 
indifferent. I have said it before, and I will say it again, although 
this is a very controversial bill, it is, in my view, essential and in 
the interests of all Quebecers and Canadians that the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13627"> 13627 </A></B>
<P>
ment pass it so that citizens are better protected against the 
upsurge in crime and violence that can strike anyone at any time.
<P>
	I cannot, at this time, go into all the details of this bill, but it is 
clear from the controversy surrounding it that it has some major 
flaws. I will mention just two in particular. First, in a move 
designed to impress the public, the Minister of Justice included 
in his bill a minimum sentence of four years, in lieu of the 
provisions of section 85 of the Criminal Code. In its present 
form, section 85 provides that a criminal who uses a firearm 
while committing an offence will have to serve an additional 
consecutive sentence of one year. In the case of a second or 
subsequent offence, the additional sentence is three years.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Surely the Minister of Justice cannot seriously think that a 
minimum sentence of four years on top of the original sentence 
will have a dissuasive effect. It will not. It will merely serve to 
worsen the already serious problem of overcrowding in 
Canada's prison system.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would remind you that members of the Quebec 
bar told the committee that a minimum sentence of four years 
for use of a firearm in committing an offence could result in 
something like an additional 250 people a year joining the 
prison population. When you think about how much it costs 
taxpayers to keep one offender in jail, I do not know whether this 
country, which is bankrupt, currently has the means to support 
another 250 people in jail. The auditor general also spoke of this 
subject.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, the Bloc 
Quebecois justice critic, is proposing to simply drop clauses 135 
to 144, which merely list ten crimes with a minimum sentence of 
four years. I think that we should stick to the current rules 
established in the Criminal Code. It should be up to judges to set 
the sentences for the various crimes committed by offenders.
<P>
	Would it not be wiser to follow Quebec's example in justice 
matters, and to channel our efforts towards better 
understanding, by putting emphasis on prevention and bringing 
in measures which promote rehabilitation, instead of giving in, 
like this government has, to repressive movements from all over 
the country, which are expounded mostly by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Another point that is of particular concern to me is that 
section 106 of the current Criminal Code stipulates that people 
who make a living from hunting do not have to pay the licencing 
fees related to firearm ownership.
<P>
	I know very well that we have grown accustomed to the 
government's double standards over the past two years, but this 
bill is too serious and important for that kind of game. Clause 
110 of the bill would effectively allow the governor in council to 
introduce discriminatory regulations uniquely for the benefit of 
aboriginal peoples. I fail to see why belonging to a certain class 
of persons changes the application of the legislation.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative that any person who owns a firearm 
be obliged to pay registration fees, whether that person lives off 
the proceeds of the hunt or is a native. This government must not 
allow the creation of different classes of citizens. It is not 
helpful at all and merely creates conflicts within our society.
<P>
	Guns must be controlled and regulated by laws that are 
logical, sensible and apply to all citizens of this country, 
irrespective of their age, sex, occupation or cultural heritage.
<P>
	I know this bill does not enjoy unanimous support, but we 
must remember that as elected representatives, it is our duty to 
protect our constituents, often from themselves.
<P>
	This bill should respond to the main concerns which have 
been raised constantly in the past five to ten years with respect to 
gun control.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We know this bill is not a panacea for the crime and violence 
that exist in our society. However, it is time to acquire the 
additional tools we need to deal with these problems. I think this 
bill is a tool that will help society evolve, and that a few years 
from now, it will be too late.
<P>
	Finally, I may recall that at the present rate, there will be 
about four million guns of all kinds in less than ten years. We 
cannot afford to leave this legacy to future generations. It is time 
to act now. This has gone on long enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to 
discuss report stage of Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and 
other weapons. This is perhaps the most controversial piece of 
legislation the House has seen since the implementation of the 
GST. It is also a piece of legislation which has caused a great 
deal of debate and at times heated discussion since this issue was 
first raised in the House.
<P>
	I have learned there is little or no middle ground on the issue 
of gun control. It is an issue that Canadians either do or do not 
support. I surveyed my constituents of Edmonton-Strathcona 
twice to gauge their feelings on this issue. I did this through 
household surveys and received conflicting results. Some 
individuals suggested the first question was too broad and all 
encompassing and others felt the second question was too 
narrow. This is a problem in which each side is divided into 
black and white; there does not seem to be any shade of grey.
<P>
	How do we resolve this conflict in order to vote according to 
the wishes of the majority of our constituents? I felt the best way 
to resolve the problem was to bring in an independent third 
party. In this case it was an independent pollster. This polling 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13628"> 13628 </A></B>
<P>
firm's objective was to find out how my constituents truly felt 
on the issue of gun control. The results were as follows.
<P>
	Just under 50 per cent of the respondents said they believed 
the government's proposed gun control legislation should not be 
passed without modification or amendment, while only 28 per 
cent said it should be passed. Over 55 per cent believed that the 
potential benefits of the proposed legislation would not justify 
the cost of the bureaucracy required to enforce it compared with 
30 per cent on the yes side. An astonishing 70 per cent believed 
that the authorities would be granted too many powers 
concerning the issues of search, seizure and compensation, 
while less than 25 per cent felt that the new powers would be 
justified. Finally, almost 80 per cent of the constituents from 
Edmonton-Strathcona believed that criminals would not 
comply with the justice minister's proposed gun control 
legislation compared with only 11 per cent who said that 
criminals would.
<P>
	It is also interesting that this government seems to be 
travelling down the same road as the previous Conservative 
government. There was an outcry of self-righteousness from the 
Liberals while they were in opposition over the Conservatives' 
use of time allocation to ram through legislation.
<P>
	The Liberals had managed to make the most faithful 
individuals of our democratic process turn into pessimists. This 
Liberal government is trampling on Canadians' democratic 
rights by limiting the time in which we as parliamentarians can 
debate legislation put forward in this House.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	The Mulroney government used time allocation 35 times to 
pass 200 bills. That is 17 per cent of the Mulroney government's 
bills, which is shamefully unacceptable, as was indicated by the 
other side.
<P>
	Now let us look at the government's record, in which time 
allocation has been used an unprecedented 14 times on only 59 
bills, including this one, Bill C-68. On this bill time allocation 
has been used not once, not twice, but three times. In other 
words, the government has used time allocation 24 per cent of 
the time, 7 per cent more than the Mulroney government. That is 
totally unacceptable to me and to the constituents of 
Edmonton-Strathcona and I believe to all Canadians.
<P>
	The government must start to listen to the people and not the 
spin doctors, or else it as well will be able to hold its caucus 
meetings in a phone booth.
<P>
	The people of Edmonton-Strathcona have spoken out on this 
issue, and the majority concur with the Reform Party's position 
that registration is not the means to an end in which the end is a 
decrease in crime. It is for this reason that the Reform Party has 
brought forward amendments to split the bill during second 
reading. We would have passed the crime control measures 
immediately, which would have allowed us more time to spend 
debating the merits and pitfalls of a full scale registration plan.
<P>
	We as a caucus applaud the justice minister's endeavour to 
curtail the deliberate criminal misuse of firearms. He has done 
this through increased penalties for criminal misuse of firearms 
and through an increased effort to further enhance controls on 
illegal border crossings.
<P>
	Unfortunately certain aspects of Bill C-68 will have a 
detrimental impact on the competitive sports shooting group. If 
we are to believe the majority of shooting organizations, they 
feel there is a real possibility of the loss of Canada's sports 
shooting structure. Prohibiting or restricting firearms that are 
commonly used in legal, legitimate, recreational circumstances 
such as casual target shooting or in formally organized 
competition does not prevent criminal acts. It only further 
restricts the rights and freedoms of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	As the Reform Party's critic for amateur sports, I feel 
obligated to speak directly to the specific sections of the bill that 
have the most direct effect on sports shooting organizations 
across Canada. We proposed amendments in committee that 
would have allowed those individuals who are members of the 
registered recognized shooting associations to be exempt from 
Bill C-68, and this was defeated. Our position is that we do not 
want to prohibit guns that are used specifically for competition 
and thereby prohibit those at the entry level from entering the 
sport.
<P>
	Our reasoning is that you do not come into the world of 
competitive shooting with a $5,000 or $6,000 target pistol. You 
start off at the entry level with a very inexpensive firearm. You 
join a club and you take up shooting. Invariably these firearms 
tend to have barrel lengths of four inches or so and to be .32 
calibre, which is what the Olympic shooters use.
<P>
	It is a concern for me that the proud tradition that Canada has 
in competitive shooting may be lost. A perfect example was 
during the Commonwealth Games last year, an event that 
resulted in 43 medals for Canada. Twenty-two were shooting 
medals. That is over 50 per cent of Canada's total medals 
awarded. Under this bill, that number will decline dramatically.
<P>
	Bill C-68 prohibits two-thirds of the pistols owned by 
law-abiding citizens. Many of these are collectors' items or are 
target pistols in current use in competitions such as the 
Olympics and Commonwealth Games. Some of these firearms 
may be grandfathered, but that is simply a delay.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13629"> 13629 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The majority of my constituents feel that Bill C-68 is an 
ineffective and intrusive piece of legislation. What Canadians, 
both rural and urban, want is crime control, plain and simple.
<P>
	Until these types of problems which I, the rest of the Reform 
caucus, the people of my constituency and the people of Canada 
have raised are dealt with, we as a party and I as an individual 
cannot support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wanted 
to rise and speak on these amendments to Bill C-68, first 
because we supported the bill at first and second reading. We 
supported the principle, because we believe virtue is 
unassailable.
<P>
	Surveys reveal that 79 per cent of Canadians and Quebecers 
agree with the adoption of measures making it more difficult to 
obtain firearms. We see this as a modern measure with an eye to 
the future. We want to take steps to limit violence, and this is 
why we approved the bill at first and second reading.
<P>
	We also want to continue to support this bill. However, some 
amendments seem reasonable, and the government should 
permit some changes to the bill. In some cases, the changes 
sought are even more stringent than what was proposed. We 
want legislation that is more balanced and fairer for people.
<P>
	It must be credible. The people governed by it must believe 
that it will improve things. If people do not believe in it, it 
becomes like other oppressive legislation, like burdensome 
taxes, which we already know about. When taxes become 
burdensome, what do people do? They start smuggling and black 
marketeering. They find a way to get around the law.
<P>
	If people see this legislation, which is so important, as 
exploiting them, if some people, such as hunters, feel they have 
to pay a hidden tax, they, and there are more of them than any 
other group covered by the legislation, will probably be less 
likely to comply with it, because they find it oppressive.
<P>
	We therefore proposed certain amendments, on 
decriminalization among other things, because someone who 
forgets to register a weapon is not a criminal. This person 
presents no danger to society. This person does not deserve to go 
to prison, as someone said before me, at a cost of $50,000, 
$60,000 or $78,000 a year in a federal penitentiary. This is what 
it costs to keep a person in prison.
<P>
	It seems to us that certain sentences are not consistent with 
their intent or with the offence committed. We understand that a 
punishable offence must be tied to a reasonable sanction. The 
proposals we are making, however, seem more reasonable than 
what the bill currently provides.
<P>
	We do not think that, if these amendments are voted down 
tomorrow morning,-or tonight, because we will probably vote 
tonight-that we will vote against the whole bill. No, that will 
not be the case. We want to play fair. We therefore propose to the 
government that it accept some of the amendments that will 
make it easier for people to accept the bill without putting their 
peace and security at risk and that will enable it to co-operate, to 
accept some help from the opposition so that this legislation 
may be civilized, modern and fair to everyone.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Other inexpensive measures could be implemented. Hunters 
have never been opposed to safety measures. Quebec already 
has a law requiring people to store firearms in a separate, locked 
cabinet, and to keep bullets in another room of the house. We 
proposed in amendment an inexpensive locking device that can 
be obtained for $10 or $15.
<P>
	If the manufacturer were required to supply this device with 
the firearm, it would cost even less. The purchaser of a firearm 
would automatically have the locking device and citizens would 
be safer. This is a small, one time outlay, but the continuing 
costs of licences or registration certificates are much less 
acceptable to hunters. If, however, sportsmen in Quebec and in 
the rest of Canada were certain that, despite the cost to them, the 
bill would save lives, I think that they would throw their support 
behind it tomorrow morning. While there is still time, let us take 
the action that will make it easier for people to comply.
<P>
	I hope that the government will see the validity of the 
amendments put forward by the official opposition and that it 
will vote in favour of these amendments this evening.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is quite clear that the Liberal government has bitten off a lot 
more than it bargained for as it proceeds to ram Bill C-68 
through the House.
<P>
	The government contends its gun control bill will do wonders 
to prevent gun related crimes. The government contends that 
Canadians from coast to coast want Bill C-68. The government 
contends that the cost for tighter gun control is minimal. While 
the government contends, Canadians are learning the facts about 
gun control and the facts about gun related crimes.
<P>
	Let us start with the government's premise that gun control 
will reduce violent crime. Statistics Canada reported in 1991 
that a total of 753 homicides were committed. Two-thirds of the 
murderers had prior criminal records. Almost half, 46 per cent, 
of those homicides were committed during the perpetration of 
another criminal offence, and only 36 per cent of these 
homicides were committed with firearms, half of which were 
committed with handguns, which are already required to be 
registered. If we look further into the statistics we see that 71 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13630"> 13630 </A></B>
<P>
cent of these homicides were  committed by individuals who 
could not even legally obtain a firearm.
<P>
	Despite the fact that Canadians have been required to register 
their handguns since 1934, gun related crime has remained 
relatively constant over the years. That is because those 
restrictions have not prevented criminals from getting 
handguns. Tougher gun control will merely drive up the street 
value of weapons, making gun smuggling more lucrative than 
ever.
<P>
	Bill C-68 in all likelihood will actually increase the criminal 
element in our society instead of reducing it.
<P>
	It is worth mentioning that New Zealand abandoned firearms 
registration in 1983 after the police there said that registration 
diverts police away from more important duties. In Australia 
more than 40 per cent of firearms have not been registered, even 
after decades of requirements that they do so. The justice 
minister would do well to look at the experiences with gun 
registration in other countries.
<P>
	The Liberals also contend that Canadians from coast to coast 
want Bill C-68. The Canadian Medical Association, the 
Canadian Bar Association, and a host of provincial governments 
are not in favour of the very contentious provisions of Bill C-68.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Polls show that as more people learn about Bill C-68 the 
support drops. That is why the government is ramming Bill 
C-68 through the House by invoking closure.
<P>
	There is the cost of universal registration of guns. The 
Liberals will have Canadians believe that registration will only 
cost $85 million. That is totally and completely erroneous and 
the justice minister knows it. The government bases its cost on 
the premise that there are only about 6.5 million firearms which 
would need to be registered at a cost of $85 million. The facts 
speak for themselves. Why does it currently cost $82 to register 
a handgun and why would it be only $13 to register long guns?
<P>
	In 1976 the Solicitor General of Canada estimated Canadians 
owned ten million firearms. Each year approximately 200,000 
additional firearms are legally imported into Canada, 
suggesting there should now be at least 14 million guns.
<P>
	A 1992 United Nations survey found that over seven million 
Canadians, 26 per cent, own firearms. At the same time a justice 
department study showed that each owner had an average of 2.7 
firearms for a total of 19 million. In April 1995 the deputy 
commissioner of the RCMP stated that there could be as many as 
25 million firearms in Canada, two and a half times the 1976 
figure.
<P>
	If high firearm numbers equate with high crime then the crime 
rate should be two and a half times higher than it was in 1976. In 
fact, justice department statistics show that the crime rate in all 
categories has been stable with only minor fluctuations over the 
same period. Despite the claim that gun control impacts directly 
on crime, neither Bill C-51, the Trudeau bill nor Campbell's 
Bill C-17 have had any observable affect on this trend. What is 
the justification for more gun laws?
<P>
	The people of Yellowhead want a criminal justice system 
which works for them. They want tough laws to deal with young 
offenders and they want tough laws to deal with the criminal 
element. They want their property and their rights protected. 
They will not be punished for not registering their firearms. 
They want the bad guys punished.
<P>
	Under this terribly misguided gun control bill those who 
inadvertently fail to register their firearm face a summary 
conviction offence which would result in, at the very least, a 
criminal record, and at the most it could end up in a five year jail 
sentence. If a person knowingly fails to register their firearm 
they could face a maximum of 10 years in jail. That is for 
law-abiding citizens, but the thugs who steal firearms face a 
maximum of two years in jail. What kind of country are the 
Liberals building for the future?
<P>
	Section 99 of this ill conceived Bill C-68 puts at risk 
fundamental liberties handed down from the Magna Carta, 
going all the way back to 1215. Section 99 allows for 
warrantless searches to be conducted. Section 107 criminalizes 
non-co-operation with police. Sections 91 and 92 enforce harsh 
penalties for non-compliance with gun registration. All of these 
single out law-abiding citizens. So much for almost 800 years of 
judges and scholars; 800 years of jurisprudence. This firearm 
legislation has the potential to abrogate and trample Canadians' 
liberties and freedoms, not only for gun owners but non-owners 
as well.
<P>
	I speak on behalf of the majority of my constituents when I 
say that the bill will do little to protect them from the criminal 
use of firearms. I have stacks of anti-gun control letters and 
scores of petitions signed by thousands of constituents who want 
the government to reconsider the legislation. I will quote from a 
couple of these. Mrs. Dorothy Harrison of Barrhead, Alberta 
writes: ``The criminals will not register their guns and 
law-abiding citizens will be penalized. The present justice 
industry is a gold mine for lawyers and totally inadequate''.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Mr. John Rae of Whitecourt, Alberta writes: ``As a concerned 
citizen of the Yellowhead riding, I am alarmed at the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13631"> 13631 </A></B>
<P>
flaws in the gun control legislation that will turn law-abiding 
citizens of this country into law breakers''.
<P>
	This bill is more than just about firearms legislation. It is 
really about raw political power exercised by the state over its 
citizens.
<P>
	If the government was really serious about reducing crime it 
would look at the causes of crime and the causes of urban 
violence. But to do so, the government would have to tackle 
some very holy sacred cows, sacred cows that this government 
along with previous governments helped to build.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this will be the only opportunity I have to address Bill C-68 in 
the Chamber. I was not able to speak to the bill at second reading 
because there was time allocation then. Now there is time 
allocation at report stage and time allocation again at third 
reading. There has been time allocation at every stage of the bill. 
It is unfortunate that in the end most members will be lucky to 
have 10 minutes to speak to this bill.
<P>
	It is my intention to oppose the bill at report stage and at final 
reading unless substantive amendments are made. I have 
mentioned before that in the last election I made certain 
commitments to represent Calgary West in the House of 
Commons and to do so on the basis of Reform principles and 
policies. All Reformers ran on those principles.
<P>
	Among those principles and policies is a commitment to 
ascertain the views of our constituents and to vote those views 
where they can be ascertained. Specifically, on moral issues and 
on the issue of gun control, I have made a particular 
commitment to discover and to vote the wishes of my 
constituents. I have followed a process in attempting to do that.
<P>
	Through my householder I surveyed the general opinions of 
my constituents on gun control prior to the tabling of Bill C-68. 
That survey covered three general areas that are included in the 
bill. It covered the area of registration of all weapons, tougher 
penalties on gun crime and also the area of further restrictions 
and prohibitions on various classes of weapons. All of those 
things were supported in principle by a large majority of those 
who responded to the survey. That was prior to the tabling of Bill 
C-68. Consistent with that I supported Bill C-68 at second 
reading despite my own misgivings about some elements of it.
<P>
	At that time I sent out a second survey to my constituents 
giving a little more information on the bill and asking very 
specific questions about the contents of Bill C-68 as well as 
giving my own views on it. Those questions, which were much 
more complex, asked about elements of the bill. As well they 
asked for their overall feeling on the bill. It came back with a 
somewhat different result that I think reflects not only greater 
knowledge of the bill but a change in public opinion that has 
occurred in Calgary in the past few weeks.
<P>
	While some elements of the bill remain strongly supported by 
the population I should say that both my householder survey and 
the scientific survey I have conducted have indicated that there 
is still broad support for the general principles of the bill. 
However there are some very severe concerns about specific 
matters, about some of the penalties for non-registration, the 
confiscatory elements of the legislation and the cost concerns.
<P>
	Some areas are supported and some are not. In the end the 
households that replied indicated about 60 per cent overall 
disapproval of the bill. I will reflect that in my vote.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	From my own personal standpoint I believe there are elements 
of gun control and specifically of this bill that could be helpful. 
The government has over reached in a number of areas of the bill 
and it is unfortunate that we cannot get a more modest package.
<P>
	Let me make some comments from my perspective as 
intergovernmental affairs critic of the Reform caucus because 
there are several areas of the gun control package that deserve 
some comment. We know that the Department of Justice retains 
overall responsibility for gun control but the program is 
predominantly administered by provincial and territorial 
governments, through chief firearms officers and local police 
agencies.
<P>
	In 1993, the auditor general concluded that delays in reaching 
financial agreement with the provinces and territories under the 
authority of section 111 of the Criminal Code could well weaken 
the gun control program. Financial agreements had been 
initiated in 1979 and extended several times. The agreements 
expired on March 31, 1993 and now new agreements have been 
signed only with the maritime provinces.
<P>
	I have been told the funds that the provinces received are not 
adequate to cover their costs. For example, in the case of 
Saskatchewan, it has not received payment for its 
administration of existing gun control programs since April 1, 
1993 and it appears that little progress toward resolving this 
conflict has been made.
<P>
	The federal government's latest offer amounts to only about 
two-thirds of the actual cost incurred for these programs. 
Agreements with the provinces are also mandated under section 
108 of the Criminal Code to ensure maximum co-ordination 
with regard to administration of gun control.
<P>
	We know that several of the provincial and territorial 
governments, and I include here Alberta, Saskatchewan, the 
Yukon territory, the Northwest Territories and now Ontario are 
not supportive of the bill. Clearly a high degree of provincial 
support is needed if this program is to be implemented with any 
degree of success.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13632"> 13632 </A></B>
<P>
	Many amendments have been suggested to the bill, including 
the creation of a new level of bureaucracy, gun control 
inspectors, for which no cost estimates are available and about 
which all provinces are very concerned.
<P>
	It would seem to me that a government that wanted to have its 
provincial counterparts on side would slow down and consult 
with them more on the bill, on the amendments and on its 
implementation. Instead we have a situation where at least two 
provincial governments, Saskatchewan and Alberta, are 
considering constitutional challenges or perhaps even refusing 
to administer gun control programs. That is unfortunate but it is 
part of what I talked about earlier in my speech where we have a 
situation where in many areas the government has over reached 
itself. In some cases it raised some very legitimate areas of 
concern and in other areas raised concerns where concerns were 
not necessary.
<P>
	My own feeling, having talked to many people in my riding 
about this, people who own guns and do not own guns, people 
who are for the bill and who are against the bill, gun owners who 
are for and gun owners who are against, non-gun owners who 
are for the bill and non-gun owners who are against it, is that 
there is a fairly broad consensus on the kind of gun and crime 
control that is needed.
<P>
	Many citizens would be more than willing to register their 
weapons and co-operate with police if they felt that in so doing 
this would affirm the legitimacy and respect for their 
responsibly used property rights and for responsible gun 
ownership.
<P>
	Unfortunately there has been a pattern of legislation in the 
past decade where registration has been followed by increased 
regulation, ultimately by restriction, prohibition and then by 
confiscation, often without compensation. This has led to fears 
that some may say are unfounded but which do have their 
grounding in people's experience with gun laws.
<P>
	These are people who have tried consistently to obey the law. 
That is unfortunate. Government has reinforced that impression 
by concentrating on the issue of gun control. Most people see a 
role for gun control but we have a government that refused to 
move in most areas of criminal justice reform.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act remains unreformed. Sentencing 
remains not reformed satisfactorily. We have ongoing debates 
about capital punishment and other areas of the criminal justice 
system which the government has not touched at all.
<P>
	All in all, the government's fairly one dimensional 
determined agenda in this area has probably cost it the support 
of many Canadians who might otherwise support this 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	I will be the first to admit that it is very difficult to measure 
public opinion on this bill. Certainly when this bill was 
originally brought before the House my constituents were 
overwhelmingly in favour of its general direction. There has 
been a shift in public opinion. That shift has been away. The fact 
of the matter is that no clear consensus now exists for many of 
the measures in this bill. For that reason, I will be supporting a 
wide range of the amendments to the bill, and if those 
amendments are not adopted I will oppose the bill on the final 
vote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to participate in today's debate at report stage of Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons. I already 
had an opportunity to speak on February 16, during the second 
reading debate on this bill. I then supported this bill and I-like 
my party, the Bloc Quebecois-continue to do so. I would, 
however, like the House to adopt the amendments proposed by 
my Bloc colleagues, the hon. members for Saint-Hubert and for 
Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	These amendments would decriminalize the failure to register 
a firearm, impose a 20 year freeze on licensing and registration 
fees, ensure that all parties are treated fairly in this matter, and 
eliminate the minimum four year sentence for some criminal 
offences involving a firearm.
<P>
	I generally agree with the institution of a national system to 
register all firearms and the inclusion of new offences in the 
Criminal Code, except for the amendments proposed by my Bloc 
colleagues. I think that we must staunch the illegal flow of 
firearms into and within Canada and tighten border controls. We 
all know that enormous quantities of firearms are imported into 
Canada every year.
<P>
	The debate on Bill C-68 has been and still is too emotional, in 
my opinion. The discussions so far have been very heated. I have 
received hundreds of letters, protesting this bill I must admit, 
most of which are from English Canadians. I think that the 
campaign against this bill was mostly orchestrated by the 
firearms industry. I also believe that the Reform members gave 
in too easily to the lobbying of firearms manufacturers.
<P>
	I consulted my constituents in the riding of Bourassa. An 
overwhelming majority recognizes the need to bring in stricter 
gun control laws. Over the past year, firearms were used in some 
crimes in my riding, which has swayed public opinion towards 
better protection of the public. Of course, stricter firearm 
controls cannot in themselves resolve the problem or all of the 
problems associated with criminal activity. We must admit 
however, that they will, however, be of great help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13633"> 13633 </A></B>
<P>
	The registration of all firearms is a positive move. Gunowners 
will also have to find ways of storing them safely. I support 
Motions Nos. 84 and 135 in particular, which were proposed by 
the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, and which would oblige the 
manufacturer, importer or exporter of firearms to equip them 
with a safety lock.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	I think that these amendments markedly improve this bill and 
would be relatively inexpensive to enforce. After consulting 
with the citizens of my riding, I can state that they support the 
main points in this bill. I think that this piece of legislation is a 
step in the right direction, despite its omissions and 
shortcomings.
<P>
	The number of deaths caused by firearms is unfortunately still 
too high. In Quebec alone, between 400 and 450 deaths are 
caused by firearms per year. Firearms are the weapons used in 
most homicides and in three out of four suicides in Quebec, 
which total approximately 300 per year.
<P>
	Therefore, we must combat the criminal use of firearms more 
effectively. According to the polls, Quebec shows the strongest 
support for gun control. This is particularly true within the 
labour movement where I come from. Quebec's three labour 
congresses support the broad principle of this bill, as do the 
municipalities, the Quebec Bar Association and public health 
experts.
<P>
	However, I have serious reservations about several provisions 
in Bill C-68, especially those dealing with procedures and 
registration costs. The government claims it will cost $85 
million, spread over seven years, to set up this system. However, 
the Government of Quebec has already indicated that in Quebec 
alone, it will cost more than $300 million.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Justice refuse to give us the figures 
for the real cost of registration? The minister said that on 
average, a woman dies of gunshot wounds every six days in this 
country. Guns are used in most domestic murders.
<P>
	The government has a right and a duty to protect citizens 
against the unlawful use of firearms. Public safety must be 
better protected. I will therefore vote in favour of the 
amendments presented by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to make a few remarks with regard to Bill C-68 and the 
amendments put forward by my colleagues.
<P>
	On time allocation, we must understand in this assembly that 
there are many Canadians interested in this subject, and to set a 
time limit on the amount of debate when we have such an 
important bill before us is not the act of a responsible 
government.
<P>
	Look at the number of amendments that have been placed 
before this Parliament. There are 267 different motions before 
us right now. What does that say about the bill? In a very clear 
way, this to me says that the bill is inadequate. It says that the 
bill does not meet the needs of Canadians. From those 267 
amendments that are before us, there are all kinds of ideas that 
are expressed by Canadians as to ways and means by which the 
bill could be adjusted to better meet the objectives, whatever 
they are.
<P>
	However, the government has not listened to the 267 motions 
that are here. We have had very little debate today by the 
Liberals. They have made up their minds. They are determined 
to ram this thing through and put closure on it. Tomorrow we 
will have third reading. The bill will then go on to the Senate, 
and supposedly the government has done its job. It has not. That 
is one of the things I have concern about.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The second thing is who really asked for this legislation? 
What were Canadians asking for? They were asking during the 
last campaign for legislation that would be tougher on the 
criminals. That was their major objective.
<P>
	If we listen to all the debate that is going on in this House, 
what are we talking about? We are talking about the registration 
of guns, which is a major concern supposedly, but it is not the 
first priority. It has been the focus of the discussion. We have set 
aside a major, thorough, knowledgeable, good discussion on the 
first priority of Canadians, and that is legislation and laws in the 
country and actions of the court that will punish the criminal and 
protect the responsible citizens of this country.
<P>
	We have mixed up the priorities. We have before us poor 
legislation, which is not doing the job. We have a government 
that is focused on registration, which is unacceptable to the 
Canadian public and is not meeting the needs.
<P>
	There are three areas I will concentrate on. First, we have to 
look at the question, which has been raised in the House a 
number of times, of whether it will prevent crime. Will this 
legislation prevent any harmful act occurring to another citizen? 
Second, what about the cost of this legislation? Will this 
registration be worth the cost to the Canadian taxpayer? 
Whether they pay it because of their licence fee, whether they 
have to pay money for registering their gun, it is still a tax. It is 
still a cost to the Canadian taxpayer. Is that cost going to be 
worth while and bring about the benefits we want? Third, what 
about the freedom of responsible individuals in Canada? Does 
this legislation infringe on their rights and their freedoms to act 
as responsible citizens? I would like to address those three items 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13634"> 13634 </A></B>
<P>
with regard to this legislation and also relative to the 
amendments that are before us today.
<P>
	First, will registration of long guns really fight crime and 
prevent crime? The answer is clearly no. That has been 
reinforced by the minister, not only in this House. It has been 
reinforced by the Minister of Justice making comments on 
radio, television, and through the written media that he can 
produce no evidence that registration will prevent crime and 
stop any harmful act in the streets of Canada, no evidence at all. 
So why are we doing it? There has not been any justification.
<P>
	Second, has registration in the past of handguns prevented 
crime from happening in the streets? Has it controlled the use of 
these weapons in an offence? We had very strict comprehensive 
gun control legislation brought into this assembly in 1977 and 
again in 1991. We have found that legislation has had no effect, 
that the rate of crime has gone up. It has had no impact on the 
incidence of homicides, on suicides, on violent crime or crimes 
committed with firearms. It has had no effect at all.
<P>
	Today we are trying to put another layer of legislation in that 
requires registration and licensing of Canadians who have guns, 
and no one has answered that basic question: will it help to fight 
crime and to reduce the amount of crime or the harm that occurs 
to individuals? Nobody can answer that. I am sure at the moment 
there is no answer.
<P>
	We have been convinced as the Reform Party that registration 
is not the answer to crime control at all. I know many Canadians 
tell us that in a very clear way.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I wish to cover a second point with regard to cost. The 
conclusion is very clear. The registration of guns will be a huge 
waste of taxpayers' money. Whether taxpayers pay $85 million 
directly, whether taxpayers have to pay a licensing fee or a 
registration fee for one gun or a number of guns, it will be a huge 
cost to Canadians.
<P>
	Estimates are $500 million. Others estimate it to be even 
more. It will be an unnecessary huge cost at a point in time when 
Canadians have a limited amount of money to spend on the extra 
things government would demand of them. It seems to be a very 
useless exercise to spend money on something that does not 
have results.
<P>
	One of the authorities of the country who has been mentioned 
a number of times in this assembly, the auditor general, has said 
very clearly that before we pass new legislation we should look 
at past legislation to see whether it has met its objectives and has 
been cost effective in any way.
<P>
	I have already cited the 1977 legislation and the 1991 
legislation passed by the House. From all estimates or 
judgments the expenditure of money out of the public purse to 
put that legislation in place has not brought about the results 
Canadians want. It has not lowered the rate of crime or reduced 
it or stopped the number of killings that have been going on. It 
has done nothing.
<P>
	Again Canadians are being asked to spend millions and 
millions of dollars, over half a billion dollars most likely when 
the bill is tallied, to try to register them and then supposedly 
reduce the amount of crime. It has not happened in the past and it 
will not happen in the future.
<P>
	I asked my constituents, like everybody else has, what they 
thought of registering guns. Thirty-one per cent said that stiffer 
gun control would be effective, in other words registration, in 
reducing crime or crime related activities. Sixty-nine per cent 
said that it would not. Thirty-six per cent agreed with 
registration.
<P>
	That was a reflection of southern Alberta attitude that was 
very accurate. When I walked around my constituency and went 
door to door, business to business, I found that 99 per cent of my 
constituents-and I talked to at least 200 or 300 of them on the 
street-came to me on a volunteer basis to say clearly that 
registration was not the way to go and that I should vote against 
it in Parliament.
<P>
	With the government invoking closure, a government that has 
not allowed us to discuss it fully, how else can we vote?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to make a couple of brief comments that I think are 
relevant to the debate as many Canadians are watching the 
deliberations of the House on Bill C-68.
<P>
	The previous speaker mentioned that some 267 amendments 
would be considered at report stage. I took out the Order Paper 
and Notice Paper for today to find out the exact source of all the 
amendments. I found, even when reviewing the last 60, that 
some 45 of them were put before the House at report stage by 
two members of the Reform Party who were also members of the 
justice committee that dealt with the bill.
<P>
	Motions at report stage are admissible if the committee has 
not dealt with the matter. I think there is another condition. 
However it raises an interesting question.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The previous speaker tended to indicate that all these items 
had to raised. If many of the amendments that have been raised 
before the House at report stage are still to be addressed by the 
House, it begs the question why members of the committee who 
were there to discuss the bill did not raise these questions and 
motions at the justice committee. Why are they now tying up the 
time of the House?
<P>
	As I stated earlier, if all 267 motions were to be debated in the 
House with all the time members would want, we would be here 
until next Christmas. Frankly I think Canadians are saying that 
we have consulted more than enough on the gun control 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13635"> 13635 </A></B>
<P>
	The member also referred to the government ramming 
legislation through. It has been almost a year since the 
discussion documents were tabled by the justice minister. He 
has travelled from coast to coast. He has talked to Canadians 
about the issues. As a result of the committee work the justice 
minister has brought forward many extremely important 
amendments that respond to the concerns of Canadians. One 
example would be with regard to first time offenders and the 
non-registration of weapons. Those were positive and 
constructive changes with regard to the messages the justice 
minister heard.
<P>
	Throughout the day I have seen the justice minister in the 
House and in the lobby. He has followed the debate very closely. 
He has listened to all hon. members whether it was in committee 
or in the House. He has certainly listened to Canadians.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to be with the minister in Toronto. We 
went to Regent Park, a subsidized housing development, where 
there were ordinary people from a number of walks of life, gun 
owners and non-gun owners alike, who all had an opportunity to 
speak. It was a very interesting meeting. We heard from the 
people in that community that it was commonplace for them to 
hear a gunshot at night when their children were playing in the 
streets. They were very scared and concerned about what was 
happening to safety in our communities.
<P>
	Considering the priorities of Canadians, community safety is 
certainly an important issue. One issue I keep hearing about 
from members of the Reform Party is the issue of registration. 
They proposed initially that registration and addressing the 
crime element should be separated, but the minister has 
explained clearly that there is an important and integral 
relationship between registration and crime control. One 
example concerns the importation of firearms.
<P>
	Recently in Toronto there was a case where a gun dealer 
legally imported firearms but subsequently marketed them on 
the black market. Registration under the legislation, for 
instance, would require that on importation the weapons would 
be registered by the importer. There would be a clear trail of the 
weapons from the time they enter the country.
<P>
	Another aspect concerns the importance of the relationship 
between Canada and the United States. Many members have 
suggested that we have to go after the criminals and those who 
are smuggling in firearms from the United States. Members 
know well that some 1,400 guns are reported lost, missing or 
stolen each year by Canadians. We can imagine how many 
weapons are actually lost, missing or stolen. Clearly those 
weapons are in the hands of the criminal element.
<P>
	Therefore it is important to ensure that all Canadians who 
have firearms and register them are well aware of their 
responsibilities. In talking with gun clubs and other large gun 
owners I have found that the educational aspect of the 
consultative process has been extremely valuable to the 
Canadian public. Only about 10 per cent of  Canadians actually 
own firearms. The other 90 per cent are probably not very 
familiar with the rules regarding firearms.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	The comfort level of Canadians at large has been improved 
substantially because of education, knowing that there is 
licensing, knowing that there are courses, knowing that there are 
restrictions on transportation and ammunition sales, and 
knowing that registration will ensure gun owners have an 
opportunity to show they support law, order and safety in 
communities.
<P>
	The whole issue of crime control comes down to whether we 
wait until we have a problem in Canada with regard to safety and 
crime in our communities or whether we respond proactively. If 
we took into account that for every one incident of a firearms 
related crime in Canada there are 100 incidents in the United 
States, and if we took into account the population differential of 
ten to one, for every incident in Canada there are ten in the U.S. 
on a per capita basis.
<P>
	Could we imagine what the reaction of the Canadian public 
would be if the crime rate due to guns in Canada were to double? 
That would mean there would be only one incident for every five 
in the U.S. I dare say that most certainly the Canadian public 
would be extremely upset about the decay within society.
<P>
	We have something in Canada of which we are very proud and 
must protect, that is safety in our communities. As we all know, 
the Prime Minister has boasted about safety in Canada. We can 
safely walk in our parks. As a result of initiatives such as this 
one we will ensure that Canada remains a safe country in which 
to live and a safe country for our children.
<P>
	I do not think the honest hunter, gun collector or target shooter 
will be impacted in any material way by the legislation. The cost 
is not an issue. Ten dollars for 10 guns for five years is not an 
issue.
<P>
	People in my own riding have come to see me and I have asked 
them how it would affect them. After we got over the cost issue 
it got down to the issue of confiscation. There are questions 
about confiscation. My constituents continue to raise the spectre 
that the government wants to register guns because it wants to 
take their guns away.
<P>
	The justice minister has made it very clear that confiscation is 
absolutely not an objective of the government. Canada has a 
very vibrant economy in hunting, target shooting and collecting 
that will remain. When it gets down to paramilitary weapons, 
automatic weapons and guns that have absolutely no purpose 
except to hurt people, they are the ones Canadians say should be 
off the streets and out of the hands of those most likely to cause 
harm to our community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13636"> 13636 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear the amendments brought forward by the committee 
are constructive. The vast majority of the 267 amendments 
presented by the Reform Party at report stage are nothing more 
than a disruption of the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in the words of my colleague, I should like to straighten 
out the previous speaker from the Liberal Party on a couple of 
issues.
<P>
	He suggested that we were tying up the time of the House on 
the bill. He more or less said that it was terrible for us to do so 
and that it was not all that important. In my community and in 
communities across the country it is important to people. If the 
hon. member wants to look back at the number of petitions 
presented in <I>Hansard</I>, he would see that the numbers of names 
on them are extensive. If he says it is not important he is missing 
the boat.
<P>
	He also said that we have been debating the issue for over a 
year. It is my understanding that the bill was introduced on 
February 14. It must be another short year for the Liberals.
<P>
	There were amendments to the gun laws in 1977 and 1991. 
Many people ignored those changes. I have evidence from 
several studies which indicate that is exactly what will happen 
next. As much as these folks are insisting on putting these things 
in, a lot of people are saying it is hogwash and will not work.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	There is something about the costs they say are small but I 
wonder about the costs of all the policing, of this whole 
exercise, of making sure all the law-abiding citizens remain 
law-abiding citizens or perhaps trying to find them as being 
criminals.
<P>
	The cost of their time spent enforcing gun laws as opposed to 
time looking at the more severe problems of drugs and so on is 
extra ordinary cost. For a member of the other party to put that 
swing on it is absurd.
<P>
	I recently competed in a politically correct competition with 
the Ridgedale Rod and Gun Club in my riding. If I could not use 
a prop-

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am very sorry to

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of the motions in Group 
No. 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before the vote I talked about the closure issue. Closure 
was forced upon the democratic principles of the House by the 
Liberal government before debate really took place on the Bill 
C-68 gun issue. Although the justice committee talked about the 
gun control legislation, there is more to it than that. The public 
has a right to hear from all members, all of its representatives 
from across the country on this issue. I do not think what the 
Liberals have done is in the least bit democratic. Back in my 
riding people are asking why such an imposition has occurred on 
this particular bill.
<P>
	In fact, the Reform Party introduced 138 amendments to Bill 
C-68. I would like to ask the government, with closure limiting 
debate to six hours at report stage and another six hours at third 
reading, how on earth is it possible to debate 138 amendments? 
It surely does not allow the members of the Reform Party to 
accurately describe what is wrong with Bill C-68. This is 
forcing an anti-democratic bill through the House and it is 
wrong.
<P>
	That is in part what is wrong with a majority government. This 
government has not taken the hint from the last government that 
was in majority in this House of Commons. It got arrogant. It got 
overconfident. In the early stages, those are the signs we are 
seeing from this Liberal government. That is unfortunate, but 
fortunate for the rest of the land because we only have about two 
years to put up with this nonsense.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	There are two other bills of particular note going through here 
on the basis of closure, and they are Bill C-41 and Bill C-85, the 
criminal justice system and MPs' pensions. Again, this 
government invoked closure on perhaps the most important 
legislation they could dream up since Parliament opened. They 
forced closure on it. It is absolutely unbelievable.
<P>
	I can tell members that there are many people across this land 
who do not understand why, including myself. They make jokes 
about it here as I talk. We will see where the jokes go two years 
from now when we hit the election.
<P>
	Before the votes started I was about to talk a little about the 
Ridgedale Rod and Gun Club, one of many rod and gun clubs in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13638"> 13638 </A></B>
<P>
this country. I had the privilege of participating in a shoot in that 
club about three weeks ago. I won one of the competitions. It 
was on a politically correct gun competition with pistols and 
politically  incorrect guns. I had never really shot these pistols 
before, although I am a gun owner myself; I have three rifles. 
What surprised me in particular about this competition was the 
level of pride and satisfaction these members had. There was an 
extreme level of competence these people had.
<P>
	One of the members who spoke here previously from the 
Liberal Party said that these people do not mind Bill C-68. 
Every person at the Ridgedale Rod and Gun Club was extremely 
upset at it.
<P>
	I do not understand how a government that invokes closure on 
this bill, says it is not costly, and whose members say that people 
agree with what they are doing could be so wrong. I guess what 
we are going to see is a lot of this Liberal arrogance for the next 
two years. It is going to catch them and it is going to catch them 
hard.
<P>
	These people at the Ridgedale Rod and Gun Club, I have 
admiration for people who have collections of any sort. There 
were several people there. One fellow had one of the better 
collections of Enfield rifles in Canada. He was asking: ``Why 
are they doing this? What is this for? Come and look at my 
collection. I will show you what safety is all about''. I did not get 
to see the collection, but as far as safety goes with these folks, 
they are probably number one in the country. They know what 
gun safety is all about.
<P>
	I do not understand what the direction is here. I thought we 
were after crime and criminals. These people are not criminals. 
These are not crime makers unless a government chooses to 
head them in that direction by way of calling them criminals by 
virtue of non-compliance with Bill C-68.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is not going to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I hear over here that it is 
not going to happen. If not, why does the government not allow 
us to debate this issue instead of calling closure on it? The 
government is saying it can read the Canadian people so well, 
but it is absolutely wrong. It is wrong on Bill C-68, on Bill 
C-41, and on those preposterous MP pensions on Bill C-85, 
which it is insisting on bringing in.
<P>
	The Ontario Handgun Association I believe wrote all MPs 
letters. I will give members information it provided to us.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Recent survey data indicate that a minimum of one-third of 
Canadian gun owners will refuse to comply with the proposal by 
the Minister of Justice to register all firearms. In the 1995 gun 
control survey organized by Professor Gary Mauser of Simon 
Fraser University, Canadian firearm owners were asked the 
following question: ``If the government's proposal to register all 
firearms becomes law, do you plan on registering all, some or 
none of your firearms?'' The response to this question is in the 
final analysis nearly one-third of all Canadian firearm owners 
candidly admitted to a stranger  over the telephone that they 
would not register their firearms.
<P>
	What is wrong with a government that puts through closure on 
such an important issue when Canadians will tell it to stick it in 
its ear?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to on Bill C-68 under protest to 
the closure limiting the members in this House to a six-hour 
debate on report stage.
<P>
	The constituents in Mission-Coquitlam want crime control, 
not gun control. We have gun registration now and we have laws 
now that would help control crime in our country. However, the 
courts do not enforce many of our laws and often our police are 
frustrated at the lack of substance in sentencing.
<P>
	Bill C-68 as it now stands will not prevent abuse with a 
firearm. It will, however, punish many good, law-abiding 
Canadians who are gun collectors, hunters, and gun club 
members. To force a national registration on these law-abiding 
citizens I believe is a waste of time and money and a waste of the 
necessary manpower we will need to put this registration into 
permanent record.
<P>
	The justice minister tells us that there are pretty scary 
statistics out there dealing with the use of guns. Every six days a 
woman is murdered by a gun. Over 1,000 suicides per year are 
the result of gun usage. After reciting these statistics, we are 
also told that these are the reasons we need gun control. We are 
never told two things: first, how will the registration of rifles 
and shotguns reduce these numbers; second, what percentage of 
these acts takes place with guns that would would be required to 
be registered under this legislation?
<P>
	The Reform Party's position is crystal clear on law and order. 
The party stands for tougher laws to deal with criminals and 
more protection for potential victims of crime. The party has 
stated on many occasions that Canadian laws need to be tougher 
on criminals.
<P>
	The gun registration system proposed by Bill C-68 will do 
nothing to prevent the use of handguns and rifles in the 
commission of crimes.
<P>
	When analysing the part of the bill dealing with gun 
registration one has to go back to first principles of what 
problem this legislation is trying to address. The problem is a 
proliferation of firearms, both handguns and rifles, and their use 
in criminal activities. This being the problem, it is difficult to 
see how a system of national gun registration would be of any 
benefit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13639"> 13639 </A></B>
<P>
	All can appreciate that criminals are not going to register 
illegal weapons or weapons acquired illegally. The registration 
of a weapon will not stop its use in a domestic quarrel. Recently 
here in Ottawa we had the tragedy of the shooting of a young boy 
and a young girl. Registration of that firearm would not have 
prevented that tragedy.
<P>
	Some of the problems can be addressed through action taken 
at the United States border, allowing customs officials to stop 
the importation of guns, and stiffer penalties for those who 
commit crimes with guns. The bill addresses both of these 
issues, although not in sufficient depth to suit the Reform 
caucus. Customs officials should be empowered to prohibit the 
importation of firearms, and any crime committed with a gun 
should result in an increased sentence, which is mandatory and 
cannot be plea bargained away.
<P>
	I also am in support of those parts of the bill that would attack 
the problem of gun smuggling in Canada. It is vitally important 
that those who patrol our borders be given real powers to deal 
with those who would import guns illegally into Canada. Again, 
I think this is something the justice committee should look at in 
detail. Should the people who patrol our borders be given 
powers to be more than revenue collectors? Should the 
provincial police or RCMP in particular provinces be required to 
maintain a presence at the borders? A true police presence at our 
borders would, to my way of thinking, reduce smuggling. I am 
not saying we should arm our customs agents, but they should be 
backed up with trained police.
<P>
	I am also concerned because the registration system will be 
computerized. We all know that sophisticated criminals can 
break into virtually any computer system constructed, 
especially with the availability of Internet and World Wide Web. 
There is the distinct possibility that criminals will be able to 
break into the computer code and the registration system to 
determine where the guns are. It will be like shopping at home 
for criminals. It will mean that those who register guns will not 
be safe and will be under the constant threat of being broken into 
by criminals to steal their guns. Gun registration will not save 
lives, but tougher laws to deal with criminals will.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	To reiterate, here are ten points I feel we have to address 
regarding the registration system.
<P>
	The registration section does not stand up to a cost-benefit 
analysis. That is, the lowest cost estimate is now at $85 million, 
without any indication from the government as to its beneficial 
effects on crime. Legislation should not be passed when the 
government cannot tell taxpayers how much it will cost to 
implement.
<P>
	The analysis of the cost and effectiveness of gun control 
legislation already in place has not been completed, as requested 
by the auditor general in 1993.
<P>
	It is argued we must have registration because the chiefs of 
police support it. The chiefs also support capital punishment and 
repealing the section of the Criminal Code that grants murderers 
the opportunity for early parole. The Liberals do not support 
these positions. Either the chiefs are right or wrong. Liberals 
cannot cherry pick to suit their purposes.
<P>
	Proposed clause 112 of the bill states that regulations made 
pursuant to the bill will not have to come before Parliament for 
scrutiny. This is objectionable. What is the government trying to 
hide?
<P>
	Proposed clause 117 allows police to search your car, house, 
et cetera, without a warrant if they believe you have a weapon 
that was used in a crime. However, if during the search they find 
an unregistered gun, it may be seized.
<P>
	With reference to the arguments raised regarding the number 
of suicides in Canada and domestic violence, this bill does 
nothing to address the root causes of either of those problems. 
These are social problems, which will not be resolved through a 
registration procedure.
<P>
	In the polling results showing public support recited by 
advocates of this bill the questions regarding support for gun 
control usually link it with a question: ``Are you in favour of 
legislation to reduce crime?'' That also affects the response one 
gets to that question.
<P>
	The car licensing analogy is used to justify registration: if we 
register cars then we can register guns. If the analogy is to be 
complete then legislation should be changed to require safe 
storage of cars, and any accidents caused by stolen cars should 
be the responsibility of the owner. Alternatively, has vehicle 
registration done anything to prevent drunk driving or the 
prevention of accidents?
<P>
	There has been no answer from the government to those who 
argue that a computer registry of guns could be accessed by a 
computer hacker. This would give potential thieves the location 
of virtually every gun in Canada.
<P>
	Handguns have been subject to registration since 1934. There 
is no evidence and it is the government's argument that this has 
had no effect on reducing the criminal use of handguns.
<P>
	The justice minister knows very well that a registration 
system will not reduce the number of murders or suicides by 
firearms one bit. He should know that Canada is a large and 
diverse country, which in many ways starts at the borders of 
metropolitan Toronto. This country is not metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	The justice minister should read the legislation that is 
presently in place in relation to gun control. He will find the 
present laws in Canada are among the toughest in the world with 
respect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13640"> 13640 </A></B>
<P>
to firearms. Therefore I urge members opposite, members from 
outside of metropolitan Toronto, to look at Canada and see it for 
what it is: a vast country where hunting and outdoor  activities 
are a way of life to some and a recreation to others.
<P>
	The registration system proposed in this bill will not 
accomplish the goals set forth. Therefore, when it comes time to 
vote for the bill, vote it down until the necessary amendments 
are a part of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will talk 
for a minute about why I joined the Reform Party. Obviously my 
colleagues and I supported other political parties in the past. 
What caused us to join the Reform Party?
<P>
	We recognized a long time ago that we needed to change the 
system. I do not think Prime Minister Trudeau ever made a more 
accurate and truthful statement than when he said that MPs are 
nobodies. I think no MPs in this House should know that and feel 
that more than the backbench MPs on the opposite bench. They 
are nobodies. When they stand up to speak out and vote against 
the government on a bill, they are chastised, reprimanded and 
punished for representing their constituents. That is what we are 
here for; we are here to change the system.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	The Conservatives under Prime Minister Mulroney wanted to 
get the GST through this House. What did they do? They cracked 
the whip and got their backbench MPs, even though their 
constituents solidly told them they did not support the GST, to 
vote in favour of it. Where are the Conservatives now? I do not 
see them around this House. That is where these people are 
going to be after the next election as a result of the kind of 
activities they have engaged in over the last few days. There is 
no change in sight.
<P>
	I would like at this juncture to take a minute and commend 
those Liberal MPs who had the courage, the fortitude and the 
tenacity to stand up and vote against this bill even though they 
knew they were going to be punished for doing so. They were 
being true to their constituents. They were representing their 
constituents which is what they were elected to do. In the face of 
adversity they were prepared to do it and I commend them for it. 
We may have differing views and different philosophies but by 
and large I can admire people who are prepared to stand up for 
their constituents.
<P>
	Reformers will be in every Liberal riding at the next election. 
We will remind the constituents how the Liberals treated 
parliamentary democracy in this session, what they did to ram 
through these government bills and how they abused their power 
and position.
<P>
	It has been said that power corrupts and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely. This goes back to the heart of why we need 
to change the system. We need to take some of the power away 
from cabinet and away from the Prime Minister and distribute it 
among the MPs. We would then have the opportunity to see real 
democracy in action and not the executive kind of authoritarian  
democracy we have had in Canada, these democratic 
dictatorships we have had over the last 30 or 40 years.
<P>
	In speaking to the bill itself, it is an established rule that 
justice should not only be done but should be seen to have been 
done. In other words the law must not only be just but it must be 
seen to be just. Can this be said about Bill C-68 and the agenda 
behind it? I do not think so.
<P>
	Gun control is a controversial subject. It is clear that real and 
serious disagreements exist in Canada over it. I am aware and I 
acknowledge that the opinion polls show a majority of 
Canadians tentatively support the government's position at the 
present time. I would caution my colleagues opposite that the 
more and more people find out about it, the less supportive they 
are.
<P>
	I also caution that in the words of Thomas Jefferson, great 
initiatives should not rest on slender majorities. If a majority 
supports something but does not feel very strongly about it and a 
minority opposes it very strongly, it undermines the rule of law 
to ram it through.
<P>
	There is something else that undermines the rule of law even 
more directly and that is when governments say one thing and do 
another. It erodes the very foundation of our society if 
governments misrepresent. That is why I want to ask my 
colleagues opposite to do a little soul searching on this bill. I 
want them to look at themselves in the mirror and ask this 
question: Is this legislation a prelude to confiscating citizens' 
firearms entirely? I do not expect them to concede that in this 
House.
<P>
	Let me point out a couple of quotations that worry me. First, 
when this whole business began the Minister of Justice said 
openly that in his view only agents of the state, police and 
soldiers, should have weapons. He has since stopped saying it, 
but has he stopped believing it? His assistant, Darryl Davies, 
recently said that hunting is a barbaric and murderous activity 
and should be banned in Canada. He also said nobody in a 
civilized country needs a gun. This is a high level official 
working in the minister's office.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	The minister has not to my knowledge repudiated either of 
these remarks. Can we believe the assurances that hunters and 
hunting are not targeted by this bill with these kinds of 
statements made by such senior people in the minister's office?
<P>
	Other prominent gun control advocates including former 
Metropolitan Toronto Police Services Board chair Susan Eng 
have made it quite clear: ``Gun registration will start the process 
of stigmatizing gun use, just like drinking and driving. In their 
hearts, gun owners know this and this is what makes them so 
mad''. We know what Ms. Eng is up to here and we know what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13641"> 13641 </A></B>
<P>
the real agenda is behind the legislation when we hear these 
kinds of statements.
<P>
	Manitoba Liberal leader Lynda Haverstock said in May 1994: 
``I think what we should be doing is ensuring there is less and 
less and less availability to having guns'', which she justified on 
the grounds that ``sometimes our overall responsibilities have to 
override individual rights''.
<P>
	I know my colleagues opposite and my colleagues on this side 
of the Chamber have very serious differences about the bill as it 
now stands. The sweeping powers it gives the police worry us. 
The security of the universal system of registration worries us. 
The severe penalties for infringing this law in a society where 
murderers are free to go out on the street a short time after they 
are convicted strike us as unbalanced. The implied assault on the 
way of life of millions of Canadians troubles us.
<P>
	What worries me most at this moment is that this entire bill is 
a massive fraud. I am concerned that all the pious assurances 
that confiscation is not contemplated are just a smokescreen 
behind which the legislation permitting confiscation can be put 
in place. Then the very people who say no private citizen should 
own guns will act on that belief.
<P>
	Perhaps my colleagues opposite have not given this much 
thought. Perhaps they have accepted the smooth assurances of 
the Minister of Justice. I hope they will take the time to consider 
before voting on this whether the real agenda is outright 
confiscation at some time in the future. If it is, then I challenge 
them to either put it on the table openly right now and let us 
debate it, or put it aside and put the legislation aside that will 
make it possible.
<P>
	This bill is bad enough as it is. What we really wonder is why 
the Minister of Justice is so determined to pass it when it is well 
established that there is no correlation between rates of violence 
and gun crime and laws respecting firearms ownership.
<P>
	What is the real purpose of the bill? If it is a prelude to 
confiscation then it is extremely dangerous to the credibility of 
our government and to the notion of the rule of law in Canada if 
the government does not come forward and is clean with people 
right now telling them that is what is on its mind.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues opposite will not vote to pass such a bill. 
I can assure them if they do, we will be there at the next election 
to remind their constituents how they voted today on closure, 
how they voted last Thursday morning on closure and how they 
voted on this very, very important piece of legislation, Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address the House on Bill 
C-68 this evening. I say it is a pleasure because I am one of only 
three Reform MPs who has had the opportunity to address the 
House on this very important piece of legislation three times in 
the past. The first time was at second reading, the second time 
was on the Reform amendment to split the bill which was also at  
second reading before the government enacted time allocation 
and the third time is tonight.
<P>
	As has already been said by many of my colleagues, we find it 
absolutely deplorable that on such a crucial piece of legislation 
which has elicited such high emotions across the land, we find 
the government has yet again enacted time allocation at report 
stage and at third reading.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	The government limited the debate at second reading and 
forced the bill to the committee. It gave assurances that all of the 
pertinent facts, data and arguments could be brought forward at 
committee. Today in arguments put forward by Liberal members 
we were questioned why we were bringing forward these 
amendments at report stage. We were asked why we wanted, in 
their words, to tie up the House debating this legislation when 
we could have done it at committee stage. Those of us who 
participated at committee stage know that the exact opposite 
happened. There simply was not time to adequately address all 
of the concerns.
<P>
	The Liberals limited the number of witnesses who could 
appear before the committee. Today I heard that while all MPs 
had the opportunity to appear before the committee they were 
limited to five minutes to make their points. As anyone who has 
ever made a public address knows, five minutes goes very 
quickly, especially when one is trying to make points on as many 
issues as are encompassed by this comprehensive piece of 
legislation known as Bill C-68.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is a very detailed, lengthy and intricate piece of 
legislation with some 132 clauses in the firearms act and 
amendments to another 100 sections in part III of the Criminal 
Code. For the government to suggest we can get through that and 
bring forward all the pertinent points by concerned constituents 
and concerned Canadians across this land in a few hours of 
debate is absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
	I find it deplorable that the government would enact time 
allocation and ram this through the House. That is exactly what 
is happening tonight. It is exactly what will be happening in a 
day or two when we are limited to six hours of debate at third 
reading as well.
<P>
	I would like to speak about our amendment at second reading 
stage to split the bill. The Reform Party feels very strongly that 
we are dealing with two completely separate issues in Bill C-68. 
One issue is further regulation and restrictions on law-abiding 
firearms owners. The second issue is what to do and how to get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13642"> 13642 </A></B>
<P>
tough with criminals who misuse firearms and actually use them 
as weapons.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that one of the Liberal members earlier 
today suggested an amendment to actually change the name of 
the act to ``an act respecting firearms and other related matters'' 
rather than ``an act respecting firearms and other weapons'' as it 
is presently named. I would certainly support that amendment.
<P>
	As I have travelled throughout my riding, a lot of people have 
expressed concern that people do not differentiate between a 
firearm and a weapon. It is an important distinction to 
law-abiding firearm owners that a firearm is only a weapon at 
such time as it is used in the commission of a criminal offence. 
Prior to that it is simply viewed to many people as a tool, or 
something used in a hobby if they are a shooter. It is not 
considered by them to be a weapon. It is merely private property. 
It is an important distinction.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues have talked about the fact that what 
we are discussing here is the fourth group of amendments. It is 
interesting to note that we are being asked to debate in a few 
short hours some 267 amendments to this legislation. How can 
we do that justice? How can we adequately debate the pros and 
cons of those individual amendments? We simply cannot. For 
the purpose of debate some of them have been grouped. Group 
No. 4, for example, which we are currently debating has 33 
individual motions. How can we do them justice and adequately 
discuss them in that short time frame?
<P>
	I am very concerned with the erosion of democracy. The 
Reform Party feels very strongly that the primary purpose of 
members of Parliament, which I have spoken about before in the 
House, is to properly and effectively represent the wishes, 
concerns and views of the majority of their constituents where 
that view can be ascertained.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	How can I do that? I have made that point as well. How can I 
do that on this piece of legislation when it deals with two 
distinctly separate issues?
<P>
	The constituents of Prince George-Peace River have made it 
very obvious to me that they want to get tough with criminals. 
They want to bring in tougher sanctions on the criminal 
elements in the country. Therefore I support the part of the 
legislation that deals with the amendments to part III of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	At the same time my constituents are telling me that they want 
to have no part of registration. Why do they not want to have 
registration? We hear ludicrous arguments that we register our 
dogs and our cars so why should we not register our firearms?
<P>
	They are concerned for three main reasons. One is the cost and 
we have talked about that before. They are concerned about the 
paperwork time and the cost to police forces that are already 
stretched to the limit. Hundreds and thousands of useless hours 
will be spent compiling the information.
<P>
	We pointed out in committee as well as in the House that the 
mailing system proposal of the justice minister will not work. 
How can a firearm be identified if it is not actually physically 
seen and inspected? It is interesting to note that Quebec has 
indicated that it wants $300 million if the government goes 
ahead to administer the registration program in that province. 
Yet the justice minister is still clinging to his $85 million total 
cost, which is obviously far from accurate.
<P>
	Constituents are concerned and law-abiding gun owners are 
concerned about the cost recovery that has been bandied about 
from the other side. What will that mean in the future? What will 
the costs of paying an annual ownership fee amount to if they 
want cost recovery?
<P>
	The second issue in addition to cost is the security of the list 
that some of my colleagues have addressed. I spoke about it 
earlier in the House. Will this not provide a shopping list for 
criminals? We all know that hackers break into computer 
systems practically on a daily basis across the nation and around 
the world. If they can break into IBM and can break into the 
Pentagon, what makes the justice minister think they will not be 
able to break into this computer system to get a hold of the list? 
It will provide criminals with a list of where the firearms are and 
what types of firearms they are so that they can steal the firearms 
they want to use. It will also by omission provide them with a list 
of what homes in which communities do not have firearms and 
therefore the home owners are defenceless.
<P>
	The third issue on registration is future confiscation with 
which some of my colleagues have dealt. Above all is the 
statement that it will not be effective. New Zealand, Australia 
and other countries have tried it. I note that draconian gun 
controls brought into effect in the United Kingdom in 1988 were 
followed by dramatic increases in crimes involving firearms. 
They were not effective. It has been proven around the world 
that registration and stiffer gun controls are not effective.
<P>
	I will make a point, which my constituents make to me on 
almost a daily basis, to the Liberals opposite because they will 
know about it pretty soon. There is another election before 
registration becomes mandatory and the voters will be there to 
remind them about this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to take but a few minutes to set a few 
facts straight in the House and possibly to assist or enlighten 
some of my colleagues across the way. While we will try to 
enlighten the people across the way, I recognize it may be a 
major challenge. Nevertheless let us spare no effort in the noble 
cause of enlightening the people across the way who say that it is 
undemocratic to propose this bill.

<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill is supported by the vast majority of Canadians in 
every province. Furthermore the bill is proposed by a 
government elected under a program including the bill among 
others.
<P>
	According to the opposition we have the following 
proposition: ``The majority of people want it. The majority of 
Parliament want it. The majority of people have asked the 
majority of Parliament to enact it but it does not matter. It is 
undemocratic for us to be voting for that which the people 
want''. However, in the eyes of the Reform Party, it is far more 
democratic to agree with the leader of the Reform Party because 
he said so.
<P>
	There is something wrong with that way of thinking by the 
people across the way. Then members of the Reform Party say 
that they have not had enough time to debate the bill and that the 
use of time allocation is wrong.
<P>
	I invite colleagues across the way to pay attention because we 
will be asking questions later. This is the way it works. A few 
weeks ago we had in the House a bill regarding no less an issue 
than the rail strike in Canada. At that time two of the three 
parties in the House proposed time allocation, and the Reform 
Party was one of the two parties. If the use of time allocation is 
not proper, why was it proper on an issue the Reform Party liked 
as opposed to one they disliked?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It was a national crisis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I hear a bit of heckling from across the way. I do 
not think I am being particularly provocative on the issue. 
Nevertheless let me submit this to you, being far more objective 
than I am and seeing it through the neutral eyes of Madam 
Speaker, that they say they have only had a few short hours of 
debate. The bill has been debated longer in the House and in 
committees than the throne speech, budget speech and all the 
budget bills put together. All that debate combined is not as long 
as debate on the bill dealing with guns, and for them it is still not 
long enough.
<P>
	The last member of the Reform Party who spoke said: ``I need 
much more time to speak on these profound amendments''. 
Most of the so-called profound amendments would delete all the 
clauses in the bill. How much time does one need for that kind of 
nonsense?
<P>
	The Reform Party argues it is more democratic to allow it in 
the minority more time to remove the clauses supported by the 
majority of members of Parliament and the majority of 
Canadians. This is Reform Party logic. It makes sense to a few 
people but a very small and decreasing number of people. That is 
what is wrong with that logic.
<P>
	I do not want to be too provocative about it but members of the 
Reform Party are trying to prevent the majority of Canadians 
from having legislation they want. They are against the 
democratic principles they pretend to espouse.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And this is what is wrong with the Reform Party. I know that 
the members of the Reform Party tend to kick up a fuss from 
time to time. We hear their cry from time to time in the House. 
Nevertheless, the members opposite are not in a bit of a state 
because the majority of Canadians are supporting them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One member said a little earlier tonight that gun registration 
would not have eliminated a particular crime. The member 
described victims of a particular criminal incident and said that 
registering the guns would not have had the desired effect in that 
case. That is about the same as asking-and I have had a few 
people ask me about it-how many lives the registration of guns 
would save.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Zero.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is a good point. I am glad the hon. member 
across the way is wide awake and listening. It is about the same 
as asking how man lives licence plates on motor vehicles will 
save.
<P>
	If we do nothing else of course it will not save any. Who says 
it is not in the interests of society to do anything else? It is the 
same with licence plates on motor vehicles. It permits one to 
determine when cars are being used in an inappropriate way, to 
chase them down, to give tickets and to take other measures to 
provide greater safety for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is the same thing with gun control. It is the same thing. The 
members in this party and most Canadians want laws in this 
country that differentiate us from our neighbours to the south, in 
the United States of America. I have a great fondness for the 
United States, a great land of prosperity. However, the 
Americans have laws that permit people to bear arms in the 
street in some states, like Texas, for example.
<P>
	Now this is not the sort of society we want in Canada. I say 
this to the members opposite over the outcry and all the noise the 
Reform Party is making-we do not want this sort of society. 
This is not at all what we want.
<P>
	We want a society in which we will-

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

would be interested in hearing the final moments of the speech 
of the government whip.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13644"> 13644 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that I 
am trying not to be provocative, it is getting a few members 
across the way a bit more than excited. Nevertheless this is a 
serious piece of legislation proposed by a minister who has 
travelled the country to listen to the views of Canadians.
<P>
	We have debated the bill longer than any other piece of 
legislation has been debated since we have been in office. We 
debated the bill, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, longer 
than we debated the throne speech, the budget debate and all the 
budget bills combined. We have nothing to apologize for. 
Canadians have been consulted.
<P>
	Now that they have been consulted, the time for decision has 
come. This is a government that does not hesitate to make 
decisions. The government will make the necessary decisions. 
The government will enact the legislation necessary to make 
this a better, finer and safer society for all.
<P>
	In a few years from now some of the members across the way 
in the Reform Party will be apologizing to the people of Canada 
for the wrongheaded decisions they are taking today. They will 
be apologizing for those blunders, as the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands put eloquently. That is what will 
happen. I say to members across the way that it is still time for 
them to change their minds. There is still time to vote for the 
legislation the people of Canada have asked us to enact. There is 
still time to do what the majority of Canadians want.
<P>
	If members across the way think they are behaving in a way 
that is deserving of the support of the majority of the people they 
pretend to represent, now is the time to show it. Now is the time 
to vote on a measure the people of Canada want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the purpose of the bill as every bill is to make 
the country a safer place. I will indicate how the bill will do the 
exact opposite. It will make our streets less safe in the future.
<P>
	As I only have two minutes I will be very brief. I will dispense 
with all the rhetoric and take the minister's argument a part 
piece by piece.
<P>
	When passed the legislation will cost between $85 million 
and $500 million. That money has to come from somewhere and 
will be taken away from the functional arm of justice. There is 
something called opportunity cost. When it is pulled away from 
one arm of justice to another it should be put into an area with 
better efficiency. Unfortunately it has been proven that gun 
registration does not work and will not make our streets safer. 
Studies have been done in Australia, New Zealand and other 
countries.
<P>
	The minister says that we will have less homicide. The reality 
is that of the 720 homicides in the country last year 220 were 
committed with firearms and 5 were committed with legally 
owned handguns. The minister says that we will have less 
suicide. Persons who are going to commit suicide do not go out 
to get a gun registration or an FAC. They do not go through all 
the loops necessary to get a gun. They kill themselves or attempt 
to kill themselves with whatever is available.
<P>
	In short, that is why the registration aspect of Bill C-68 will 
not work. It will make our street less safe because it will take 
money away from the functional arm of justice.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 7.45 p.m., 
pursuant to order made Thursday, June 8, and in accordance with 
the provisions of Standing Order 78(2), it is my duty to interrupt 
the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the report stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	Pursuant to agreement made earlier, all motions in Group No. 
4 are deemed put and recorded divisions are deemed requested 
and deemed deferred.
<P>
	Pursuant to agreement made earlier all the motions in Group 
Nos. 5 to 11 are deemed proposed and seconded, questions put, 
divisions requested and deemed deferred.

amendment be dealt with in great detail but for a brief 
explanation as to what the effect of the amendment would be.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the Chair take it the hon. member 
is not giving unanimous consent to deal with Motion No. 267 
first?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> I am content to deal with Motion No. 267 first 
but I would like someone to explain in 30 seconds what 
amendment 267 is all about.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take it there is unanimous consent to 
deal with Motion No. 267 first. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 267.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 267 lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the member for 
Mississauga East voted twice on the motion. Am I correct in 
assuming that the House would count her first vote in support of 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary rose 
to explain that she had been counted in error and therefore she 
was counted with her second vote.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 1. The Chair's 
understanding is that the Chair is not going to have to read each 
of the motions, that the number is sufficient.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears that only two members 
are voting in favour of the motion. Perhaps I could ask for 
unanimous consent that the members who have voted on the 
previous motion be recorded as voting nay, with the exception of 
one or two who could rise to ask that their vote be recorded as 
yes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent to that 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a bit of 
misunderstanding on how you vote on these issues. The clerk 
has looked on both sides of it. Can you explain to members 
which side you will be looking at first when you are voting?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Actually, neither side. The clerk has to 
do the counting. We try not to look on either side. We look 
wherever somebody is standing.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I was voting in favour of the motion and I 
inadvertently got a vote ahead. I want to make sure that my name 
was not recorded twice in error.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The next question is on Motion No. 10.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, in an effort to save a bit of time, I 
wonder if there would be a disposition that the members who 
voted on the previous motion be recorded as having voted on the 
motion now before the House with Liberal members voting nay. 
Perhaps the mover of the motion and others could stand and 
indicate if they wish to vote differently.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The Bloc members will vote in favour of this 
motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party members vote no 
except for those members who wish to vote otherwise. As the 
member for Calgary Centre, I wish to record my vote as a yea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, New Democrats vote nay on this 
motion, including the member for Kamloops who had voted yea 
on the previous motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent among all 
the members to proceed as has been proposed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It would 
be helpful when the government whip rose if he stated which 
motion number it was applying to.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is Motion No. 10. That has been 
agreed to and the vote will be counted shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if we have finished 
the count, but I want to be shown as being in favour of Motion 
No. 10.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, do we get up on a point of order and 
indicate that or do we just stand up? Please explain. I was voting 
in favour of the motion. Do you require us to get up on a point of 
order to do that or do you just look to either side to see who gets 
up?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is a good point. Is anybody not 
satisfied that their vote has not been indicated by what was said 
or by what they have done?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am voting in favour of Motion No.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make it clear as 
well that I am voting in favour of Motion No. 10.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Miramichi on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, we know the Miramichi is a 
great river, but the Restigouche is even greater. I would be 
voting in favour of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Nipissing and the 
hon. member for the great river of Miramichi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hubbard:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wood:</B> I am voting in favour, Mr. Speaker.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 10 lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House is now voting on Motion No. 158.
<P>
<B>(2040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the House would concur 
to apply the result just taken on the vote on report stage Motion 
No. 10 to report stage Motion No. 158 which is the one we are 
now dealing with. The votes appear prima facie at least to be 
identical. Perhaps the House could seek that and any member 
wishing to indicate otherwise could rise at that point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to have it 
recorded that I voted in favour of Motion No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am voting in favour of Motion 
No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the record to show 
that I am voting in favour of Motion No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am voting in favour of Motion No. 
158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am voting in favour of Motion 
No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the record to show that I 
am voting in favour of Motion No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to record my vote as 
being in favour of Motion No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> In favour, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, I vote yes on the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Verran:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am supporting the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Ur:</B> In favour, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> In favour, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make sure that my 
vote is recorded as a nay for Motion No. 158.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like it to be recorded 
that I am voting in favour of Motion No. 158.
<P>
	I think part of the problem is that the sheet the Speaker is 
using which has grouped the votes is not available to the 
members which may be slowing down the vote. Perhaps if the 
Speaker could give us the list of motions as they are in 
groupings, that would allow us to get the votes done a little 
quicker because we will be able to anticipate what the vote is 
going to be on.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Anything that would speed things up 
would be fine.
<P>

[<I>English</I>]

	The next question is on Motion No. 167.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I would like to put 
some order back into this evening's proceedings. This is at the 
prompting of some of the ministers of the crown on the front 
benches.
<P>
	I suggest we have a stand up vote on Motion 167 and we duly 
record everyone's wishes. I think it will follow what we have 
agreed to beforehand as the whips. If that is the case, then we can 
proceed with the applied votes and reverse applied if it works 
out that way.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Anything for order, I am sure we are all 
for that.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 4 defeated. 
Motions Nos. 6 and 154 are also therefore negatived.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 23.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 23 I am told only 
ensures that the French and English texts are the same. Perhaps 
you, Mr. Speaker, could ask if there are five members who 
actually desire a vote on this. If not, we could then deal with it 
accordingly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members have heard the words of the 
whip of the government. Are there five members who are 
concerned about this matter? It would seem not.
<P>
	All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	(Motion No. 23 agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The next question is on Motion No. 24.
<P>
	(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on 
the following division:)
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 24 negatived.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 28. A vote on Motion No. 
28 applies to Motions 29, 43, 49, 51, 60, 69, 71, 76, 79, 92, 95, 
100, 207, 215, 216, 218 and 225. An affirmative vote on Motion 
No. 28 obviates the necessity of putting the question on Motion 
No. 50. A negative vote on Motion No. 28 necessitates the 
question being put on Motion No. 50.
<P>
	All those in favour of Motion No. 28 will please rise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think you 
will find that Motion No. 76 should not be included in the 
grouping.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that acceptable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, in an effort to save time let me try 
again to see if there would be unanimous consent to apply the 
vote just taken on report stage Motion No. 24, in other words the 
last one, to report stage Motion No. 28, which is the one now 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members have heard the terms of the 
proposal. Is there unanimous consent to apply the vote just taken 
to the motion now before the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it understood that all of the motions 
that were indicated earlier would also be affected by the vote?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 261]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I declare Motion No. 28 
negatived. Therefore Motions Nos. 29, 43, 49, 51, 60, 69, 71, 76, 
79, 92, 95, 100, 207, 215, 216, 218, 225 are negatived.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the recent success, let 
me ask for unanimous consent to apply the vote taken on the last 
motion to Motions 50, 41, 42 and 45. They all stand in the name 
of the same hon. member.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I can try for a few more if the House is so 
disposed. We can also try to determine whether or not there is 
agreement to apply the same vote to report stage Motions Nos. 
87, 88, 8, 174, 187, 189, 191, 197, 199, 223, 134, 136, 146, 147,

A vote on this motion also applies to Motions Nos. 133, 173,

the necessity of the question being put on Motions Nos. 8, 9, 11,

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 182 agreed to.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 183.
<P>
	Before calling on the government whip, an affirmative vote 
on Motion No. 183 obviates the necessity of putting the question 
on Motions 187, 189 and 191. A negative vote on Motion No. 
183 necessitates the question being put on Motions 187, 189 and 
191.
<P>
<B>(2205 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
you could find unanimous consent to record the votes in the 
following way: Liberal members will be voting nay on this 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to record that I will 
be voting in favour of that amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Yea, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will vote nay on Motion No. 
183.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members will probably 
vote no except for those members who wish to vote otherwise.

voting yea on Motion No. 230.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motions Nos. 201 negatived. 
Consequently Motions Nos. 84 and 230 are negatived. The vote 
on Motion No. 230 applies to Motions Nos. 232, 234, 236, 238, 
242, 245, 248, 251 and 254.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you will find there is 
unanimous consent for members who voted on the previous 
motion to be recorded as voting as follows: Liberal members 
will vote nay on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the Bloc Quebecois

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on Motion No. 18, if you were to 
seek unanimous consent I think you would find that the Liberal 
members will be recorded as voting yea.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Members of the Bloc Quebecois will vote nay 
on this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members will vote yes, 
except for those members who wish to vote otherwise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor</B> Mr. Speaker, New Democrats would vote yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With respect to Motion No. 18 by 
unanimous consent it is so ordered, as was indicated by the 
whips.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 266</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The next question is on Motion No. 21. 
A vote on this motion also applies to Motions Nos. 22, 33, 34, 
36, 47, 57, 72, 74, 80, 89, 90, 171, 172, 227 and 261.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the Chair to determine 
whether five members wish to rise and ask for a recorded 
division. In other words, if the Chair would seek the yeas and 
nays, the Speaker might find that members do not wish a 
recorded vote on this motion for the same reason as the other 
item earlier today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
<B>(2220 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of clarification. 
These are all government amendments. I am in favour of them 
all except Motion No. 227 which would have the affect of 
overturning an amendment carried at committee. If I vote in 
favour of Motion No. 21 can I still vote against Motion No. 227, 
or am I precluded from doing so?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to permit 
the hon. member to vote as he has just outlined?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want to be noted as voting 
against Motion No. 227.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also like it to be recorded 
as voting against Motion No. 227.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also like to be recorded as 
voting against Motion No. 227.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recorded as voting 
against Motion No. 227 as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to be recorded as voting 
against Motion No. 227. Could I also record that I am in favour 
of Motion No. 102?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to record likewise 
with regard to Motion No. 227, that I would vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like clarification on the 
motion. We cannot find it and we do not know what it is. We 
would like it to be read, please.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13676"> 13676 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is Motion No. 21 in Group No 7. Mr. 
Rock, seconded by Mrs. Marleau, moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 9 of Bill C-68 be amended by striking out lines 14 to 21 on page 
10 and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``holder to acquire restricted firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does the hon. whip of the Reform Party want Motion No. 227 
read out as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understood the House to be 
voting on report stage Motion No. 21. Perhaps the Chair could 
just ask for the vote on Motion No. 21 and we will deal with it 
accordingly. The other motion is not even before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. whip of the Reform Party was 
going to consult. Does he have a further point he wishes to 
make?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is in favour of 
Motion No. 21 but we are against Motion No. 227 and I do not 
know why you have Motion No. 227 grouped with Motion No. 
21.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is a consequential ruling by the Chair 
that the vote would apply to Motion No. 227 as well, along with 
a number of others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of efficiency here I would 
like to clarify that the Reform Party members will vote yea on 
Motion No. 21 and nay on Motion No. 227.
<P>
<B>(2225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The Bloc members will vote in favour of 
Motion No. 21, but against Motion No. 227.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Are there any other permutations or 
combinations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, on Motion No. 21 New Democrats 
would vote yea, but I believe the whip of the government should 
be informing the House on why Motion No. 227 is not before the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The table officers who have been 
terrific will try to figure all that out and give us the count on 
Motions Nos. 21 and 227.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could 
you clarify whether we are also voting on Motion No. 227? If 
that is the case I should like to be recorded as being opposed to 
Motion No. 227.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I gather there is no consent to do what 
we have been trying to do for the last 15 minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is no consent to function 
as logically as we have just done, I would propose that the whips 
of each party indicate how the members of their respective 
parties will vote on Motion No. 21 and the subsequent motions 
and that the party whips be asked to indicate how their party will 
vote on Motion No. 227, more specifically.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The problem has been caused by the 
fact that in the confusion we were voting on Motion No. 21. The 
vote on Motion No. 21 also applies to about 15 other motions 
including Motion No. 227.
<P>
	Apparently the Table can figure out how we have all voted if 
the government and all the other party whips will permit us to do 
the calculation and come back with an answer. Is that 
acceptable?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is some difficulty with what 
is happening at this point.
<P>
	We were told that we were voting on report stage Motion No. 
21. I believe, if you were to seek it, you would find the 
respective whips would indicate that probably everyone is 
voting for that motion.
<P>
	However the difficulty is the following one. I believe the 
Chair is seeking, at the request of one member, to split the 
decision already taken by the Chair earlier today, which would 
have the effect of voting separately on Motion No. 227 and then 
on all the other motions grouped in that list of some 10 or 15 
motions indicated earlier by Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I never understood that we could split a decision made by the 
Chair. If the Chair could explain that to us we could proceed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point is one that I think can be 
accepted. The Chair has made a ruling that the vote on Motion 
No. 21 will apply to all the other ones.
<P>
	As the whip indicated, the hon. member for Scarborough West 
wished in effect to vote differently. However we are bound by 
the ruling of Mr. Speaker and therefore we will have to take a 
vote, I suppose on Motion No. 21, and it will be applied to all the 
others as indicated by the ruling of the Chair.
<P>
<B>(2230) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we could certainly quite 
reasonably follow a logic that does not stand up in order to 
follow procedure, because we support Motion No. 21 and the 
subsequent motions, except Motion No. 227. We could, 
therefore, battle over procedure, and all those watching us this 
evening would conclude that we are procedural experts rather 
than people who vote responsibly.
<P>
	I therefore suggest that the House decide unanimously to vote 
on Motion No. 21 and the others and to vote on Motion No. 227 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13677"> 13677 </A></B>
<P>
separately so we can do this a bit logically and so that people 
understand what we are doing here tonight.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, is there unanimous 
consent to vote on Motion No. 227 separately?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> So we will vote on this motion 
separately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, now that we have separated the 
two matters, I think you could ask the House whether five 
members wish to rise and ask for a recorded vote on the group of 
motions you have listed, with the exception of Motion No. 227, 
which we will vote on shortly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the motion of the 
government whip. Do five members wish to rise as indicated?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	As there are no nays, Motion No. 21 is adopted. Accordingly 
Motions Nos. 22, 33, 34, 36, 47, 57, 72, 74, 80, 89, 90, 171, 172 
and 261 are agreed to.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 227.
<P>
	(The House divided on Motion No. 227, which was agreed to 
on the following division:)
