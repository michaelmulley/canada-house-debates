</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present in both official languages the fourth report of 
the Standing Committee on Industry entitled “Productivity and 
Innovation: A Competitive and Prosperous Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Industry met with over 70 witnesses to 
discuss productivity, innovation and competitiveness.  I would 
like to thank everyone who participated in our extensive hearings 
and for sharing their insights with us.  I am confident that the 
public will agree that this report reflects both their concerns 
and common Canadian values and priorities in our ever evolving 
and productive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the committee I would also like to thank our clerk 
Richard Rumas, our researchers Daniel Shaw and Daniel Brassard 
and the interpreters and parliamentary staff for their 
assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the standing 
committee's report on productivity and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the committee did a good job in providing a 30 
year history of the decline in productivity and documenting our 
current situation in terms of our productivity fall.  However it 
failed to identify the underlying reasons for Canada's 
deteriorating productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes that the role played by public 
policy during this period is a significant factor that needed to 
be examined. We suggest that the fundamental shift in government 
policy in the late 1960s and 1970s created the conditions that 
led to Canada's decline in productivity and therefore we offered 
a dissenting opinion to that effect.

taking away political advantage for political donations.

respecting the creation of sanctuaries for endangered species of 
wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the situation right now with respect to 
endangered species in Canada is deplorable.  More than 300 
endangered species exist in our country but there has been a 
decline in habitat which is critically important for the 
existence of these species for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides for the species to be defined by a scientific 
group under the auspices of COSEWIC.  It provides for habitat 
protection by obligating the federal government to engage in 
negotiations with private land owners and provinces.  In the case 
that negotiations are unable to proceed further, the land can be 
taken over as a sanctuary, as long as the groups are compensated 
for the land at fair market value.  Finally, it provides that 
people who own lands that contain sensitive habitats for species 
can receive benefits under the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will go a long way in protecting our endangered 
species for future generations to enjoy.

petitions is on behalf of thousands and thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners indicate that there has been empirical evidence 
of the value of marriage as a cornerstone of public policy which 
produces tangible public benefits and that parliament has 
reaffirmed that marriage is and should remain the union of one 
man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.  However, the 
government has brought forth Bill C-23 which extends 
marriage-like benefits to same sex couples. Therefore the 
petitioners pray that parliament withdraw Bill C-23 before it is 
passed today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

subjects. The first petition is three separate ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, who are my constituents, are calling for 
parliament to withdraw Bill C-23.  They say that a bill which 
fails to define marriage in legislation as a union of one man and 
woman, a definition which was affirmed by the House on June 8, 
1999, is an inappropriate intrusion into the personal lives of 
Canadians and extends benefits only to a relationship of a sexual 
nature.  They would like the bill withdrawn.

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (for the Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-23, an act to 
modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to be here today to speak to Bill C-23, the 
modernization of benefits and obligations act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me thank my colleagues, the members of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, for their excellent work. 
I would also like to thank all the witnesses, the individuals and 
organizations that took the time to thoughtfully consider the 
bill and to either appear before the committee or to send in a 
brief on Bill C-23.  Their work is very important in this process 
and I want to thank them for their time and helpful 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 will amend 68 statutes to ensure that committed common 
law couples of the opposite sex and the same sex receive equal 
treatment under the law with regard to benefits and obligations. 
As the Minister of Justice has repeatedly said, the legislation 
is about tolerance and fairness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the bill we are achieving respect for the fundamental 
values inherent in our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
The government and the majority of Canadians believe that all 
common law couples in committed relationships should be treated 
in the same way.  Bill C-23 reflects this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a minute to review some of the more complex issues 
and misinformation that have arisen surrounding Bill C-23.  Some 
members of the House and some witnesses before the standing 
committee have suggested that Bill C-23 does not go far enough 
and that the benefits and obligations should be extended not to 
just same sex couples but to all people in relationships of 
dependency.  I would stress, however, that Bill C-23 does not 
preclude discussion which has already started on whether or how 
to acknowledge the nature and reality of the many types of 
dependent relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees that this is an important issue which 
deserves further attention.  It is for this reason that the 
Minister of Justice has already announced that the issue will be 
referred to a parliamentary subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the parliamentary subcommittee will be to examine 
four broad categories of questions.  First, should the Government 
of Canada reconsider the basis on which benefits and obligations 
are determined at present?  Second, what overall policy 
objectives for Canadian society should benefits and obligations 
support?  Third, if either economic dependency or economic 
emotional interdependency is the most appropriate basis on which 
to distribute benefits and impose obligations on Canadian 
society, how would it be defined and measured?  Fourth, should 
all benefits and obligations be distributed on this basis or only 
some where appropriate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions are highly conceptual and represent the first 
stage of this study which will set the framework and principles 
on which further study of the issue of dependency will be based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned in the committee hearings, the Law Commission 
of Canada has been studying the issue of dependency and 
interdependency for some time and expects to release a public 
issues paper on these questions in the early summer of this year. 
Work on these broader, important questions is real and is 
progressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broader issue of dependency is complex and separate from the 
issue dealt with in Bill C-23.  I realize that many are 
frustrated with what they see as further delay on this related 
but separate question.  However the government firmly believes 
that it is premature and irresponsible to extend benefits and, 
more particularly, to impose obligations on these broader 
dependent relationships without careful consideration of all the 
implications for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some federal statutes already extend benefits and 
obligations to people in dependent relationships, we need to know 
more.  We need to know about the financial cost, any possible 
downsides for elderly and disabled individuals and whether 
Canadians would even be prepared to take on legal obligations for 
their relatives and others before we could determine whether it 
would be appropriate to include such relationships in all laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of adult Canadians currently reside with elderly 
parents, siblings or other relatives.  Extending benefits and 
obligations to people involved in all these forms of 
relationships would have far-reaching consequences for 
individuals and society as a whole.  While benefits which reflect 
dependency would likely be welcomed, it is unclear whether the 
accompanying legal obligations should be imposed on individuals 
or those relatives with whom they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, eligibility for the guaranteed income supplement 
under the Old Age Security Act is determined on the basis of 
combining the income of both persons, which might result in 
reducing benefits for some elderly persons who live with adult 
children or other relatives.  As another example, if an adult 
lives with his or her elderly parent for many years and then 
leaves to marry, this extension might result in a situation where 
the Canada pension plan credit would be split between the parent 
and the child as it would now following a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premature changes may have unexpected results.  Government must 
be careful and responsible with any changes so that the system 
encourages rather than discourages people taking care of each 
other.  We must be careful to ensure that any legal changes would 
not impose obligations which accidentally act as barriers to 
people supporting each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the more complex issues surrounding the broader questions 
of dependent relationships need to be worked out, this work 
cannot be allowed to delay further the issues dealt with in Bill 
C-23.  The Law Commission of Canada stated before the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However much we believe the need for parliament ultimately to 
strive for its legislative “best”, we also believe that there 
are times, and this is one of them, when it should proceed to 
enact what is, constitutionally, a legislative “good”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have also claimed that Bill C-23 will destroy 
the institution of marriage or result in adoption by same sex 
couples.  The Minister of Justice has repeatedly stated that the 
bill is not about marriage.  It is about equal treatment under 
federal law for all common law couples, whether of the opposite 
sex or the same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the government has been responsive to the concerns 
of many Canadians, including some in my riding who needed 
reassurance that the fundamental institution of marriage would 
not be altered in any way by the bill.  I proposed an amendment 
at committee stage to give this reassurance to Canadians. 
Subclause 1.1 of Bill C-23 now states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, the amendments made by this act do not 
affect the meaning of the word marriage, that is, the lawful 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This answers the many questions which have been presented here 
today in the petitions.  Although some have claimed this does not 
have any legal effect, I and others on this side disagree.  The 
amendment to the bill is a clear statement of the intention of 
the government that the legal meaning of marriage remain the same 
as it always has been in the history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the claims that the bill will result in adoption 
by same sex partners, I wish to point out again that adoption is 
decided under the laws of the provinces.  It is provincial law. 
The references to adoption in Bill C-23 are there to ensure that 
children adopted in accordance with provincial law will be 
included in federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one aspect of Bill C-23 which has not received much 
attention in the debates but which I believe is important.  Bill 
C-23 amends several federal statutes to ensure that children are 
not discriminated against, both by including references to 
adopted children in those few statutes which do not already do so 
and by removing the last remaining reference to illegitimacy to 
ensure that all children are included in the federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been a series of conflicting remarks from the 
other side:  first, that the government is only putting the bill 
forward because the courts have forced the government's hand over 
the objections of Canadians and, second, that the bill is 
unnecessary as it goes beyond what the Supreme Court of Canada 
has required.  Let me respond by saying that the government 
brought forward the bill at this time because it is the right 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have a duty to represent the interests of all its 
citizens whether they belong to the mainstream or, perhaps even 
more important, when they represent a minority group.  I am 
pleased to represent a political party which believes as one of 
its central policies that governments have a duty to safeguard 
the interests of both the majority and the minorities which make 
up the face of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1999 the Supreme Court of Canada in its ruling in M. v H. 
said that governments could not continue to discriminate against 
same sex common law couples by denying them the benefits and 
obligations granted to opposite sex common law couples.  All 
unmarried common law couples, both opposite sex and same sex, 
must have access to the same benefits and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, although the decision of the supreme court set out the 
road map by identifying that same sex common law couples must be 
included, which is its proper role under the constitution, it 
remains up to parliament to decide how the law must be changed to 
provide that equal treatment.  That is why the approach in Bill 
C-23 is both a responsible and a balanced one which deliberately 
maintains a clear legal distinction between married and common 
law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the courts have told us and what the bill addresses is that 
common law relationships should be given equal treatment in the 
law, whether they are opposite sex common law couples or same sex 
common law couples.  The bill uses clear language to maintain the 
term spouse for married couples and to introduce the new term 
common law partner for both opposite sex and same sex unmarried 
relationships.  By doing so it preserves the legal distinction 
between married relationships and unmarried conjugal 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of a legislative action such as the bill the 
courts will continue to address cases in a piecemeal fashion, 
focusing on the very narrow issues brought before them.  The 
status quo is not an option.  It promises confusion, unfairness, 
and continuing and costly litigation.  Equally important, it runs 
the unacceptable risk of making the courts the arbiters of social 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have on final issue.  The proposed amendments to the Judges 
Act contained in Bill C-23 were referred to the Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission for consideration and 
recommendation pursuant to the Judges Act. 
I am pleased to advise that this independent and constitutionally 
mandated commission has now informed the government that it 
supports the Judges Act amendments which are consistent with the 
amendments to the other statutes included in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its reporting letter, which was tabled in the House on March 
30, the commission observed that the proposed amendments to the 
Judges Act represent an appropriate response to the issues 
surrounding survivor annuity benefits.  It is noted in particular 
that the apportionment rules provide a satisfactory basis for 
resolving any conflicts in those few instances where there may be 
more than one survivor, a legally married separated spouse and 
subsequent common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most significant is the commission's observation that 
the proposed amendments are important and timely to ensure 
compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
its recommendations that the amendments be passed without delay. 
We are grateful to the commission for its careful consideration 
of these issues and for the timely delivery of its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill is about equality and respect.  Bill 
C-23 provides a responsible and balanced approach to correct 
longstanding discrimination against same sex couples and to 
ensure equal treatment for common law couples of the same sex and 
opposite sex while preserving the fundamental importance of 
marriage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to join in the debate on third reading of 
Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity, as the bill has moved through the 
House and through committee, to speak to the bill four times.  I 
do not think it would serve the House or yourself, Mr. Speaker, 
to go over too much of the ground that has already been covered 
at some length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> shows in some detail the 10 very 
strong reasons why the official opposition felt, and made strong 
arguments in fact, that Bill C-23 should be withdrawn.  We laid 
that out for the House and we put forward amendments to improve 
the bill.  Unfortunately last night, with the exception of a few 
on the other side, those amendments to improve the bill were 
jettisoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the member opposite talked about the definition 
of marriage that is in Bill C-23 which has been added due to 
public pressure by the justice minister.   Yes, we are thankful 
that that amendment was put in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What troubles us is that the definition of common law partners, 
which this bill now defines as any two people, same sex or 
otherwise, who live together for one year in a conjugal 
relationship, is continually defined in every statute throughout 
Bill C-23 repeatedly.  Yet, to place a definition of marriage and 
spouse in those same statutes is something the Liberals have 
refused to do.  They put it at the front end of a bill where it 
will not appear in any statute anywhere.  When someone pulls the 
Income Tax Act off the shelf or the Pension Beneficiaries Act or 
any of these acts, there is no definition of marriage there, but 
there definitely is a definition of common law partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our amendments we asked that the government actually make 
this definition of marriage substantive and have legal effect 
because there are court cases coming that will challenge the 
definition of marriage.  It is our position that if we are going 
to put it in law, let us put it in law.  That was our argument, 
to put it right in the statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Liberals have elected to leave it out of the 
statutes and put it in a place whereby, in the expert legal 
opinion of Mr. David Brown, a lawyer from Toronto with the firm 
of Stikeman Elliott who reviewed legal precedents and textbooks 
on this very matter, the way the government did it would have 
little to no legal effect when these cases come forward as 
opposed to the approach that the Canadian Alliance put forward, 
which would substantively place the definition of marriage in 
Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that so important?  It is important because it would send 
a clear signal to the courts on behalf of the Canadian people 
that marriage should remain the union of a man and a woman to the 
exclusion of all other definitions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is troubling that the government would put forward an 
amendment to appease the concerns of Canadians.  We have heard 
here in this House from the petitions, thousands of them now, 
probably over the 10,000 mark that have come forward in a short 
period of time on this bill.  It is of concern to us that the 
government would attempt to appease those concerned Canadians 
with an amendment to Bill C-23 that really is for show only.  As 
the member for Scarborough East referred to it, the Liberal 
member in fact, it is a ghost amendment, a ghost bill which is 
going to float out there but will not have any real effect. 
Canadians are thinking that it will, but they have been misled by 
this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been more sincere for the government to actually 
have adopted the amendments that the Canadian Alliance put 
forward to have the definition of marriage put in the statutes. 
It is troubling that it has misled the Canadian people and those 
petitioners to think that something substantive has been done 
when in fact it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a number of significant problems with this bill that 
are going to cause it to be very troublesome in its 
implementation and to which I have made reference before.  One of 
the key areas is this term that the government has added in the 
definition of common law partners.  In fact, it is the criterion 
for qualifying for all these benefits that we currently apply to 
marriage and family.  The single criterion for same sex couples 
now is that they live in a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, it is a term.  There are all kinds of terms in legislation 
but, normally, when that occurs, there is some definition of the 
term so that it is made clear to those looking at the statutes or 
the legislation passed by this House who qualifies or who does 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly asked for a definition to be included in Bill 
C-23.  The government has refused to do that.  In committee and 
otherwise, it has answered by saying the courts know what a 
conjugal relationship is.  What kind of answer is that?   That 
answer says that the courtroom is going to be the determining 
place for people to to get a ruling whether or not they actually 
are in a relationship that qualifies for all these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think how inappropriate that is.  Here we have two 
individuals who are living together, assuming they are in a 
conjugal relationship and later finding out that they are not or 
vice versa, assuming they are not and later finding out that they 
are.  The confusion, the court cases, the challenges, what 
happens to the benefits, the obligations upon death, all these 
questions are left unclear by this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What troubles me the most is that members opposite, good 
members, members that have children of their own and families, or 
that are married, know that this is a fundamental flaw in this 
bill.  They know it.  Yet, last night we saw that on the report 
stage amendments, in spite of knowing that there are these 
fundamental weaknesses with this bill, the members are going to 
follow the edict of the Prime Minister and the cabinet and vote 
for a bill that is so tragically flawed.  That is what troubles 
me more, that good men and women would not stand up for what they 
know is right, stand against what they know is wrong and fulfill 
the obligations they made to their constituents a few years ago 
when they were elected to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time we have seen the Liberal government 
move in a direction that is directed to them by either the courts 
or lobby groups.  There has been a litany of decisions that have 
been made by this Liberal government that have impacted the 
Canadian family in a detrimental way.  I cannot use any other 
word, except that the policies of the Liberal government are 
actually working against the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me review some of those.  I think it is in keeping with Bill 
C-23 because it points out that there is a trend here that is 
consistent in this current Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, a statement made in the House a year 
or so ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance that parents who stay at home do not work as hard as 
those in the workplace.  That caused a big kerfuffle across the 
nation.  Families from across the nation and those who care for 
children at home spoke out.  There were retractions resulting in 
all kinds of activity, and then questions about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, because of the public pressure and because of motions 
that were brought forward by the Canadian Alliance that addressed 
the inequity and the tax treatment of stay at home parents or 
single income families, the finance minister was forced to launch 
a special committee to look at tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special committee sat for a number of months, had witnesses 
appear, as is the normal committee process, and produced a report 
that said there were some fundamental inequities in the way that 
tax treatment is applied to families that actually made it more 
difficult for parents to spend time with their children.  It 
actually provided incentives for just the opposite, for parents 
to put their children in institutionalized care and enter into 
the workplace.  It made recommendations that that should change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we saw the budget.  The recommendations in that 
report were not included.  We went through the whole report 
process.  We went through recommendations from the special 
committee to address the anti-family tax policies of the 
Liberals.  There were some good recommendations, but nothing was 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about another situation.  This issue is by far the 
number one issue for petitions that the House has seen in the 
whole 36th Parliament, far greater than any other issue that has 
hit the floor of the House.   Many people who have never been 
involved in the political process were motivated to get involved 
on the one issue.  We are approaching over half a million 
signatures.  I think we may see one million on this before it is 
over.  Petitions are still coming in to my office in stacks. 
People listening may recognize the fact that this was the 
grievous ruling of a court in B.C. that struck down the 
illegality of possession of child pornography.  Just the term 
turns your stomach.  Petitioners across the country are crying 
out to have this reversed and the law upheld to make it illegal 
to possess this material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance brought a motion to the floor of the House 
which was initially supported by some 70 members opposite. It 
asked the government to use the notwithstanding clause to uphold 
the law and not let the court strike down a law that protected 
children and made this kind of grievous material illegal. 
Unfortunately, only four of the members opposite stuck to their 
convictions.  The rest reneged on their commitment and voted with 
the whip vote pressured on them by the Prime Minister.  The 
motion we put forward to uphold the law to protect children was 
struck down again by the Liberals.  They deferred it and said 
“Let us leave this to the courts.  We will appeal it.  It will 
all be solved in a month or two”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know how long ago that was?   It is almost a year and 
a half since the court struck down the law that made the 
possession of child pornography illegal in B.C.  What has 
happened in that time?   Cases have been delayed.  Prosecutions 
have not proceeded.  The B.C. case is being referenced in other 
provinces and has impacted prosecutions on this issue.  It is a 
year and a half later and still nothing has been resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the tool in the House to resolve that.  We had the tool 
in the notwithstanding clause.  It is part of the charter, not 
separate.  It is there to be used.  But, rather than use a tool 
that they had, a legal, legislative, charter tool, they chose not 
to do it, to defer to the courts, to put children at risk and 
make this grievous material legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end.  Bill C-23 is part of a consistent trend we 
see from the Liberal government. 
Here is another one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on a joint Senate and Commons committee that was struck 
after great public pressure and concern about the issue of family 
law, the divorce act and custody and access because the approach 
taken by the courts and the guidelines put in place by the 
Liberal government are not working.  They are not working for 
people when it comes to issues of custody, access and support 
when there is marital breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Largely through the pressure of one senator in particular the 
committee was launched and I had the privilege of sitting on it. 
The government spent about $600,000 to finance the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travelled the country and heard from Canadians from coast to 
coast.  They shared painful stories about how their relationships 
had broken down and they had been driven into the courtrooms. 
Sometimes it seemed as if the legal profession had actually made 
the situation worse.  Both sides in some disputes were spending 
all their money and going into debt trying to resolve their 
family conflicts.  Children were caught in the middle. Sometimes 
the testimony was painful.  A couple of times the interpreters 
who travelled with us had to leave the interpretation booth 
because they were in tears.  They could not interpret any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lots of money was spent and lots of testimony was heard.  It was 
a year of hard work by a large committee.  The final result was a 
report with some good and implementable recommendations, many 
with which the official opposition agreed. Our dissenting report 
was very short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response of the Liberal government when it got the 
report?  Was it going to implement the report?  Was it a priority 
for the government? The response of the justice minister of the 
day was to say the government wanted to look at it further and it 
would probably take another three years before any action was 
taken. That tells Canadians it is not a priority to solve that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-23 what is the government communicating to Canadians 
as its number one priority?  Bill C-23 has seen closure at second 
reading after four hours of debate.  It had three and a half days 
in committee and many people who wanted to appear before the 
committee were excluded.  There is closure at third reading now. 
The bill is being been rushed through the House and it affects 68 
statutes and fundamentally changes some of our social norms and 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not act on the custody and access report and 
it still has not.  I still get letters from people who are 
concerned about when they will see family law reform that was 
recommended in the report generated by the joint Senate and 
Commons committee on custody and access.  What can I tell them? I 
tell them to continue to write to the justice minister and let 
her know their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately I do not hold out much hope because the party 
opposite gives lip service to children.  Once in a while it 
mentions the word family.  There was a lot of reference to family 
and children in the throne speech but when it comes to 
implementing things that help families retain the money they 
earn, to protect children, that help marriages succeed, the 
government is not there.  It does not deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On justice issues, there is the Young Offenders Act. Who has 
been the voice pressuring for changes to the YOA?  The official 
opposition.  A member of our party from B.C. brought forward a 
number of significant amendments and pressured the government to 
move. Finally we see some movement although there is some concern 
that again a lot of it is window dressing and substantive changes 
are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see cases where the government allows parole to be given to 
known sex offenders. They are being released into our 
communities. 
Families and communities are not aware of the potential danger on 
their streets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can continue with more items from my list but the message I 
want to get across to the House is that there is a litany of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
have been listening to the member and he seems to be drifting off 
the issue that is before us.  He is drifting all over the map and 
I hope that he will get to the issue that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre is working his way to the bill that is before the 
House.  He apparently is of the view that there are issues 
surrounding the bill and government action on a number of fronts 
that are important and connected with the bill. I think he is 
making that point.  I know he is soon going to be discussing the 
provisions of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are exactly correct as 
usual.  I am tying together all the examples I have presented in 
the House and I could present more.  In deference to the member 
opposite who is concerned that I may be straying, I will limit 
myself and not go on with the many examples that I could show of 
the anti-family approach of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with what Mr. Speaker said, I am trying to get 
through to the member opposite that his party has an approach in 
taxation, in protecting children, in law reform and in family law 
that consistently undermines the strength of the Canadian family. 
I am asking the member to consider that these policies need to be 
reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada should promote policies that send a 
message of the important work that parents do. They are raising 
the next generation.  They are instilling values, character and 
integrity in the lives of the future citizens of this country, 
the next generation.  Public policy must send them a message that 
they are doing the most important work in the nation. The most 
important work in the nation is parenting the next generation. 
Unfortunately the anti-family approach of the Liberal government 
is undermining that. The official opposition repeatedly has 
brought forward policy initiatives that are intended exactly to 
reverse that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons we are concerned about Bill C-23. 
Apparently the number one priority of the Liberal government is 
to extend benefits to same sex couples, even in light of the 
concern about fair family taxation that has been presented to the 
House.  We have received petition after petition not just with 
Bill C-23, but prior to Bill C-23.  For years people across 
Canada have been asking the government and the House to define 
marriage in legal statute, not leave it subject to the common law 
whims of the courts, but to define it clearly in statute, not 
like it has done in Bill C-23 as a ghost law, but right in the 
actual statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have petitioned the House about child pornography, 
family law reform and so on.  The official opposition has asked 
for a shared parenting approach in custody and access. We have 
asked for the use of the notwithstanding clause of the charter to 
protect children.  We even brought forward improvements to the 
Young Offenders Act to protect children from violent young 
offenders and to put the non-violent offenders into good remedial 
treatment, to get them back on the street with appropriate 
reforms put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consistently said to leave the dollars and the choices 
in the pockets of the parents when it comes to child rearing 
instead of taking them away. I sit on another committee of the 
House that deals with children and youth at risk.  That committee 
is proposing a $7.8 billion national daycare program.  Whose 
money is funding that national daycare program?  It is the 
dollars earned by mothers and fathers trying to rear their 
families.  They may not want to have access to a national daycare 
program, but they are going to pay for it anyway with the Liberal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not just leave that money with the parents?  If they choose 
to use daycare for their situation, fine.  If they choose to have 
a loving relation, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle, that is their 
option.  If they choose to stay at home and make do with perhaps 
a little less income, that is okay too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the Liberal government says it is going to tax a 
single income family making $50,000 a year 100% more than a dual 
income family, 100% more. It is forcing families for financial 
need to spend less time with their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 does deal with marriage.  The union of a man and a 
woman is the foundation for the family.  There are six million 
marriages in Canada today.  We talk about the high divorce rate. 
Of the six million marriages, every year only about 2% of them 
divorce and 98% say it is working pretty well for them and they 
are going to stay together for another year. Seventy-five per 
cent of all children are currently being raised in Canada within 
those marriages.  It is an institution that works and it is an 
institution that Canadians do not really want to see changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern with the bill as I said at the beginning is that 
number one, marriage should be defined clearly in the statutes. 
The government refuses to do that.  It has put it in a ghost 
location in the bill where it really will not have any effect 
even in spite of all the petitions.  Number two, the government 
has set it up with a definition of conjugal that is undefined in 
the legislation and fundamentally will drive people into the 
courts to have the state intrude into assessing whether a private 
relationship qualifies or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two big flaws in the bill.  There are others but those 
are the key ones that have us concerned that it will not work. 
Ultimately this will not work. It will be a windfall for lawyers 
and judges in driving people into the courts, but it is not 
really going to achieve the government's objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond all that, those people who may have an economic 
dependency or may be caring for one another in some way but would 
never dream of having a conjugal relationship, if that means some 
sort of physical intimacy or a sexual relationship, are excluded. 
There is all this rhetoric about addressing discrimination, yet 
the government excludes people who have all kinds of dependencies 
and close personal but not physical relations.  They are 
excluded.  If that is not discriminatory, I do not know what is. 
We play word games sometimes in the House.  We all know it. That 
is one of the big problems we have with Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other things I need to bring forward on Bill 
C-23. Of all the concerns I have presented about the litany of 
anti-family policies that have been brought forward by the 
Liberal government on all fronts including Bill C-23, and in all 
the pro-family initiatives we have brought forward on taxation 
and protecting children and so on, this is what is troubling most 
of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite are aware that we have brought forward 
legitimate concerns.  They agree with some of the things we have 
brought forward.  They have told me privately, “I agree with 
you, but what can I do?” They know that some of the things they 
are being told they must vote for are wrong.  I see them working 
hard to rationalize and find some to appease their conscience and 
say that what they are voting for is actually okay. They twist 
and turn and look for any kind of rhetoric from the legal 
bureaucracy to give them reasons for taking the position they do. 
Ultimately they know what they are voting for is wrong.  They 
know it does not work for families.  They know it will not 
strengthen the Canadian family.  A lot of these initiatives and 
policies will actually work against the Canadian family in the 
long run.  What troubles me is that they know it but they will 
not stand up and do the right thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also troubles a lot of Canadians right across the country. 
This is the reason why Canadians are frustrated with politicians. 
I have seen surveys that have asked Canadians which profession 
they trust the most.  These professions included lawyers, doctors 
and other types of professions.  Do members know which profession 
has the lowest rating of public trust?  Politicians are down near 
the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can joke and laugh about that and say it is funny but what is 
this all about?  We are here to serve the Canadian people.  We 
should be the people exhibiting integrity and character as an 
example to our children.  We should exemplify the values that 
inspire the youth of our nation but that is not what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make fun of or mock the role of elected office, whether 
it is the prime minister's office or the leader of the 
opposition's office, it is like tearing down our own house.  It 
does not strengthen our nation.  It actually undermines the 
respect that we have for the institutions that are in place 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the members opposite to think about all the 
anti-family policies they have brought forward and the message 
they are sending with these policies that work against the 
strengthening of the Canadian family.  They have an obligation to 
send a message to Canadians that certain things are important. 
There are verifiable facts and empirical data that show that 
marriage works for kids.  It is not too much more complicated 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has forced closure on this bill.  I think 
this is the 62nd time that closure has been invoked by the 
Liberals to limit debate.  Tragically, 68 statutes will be 
affected by this bill and we will only have one day of debate at 
third reading. When they vote on this bill tonight, which gives 
every benefit and obligation to same sex partners, which is 
currently reserved for marriage and family, I hope they think 
about whether this is a number one priority and whether this is 
the message they want to send to the young people of Canada, the 
next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In surveys and studies that I have seen reported in the press, 
90% of young people say that their number one priority is family 
and the development of family relationships.  When members 
opposite vote tonight will they be sending the right message? 
Are we sending them the message that we agree with them when we 
vote on the bill tonight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that voting for Bill C-23 sends the right message 
at all.  It sends a very confusing message.  I invite every 
member of the House to think about the obligations they have 
taken on and the commitments they have made to their constituents 
who put them here.  I invite them to think about the bill and the 
message they will send to Canadian youth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what I have said here today, I feel compelled to 
close my talk this morning by moving an amendment to give all 
members of the House another chance.  I move, seconded by the 
hon. member for Elk Island, the following amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK47">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in 
relation to benefits and obligations, be not now read a third 
time but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights for the purpose of examining the feasibility of 
adding a definition of marriage to all relevant clauses of the 
bill so as to have the effect of adding the definition to each 
act being amended by the bill such that the definition will carry 
significant legal force and effect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
hon. member for Calgary Centre's voice trailed down a bit when he 
was reading the motion that I seconded.  I want to make sure that 
the official record shows that the words are “be not now read a 
third time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is correct.  Those 
are the words of the amendment. The question is on the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to rise to speak on this bill on a day that I 
have no hesitation in calling historic.  This is, in fact, a 
long-awaited day, one which will allow us to enjoy full equality 
with all other workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before addressing the substance of the bill, what I believe the 
lawyers call positive law—my colleague, the hon. member for 
Chambly, will correct me if that is not the correct term—I would 
like to begin by thanking, by name, the public servants who 
assisted us in committee: Michelle Gosselin, Stan Farber, Lisa 
Hitch, Sharon Colbert, Janet McIntyre, who was always there for 
us and whose help was greatly appreciated, and Valérie Lasher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, it is not commonplace for the 
opposition to express thanks to the government, but I believe 
that it is appropriate, given the significance of this bill, as 
we will never stop saying.  This is a restorative bill, one 
which will remedy decades of injustice toward the homosexual 
community, and we must rise above partisan differences to thank 
the government for having had the courage to introduce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-23 is a yardstick by which to measure our 
society's progress along the path of tolerance.  Not very long 
ago, in 1994 when I was a new MP, full of energy, enthusiasm, and 
idealism, which incidentally I have never lost, I introduced a 
very similar bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill likewise proposed to amend all federal laws containing 
a heterosexual definition of spouse to include a homosexual one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time in 1994 only 52 members supported the bill and 
only a single member of cabinet, the then Minister of the 
Environment and Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. member for 
Hamilton East, did so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, things have changed considerably.  There was considerable 
dialogue between parliamentarians and the gay community, as well 
as all those who believe in equality. 
I would also mention the extremely important role played by the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission, which, since 1979, has 
signalled discrimination against members of the gay community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to thank the various spokespersons of 
gay associations, such as EGALE, and its executive director, 
John Fisher.  This national group has for many years actively 
supported equality for gays and lesbians.  It is associated with 
various cases that have come before the supreme court or lower 
courts, such as the Rosenberg and the Egan-Nesbit cases and, 
closer to home, the matter of M and H. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the people of Quebec, whose voice was extremely 
important in the debate. 
I am thinking naturally of Laurent McCutcheon and the coalition 
he heads so well. This coalition combines unions, such as the 
CEQ, and community groups.  I also want to thank the people in 
Quebec City, including Claudine Ouellet, who appeared before the 
parliamentary committee and very eloquently made the case for 
the need for such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, who, 
on a number of occasions in caucus, permitted me to make 
presentations and were always most patient.  We know that in 
politics we do not all start from the same point.  We have to be 
prepared to convince people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wager we made as parliamentarians, in the Bloc Quebecois and 
in the other parties, is that we will not constrain, but 
convince. 
We made it because we know that words, ideas and values are 
important in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give myself credit for being patient and having worked on this 
for a long time.  This evening, I believe that we will not be 
disappointed and that a very large number of parliamentarians 
will work for full equality. When the Speaker rises and puts the 
question, many members will support the government's initiative 
on Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the member for Burnaby—Douglas, who is, as 
members know, one of my friends.  In a way, he was a forerunner 
and paved the way. 
He too has shown considerable perseverance. I believe that for 
this evening's results we will owe him a debt of gratitude not 
just for persevering but for being extremely present in all the 
debates on the equality of rights of gays and lesbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note of thanks, let us move to the heart of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we must recall that the bill before us is one that 
is eminently respectful of earlier court rulings.  I will, if I 
may, give a brief background of the gay and lesbian community's 
quest for the equality that the present government proposes to 
grant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1979 that the Canadian Human Rights Commission first 
mentioned that sexual orientation should be included in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognition of same sex couples means recognition of the 
emotional relationships openly engaged in by homosexuals. First, 
we had to stop discriminating on an individual basis.  That is 
why the first court challenge involved including sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want those people to clearly understand that the Canadian 
Human Rights Act is different from the charter. The charter is 
part of the Constitution; it is the supreme law of the land. It 
was adopted in 1982 under conditions that we all know and that 
today's day of celebration prevent me from describing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, the Canadian Human Rights Act is an act of 
parliament. It protects those who receive federal services or 
who work in a jurisdiction that comes under the federal 
government. I am thinking of course about banks, 
telecommunications, postal services and all the other federal 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, in Haig v Canada, the Ontario court of appeal ruled 
that it was discriminatory and contrary to section 15 of the 
charter to not recognize sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination. At the time, a decision which could 
have been binding in Ontario alone was extended to the whole 
country. Thanks to Kim Campbell, the then Minister of Justice—whom 
we remember with fondness—that ruling was made binding 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came Bill C-33. I was here when parliament passed it in 
1993. The then Minister of Justice, the hon. Allan Rock, 
introduced a bill to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, so as 
to comply with the ruling issued by the Ontario court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, a long series of cases were heard by various 
courts. 
There were administrative tribunals, judicial tribunals, which 
declared that it was discriminatory for the workplace not to 
recognize same sex partners in collective agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another extremely important case is the 1995 case, initiated in 
1993, of Nesbit-Egan v Canada.  This one needs particular 
attention because the supreme court judgment in this case is 
what has led to our now needing to read section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as including sexual 
orientation among the prohibited grounds for discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a quick overview of the case that was brought before 
the supreme court.  Jim Egan and John Nesbit had lived together 
for more than 40 years.  Public opinion is sometimes prejudiced. 
People think that homosexuals who enter into couple 
relationships are not always stable people capable of long term 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not familiar with your personal life, Mr. Speaker, but just 
think, here we are dealing with two people who have shared each 
others' lives for more than 40 years.  That is nothing to be 
sneezed at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to inform my colleagues that one of them died about a 
month ago, and his loss was a heavy blow to the gay community. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Nesbit sought a spousal allowance under the Old Age Security 
Act.  This allowance is usually provided under the law when the 
partner of the pensioner is between 60 and 65 years old and the 
couple's total income is less than a given amount, which is 
adjusted annually.  The government denied Mr. Nesbit this 
allowance on the pretext that the definition of spouse in the 
law applied only to couples of persons of the opposite sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nesbit-Egan couple therefore applied to the federal court to 
have it declare the definition of spouse appearing in the Old 
Age Security Act discriminatory on the basis of sexual 
preferences and an infringement of the right to equality 
guaranteed by section 15.  Their application was denied by the 
trial level court.  The decision was appealed to the federal 
court, and the application was again denied.  In legal annals, 
one must really persevere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the denial was that the definition of spouse was 
not discriminatory under section 15.  That is what the federal 
court said.  The court said it denied the spousal allowance 
because there was no conjugal relationship rather than because 
of their sexual orientation. 
The court ruled that the distinction between conjugal and 
non-conjugal relationships flowing from the definition was not 
the kind of distinction that went beyond the limits and 
constituted discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case went to the supreme court and, in an extremely tight 
decision, it replied to three questions.  The important thing 
about this decision is that it ruled that section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms should be read to 
include sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting because, already in 1982—the year the 
Constitution was patriated and certain aspects of the 
Constitution were rewritten, not always fairly with respect to 
Quebec, but that is another matter—people wanted sexual 
orientation included as a prohibited ground. 
Who was the Minister of Justice at the time?  It was the current 
Prime Minister, who dismissed this entirely legitimate concern. 
Those who believed that this kind of discrimination would not be 
tolerated by the courts turned out to be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the Rosenberg case, where the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada challenged the provisions of the Income Tax Act, which 
did not allow same sex spouses to register retirement savings 
plans in each other's name or to receive survivor's pensions and 
allowances.  That was discriminatory treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the courts were extremely receptive and struck down 
the provisions of the act which did not allow this recognition. 
The government was asked to change the law, and this led to Bill 
C-78. The Rosenberg case triggered an important change in the 
Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill now before us is in direct response to the 
supreme court. This is why I cannot agree with Canadian Alliance 
members. Generally speaking, and I say this in all friendship, I 
tend to make a point of not agreeing with them. Canadian 
Alliance members are not too open-minded when it comes to human 
rights. We will recall that they voted against Bill C-33, which 
amended the Canadian Human Rights Act. They also voted against 
my private member's bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They opposed Bill C-68, specifically with respect to the 
recognition of surviving spouse's pension. Today, they are 
opposing Bill C-23. It should be known that the type of society 
that the Canadian Alliance is advocating is one where 
homosexuals would not be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people openly wish to maintain discrimination. They are 
hypocrites. They talk out of both sides of their mouths. Let us 
be clear: there are people on the Canadian Alliance side who are 
homophobic. 
Whenever they had the opportunity to trample or reject the 
rights of homosexuals, they did so as a monolithic block, with a 
single voice and guided by intolerance, by unanimously voting 
against the widely recognized interests of the gay community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in a democracy, we have to accept the fact that such 
people get elected. They get elected by their respective groups 
of voters, and this is why I respect them. But the Bloc 
Quebecois and myself will never endorse the type of society that 
the Canadian Alliance hopes to build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some day we will live in a sovereign Quebec. I hope for the rest 
of Canada that it is never led by the Canadian Alliance. Imagine 
what Canada would be, with or without Quebec, if, some day, the 
Canadian Alliance were to form the government. 
What guarantees could we, all those who believe in individual 
equality, have with respect to equality of treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on my knowledge of the rest of Canada, I believe Canadians 
outside Quebec are far too generous, far too open, far too 
sensible to trust the members of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this bill before us is directly dictated by a supreme 
court decision that was brought down on May 20, 1999, eight to 
one.  Anyone familiar with the supreme court knows very well 
that this is an extremely solid decision, and an extremely 
significant one.  An eight-to-one Supreme Court decision is rather 
exceptional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>M. v H. was about two lesbians who had lived together for a few 
years. 
Before they separated, they had built up a business together and 
acquired business capital.  Under section 29 of the Family Law 
Act, one of the women demanded support.  This support payment 
was not allowed, because the wording of the act called for 
support to be paid to a partner of the opposite sex.  A whole 
process of court challenges then ensued, beginning with the 
Ontario court of first instance and ending with the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  In my opinion, the finding in M. v H. is the 
most significant as far as human rights are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was its finding?  It found that Common law relationships 
are conjugal relationships, which must be considered as such 
regardless of whether the couple concerned is homosexual or 
heterosexual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court first of all was giving recognition to common 
law relationships, and furthermore recognized the absolute 
equality there must be between partners in a common law 
relationship, whether they are homosexual or heterosexual in 
orientation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue by citing two rather long paragraphs I 
feel constitute the quintessence, the very structure, the main 
thrust of the supreme court judgment.  Out of respect for our 
interpreters, I shall read them very slowly so that they do not 
miss anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court made the following statement in defining 
spouses as set out in section 29 of the Family Law Act. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, the definition...extends the obligation to 
provide spousal support...beyond married persons to include 
individuals in conjugal opposite-sex relationships of some 
permanence....Same-sex relationships are capable of being both 
conjugal and lengthy, but individuals in such relationships are 
nonetheless denied access to the court-enforced system of support 
provided by the FLA. This differential treatment is on the basis 
of a personal characteristic, namely sexual orientation, that, 
in previous jurisprudence, has been found to be analogous to 
those characteristics specifically enumerated in s. 15(1). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court is referring here specifically to the decision in 
Nesbit.  I continue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the issue is that this differential treatment 
discriminates in a substantive sense by violating the human 
dignity of individuals—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that our colleagues in the Canadian Alliance understand 
clearly that the supreme court is talking about something called 
human dignity.  I do not see how, as lawmakers, we can oppose 
something called human dignity.  I continue:

</I></B></P><P align=left>—in same-sex relationships....The nature of the interest 
affected is fundamental, namely the ability to meet basic 
financial needs following the breakdown of a relationship 
characterized by intimacy and economic dependence. 
The exclusion of same-sex partners from the benefits of the 
spousal support scheme implies that they are judged to be 
incapable of forming intimate relationships of economic 
interdependence, without regard to their actual circumstances. 
Taking these factors into account, it is clear that the human 
dignity of individuals in same-sex relationships is violated by 
the definition of “spouse” in s. 29 of the FLA. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it is desirable.  It is possible for a man to love 
another man, it is desirable and the fact should be fully 
recognized by the lawmaker.  It is possible for a woman to love 
another woman, it is desirable, it is noble, and it should be 
given the same recognition by the lawmaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No amount of prejudice will prevent the attainment of the 
equality to which same sex couples are entitled to aspire.  We 
have seen this in the court decisions.  We see it in political 
courage.  I am sure that, this evening, many of us here will 
wish to vote in favour of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves this question:  Why is it important that 
we show strong support for a bill such as this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hours could be spent exploring the cause of homosexuality.  As I 
have often said, I have five siblings, I have extremely normal 
and wonderful parents, and my mother stayed at home while my 
father worked.  I wanted for neither affection nor love.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing about how I grew up to suggest any dysfunction 
in my family, and yet I am homosexual.  I am very happy to be 
so.  I am happy, I love life, I love my work, I have friends, I 
have love in my life, and I want for nothing in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ask ourselves what it would mean if lawmakers continued 
to send the message that same sex couples are second class 
citizens, that, despite the fact that, in many cases, they are 
taxpayers, they are not entitled to full recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that Canadian Alliance members will reflect on what I am 
about to say. 
Mr. Speaker, you were 13, 14 or 15 at one time; you might argue 
this was some time ago. Whether they live in Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Montreal or Charlottetown, PEI, when at age 13, 14 
or 15, young people discover that they are different from the 
others in their sexual attraction, because they are attracted to 
people of the same sex, it is important that they feel they are 
full-fledged citizens, and to know that, in their lives, 
regardless of profession and aspirations, lawmakers will provide 
full recognition and discrimination will be tolerated neither in 
Quebec nor in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Bill C-23 proposes to do. 
What is so threatening about it? Could someone from the Canadian 
Alliance tell me how the fact that a person chooses to live as a 
homosexual in society, to engage in an emotional relationship, 
which the supreme court said ought to be considered as a 
conjugal relationship, poses a threat to the heterosexual 
community? What makes Canadian Alliance members view Bill C-23 
as a threat to traditional families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a traditional family. My twin brother has a 
traditional family. My sister Lorraine has a traditional family 
with her husband Jean-Pierre and their son Francis. Yet, I do not 
believe that I, as an individual, threaten the choice they made 
to form a traditional family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. members of the Canada Alliance need to review 
their position.  They need to support this bill.  Doing so will, 
in my opinion, enhance their status as a parliamentary group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill does not change, and it is important to say so, 
is the definition of marriage.  The definition of marriage is 
not included in this bill.  It is part of common law.  Nothing 
in the 300 or so clauses of Bill C-23 changes the definition of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those tempted to vote against this bill because they claim it 
threatens the institution of marriage according to the 
conventionally held view are, quite simply, wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not change the definition of cohabitation as it 
exists in federal statutes, which refer to a period of one year 
of life together.  This bill does not change the consequences 
and legal facts surrounding separation. 
According to federal law, common law relationships terminate at 
the time of a separation.  There is nothing in this bill that 
changes this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no change to section 18 of the Criminal Code, which 
refers to the fact that offences committed in the presence of 
one's spouse are not to be presumed to have been committed under 
compulsion.  Not only is that section not changed, neither is 
section 278, nor 155 on incest, 290 on bigamy, nor 293 on 
polygamy.  Of course, the bill does not make any change to the 
Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act or the Divorce Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill provides is that the expression conjugal 
relationship should be associated and used closely with common 
law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What criteria are established by the term conjugal relationship, 
what do we mean when we talk of a conjugal relationship?  In 
Canadian law, since the lower courts examined the term conjugal 
relationship, we have a fairly clear idea what it means.  It 
means sharing a roof, personal and sexual relations, the 
presence of services and of social activities, financial 
support, the image the couple gives of itself in the community. 
There are of course times when all these elements are present, 
at other times only some of them may be present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give my opinion right off on a very important 
element of the debate that took place in parliamentary committee 
and elsewhere.  I think that the government was well advised not 
to recognize in the bill other relationships of interdependence. 
They do exist in our society: a son caring for his mother, 
someone else looking after a niece, one co-tenant attending to 
another, who is perhaps disabled.  But these types of 
interdependence do not constitute conjugal relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to their great credit that people in our society look 
after others.  We need only think that, in a few years, seniors 
in Canada and Quebec will represent over a third of our society. 
Indeed, we as a society must think about how we will support 
those who are financially dependent on others and those who take 
care of other people. However, that reflection cannot take place 
in a debate on same sex spouses or unmarried opposite sex 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has been going on for ten years in Canada. The first 
case dealing with same sex spouses was heard by the courts in 
1990. Now, in the year 2000, we have a bill before us. The 
homosexual community and all the democrats who support it have 
been patient, since the debate lasted ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that we have an extremely informed debate on the 
various forms of interdependence that exist in our society. 
I know that some of my colleagues, including the hon. member for 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, hope that this debate can take place. So 
do other Bloc Quebecois members, but the fact that such a debate 
has not taken place is no reason to vote against Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is the result of a very clear understanding of the 
situation by decision makers, first because the courts have 
issued rulings and, second, because the Minister of Finance 
evaluated the costs of recognizing same sex spouses. We are well 
aware—and I will get back to this later on—that these costs 
are minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the debate on the other forms of interdependency has 
not yet taken place. The law reform commission of Canada is just 
beginning to look at the issue. 
I know that the government is proposing to set up a joint 
parliamentary committee with Human Resources, Justice and 
Finance, so that all the departments involved in possible 
recognition of other forms of interdependency can use their 
expertise, and so that we, as parliamentarians and decision 
makers, can have access to as much information as possible.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues to vote in favour of the bill and to 
work towards equality and democracy for the following six 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this is a bill that recognizes one of the most 
fundamental values in our society.  Whether we are sovereignists 
or federalists, men or women, young or old, rich or poor, we all 
believe in equal treatment.  That is what this bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the courts of law, the supreme court in particular, have 
ruled that we, as lawmakers, could not continue to discriminate 
against same sex couples.  That is why this bill is restorative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, let us be clear, the government introduced an amendment 
in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  I was 
not in favour of the amendment, but it at least has the merit of 
removing any possible ambiguity.  This bill in no way, shape or 
form has anything to do with marriage.  Marriage according to 
the conventional, common law definition will continue to exist, 
and that is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I cannot guarantee that 10 or 15 years from now a 
court of law will not rule that it is discriminatory to limit 
the institution of marriage to the heterosexual community.  I do 
not know, but what I do know is that, if a court of law rules 
that marriage is unconstitutional because it is limited to the 
heterosexual community, it will not be because of this bill.  It 
will be because of section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, according to the Department of Finance in the Rosenberg 
decision, this bill involves no substantial cost to the 
treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, 70% of Canadians would like us to end the discrimination 
to which homosexuals are subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, last June, at the end of the session, the National 
Assembly, in the sort of unanimous gesture of which the house of 
the people is capable in the great moments of the community, 
passed Bill 32, which amended 28 statutes and recognized same 
sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, for all these reasons, individually and 
collectively, if democracy is to mean anything and if we are to 
take pride in representing those who have put their faith in us, 
all members must rise and support Bill C-23 when the Speaker 
puts the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague for Burnaby—Douglas, who has been a 
champion of same sex equality, not only in the House of Commons 
and parliament, but also in the broader society.  I recognize the 
incredible work that the member for Burnaby—Douglas has done, 
not just in the New Democratic Party, but in the political life 
of the country, in standing to ensure that gays and lesbians are 
not discriminated against and in defending equality for all 
the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are debating the final reading of Bill C-23, I am proud to 
say that members of the New Democratic Party fully support the 
bill.  Our party has had a long history of standing for equality 
and defending minority rights, and we will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to what the bill is about.  As with other 
issues before the House, there has been much misinformation and 
propaganda put forward and I think it is important to state the 
case of what this bill is about.  In my mind, and for anyone who 
cares to look at the bill, it is about equality.  It is about 
dealing with the legal issues that resulted from the May 1999 
supreme court ruling in M. v H., which made it quite clear, 
legitimately, that governments cannot limit benefits or 
obligations by discriminating against same sex common law 
relationships. 
That ruling made it very clear that denying equal treatment 
before the law to same sex common law partners is contrary not 
only to the charter of rights and freedoms, but also the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that historic case in the supreme court a number of 
provinces and other jurisdictions have gone back to examine their 
statutes to see whether discrimination exists.  For example, 
since 1997 the province that I am from, British Columbia, has 
amended numerous statutes, including six core statutes, to ensure 
that there is no discrimination against same sex benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999 Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations.  In 
Ontario we have seen 67 statutes amended.  As well, in a large 
majority of Canadian cities, in private sector companies, in 
municipalities, in hospitals, in libraries and in various social 
service institutions across Canada we have seen the same kind of 
change begin to take effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say, and I think many people in this country would 
say, that this is long overdue.  It has been a long, costly and 
arduous role for many people in this country who have faced 
discrimination before the law, but also in terms of 
discrimination in public attitude, in government legislation and 
in services.  Today we should take pride in saying that Bill C-23 
is the right thing to do to uphold equality in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to say that it is also with a note of 
dismay that we have to challenge the misinformation that has been 
put forward by the former Reform Party.  In fact, listening to 
the debate in the House over the last few weeks, I have really 
been quite appalled at the level of debate, the cheap shots that 
have been taken and the hateful comments that have been made by 
members of the former Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Reform Party members have done the same thing they did 
with the Nisga'a final agreement.  They have tried to portray 
this as a debate not about equality, but somehow that parliament 
will be conferring special rights on a special interest group. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is not about 
special rights.  It is not about special rules or considerations. 
This is about ending discrimination toward gay and lesbian 
couples in common law relationships and saying that the law must 
apply equally and fairly to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard former Reform members say that the legislation 
will hurt children and that children will suffer.  I have also 
heard— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
regret interrupting this speech because I enjoy listening to what 
the member has to say, but the Speaker has ruled, and it has 
subsequently been upheld about four or five times, that the name 
of our party is the Canadian Alliance.  It has been ruled and I 
would ask this member simply to adhere to the ruling of the 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I used the term 
the former Reform Party.  The term alliance is an interesting one 
because alliance to me implies that there is a partnership taking 
place, and I have been curious to see who is really banging down 
the door to form this alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canadian Alliance, the former Reform Party, the 
opposition members, but the point is what they say in the House 
and the way they have taken on this bill.  They have held up a 
smokescreen, trying to fool people or give people the illusion 
that it is about special rights.  That is completely unfounded 
and nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been particularly offended by the remarks of members 
opposite that the bill will hurt children and families.  In fact, 
just yesterday a member of the opposition in his debate said “I 
suggest that this government has given in once again to the 
tyranny of the minority.  We cannot legislate equality any more 
than we can legislate morality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do legislate equality.  That is what the charter of rights 
and freedoms is about.  That is what our constitution is about. 
That is what the Canadian Human Rights Act is about. 
We do legislate equality and every member of the House should 
stand to defend the right of equality.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members are trying to legislate morality in the House. 
Let us be very clear about that.  When they do so we have to 
understand that not only are they attacking gay and lesbians or 
same sex couples who are in a common law relationship, they have 
gone further than that.  They are now attacking the rights of 
people, whether they be gay, straight or whatever, in common law 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday some of the amendments that we dealt with were 
specific amendments to remove the term common law relationship 
from the Old Age Security Act and the Income Tax Act.  That would 
take us back to the dark ages.  I thought we had entered the new 
millennium.  The members of the opposition party, the former 
Reform Party, are stuck in an age where their moralistic views, 
their narrow, hateful views of what Canadians are about, are not 
shared by the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the opposition who have opposed this bill why 
they consider it to be such a threat to heterosexual families. 
They seem to think that Bill C-23 will somehow undermine their 
own families or what they perceive to be traditional marriages. 
Why is there only one definition of marriage in their minds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard Reform members say that the bill will diminish 
marital relationships.  I have to question and challenge why they 
are so threatened, so weak and so hateful that in order to impose 
their moralistic view they are determined to deny equality to 
other Canadians who happen to be in same sex relationships.  Why 
are they willing to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the unfortunate consequences of their argument is that by 
voicing their biases and their prejudices against people they 
actually give permission to other people in society to stir up 
hatred and division.  We saw that during the Nisga'a debate when 
Reformers made remarks that were then taken up by racists and by 
people who harbour huge feelings of homophobia.  This is what the 
former Reform Party members are allowing to happen by their very 
hurtful comments.  They make comments which divide our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party are absolutely appalled by that 
stand.  We think it is outrageous.  We have the courage to stand 
in this place to defend equality and to stand in support and in 
defence of same sex relationships.  All people should be given 
the same treatment under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day this bill is important because we have 
seen incredibly lengthy court battles.  I know of couples who 
have dealt with the system, who have been forced to go through 
humiliation and discrimination because of the law and have had to 
pay money to lawyers.  We have seen some of the very expensive 
legal challenges that have taken place.  It is important for us 
as legislators to say that we have a clear ruling.  This is about 
equality.  It is about doing the right thing.  We should stop 
this very expensive process of forcing people to go through 
litigation.  We should be changing these laws.  That is another 
reason Bill C-23 should be adopted unanimously by the House 
tonight, and it will be supported by New Democrats. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I noted that the hon. member referred to the Canadian 
Alliance members as hateful probably a dozen times in her speech. 
It does not serve anybody's interests to revert to name-calling. 
I notice that when people disagree in the House, particularly 
members of the NDP, they go on the attack and make accusations of 
this kind rather than substantive debate, which is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the member has missed in our comments, which 
we have continually repeated and which I would like her to 
address, is the fact that our core themes on this bill have been 
that if marriage is going to be put at the front of the bill, 
does the member have a problem with putting marriage right into 
the statutes, where legal opinion says it will actually have 
substantive legal effect?  Legal opinion is that, the way the 
justice minister has done it, marriage will be left out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, she said that we did not want to put people in the 
courtrooms and cause them to incur legal costs.  Yet with the 
undefined definition of a conjugal relationship in the statute, 
people will probably be driven into the courtrooms to have their 
relationships assessed by the state.  We have consistently said 
that is probably inappropriate, that it would be better to define 
it in the statute.  I would ask her to speak to those two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did use the word hateful 
a number of times.  I stand by it because I believe the arguments 
from opposition members were hateful of other people in society. 
For example, when they attack people who are in common law 
relationships I wonder where is their morality in terms of 
imposing their views on other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that incredibly divisive.  I find it incredibly biased 
and I find it hateful.  Basically it is singling out people for 
the fact that they do not uphold the member's particular view of 
marriage even though people in same sex relationships may have 
all the attributes and the characteristics of what the member 
would characterize as a traditional marriage.  I think that is 
hateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the other question I say very clearly that I did not 
support the preamble, the definition of marriage contained in the 
bill.  Nor do I think it should be applied to the other statutes, 
simply because the bill is about benefits and obligations.  That 
was the original intent of the bill.  In fact it is a great shame 
that the government caved in at the last minute and put in that 
preamble an attempt to win the support of some of its 
backbenchers, which obviously did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original intent of the bill in terms of benefits and 
obligations was correct.  To put in that preamble, and to put it 
into every other statute where there is not a definition of 
marriage currently, incites an inflammatory kind of environment 
which allows opposition members, the Canadian Alliance, the 
former Reform Party, to carry out its agenda of dividing people. 
I simply do not agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the hon. 
member made reference to treating people fairly.  I could not 
help but be reminded that a few nights ago in a private member's 
bill by one of the members of our party the member for Wild Rose 
asked for an ombudsman to be put in place to hear the issues of 
the native people on reserves so that they could be treated 
fairly.  Her party voted against the grassroots native people 
having an independent ombudsman to hear their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed to me to be a very reasonable private member's bill. 
It focused on the needs of grassroots people so that they would 
have a fair hearing.  Yet strangely enough every member of her 
party voted against an ombudsman for native people.  It seems 
inconsistent with her concern for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but we 
have to go to the response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very easy 
question to answer.  We in the NDP believe in the 
self-determination of aboriginal people.  We believe that 
aboriginal communities, first nations, have the ability and the 
capacity to put in place any procedures they want in terms of an 
ombudsperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Reform Party to impose that, we see through its agenda. 
When we look at the debates that have taken place in the House 
over aboriginal rights, the Reform Party has opposed every one. 
Then all of a sudden it comes up with the idea of an 
ombudsperson.  Methinks it doth protest too much.  Its agenda is 
very clear, but from our point of view it is something that 
should come from within the aboriginal community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in the debate surrounding Bill C-23, an 
act to modernize the statutes of Canada in relation to benefits 
and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members to keep the title of the bill in mind during 
my remarks.  It is important that we focus on what the bill 
really is and what it really means and not let the debate get out 
of proportion.  It is a very practical and pragmatic piece of 
legislation which simply seeks to modernize the way we treat 
benefits in employment situations or in hereditary issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to honour the member for Burnaby—Douglas who on 
behalf of the NDP caucus has been championing this issue for his 
entire adult life.  It must be very gratifying for him to see the 
bill finally being debated in this way today.  Some 21 years ago 
when the member was first elected to the House of Commons we 
would have been light years away from actually having a debate on 
same sex benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress has been made very slowly and at a very frustrating 
pace, I am sure, for the many activists who have dedicated their 
lives to it.  As we have often said, it is like steering a 
supertanker one degree at a time.  Slowly but surely, with 
dedicated people like the member for Burnaby—Douglas, we are 
making social progress on the issue, and I recognize him today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gay rights are the last great civil rights movement of our time. 
It is one issue we have failed to deal with during the last 
century with the emancipation of black people and their moving 
forward on social issues in the United States.  That was a 
genuine civil rights movement.  The aboriginal people in this 
country in recent years have finally been put at the forefront of 
social justice issues.  That was a civil rights movement.  The 
one remaining movement about which we have been negligent and to 
which we have failed to give enough attention is the very real 
discrimination that still exists in our dealings with gay and 
lesbian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always frustrated and saddened by the reaction in some of 
the speeches I have heard from the right wing extremist parties. 
The extremists always find it easier to promote hatred than to 
stamp it out.  It is much easier to get attention by a divisive 
argument than by an argument which actually unites and moves 
society forward.  More than angered, I am saddened by some of the 
tone and content of the debate we have heard from the right wing 
extremist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me in that it is a little frightening to think that 
those Canadians can be that retarded in their development on 
social issues.  That is the only term I can use.  Somehow they 
have been held back.  The rest of us have moved forward and they 
have not. They have either failed to listen or refused to listen 
or failed to understand what the rest of the country is telling 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party should not be any more proud in one sense.  It 
moved an amendment which catered to the musings of right wing 
extremists in that an 1880 definition of marriage is now 
entrenched in Bill C-23 by amendment by the Liberal Party to 
appease and placate right wing extremists who simply could not 
tolerate the idea of the bill going forward and threatening what 
they believe to be the sanctity of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the definition of marriage was put forward in the 1880s in 
Britain's common law other things were typical about marriage as 
well.  For instance, two races were not allowed to marry.  At 
that time interracial marriages were illegal.  We have gone 
beyond that.  We have matured and developed to realize that was 
silly, and so we chucked it out.  At that time it was legal to 
beat one's wife as long as one did not use a rod thicker than 
one's thumb.  That was silly.  That was obsolete and had to be 
dealt with, so we modernized the institution of marriage to toss 
out those anachronisms.  There is another one we have yet to toss 
out, the barrier which so horrifies right wing extremist parties 
today, same sex unions and same sex marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that my children grew up in a neighbourhood 
where they recognized that families could take all kinds of 
shapes, that there was no one definition of the perfect nuclear 
family.  The reality is that I have neighbours where there are a 
mom, a dad and two children, and that is a family.  There is a 
single mom with children, and that is a family.  There are two 
moms with children, and that is a family too.  My kids have grown 
up with that realization and they are not frightened by it. 
There is nothing to fear by extending the same rights to other 
groups that we ourselves enjoy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right wing extremists always seem to feel that by extending 
rights to one group somehow diminishes the rights others enjoy. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  It augments and 
accentuates the rights we all enjoy.  When we all move forward 
together that is the only time society truly moves forward 
together.  If we leave any one significant group behind, we are 
not doing our job in terms of equal rights and equal 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the arguments of members of the Reform Party or the 
right wing extremist party are nothing short of ludicrous.  One 
criticism is that the bill will lead to “benefits for sex” and 
abuses of who will be entitled to benefits.  They are saying that 
heterosexual men will claim to be gay so they can get dental 
benefits or something.  They are groping for ways to criticize 
the bill.  That is absolutely absurd, but we have heard them put 
forward such arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have consistently voted against every measure to 
promote equality on this issue.  We have seen it all through 
their comments since I have been here in 1997.  In 1996 Reform 
critic Sharon Hayes, during the debate on changes to the human 
rights act, said the Reform Party had taken the position that it 
rejected the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act as both unnecessary and inadvisable, 
recommending the exclusion of significant numbers of our 
population from coverage under the human rights act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder sometimes if members opposite think about what they are 
doing and what they are saying.  I honestly wonder if they have 
given the matter any serious thought, or if they just react in a 
knee-jerk way, driven by emotion but certainly not by any kind of 
principles with which we would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of my remarks I asked members to remember that this 
is an act to modernize the statutes of Canada in relation to 
benefits and obligations.  It is nothing more.  It seeks to grant 
benefits to those working persons who may seek to share their 
benefits with someone other than the conventional definition of 
spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that has already been amended in most 
collective bargaining agreements and in many provincial statutes. 
It is really bringing the federal statutes into line with what is 
already the norm.  There is nothing radical or revolutionary 
about the idea.  It is simply institutionalizing what society has 
already agreed should be the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the bill is a long overdue reaction by the government 
to the rulings of the supreme court.  If we need guidance on its 
origins or the moral authority, we can look at cases such as M v 
H.  It was about payments after the breakdown of a same sex 
relationship.  Sooner or later we knew we would have to deal with 
the issue.  This very high profile case helped the country 
finally come to grips once and for all with what happens in a 
same sex relationship when the relationship fails and whether it 
should be treated in the same way as a more conventional union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was useful for the country to finally wrestle with the issue. 
We have all benefited from having the debate of recent days.  I 
look forward to the passage of Bill C-23 because I firmly believe 
it is one of the last great civil rights issues of our time.  I 
am very proud that I am lucky enough to have been elected in a 
period where I was able to play some role in bringing it about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in 1996 when Bill C-33 was being debated it was 
claimed that there was absolutely no future intent to bring in 
same sex benefits.  Four years later and here we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Bill C-23 not just a pit stop along the way to having further 
amendments made to the entire institution of marriage or to the 
definition of marriage?  Could the member give me his viewpoint 
on the matter of whether there should be any further amendment to 
the definition of marriage that he would like to see?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I ask people to recognize 
that the name of this bill is simply to modernize the statutes in 
relation to benefits and so on.  That is what we ask people to 
keep in mind.  It is sort of a paranoid idea to think this is the 
slippery slope toward what could be considered to be some kind of 
a dangerous movement toward anything else.  Do not give it more 
attributes than it has.  It seeks to modernize the payment of 
benefits and obligations in relation to many acts where there is 
reference to that kind of shared thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether the definition of marriage should be modernized as 
well, I believe it should.  I believe the definition of marriage 
that we are currently using, as I said, is from 1880s British 
common law.  Many things have had to be changed to reflect social 
morals and so on.  I think it is wrong to even try to legislate 
morality.  That has been made in argument before.  If we read 
Oliver Wendell Holmes at that same period of time in the 1880s, 
he was saying, “You can't legislate morality.  The state has no 
business trying to legislate morality”.  We can legislate 
equality, as the hon. member for Vancouver East pointed out quite 
correctly, but we cannot legislate morality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say the right wing extremist party in this country has 
things completely reversed.  Stop trying to legislate morality 
and admit that it is necessary to legislate equality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again I think it is regrettable that the hon. member of 
the NDP continues to use terms that take away from the debate: 
extremist and hateful.  Those are labels which I think undermine 
the credibility of the House.  I appreciate there are different 
opinions on issues.  Our party has a policy that says that we 
feel that marriage should be between a man and a woman.  It is 
right in our policy document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that we had a motion on the floor last June to the 
effect that this House affirm that marriage remain the union of a 
man and a woman in law and that the House do everything possible 
to keep it that way.  A majority of members, perhaps even all the 
members who were there that day in the NDP party, voted against 
that motion to keep marriage defined as a man and a woman.  I can 
respect that they have a different opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I want clarity from the member.  Is that the official 
position of the NDP party, that we should not have marriage 
defined as a union of a man and a woman?  Do they want to have in 
statute same sex marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, nothing is stopping the 
organizations that the hon. member belongs to from having a 
definition of marriage different from what exists in statute. 
What exists in law and what might exist in the hon. member's 
church are two different things.  Nothing is stopping the hon. 
member from passing a by-law in his church or in the moral 
majority right wing evangelical movement that that particular 
church will not honour a union other than a single man and a 
single woman, which would be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in fact in statute, in law where we need a legal 
definition for really a contractual relationship to be partners, 
we can be more flexible and we can be more generous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate, a debate 
that has been filled with a great deal of information, a great 
deal of emotion and I think is generally reflective of the range 
of emotions that people across the country certainly feel when 
approaching this subject matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23, modernization of benefits and obligations, is 
appropriately named.  There is obviously an element of 
modernization and certainly one of obligation that will stem from 
the omnibus type of legislation that amends 68 statutes in 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have heard and other speakers before you have 
heard a great deal of consternation and oftentimes heated debate 
on this subject matter.  Members of parliament individually have 
been receiving I am sure a great deal of correspondence and a 
great deal of feedback, both positive and negative, about this 
subject matter, this bill.  Whenever it appears, whenever issues 
of sexual orientation or anything that might be perceived as 
infringing upon traditional views, values, definitions, there is 
bound to be a reaction that is often motivated by fear, 
misunderstanding and raw emotion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be rather temperate and understanding and do our 
utmost to not fan the flames in this instance, as we have seen in 
other instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not drawing a direct correlation, but there is a situation 
currently on the east coast of Canada where we had a decision 
handed down by the supreme court that has spurned a great deal of 
debate about native and aboriginal fishing rights in our 
fisheries.  Once again we saw a tremendous outpouring of reaction 
and emotion that bordered on violence and in fact led to some 
instances of violence.  It is incumbent upon us as members not to 
add fuel to an already volatile situation.  We border on doing 
that in the midst of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues, no doubt, will not go away even in the wake of 
this legislation passing.  Whatever decision is made in the final 
analysis when this bill in fact does pass, if it does pass, the 
issue itself is not going to dissipate or disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said, I have had the opportunity personally to meet 
with members of my constituency, individuals who are watching 
this debate and following it very closely.  I met quite recently 
with Ernie Curry of Antigonish who is the president of the 
Catholic Civil Rights League in the Antigonish area.  On April 3 
I met with Mr. Curry and his group and we had a very productive 
meeting, in my view, with respect to the contents of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although at the end of our lengthy meeting we may not have 
agreed entirely on every point, the fact remains that both sides 
were heard.  It was a very open and frank discussion where 
information and points of view were exchanged.  I would hope at 
the end of the day that is the process that we are embarking on 
here.  This is the type of analysis that can bear fruit and can 
give individuals an opportunity to at least understand all the 
signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said of that meeting, we may not have agreed on every point 
but we certainly came to a greater appreciation of the points of 
view that do exist.  I was very appreciative of the opportunity 
to hear from him, and certainly to hear from him on the efforts, 
dedication and good work that is done by him and his 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, Bill C-23, as you would know as an individual who 
has followed and participated in this debate previously as an 
individual member of parliament for Kingston and the Islands, 
this bill does not intend, nor was it intended to change in a 
legal sense the definition of marriage or spouse for that matter. 
Bill C-23, in fact, may now include a definition because of the 
eleventh hour insertion of that amendment.  However, it remains 
clear that the intent is not to change, deviate, revamp or 
somehow diminish any definition of marriage, or certainly not to 
attack the institution of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many definitions have been put forward in the House, most 
notably by members of the Reform Party.  These amendments were 
brought forward in good faith as an attempt to bring greater 
clarity and definition to what we perceive as the traditional 
view of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happened as well at the justice committee.  It was moved by 
the parliamentary secretary that we now include this definition 
of marriage.  That was one which the Conservative Party 
supported.  I can say personally as a member of that justice 
committee that we were in support of that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 22 the government brought forward this amendment and it 
was adopted at the committee that the definition of one man and 
one woman as defining the traditional view of marriage would be 
entrenched in the bill.  This does not affect what others have 
decided upon as being their view of marriage.  The Conservative 
Party does not want to partake in any attack or any frontal 
assault on what is viewed as a traditional understanding of what 
a marriage is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the committee, although I supported this 
amendment, in many instances it is not necessary.  It is perhaps 
better left unsaid that marriage is a person's view of what that 
union means to them spiritually, religiously, from their 
background and from their upbringing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that there are occasions when we become so caught up in 
Cartesian thinking that we have to write everything down.  I 
would suggest this stems from the early eighties when we 
contemplated bringing back the constitution, repatriating it and 
putting in place a charter of rights that writes down every 
obligation and every right in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, inevitably the fear is that we will leave something 
out.  There has always been a common law notion that there are 
certain things that are accepted and certain things that people 
have come to view as practice, a normal evolution if you will, of 
how the law acts and how people react and interact with one 
another in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we are seeing the country faced with a situation 
where the government is becoming very intrusive, writing 
everything down and reminding people of what they do and cannot 
do, and essentially putting it all before them.  It is like 
layers of shingles on a roof.  There is no point in time, it 
appears, that government is prepared to maybe take some of those 
shingles away before we put another layer on top of it.  More and 
more we are seeing bureaucracy become more intrusive, more 
involved and more active in people's everyday existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that this trend has to be somehow stopped or stemmed.  We 
should be re-examining what we are doing.  A perfect example is 
the legislation with respect to gun registration.  We know that 
the legislation came about as a reaction to a horrible incident 
in the country where women were murdered in Montreal.  Yet, 
rather than try to deal with the root causes or with the problem 
itself, the knee-jerk reaction of the government of the day, the 
current government, was to put in place a registry system that is 
cumbersome, bureaucratic, intrusive and does not in fact affect 
the criminal element at all.  It focuses on individuals who are 
already participating in a very lawful and personally relevant 
activity, perhaps skeet shooting, hunting or recreational use of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether anyone personally engages in that, some individuals 
choose to do so and that is their right, and yet the government 
has targeted those persons as being a group that will be 
legislated and almost vilified by virtue of this type of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples that could be cited.  It is not 
surprising in a way that the government in this regard chose to 
include the definition of marriage with respect to this 
legislation.  The government, of course, many would suggest and I 
might be one of them, is becoming rather complacent, devoid of 
ideas, very moderate and mundane in its approach to the future of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious that in the context of this legislation when 
people reacted, and perhaps reacted in a negative way much like 
we saw with the idea that we might be subsidizing the NHL, the 
government, like a windsock and the party that likes to lead the 
parade in progress, reacted by inserting at the last minute a 
definition of marriage.  Perhaps it should have done so at the 
earliest instance but it is a government that obviously is 
completely led around by the nose by public opinion polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice decided, and for weeks and weeks 
building up to the introduction of the bill, that it was not 
necessary and that it was not about marriage.  She went to great 
efforts and pain to remind Canadians that this was not at all 
about marriage, and yet this is what we see when the government 
is backed into a corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, and as I have indicated, we do support the idea of 
having this definition in the interpretation act although, Mr. 
Speaker, as you will know as a person with a legal background, 
this will not in fact have any real legal implications on things 
such as the Family Maintenance Act or the Divorce Act.  These 
types of bills will not be affected in essence by this insertion 
in the interpretation of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there has been a motion put on the floor by the 
Reform Party that attempts to broaden the definition and insert 
essentially this new entrenched version of what marriage is. 
I applaud the motivation for doing so, but I do not necessarily 
follow the thinking or why it is they have chosen to go about 
this task.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting many of the amendments put forward by the 
member for Calgary Centre which focus in on the definition of 
marriage and spouse in the various statutes that will be affected 
by Bill C-23.  As I have indicated, this will not have a drastic 
effect on the current operation of family courts around the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that Bill C-23, which is omnibus legislation, 
extends benefits and obligations to same sex couples and opposite 
sex couples with respect to the fiscal obligations and benefits 
that can accrue and flow.  There is still a criterion or a hurdle 
that a person would have to get over to benefit or become 
eligible for that entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has been referred to by many as being driven by 
the judiciary and, in particular, the supreme court ruling in M. 
v H.  The government cannot, by virtue of this decision, limit 
benefits or obligations by discriminating against same sex common 
law relationships.  Denying equal treatment before the law to 
same sex couples is contrary to the principles of equity 
enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well 
as our Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very simple principle was set out by that decision.  It was a 
very straightforward statement by the courts saying that same sex 
couples cannot be treated differently on a fiscal level.  This 
was not a moral judgment.  This was not an attempt by the courts 
to tread into that sacred ground of marriage.  This was simply a 
legal recognition that there was a fiscal standard that had to be 
applied when looking at human relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker made a very eloquent speech about the need 
to recognize that this is about humanity and about treating human 
beings with the same level of fairness, the same judicious, 
equitable standard that is applied around this great country.  He 
and others have referred to the fact that things like the civil 
rights movement would not have occurred unless we had a vision of 
how we should interact with one another, irrespective of race, 
sex, cultural background or language.  All of these stigmas that 
can sadly become attached to individuals in our society must be 
viewed with an even hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is supposed to be blind.  We have seen the symbols of 
justice:  the woman who is blindfolded and holds a sword and the 
scales.  This is how the law is suppose to weigh how we treat 
individuals in society.  This is the same as more recent 
vintages; the way we have treated women in this country.  They 
were only given the vote as early as 1940 and only allowed to own 
property in the last century.  That came about at a time when it 
was very volatile.  There was often fragmented and angry debate 
but the country's moral fabric did not tear apart. The country 
has not been reduced to shambles and burning embers. The country 
has survived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To somehow suggest that we will be thrown into chaos and that 
the country will completely break down if we begin to extend 
equitable treatment and fiscal fairness to same sex partners is 
inflammatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is about equity and fairness of obligations and 
rights as it accrues to individuals who have paid into a fund. 
This is often about a person having the ability to receive a 
return on a fund that he or she has legally paid into and now 
wishes to benefit from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation maintains a clear definition between married 
and unmarried relationships.  Even though the legislation refers 
to marriage, it does not go into the area of what is a spouse. It 
makes no attempt to define marriage as being inclusive or 
exclusive of individuals who have chosen to live a certain 
lifestyle.  It protects and recognizes the merit and the obvious 
view that marriage is a beautiful thing.

is fine.

marriage.  Marriage is but one choice that people have to make in 
their lives in choosing how they interact with same sex and 
opposite sex individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested that because the legislation recognizes 
fiscal benefits and obligations, which already exists in our 
society today, for same sex couples, that it will somehow 
denigrate those who chose a different lifestyle, a lifestyle that 
some would view as more traditional and some would view as being 
the majority.  However, those of us in the majority have to be 
respectful of those in the minority.  It is one of the 
fundamental principles upon which this country was based. That is 
where the tie-in exists between previous minority groups that 
have been discriminated against.  We have had very historic 
debates in this Chamber on aboriginal rights, the rights of 
women, the rights of blacks and the civil rights movement.  There 
is a correlation when it comes to oppression that has to be 
remedied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major change in this bill, which proposes to encompass same 
sex and opposite sex couples in common law relationships for one 
year, is that both benefits and obligations will be recognized 
for these types of relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot has been said about the issue of conjugality, which has 
been described by some as simply sexual relations. That is 
factually incorrect.  Some MPs have expressed a great deal of 
concern about the definition.  Let me refer to the M. v H. case at 
pages 59 and 60 where the supreme court approved the criteria for 
conjugal relationships.  This was enunciated in the case of 
Molodowich v Penttinen, which is a 1980 case found at 17 R.F.L., 
second edition, 376.  This was an Ontario District Court 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court held that it 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—sets out the generally accepted characteristics of a conjugal 
relationship.  They include shared shelter, sexual and personal 
behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and 
children, as well as the societal perception of the couple. 
However, it was recognized that these elements may be present in 
varying degrees and not all are necessary for the relationship to 
be found to be conjugal. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is crystal clear as to how conjugal relations should not be 
boxed into a very strict definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the numerous interventions that other members have 
made on this bill. I appreciate the considerable correspondence I 
have received from members of my constituency of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in Nova Scotia and from around 
the country.  The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has 
the utmost respect for the views of others on this bill.  We have 
chosen to allow members of our party to vote with their 
conscience and to partake in a free vote, which is something I do 
not believe other members of the House have chosen to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to have put my humble remarks on 
the record with respect to Bill C-23. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has said that we are putting too 
much down on paper about this issue.  It seems to me that the 
courts now have some difficulty in interpreting the written law 
because a lot of the laws are not that clear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that our laws be written in a vague and 
ambiguous fashion?   Would it not be preferable to have our laws 
very clear, very well defined and as specific as possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is because there are 
two lines of thought.  There was a time in this country, 
particularly when we adhered perhaps more to the British model of 
common law, where there was an acceptance of certain things that 
existed.  There was an acceptance that we did not infringe upon 
our neighbour's house or trespass.  I suppose that has all 
evolved over time and we are now at the point where we write 
everything down. The difficulty with writing everything down is 
that inevitably things are sometimes left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we embark on a system where we must anticipate everything 
that will happen, it will be impossible.  We will never be in 
such a situation where we will be able to anticipate every twist 
and turn that might occur in the law or every human dynamic. 
Humans are far too complex for us to somehow foresee every change 
that will occur.  By giving narrow definitions to everything or, 
to use the hon. member's words, specific definitions in every 
instance, my fear is that on occasion we will make laws that will 
be restrictive and exclusive of some groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do understand that there is certainly time and merit 
in having clear definitions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member from the Progressive Conservative Party 
is consistent in being vague and evasive on taking any kind of 
firm position.  As usual, he talks about how important he thinks 
various aspect of this are and how much he appreciates opinions 
but every time I listen to him I wonder where he stands on the 
issue.  It is always hard to sift it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were in committee I recall that the member voted against 
actually defining what marriage was.  When the justice minister 
put forward her motion in committee he wanted to terminate it. 
When the justice minister's motion went on to define marriage as 
a union of a man and a woman, he wanted to exclude that part. He 
voted in favour, as I recall, to exclude the definition of 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's party was split on this back in June 1999 when we 
had a motion on the floor of the House of Commons.  The motion 
asked whether we agreed that marriage should be the union of a 
man and a woman to the exclusion of all others.  It passed four 
to one, but his party was split.  Almost half of his caucus were 
not sure whether a marriage should be the union of a man and a 
woman.  This seems to be consistent with his actions at the 
justice committee when the justice minister put forward her 
motion on the definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost seems like members of that party want to say how 
important marriage is but they do not want to define it.  It is 
frustrating for me, and I think for a lot of Canadians, who would 
like to see this party take a stand on something and not be 
wishy-washy. Maybe he can explain that.  Maybe I have 
misinterpreted his actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre has misinterpreted my actions. If 
he was paying close attention he would realize that was not the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a point where we have come to expect that we should 
not let the reform party ever have truth get in the way of 
reality.  I know I am not supposed to use that type of language 
in the Chamber, but it is very misleading for a member to get up 
and misstate the position of a party or a person, and I take 
great exception to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to what Conservatives are, there are many members in 
the reform party who feel somehow that one cannot be tolerant if 
one is a Conservative, one cannot have an open mind and look at 
things from all angles if one is Conservative.  One has to 
somehow lay down the law and hammer out a position that is 
extreme, and that is not the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the view many in this country have of what it means 
to be a Conservative.  They tried and tried again to somehow 
paint the Right Hon. Joe Clark and members of this party 
similarly as not being Conservative.  They referred to him as 
yesterday's man.  Maybe he is and this is why. He was doing 
things yesterday that people are thinking about doing today.  If 
that is the definition of yesterday's man, that is a darn good 
definition for the Right Hon. Joe Clark. He is a very forward 
thinking individual who has contributed greatly to the growth and 
development of the country. He is a very strong Conservative in 
the definition that I feel very comfortable with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for putting forward what was a 
completely fallacious position on the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  We are very comfortable with the position we have taken 
and I think the majority of Canadians are as well, not the 10% of 
extremists who try to identify themselves as living and breathing 
within the Reform Party of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could not help but listen to the member describe 
Joe Clark and it merits examining the facts.  Joe Clark was the 
most senior and influential member of cabinet in the nine years 
of Brian Mulroney's government.  There were 71 tax increases and 
it more than doubled our national debt, $300 billion.  That is 
extremism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our country is now in desperate straits.  We are the 
highest taxed nation in the industrialized world and are almost 
$600 billion in debt which will take decades to pay off.  We have 
an obligation to our children to not sewer the economy any 
further than what the Conservatives did partially under the 
leadership of Joe Clark.  I am here on behalf of my children and 
all the children of the country to turn the country around and 
set it back on a straighter track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent the member saying anything positive about Joe Clark 
because he and Brian Mulroney were the most negative and 
destructive forces the country has ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, heaven forbid that members 
of parliament say anything positive in this place.  The hon. 
member would not know that if it hit him in the face because the 
opposition repeatedly digs up negativity and perpetrates 
mistruths about individuals, parties and records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest somehow that one party is responsible for the entire 
debt is almost Liberal-like in its magnitude of mistruth. What we 
have seen is an individual who has taken this argument completely 
to outer space in terms of relevance.  It went from homophobia to 
tax phobia.  It is absolutely ludicrous but that is the type and 
level of debate we have come to expect from the Reform Party of 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out 
that the member from the Progressive Conservative Party said it 
was an extreme view.  He said we were extremists in that we would 
like to see marriage in Canada remain as a union of a man and a 
woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  That is not what I said at all.  That 
is a mistruth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was what we heard in 
the House.  He stood up and said we were extremists and that we 
were trying to exclude people from something when really all we 
are saying is that marriage should remain the union of a man and 
a woman.  That is our party policy.  That is what the House 
endorsed nine months ago.  The question I am trying to get the 
member to answer is if that is the position of his party. Would 
he stand up on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will say it very slowly 
so the hon. member can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally endorse the idea that marriage is defined as 
between a man and a woman.  In the Progressive Conservative 
Party, that great national entity the member and his cohorts are 
trying to kill, we have chosen to have a free vote which 
acknowledges that different members of the party may have 
different views.  That is freedom, a concept which the Reform 
Party is not familiar with.  There are big lashes on its members 
when they step off side.  They are relegated to the backbench, 
tossed out of the party or asked to leave politics if they have a 
different view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may not be conformists of that type but what we have decided 
to do is respect individual members and respect the various views 
that Canadians have on this very at times emotional and divisive 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of 
Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to speak today on Bill C-23, the modernization of benefits and 
obligations act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with one of my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know why I am proud to stand and speak to 
this bill.  I have listened to various members speak, such as the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the member for 
Vancouver East.  They have spoken, as national parties do, about 
human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member of the Bloc speak to the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas when he said that the member has been a gay 
member of parliament for a long time and has had the courage to 
stand and speak about these issues at a time when it was not 
popular.  I salute the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it also takes a government with a political will when it 
is in power to move the agenda forward.  This government since 
1993 has taken steps progressively, certainly and steadily 
starting with Bill C-33, and Bill C-41, and the treasury board 
bill which dealt with the issues of benefits and pensions and 
moving on to the bill before us today.  This is the culmination 
of a long series of progressive steps getting us to the point 
where we now have seen the last bastion of legislated 
discrimination in this country fall by the wayside. I am proud to 
belong to a government and a party which has had the courage to 
do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me more than anything is that I have sat in the 
House and listened to what I consider to be the spreading of hate 
and hateful messages by the alliance party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only about the issue of marriage.  This bill, as the 
hon. justice minister has said many times before, is not about 
marriage.  It is about human rights, civil rights and political 
rights of a group in Canada who have been barred from those 
rights for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I heard from the alliance party were suggestions that 
concern me a great deal because it not only stereotypes but 
creates dangerous stereotyping. People who listen to that kind of 
stereotyping may actually feel there are many reasons to dislike, 
fear and deny that particular group, gays, lesbians and bisexual 
persons, their human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me that the hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan and the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre have given statements that they 
make sound like scientific fact.  There are a couple of very 
important pieces of stereotyping which are dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan talked about feminism 
creating gays and lesbians. The hon. member talked about the fact 
that single parent families and divorce create gays and lesbians 
in this country. I would like to quote what the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan said.  While it does not bear repeating, it 
must be repeated because it shows the extremism of that party. 
The hon. member said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A gradual blurring of the sexes occurred that gave young men 
growing up in many female dominated, single parent homes an 
identity crisis. This led to a rise in militant homosexuality, a 
coming out of the closet of gay men and women who also demanded 
equality.  The things that had been considered improper went 
looking for a desperate legitimacy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When pressed, the hon. member was unable to explain why he 
believes that single mother families encourage militant 
homosexuality.  When pressed he also said that he did not know 
the answer to why homosexuals who grew up with both their father 
and mother in the home would be less militant.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That spreads hateful messages about other people. It is about a 
party so set in its own need to poison people against each other 
that it will say anything, no matter whether it is the truth or 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father came from a single parent family led by his mother. My 
father and mother have been married for about 60 years.  My 
father and mother brought me up in a home in which there was love 
and commitment.  I also learned from my parents that every single 
individual in the world has human rights for which I must 
continue to fight and that is what I am doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician I have had many gay, lesbian and bisexual 
patients.  Despite what the hon. member for Calgary Centre would 
have us believe, there is not a single piece of psychological 
research that demonstrates that lesbians and gay men function 
differently as individuals from other women and men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1974 the American Psychiatric Association has been on 
record in holding that homosexuality is not an illness and is not 
curable.  The American Psychological Association agrees that 
homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, 
stability, reliability or general social and vocational 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1997 based on research and evidence the Ontario 
Psychological Association issued a statement supporting the 
general principle that all individuals in relationships should be 
treated equally under the law without regard to sexual 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the kind of statements made by the hon. members for 
Calgary Centre and Nanaimo—Cowichan that are so disconcerting 
for many of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician, a parent and a member of parliament, I am 
extremely concerned about the damage being done to young gays and 
lesbians who are beginning to understand their sexuality. The 
suicide rate among gay and lesbian youth is extremely high, 
beginning at the age of 15 when young people are beginning to 
understand their sexuality.  Those young people are wondering if 
they may or may not be gay or lesbian.  They are worried about 
whether or not they will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now being further marginalized by the members of the 
Canadian Alliance, the former Reform Party. I cannot keep up with 
the name changes in that party. Those young people are being 
further marginalized.  In a place to which a lot of Canadians 
look for truth and honesty, they are being told openly that they 
are sick.  They are being told that they are some sort of 
abnormal creature on the face of the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that do to the sense of self-worth of those young 
people?  What does it do to increase the suicide rate for young 
people who are afraid and concerned that they will be rejected by 
the rest of society?  It is increasing the risk for them.  This 
is what concerns me so much about the irresponsible statements 
coming from the Canadian Alliance, or whatever it is that party 
calls itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other bits of misinformation keep being circulated around here. 
One is that the vast majority of pedophiles are gay.  Some 96% or 
more of acts of sexual abuse toward children are committed by 
heterosexual individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician I have not just read the newspaper from which 
members of the Canadian Alliance seem to get all their 
information but I have also read scientific information, data and 
research which has clearly said that homosexuality is not a 
disease which needs to be cured.  I know very clearly the damage 
that is being done to homosexual youth when they are afraid and 
are further marginalized.  They are committing suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one final point.  I recall the days when common 
law relationships were frowned upon.  I recall the days when 
relationships between people of different religions were frowned 
upon.  I recall the days when conjugal relationships between 
people of different colour were frowned upon.  I am glad to see 
we have finally removed one other barrier that has existed for so 
long.

probably be the single most important bill to come forward in 
this House in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Western Economic 
Diversification)(Francophonie), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
ask my colleague a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if she would be kind enough to define feminism for the 
House.  There appears to be a number of meanings.  I think we 
might profit from that definition.  There seems to be a feeling 
that feminism exists only among women.  I would like to be 
corrected if I am wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does the secretary of state know whether there are any 
churches or groups of people who belong to traditional churches 
who support this legislation?  I think that too might be useful 
to those who are watching and listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to answer 
my colleague's questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question had to do with whether feminism exists only 
among women.  My father was the greatest feminist I know.  He 
taught me to believe in myself.  He taught me that women could be 
equal to men in intelligence and in their ability to do anything 
they choose.  That is really what feminism is about.  It is about 
instilling in women the belief that they are equal and that they 
are capable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member asked me if I knew of any churches that 
were in agreement with the content and the intent of this bill. 
I have heard from many members of the United Church and many 
leaders of the United Church who feel that this is an important 
human rights bill which has been brought forward by this 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this debate has 
engendered intense emotions, not only in the House but throughout 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about 
what this bill will do.  To me it is very simple.  In the recent 
supreme court case of M. v H., the highest court in this land 
ruled that under Canada's constitution common law same sex 
couples must be given the same equal treatment as common law 
opposite sex couples.  This is a question of equality.  This is a 
question of fairness.  Since that decision came down a number of 
other actions have begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not often have a great deal of good to say about our 
Conservative colleagues in Ontario, but the Government of 
Ontario—which is not a wild and woolly, let us be inventive, let 
us do things differently for the sake of being different 
government—acted very quickly, as all governments have an 
obligation to do, to respect the laws of Canada.  It brought in a 
bill recognizing what the supreme court had brought down.  It 
introduced equal rights for common law same sex couples.  Within 
five days of that bill being brought forward it was passed into 
law, without even a vote, with agreement from all three parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The course in this legislature has not been as expeditious. 
Nevertheless, we have brought in this law and it will be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office and those of many other members here have received 
calls expressing the concern that this bill deals with a new 
definition of marriage.  It does not.  It has never been about 
marriage.  That has been made abundantly clear.  It is only about 
the rights and obligations of certain people who are living 
together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it even more clear that this bill is not about marriage 
an amendment was made.  There were many in the House who felt the 
amendment was not necessary.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, the amendments made by this Act do not 
affect the meaning of the word “marriage”, that is, the lawful 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bogeyman to say that this bill changes the definition or 
the concept of marriage, if that was a major concern in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue brought out in this debate by many thoughtful 
members of parliament is that it should not just deal with same 
sex relationships where there is a dependency, it should deal 
with all relationships involving a dependency.  I have to commend 
members, such as the member for Scarborough East, who have 
brought this forward as an alternative to the relationships we 
are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes a lot of sense, where there are relationships of 
dependency, that these rights and obligations should go forward 
and be respected through the law.  After all, we are a caring 
society and one of our objectives is to ensure that individuals 
assume a role of responsibility in looking after those with whom 
they have a relationship.  This could be a relationship of 
children and parents or brothers and sisters.  It could be 
friends, of any sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems, however, because we are not only dealing 
with rights when it will be to someone's benefit to be able to 
achieve, say, the pension benefits or the health and dental 
benefits of another person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obligation to look after certain people has been recognized 
in law.  We have recently seen how parents have been able to sue 
children for support.  Because a legal relationship, respected in 
law and based on dependency, is not always a one-way street, we 
have had to rethink this particular issue.  I will give an 
example using old age security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have two seniors living together, when they are married 
then their joint income is used as the basis for determining old 
age security benefits.  If they are not married, but in a 
relationship of dependency, using the joint income approach could 
lead to a diminution in the old age security going to one 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is where an adult lives with an elderly parent 
and then leaves, for example, to be married.  The Canada pension 
plan credits would have to be allocated to the elderly parent the 
same as if there were a divorce of a married couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are a couple of examples where the issue of creating these 
obligations based on dependency, a relationship of dependency 
between two individuals or two or more individuals, has 
difficulties attached to it because it is not a one-way street. 
It is not just benefits flowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Law Commission of Canada has been looking at the 
issue, because it does deserve further study. 
That is the reason I am pleased the minister has announced that 
this issue of benefits and obligations being extended by virtue 
of Bill C-23 will not be the end of the road, that a 
parliamentary subcommittee will be appointed to look at the 
particular issue of where these benefits and obligations should 
lie in other relationships based on dependency.  I think that is 
the way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, we have the clear dictate of the Supreme Court of 
Canada that, based on equality and fairness, these rights should 
be extended and must be extended by our legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question of fairness.  It is a question of equality. 
It is a question of what is right. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it interesting that the hon. member would say 
that this is about equality and fairness.  I would like to remind 
him that the government moved closure on this bill at second 
reading, at report stage and now at third reading.  It limited 
committee study to three and a half days.  Many people were not 
allowed to voice concerns about this bill.  It seems to me that 
is not in the spirit of the bill, if it is about fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made the point that the issue of economic dependency 
would be addressed sometime down the road and that this 
particular bill is addressing something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often asked if the requirement for a conjugal 
relationship is the criterion for receiving benefits under this 
bill.  These are benefits which have previously been given to 
married couples and families.  Now two people of the same gender 
in a conjugal relationship will have access to these benefits.  I 
would like to ask a question of the member opposite, who I know 
is a member of cabinet and an esteemed member of the Liberal 
Party.  I asked the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism, who 
spoke before him, if, in order to fulfil the requirements of a 
conjugal relationship, people would be required to have a 
physical or sexual relationship to qualify under Bill C-23.  She 
said no, not necessarily.  When the justice minister announced 
the bill, she said that benefits and obligations to individuals 
in other relationships, such as economic and emotional 
interdependence, were not included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems on the one hand that we have the justice minister 
saying if it is economic dependency, it is not included.  On the 
other hand, when I asked the secretary of state exactly “Would 
two people who do not have a physical relationship qualify under 
Bill C-23, yes or no?”, her answer was, if they fulfilled the 
other requirements of a conjugal relationship, yes.  I hear 
conflicting positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, if it is not about economic dependency and it is 
about conjugality, are we not saying that we are extending 
benefits to people based on private physical intimacies about 
which a lot of people have concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say two things.  I 
think the member implied that he agreed this bill was about 
fairness because he said that if this bill was about fairness, 
then we need fairness in the procedure by which we implement it. 
He did not like the idea that we had brought in closure on this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been before the House for a very long time.  I 
would simply remind him that the Tory Government of Ontario, 
indeed the Tory Party of Ontario, with which his party wants to 
form a union, had this before the legislature for a total of five 
days.  This has been before the House for a much longer time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has happened in terms of the evolution of 
the law. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago that there were rights and obligations 
attached only to marriage, but then they were extended by virtue 
of the law to common law relationships.  Heaven forbid, but it 
was progress.  What is happening here is that those rights are 
being extended to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that this takes on the aura of something beyond the 
moral code of so very many, but the role of government is not 
necessarily to recognize simply the moral code of some people. 
The constitution says that our role is to go beyond that to 
extending equality and fairness to as broad a section of 
Canadians as possible.  Therefore the question of dependency will 
be a further evolution of this law as we move forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is important that we be here today to debate this 
issue.  I am here to speak for hundreds of my constituents who 
have phoned, faxed and e-mailed me.  Hundreds more have filled 
out petitions which I have tabled in the House.  They contained 
thousands of signatures asking the government to repeal the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to approach the issue in two separate ways.  The proposed 
bill has not received wide public debate.  I think a bill of this 
importance should be subjected to that.  A number of questions 
have been raised and I would like to get to some of the ones 
people have asked.  Then I will get into the record of the 
Liberal government on family issues and its lack of support for 
families.  I will also deal with some of the things it has put in 
place, and some it has not, which affect families and undermine 
their importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue is the fiscal impact of the bill.  The Liberals 
have not put out any dollar figures as to what it might cost the 
Canadian taxpayer.  The finance minister when referring to the 
bill and some of the amendments said that the fiscal impact of 
these amendments would be minimal if anything at all and that it 
was not a cost issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cost issue.  We should know how many people will be 
affected.  We should know the cost it will have on the treasury, 
on the taxpayers of the country.  We do not know that.  Bill C-23 
purports to give benefits to people who have never received them, 
which will be an additional cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of conjugality has been the subject of much 
debate and many questions.  Bill C-23 defines in statute that a 
common law partner is any individual person who is cohabiting 
with another individual in a conjugal relationship for a minimum 
of one year.  Who defines a conjugal relationship?  The 
dictionary says that it is of or relating to the married state or 
to married persons in the relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that we are equating a conjugal relationship with 
a married relationship?  Is that what we are saying?  Is that 
what the bill means?  Does it mean that these relationships will 
be forced to incur the same responsibilities as married couples? 
Is there that aspect of responsibility?  Or, does it mean that 
these relationships have a societal contribution equal to a 
marriage relationship?  How will the government prove the 
conjugality of a relationship?  I suppose the real question has 
been how we will prove conjugality.  As a previous Liberal prime 
minister said, I agree that the government does not have any 
place in the bedrooms of the nation. Why has the government 
refused to clearly define it in the legislation?  Where is the 
definition? 
Will there be any methods to stop people from abusing the bill by 
saying they are in a relationship when they are not?  How are we 
ever going to pull that out?

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should clearly define a conjugal relationship but it 
does not.  It should outline the rights and responsibilities 
associated with that definition.  Are there additional 
responsibilities if one falls under the bill?  What change will 
that have for society as a whole?  I want to mention that I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the relationships that are not included, the 
other dependent relationships that exist in society.  We all know 
of such relationships.  It could be a daughter taking care of an 
elderly mom, or a couple of elderly brothers who live together to 
help each other out.  Whatever the situation, these situations 
are not addressed because they are not based on conjugality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of public input.  Time and time again people 
have said the issue is of such importance that they need a debate 
on the national stage.  It has to go across the country to give 
everybody an opportunity to debate both sides of the issue in a 
very broad manner.  We have not seen that happen.  As a matter of 
fact closure has been brought in on a number of occasions in 
parliament and certainly on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about marriage.  Is the bill about marriage?  Is it 
about the definition of marriage?  People have said that the 
definition of marriage needs to be reaffirmed.  We did that last 
June in the House.  A motion was put forward and passed that the 
definition of marriage is and should remain the union of one man 
and one woman to the exclusion of all others, and that parliament 
would take all necessary steps within the jurisdiction of the 
Parliament of Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in 
Canada.  It is simple.  The motion passed.  The people have 
spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill was brought forward without a definition of 
marriage.  The justice minister made an attempt to include a 
definition but only in a way that legal advice has told us could 
be struck down.  The definition of marriage needs to be implanted 
in all of the 68 statutes affected by the bill; it should be 
embedded right in the text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One key issue people have brought to my attention is that the 
definition is important to them.  They would like to see it 
embedded in the bill, as witnessed by the thousands and thousands 
of signatures tabled in the House asking for the definition of 
marriage to be included in the bill and, if not, for the bill to 
be pulled in its entirety.  Yesterday we put forward some 
amendments to do so but they were voted down.  We have tried to 
include that definition through amendments to the bill, but the 
House chose to vote them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak a bit about the family as a whole in society and 
some of the things we have seen which are detrimental to strong 
families.  One is the tax system which is unfair to families 
where one parent chooses to stay at home.  We think tax breaks 
and lower taxes are essential in helping to create stronger 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is the child pornography issue.  The notwithstanding 
clause was not implemented to protect our children from people 
who use, sell and collect child pornography. In the B.C. case we 
asked members of the government to use the notwithstanding clause 
to keep that law in effect while the challenge went through the 
courts.  It chose not to do so.  It has been going on for a year 
and a half to two years now and it is still in abeyance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole child pornography issue has affected my work as well. 
I brought forward private member's Bill C-321 to amend the 
criminal code to allow equipment used in the production of child 
pornography to be seized by the courts and taken away from the 
people who use it.  In many cases in the criminal code this is 
allowed to happen and in the case of the production of child 
pornography it is not.  Hopefully one day that bill will be drawn 
and debated.  In the meantime I am pursuing the justice minister 
to have that change made in the laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue we deal with on a daily basis when we watch the 
erosion of families is that of sex offenders.  We wanted to have 
a registry of sex offenders.  If we add up all the issues, it 
comes back to what we think.  We need a definition of marriage in 
the act.  We need a definition of conjugality.  We need support 
for families.  We need to strengthen families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need attack after attack on the family unit to try to 
take away its authority.  Members of all parties have gone to 
world conferences where there has been an attack on families.  We 
as a country should recognize the importance of families and do 
things to strengthen them, not to undermine them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to make a comment and 
to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that a question was asked of the hon. 
Secretary of State for Financial Institutions when the question 
could easily have been asked of me.  It was a question about 
something I was reputed to have said, but the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre did not see fit to ask me when I was here.  I 
would like to comment on it a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of conjugality, which the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre either cannot understand or refuses to understand, was 
also elaborated by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It is a series of criteria that 
has been in existence for over 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never had a problem applying the definition of 
conjugality to married couples or heterosexual common law 
couples.  Why do we seem to have this problem of applying it to 
same sex common law couples?  Do we need to find out if people 
have sex? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only part of a conjugal relationship.  In fact 
there are many marriages, heterosexual common law relationships 
and others, that enjoy great relationships in which they may not 
have frequent sex or may have stopped having sex for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about the erosion of the family.  The gay and lesbian 
youth who have a high incidence of suicide, do they belong to 
families?  I would like to know if their families do not count. 
The families of committed same sex couples who have children, do 
their families count?  Or, are we to think that their families do 
not count, their children should not be seen to be children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the family keeps being brought up.  The family is 
important, but what these members do not do or refuse to 
understand is that same sex couples have children, same sex 
couples are parents, same sex couples are grandparents and same 
sex couples are children of and brothers and sisters of families. 
Are we only going to cherry-pick what we mean as a family?  I 
would like to ask the hon. member that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to respond.  The member just said that families were 
important, but.  Families are very important.  The problem is 
that there have just been too many buts, too many howevers and 
too many what ifs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to clarify conjugality the member for Calgary Centre 
asked the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism at a round 
table at CPAC if she was saying that two people who did not have 
a physical relationship would qualify under Bill C-23; yes or no. 
The minister responded by saying that if they fulfilled the other 
requirements of the conjugal relationship, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean? 
What are the other requirements?  Where is the definition of 
conjugality?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says it is not about that.  We are getting so many 
mixed messages from the government that people are confused as to 
what it means, why the definition is put in there.  The 
government should clarify it, take all the indecision away, put 
the minds of people who are questioning it at ease and put the 
definition of conjugality and the definition of marriage in the 
bill, wherever it needs to be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Lethbridge early in his speech raised the cost issue. 
He said that one of the issues involved in this bill was cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he squares that with the fact that everyone in 
Canada is a taxpayer, whether or not they live in a same sex 
relationship, an opposite sex relationship, whether they live 
alone or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does he square that with the fact that people who are being 
addressed in this bill are taxpayers?  Why would he continue to 
want to discriminate against them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, while it is reassuring that 
the member opposite admits that everyone in this country is a 
taxpayer, or will be a taxpayer, and this is important, he is 
missing the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that Canadian taxpayers are concerned.  Certainly 
when a bill comes before the House they have the right to know 
what component it is, how much their taxes are going to rise to 
support that initiative, whether it is this initiative or 
whatever ministry it comes from.  They have a right to know what 
the cost is going to be to them through the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he missed the point.  Canadians have a right to know 
what this is going to cost. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak once again on Bill C-23. 
This is the third opportunity I have had to speak on this very 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by summarizing some of the points I made 
earlier.  They are points that I have not heard refuted or 
rebutted at all in the House by government members.  I would 
invite the minister or the secretary of state for 
multiculturalism to listen for herself and hear the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the facts.  The outline of my argument at the beginning 
of debate was that this was an “A equals B equals C” logical 
arrangement being put in place by the government.  What it is 
really doing is equating common law partnerships to same sex 
unions and equating those to married relationships, in fact, in 
the eyes of the law, making all three the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard that refuted by the government.  The only thing 
I have heard is from the Minister of Justice who said that people 
who are married are able to divorce and that the Divorce Act 
applies in their case, but the Divorce Act does not apply in the 
case of common law partnerships as the new terminology would have 
it in this bill.  That is the only difference highlighted by the 
minister, so in fact she is agreeing that what the bill does is 
put marriage on the same footing as common law partnerships, both 
heterosexual and same sex.  That is what she is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of multiculturalism questions her own comprehension 
as I hear her muttering under her breath.  It is quite clear that 
she does not understand the argument she and the government are 
putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are saying in effect with this bill is that they 
believe in sexual egalitarianism, that anyone can choose whatever 
arrangements they like and the state will treat such arrangements 
in exactly the same way through public policy.  That is the net 
effect of Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a minister of the crown.  Certainly she must 
be able to follow the logic of her own argument and the logic of 
the government bringing in this bill.  She seems to be unaware of 
this fact.  That is baffling and it should highlight for 
Canadians that the ground the government is standing on is very 
weak. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its defence has been a few arguments, one of which I will call 
the name game that I referred to earlier, that is that anybody 
who would stand and oppose this bill on the logical grounds that 
the bill simply does not make sense is called names.  We know the 
whole host of names that has been spouted out by members of the 
government.  In fact, that is an argument and a tactic used to 
shut down debate.  That is what we call intellectual bullyism. 
That is exactly what the minister and members of her government 
participate in.  When there is no strong argument based on logic, 
then hurl names at other people and those people will not stand 
in their places to poke holes in your weak and flimsy arguments. 
That is a tactic employed by this government.  It is a tactic 
that I saw many times used in my previous life as a teacher on 
the schoolyard.  It is the same tactic that is being used here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has to understand that there are people, not only 
in this House, members of the Canadian Alliance, but across the 
country who will stand up for what they believe to be true even 
in the face of being called names by those who assume that they 
are in the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of my argument which I explained earlier is the 
notion of absolutism versus relativism.  When a government 
rejects the notion of truth and that there is any such thing as 
right and wrong, it is on very weak ground.  In fact, when it 
makes the argument that what it proposes is right, that argument 
implodes upon itself.  How can one possibly say that what you 
choose to do is okay with you and what I choose to do is okay 
with me, but what I am choosing is actually what is right and 
what you are choosing is wrong?  That whole argument of 
relativism upon which the government bases Bill C-23 is very weak 
and flimsy and does not hold water.  It is like saying “What I 
believe to be true is right and everybody else should believe 
what I believe”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one enters into that line of thinking as the government has 
done here, what one really is doing is imposing one's perspective 
on people.  It is imposing one's moral perspective on people. The 
members say that this is nonsense but if they followed the 
logical conclusions of their own arguments, they would see that 
they are basing Bill C-23 on a fallacy that does not hold water, 
that does not stand up to the rigours of intellectual debate. 
They are weak and flimsy arguments veiled with name calling. 
That is all they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of this bill is to equate all relationships as being 
the same.  The minister talked about discriminatory practices. 
She is a minister of the crown that discriminates against certain 
arrangements.  Right now if a man chooses to marry two women, he 
is discriminated against.  What if he is in an arrangement of 
three people?  Let us call it a triad.  The government 
discriminates against that.  I do not see the minister standing 
up to argue that there should be an extension of benefits to this 
arrangement, yet she said that there should be an extension of 
benefits to another arrangement.  This is the logical outgrowth 
of this kind of reasoning that says that we are basing the law on 
the concept of sexual egalitarianism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our society we have always said that marriage is a very 
important institution.  In fact, our society is built on it. 
Because marriage is so important, we assign benefits and require 
obligations from those who enter into that arrangement because it 
is the arrangement that provides for the building of a society. 
Now what the minister and the government are doing is saying that 
they think marriage is a social invention, that it is not an 
institution that has any immutable characteristics of good in and 
of itself, but it is just some social arrangement that people 
decided was a good way to go and now we will go a different way. 
We will open the door to any set of groups of individuals who 
would choose to come before us and argue their case and receive 
like benefits as those who are married. 
That is a dangerous road to go down as a society.  I do not think 
the minister understands the implications of what she is 
proposing in this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very telling what the government has done in this place in 
voting down amendments that would put in the definition of 
marriage as the union of a single man and a single woman to the 
exclusion of all others.   It voted against those amendments time 
and time again, about 100 times last night in this place.  It is 
signalling with its actions that it is not willing to protect 
that definition of marriage.  We have seen in this place what has 
happened in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Centre and I were in this place in 
1997 and brought forward a debate on the Rosenberg decision in 
Ontario.  We pleaded with the government when that court 
redefined spouse to include same sex.  It went way beyond the 
boundaries of what was intended by parliament.  We asked the 
government to appeal that case because it would set a precedent 
that would later on be used in other court cases to redefine 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are those who are pushing this bill who want 
to see that, the redefinition of marriage to include same sex 
individuals.  What was the government's action?  It did not even 
put up a defence in 1997 when spouse was redefined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadians trust this group when the challenge comes 
because there are those who are committed to challenging the 
definition of marriage?  How can Canadians trust this group here 
who did not even defend the definition of spouse to defend 
marriage?  A group must be judged on its actions.  Empty words 
and rhetoric do not hold water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would implore Canadians to examine the actions of 
the government and what it is doing in proceeding on this path 
with Bill C-23 and building it on the notion of sexual 
egalitarianism.  It is signalling to Canadians that it no longer 
holds the institution of marriage as a sacred institution in the 
building block of society.  The Canadian Alliance thinks that is 
wrong and we will stand up against this kind of move from the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. 
member.  It is a very simple one.  It is that the hon. member 
speaks about marriage and the fact that marriage is really the 
only viable institution that we should discuss.  Is the hon. 
member then suggesting that common law relationships on a 
heterosexual basis that have existed now in the law for over 40 
years, that have given benefits and obligations to heterosexual 
common law couples, are therefore to be cancelled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly did not 
indicate that in my speech.  That relationship which the law has 
interpreted as being equivalent to marriage, heterosexual common 
law relationships, provide much the same function as those within 
a marriage; that is that they are able to live together for an 
extended period of time and to procreate and to have children, 
which is the building block of society.  I think that is the 
intention of what happened when the government extended the 
envelope to include common law couples because they serve in very 
much the same way as a building block to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister is saying is that she wants to extend that 
envelope to include individuals who by the very nature of their 
relationship do not have that function and ability of 
procreation.  That is the envelope that this minister is pushing 
and it opens the door to other possibilities and arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens when the minister throws the notion of what 
marriage is about and the inherent good within that relationship 
of marriage and leads Canadians down this path.  The minister 
continues not to realize that.  That is quite surprising.

should think about the Reform Party, the CCRAP party and the 
Alliance party in that order. 
There is a triad from which we certainly want to keep our 
distance.

this great parliament in terms of Bill C-23.

doing so, try to pit region against region in this great country, 
and people against people.  Ours is not as they would have it, 
the politics of destruction, grievance, hatred and pitting people 
against people.  Ours, rather, is the politics of hope— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  That is a little over the top.  Is this a debate or a 
barroom brawl? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We hope it is not a barroom brawl.  I 
know the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington will put his 
question directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  As I was saying, Mr. Speaker, ours is the 
politics of hope and reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Listen to them laugh.  I remind those 
members opposite:  Stockwell Day, go away; anti-choice, anti-gay: 
Stockwell Day, make my day; right wing bigot, go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is who those people are.  That is exactly who they are. 
That is what Ontarians think about those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the very party which talks about free votes all 
the time last night voted in a block?  They are the very people 
who talk about grassroots support and what it means to have a 
free vote.  Why did they vote in a block? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member talks about 
being the party of hope.  The only hope for all Canadians is that 
the Liberals will be defeated as soon as possible and the 
Canadian Alliance will bring forward some positive ideas about 
how to govern the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the member use the tactic—and he mentioned 
that he was here for my speech, but obviously he was not—of 
name-calling when he simply has nothing good to say— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We cannot refer to a member's absence or attendance in this 
House.  However, for the record, I was here, and I listened with 
some— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think that is a point of debate and 
not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would conclude by 
saying that what the government voted against yesterday was a 
definition of marriage in the bill, over a hundred times.  What 
the member says is outrageous.  What the member says is an 
instrument of destruction and hatred, and that what people of my 
ilk do is put forward a definition of marriage in legislation. 
That is the very offensive act that we were participants in last 
night and I plead guilty.  I will plead guilty every day that I 
stand for marriage and stand against the Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this debate in another direction, 
in a direction that I hope members opposite, indeed all members, 
will be interested to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by saying that I support this bill.  I support this bill 
because it does what needs to be done, and what needs to be done 
and why this bill exists in the first place is that it defines 
same sex relationships as outside marriage and it defines 
marriage as the lawful union of one man and one woman.  I support 
it.  It is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I bring forward is that while the opposition, 
obviously being the opposition it must oppose the bill, this is 
right and proper and it has to find all the means to oppose the 
bill, I would like to concentrate my remarks on the fact that 19 
members of my own party voted against the report stage motion 
yesterday. 
There is a good chance those same 19 Liberals—maybe more, maybe 
less—will vote against this legislation when it comes before the 
House tonight.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for my colleagues.  I think it may be of 
great interest to you, Mr. Speaker, to comprehend why some of us 
who share exactly the same values, the same Liberal values if you 
will, the same values about family, and the same concerns about 
protecting the traditional definition of marriage and so on and 
so forth, would vote against this legislation, which I believe is 
very good legislation, and some would vote for it on this side 
exclusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go back a bit to understand where this bill comes 
from.  I am one of the ones who promoted it originally.  The 
reason I promoted it was because it was becoming very clear that 
unless parliament acted the courts were going to define marriage 
and spouse as a same sex relationship.  It was coming.  It was 
occurring at the Ontario Court of Appeal level and in various 
other court cases.  This has been a fear of mine for a very long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first time I voted against my own government was when I 
voted against Bill C-33 when it came up in 1995.  I voted against 
my government because it failed in that legislation to define 
marriage and to define a same sex relationship in the context of 
a legally married relationship.  I voted against that legislation 
precisely because it left it to the courts.  Finally, this bill 
produces the definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with a 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me examine what happened yesterday.  The 19 Liberals who 
voted against the government voted on Motion No. 5, moved by the 
member for Scarborough Southwest.  The member's motion, which was 
echoed by other motions from the opposition, would have had the 
definition of marriage as the lawful union of one man and one 
woman, which is in the bill, repeated in every piece of 
legislation that the bill affects.  In other words, this is an 
omnibus bill and it affects 68 other statutes.  It defines in 
those statutes that same sex partnerships, for the purposes of 
benefits or anything else, are to be seen in the same sense as a 
common law partnership.  That should have been sufficient, but 
the member for Scarborough Southwest felt that this should be 
repeated in every bit of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the position that to have marriage defined in law when it 
was only defined in common law is a huge step forward.  In fact, 
by all analyses, that should be sufficient to guarantee that 
marriage legally is only a heterosexual relationship.  So why did 
the member for Scarborough Southwest feel it was so important to 
repeat this in every statute affected by Bill C-23? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, he did it because he does not 
trust the courts to interpret or to see this definition of 
marriage that exists in Bill C-23.  He does not trust the courts 
in future arbitrations that will involve the definition of 
marriage to pay due attention to the piece of legislation that we 
have passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he take that position?  This is the bad news, and it is 
very unfortunate.  I hope the justice minister and all Canadians 
are listening.  The reality is that members on this side of the 
House no longer trust our own justice department.  The problem is 
that on this side of the House there is a sense that people in 
the justice department are resisting common sense measures to 
define issues like this because they have some kind of secret 
agenda.  I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that I have heard time 
and time again on this side of the House, on all kinds of 
legislation, the observation that we cannot trust the 
impartiality of justice department officials.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hesitate to say that because a great many of the 
justice department officials are very competent and very sincere 
in what they do.  But there is no question that an element of 
suspicion has been created among parliamentarians and the justice 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples.  It goes back to the original gun 
control bill.  It was one thing to have legislation creating a 
scheme for controlling firearms, but what we found on this side 
of the House was that it was very difficult to get even the most 
common sense amendments to that legislation.  Then, there are 
countless other examples since I have been a parliamentarian 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a bill on electronic monitoring that would have 
enabled the authorities to affix a transmitter to a person who 
was never even charged with a crime.  There were bills that 
limited the rights of the accused to get the documents of his 
accusers when it was a case of a sexual assault charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in this very same bill that we have before us, in my 
original speech at second reading I suggested that we change the 
word “conjugal” to “sexual intimacy”, because “conjugal” 
was used by error in the wrong sense by a judge who did not know 
language sufficiently well.  Yet the justice department, which 
could have made the change and could have made everyone feel 
better, opted to carry on with the word “conjugal”, which in 
fact implies a heterosexual relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing that we have before us is legislation that 
is good.  It does do what needs to be done.  It does define 
marriage and it does give benefits to same sex couples in a way 
that does not conflict with traditional values.  But we have this 
feeling on this side of the House that this bill is not as 
perfect, is not as complete, is not as polished and as well aimed 
as it could be because we believe, or some believe on this side 
of the House, that there is some kind of hidden agenda which 
means that later on the justice department may take this to 
court.  Because the justice department creates laws in the House, 
it also defends them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have this very uneasy situation that worries a lot of us 
around here, that we are not entirely certain that the people who 
produce the legislation for the government, who advise the 
government on its legislation, are indeed as impartial as they 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the justice minister thinks about this, and that the 
justice department officials themselves think about this, because 
this criticism is long overdue.  I am sorry it has to appear on a 
piece of legislation that, in my mind, is excellent legislation. 
It brings back to parliament the definition of marriage and the 
definition of same sex relationships.  It is exactly what 
parliament should have done long ago, but unfortunately the 
optics are not what they should be because perhaps the 
legislation is not as thoroughly aimed as it could have been.  In 
that sense, the 19 members on this side of the House who are not 
willing to support this legislation do have a point, and I regret 
that is the situation.

everyone has their own views as to what makes a healthy country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, more important than more money in my pocket I want to 
build a society based on sound values.  I want my family to feel 
safe and secure and to feel that they have the opportunity to be 
as good as they can be.  I want to know that every Canadian has a 
roof over their head, food to keep them nourished, a health care 
system to care for their medical needs and an education system 
that allows everyone the opportunity to learn and to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These I believe are the first priorities of a healthy society. 
They would provide all Canadians with the tools they need to 
pursue their dreams and to be contributing members of society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on January 30, 1994, Deborah Starr-Stephan, a mother of 
10 and beloved wife of Tony Stephan, took her life.  In 1993 her 
husband, after exhausting all other options, was forced to 
declare bankruptcy.  From that point forward his family was 
unceasingly harassed by overzealous Canada customs and revenue 
agents.  With her family driven into extreme hardship, unable to 
cope with the immense stress she was under, Deborah Stephan 
committed suicide.  This should never have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1997 the official opposition proposed a 
taxpayers' bill of rights and an office for the taxpayers' 
protection.  The government needs to adopt this proposal so 
Canadians such as the Stephan family are protected from the 
summary treatment and abusive actions of CCRA agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without enacting a strong taxpayers' bill of rights, the CCRA 
could be plagued with the same accountability problems that makes 
the IRS the most hated agency in the United States.

Day is the largest single day celebration of reading and book 
buying in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year Public Works and Government Services Canada is playing 
a major role in supporting this event. A quarter of a million 
items have been distributed to Canadians through our department's 
active network of over 700 bookstores. Today there is a promote a 
book table in the rotunda of Centre Block to display key 
government publications and to distribute additional promotional 
items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to take time out of their busy day to 
visit the display in the rotunda.

of Montreal are public assets funded out of the public purse.

win back the confidence of the public and elected

There will be no question of repeating the practices being

forward by the Iranian government concerning the prosecution of

to bolster the Prime Minister of Canada's image, which is

what a statesman he is and how deft he is at international

independence as a bargaining tool”, he told Yasser Arafat in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals' so-called reforms to the unemployment insurance system 
have been devastating to Canada's unemployed.  These days only 
36% of unemployed Canadians qualify for EI benefits, down from 
87% in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In St. John's East the EI cuts are costing my constituency $50 
million annually.  In neighbouring St. John's West, in byelection 
country, they are costing it $56 million a year.  The riding of 
Burin—St. George's is losing $81.7 million annually and 
Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte is losing a further $74.7 million. 
All told, the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador has lost over 
$1 billion in EI revenues since the Liberals came to power in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the Liberals given back?  They have increased EI 
maternity leave from six months to a year.  However, given that 
only 31% of unemployed Canadian women actually qualify for 
benefits, that is very cold comfort.

this is National Volunteer Week and it gives us an opportunity to 
look at some of the profiles of our volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report entitled “Religion, Volunteering and Charitable 
Giving” there is one very startling correlation.  The more 
active one is religiously, the more active one is in making 
Canada a civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 14% of Canadians describe themselves as active religiously, 
but they make up 43% of the volunteers and contribute over 50% of 
the overall time volunteered.  In addition, they are responsible 
for over 65% of charitable giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the religiously inactive contributed in the same manner, 
donations would double and volunteer time would increase by 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members should congratulate those who are religiously active 
in their communities and who make our society more civil as a 
result of their faith and their commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all of my 
constituents, religiously active or otherwise, to find time and 
moneys to truly make a difference.

choosing and adequate time to prepare their defence in an open

will be tried in a closed, Iranian revolutionary court without 
their chosen legal counsel.

Indian affairs, HRD and the solicitor general's office, but it 
was the revenue department which got first prize today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue hands out more than $2 billion, mainly to large

Canadian Alliance members would have people believe that there 
were problems and that funds under the responsibility of the 
Department of Human Resources Development disappeared. They are 
once again trying to suggest that funds have disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to say that there is no mention of money having 
been lost in any department. It must also be understood that what 
the auditor general's report refers to goes back to 1994 and even 
long before that. But in 1994, a decision was made to set 
deadlines for claiming tax credits for research and development, 
resulting in 16,000 claims being submitted at the same time, all 
within a four month period.

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

money.  It is about the massive mismanagement of money in every 
single department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general, revenue plays favourites with 
who gets access to that cash.  In fact, less than 10% of 
companies who apply get 85% of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case the department spent nearly 10,000 hours trying to 
figure out how one guy could even qualify for the cash.  He ended 
up getting twice as much as he asked for.  Now, there is a real 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that every time anyone in the government sees a pot of 
taxpayers' cash, they just cannot resist the temptation to dish 
it out?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and

idea of what economic development is about, let alone tax credits 
for research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I explained, and this is important, is that, in 1994, for 
reasons of good management, it was announced in the budget that 
tax credits for research and development had to be claimed in the 
18 months following the year in which the money had been spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was that all the claims, some of them dating back to 
1985, were submitted at the same time. As a result, 16,000 
additional requests were submitted within a four month period. I 
feel that the department did a good job and that the auditor 
general's report tabled today will be a good tool to ensure that 
our program can be improved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They should be calling their department “Expenditure Canada”. 
Collect more in taxes this year?  Well, quick, spend it as 
quickly as possible before the public finds out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One applicant got a half million dollars more than he even asked 
for.  He was told, “Do not worry about it.  It is okay. It will 
not happen again, we promise”.  Then they were told, “Keep the 
cash”.

within the agency to ensure that all tax credit requests for 
research and development are reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions and appeal procedures were also used. Again, at the 
risk of repeating myself, the official opposition obviously 
cannot and will not understand. If the Canadian Alliance members 
were in government, there would be no business sector and no 
economic development in Canada. It is impossible to discuss 
program management with them. They cannot understand what it is 
about. As early as 1994, we began to deal with the 16,000 
additional requests, and I am proud of the work the agency has 
done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that, looking at all of the auditor general's

in the agency recognized the need to improve tax credit 
management, and the report will be of great use in that 
connection.

that they had already paid the subcontractor tens of millions of

head office of Revenue Canada multiplied it by two.  They were 
paid three times.  The taxpayers paid three times for the same

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been waiting for an MRI since December 1999.  I have 
constant pain and spasms in my neck.  I'm off work, have run out

the hon. member knows full well that over the course of the last 
14 months the government has increased by $14 billion the amount 
of transfers to provinces available for health, that just in the 
last 14 months the cash portion of the transfer has gone from 
$12.5 billion to $15.5 billion a year.  As the Prime Minister has 
said, we are prepared to sign on to even more funding long term 
if there is a sensible plan to address the kinds of difficulties 
the member has just referred to.

the bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His report points out that $2 billion have been mismanaged by 
those two departments in the application of the scientific

the auditor general noted serious weaknesses in the economic

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Prime Minister made a personal commitment to send Canadian

a very dangerous theatre of operations, one that could become 
extremely volatile and dangerous for Canadian soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did either the Minister of National Defence or the CDS

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a proud record in terms of 
peacekeeping in the Middle East.  In fact we have the command 
position at this point in time in the Golan Heights.  It is 
because the United Nations knows that Canada is dependable and 
can do a good job in peacekeeping.  That is what the Prime 
Minister was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an interest in the Middle East and continue to have one. 
We want to be of help.  If the UN puts a mission together we 
want to be there and be part of it, but of course we will do the

acceptable level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 
wake of the Prime Minister's decision last year to send Canadian

indicated that the military's operational tempo was too high. 
Since then the government has been very cautious in making 
peacekeeping commitments.

Middle East is one that I raised last fall when I was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to look at and assess this situation.  We want 
to be of help, as we have traditionally been.  We have less

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister knows, there are about 100 firefighters on 
Parliament Hill today asking parliament to make changes to the 
Canada pension plan so that they can qualify for early retirement 
benefits at the age of 55 and full benefits at the age of 60, 
instead of the current ages of 60 and 65. The minister is also 
aware that the House of Commons finance committee made a similar 
recommendation last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, will the minister now propose an amendment to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, an 
act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits 
and obligations, be read the third time and passed, and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments of the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He commented that Bill C-23 inappropriately used the term 
conjugal.  I agree with him.  We have made the comment a number 
of times in the House that not only is it inappropriate to use it 
in a same sex relationship, it is also probably irresponsible not 
to define it in a bill, particularly one which uses it so 
frequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was concerned when I understood him to say that the real 
problems with the bill were generated primarily from the 
bureaucracy in the justice department; that it really was not the 
justice minister who was responsible for bringing forward the 
bill in the manner that it is and structured as it is, with all 
its inherent weaknesses which we have itemized several times, but 
that the problem was really in the justice department.  I find 
that shocking.  Is he implying, by his own volition, that the 
justice minister does not have control of her department, that 
she cannot call the shots over the people who work in the 
ministry?  Certainly that was the tone of his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I said was that there is a 
certain lack of confidence that the justice department officials 
will deal with these issues impartially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what I said was that this is a very fine bill in the 
sense that it does define marriage and that it does define same 
sex relationships outside marriage.  The unfortunate thing is 
that there is a school of feeling on my own side that the 
lawyers, and particularly the justice department, will not defend 
this clause defining marriage when it comes up in other 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was trying to point out was that I think we have a 
problem where we have a justice department that creates the laws, 
advises the minister and then defends the laws.  I think it is 
fair to say that it is generally felt, there is a general feeling 
on all sides of the House, that the justice department is not 
always acting on behalf of parliament, but acting more on behalf 
of its interpretation of the charter rather than the 
interpretation of the charter as represented by the 
representatives of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that reply 
from the hon. member and I appreciate his candour. 
Certainly, it sounds to me like there are problems in that 
department and that the justice minister should be the one who is 
in charge.  She is ultimately responsible for what comes out of 
her department and she should act on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed in Bill C-23 that the definition of common law 
partner, which includes two people of the same sex in a conjugal 
relationship, is repeated in every statute.  In fact, it is 
repeated sometimes more than once in each of the statutes under 
Bill C-23.  Yet the justice minister and the justice department 
have deemed it not appropriate to put the definition of marriage 
in every statute.  It appears at the front of the bill, but it is 
not in the statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a legal opinion which says it will have no legal weight 
when a court challenge comes.  Therefore, is it not appropriate, 
in his mind, that our amendments which were voted down by the 
government yesterday should have been included?  If we can 
include a definition of common law partner, why not a definition 
of marriage which we have been advocating all the way along? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I repeat, Mr. Speaker, my view is that 
once you get the definition of marriage in law and once you get 
the definition of same sex couples as being outside marriage in 
law, that is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason the 19 on this side were not onside with the 
government and supported the member for Scarborough Southwest was 
because they are not confident that the lawyers and perhaps even 
the justice department will cite this clause in Bill C-23 when 
the issue of defining marriage or defining same sex partnerships 
comes up.  It is sad.  It is wrong.  It is unfortunate because we 
should have confidence that the laws we pass will be applied and 
will be defended adequately in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this is one of the problems we have with the 
supreme court interpreting the charter.  It is not that the 
supreme court is not doing its job; the real question is whether 
the interests of parliament are being defended adequately before 
the supreme court.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, those who are 
defending the interests of parliament are the very people who 
wrote the laws in the first place and are the very ones who 
advised the justice minister in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting is that we have to re-examine the 
relationship of the justice department in the creation of the 
laws and the defence of the laws.  I think we have to look at 
this whole issue and I suggest to members opposite that maybe it 
could be a motion for an opposition day.  I cannot do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great honour to rise today to speak to Bill C-23.  I 
think it is very important in terms of the kinds of measures that 
the government is taking in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by congratulating the Minister of Justice for 
putting together what I believe is a very fine piece of 
legislation and one which I think Canadians, for the most part, 
wherever they live in our great country, will not only respect 
but also welcome.  I want to indicate at the outset that I think 
it is a good move and that Canadians, ultimately and 
historically, will applaud the fact that we are moving in this 
all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the debate on Bill C-23 over the last little 
while and I have to say that some members opposite, the reformed 
CRAP alliance party members, have in fact gone repeatedly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Speaker ruled clearly several Mondays ago, and the ruling has 
been upheld repeatedly by the Speaker, that the name of our party 
is Canadian Alliance, and we should— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you will recall that I said 
the reformed CRAP party, the alliance people.  Now, having said 
that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise again on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are not going to 
get into this.  The hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington will go 
to the text of his dissertation, and I will look after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are fair and 
even-handed, as always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found not so long ago was that in listening to members 
opposite I was quite astonished, to put it frankly and bluntly, 
at some of the misconceptions that they seem to want to 
perpetuate, and the myths too.  For example, I listened prior to 
question period to the member for Dewdney—Alouette.  I listened 
to the member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands who, when I was 
speaking, talked about a barroom brawl. 
Is that not interesting coming from members opposite, a barroom 
brawl.  I would have thought that they could do better than to be 
hanging out in bars, never mind brawling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Nanaimo—Cowichan was quoted recently in the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I>.  He said “A gradual blurring of the sexes 
has occurred that gave young men growing up in many female 
dominated single parent homes an identity crisis”.  This, 
according to him, has led to the rise in “militant 
homosexuality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to state that he was unable, however, to explain why 
he believes that single mother families encouraged such 
homosexual militancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compare that to the member for Yorkton—Melville, again one of 
those Alliance people with extremist views which are way out in 
left field, and other right wing nonsense.  He was quoted as 
saying in a press release “In the 1950s buggery was a criminal 
offence.  Now it is a requirement to receive benefits from the 
federal government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not so long ago that the party opposite made reference to 
gays and blacks, saying they should be relegated to the back of 
the bus.  That is a direct quotation from those members.  It is 
amazing that these people opposite keep perpetuating that kind of 
nonsense, that kind of hatred, discrimination and bigotry.  I 
suppose we could say it is part and parcel of who they are and 
what they represent, but it is very sad that they would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do, instead of focusing on the negative nonsense 
of the Alliance people, no matter what they call themselves, is 
to focus on the positive, which is that we on the government side 
defend tolerance, compassion and caring.  Unlike those people who 
stand for and are representatives of the politics of extremism 
and bigotry, we represent the politics of hope and 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what decent Canadians expect of their government: 
caring, compassion and tolerance.  That is precisely what the 
Minister of Justice and the government have proceeded to do in 
this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on in terms of the kinds of myths that members 
opposite are perpetuating.  In fact, I want to do that right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened for the last couple of days to some of the 
speeches.  I want to point out that Bill C-23 is not about 
marriage.  In fact, on this side of the House last year we 
supported the motion which indicated that was not the case.  To 
have them rise time and time again to say that it is about 
marriage is really outrageous.  I do not know what kind of 
political spin or cheap political shots members opposite want to 
make in this area, but it really is quite unacceptable. Canadians 
see through their shenanigans, duplicity and hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not about marriage.  It is certainly not about 
relationships, dependent or otherwise.  It is not about sending 
in the sex police, as some members have alluded to in their 
convoluted way, suggesting that would occur.  Rather, we on the 
government side, in a positive, upbeat fashion, are saying that 
into the 21st century we will define ourselves in a manner 
consistent with the values of Canadians, which are tolerance and 
compassion.  That is why we are proceeding with Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was reaffirmed by a motion of parliament last year that 
marriage is the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion 
of all others.  We have repeated that in the bill to underscore 
the point.  If there are Canadians across this great country who 
do not feel the way I and other members of the government do, but 
rather agree with those on the opposite side, they can take 
comfort from knowing that there will not be a change in this very 
important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation is an omnibus bill.  I know that is 
well known.  It takes action on a number of fronts. 
Bill C-23 eliminates discrimination so that benefits and 
obligations that currently apply to common law, opposite sex 
couples will be extended to same sex couples as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to modernize obsolete language.  It repeals 
provisions of obsolete laws that are no longer needed and, where 
necessary, makes the kinds of modifications necessary in keeping 
with the kind of required omnibus legislation that we have before 
us.  I believe Canadians ultimately respect this.  In the process 
we are putting it into a contemporary context in keeping with who 
we are as Canadians as we move confidently into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go into some detail with respect to these changes.  There 
are 68 laws and statutes that will be affected and over 20 
departments and agencies of the federal government. Let me 
highlight some of the more important changes because I think for 
the record we should note them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “common law partner” is a new term to law but is used 
and understood by Canadians who have used the concept over time. 
In the French language its equivalent is conjoint de fait.  Every 
day in publications and in other media across Canada, we have 
heard these terms either in French or in English.  I think 
Canadians understand them for what they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 would standardize the definition of the term “common 
law partner” as unmarried, conjugal relationships of at least 
one year.  Similarly, the word “spouse” after passage of the 
legislation before us, would be referred consistently then to 
married persons only. It should be noted that the one year 
cohabitation period to qualify for benefits and subject to 
obligations is not new and is not changed by Bill C-23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the term “conjugal” has been used in federal 
legislation for 40 years to describe common law, opposite sex 
relationships.  The factors in determining a conjugal 
relationship will be the same then for opposite sex and same sex 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing is making sure that it fits into context in a 
modern, contemporary sense.  We are making sure that it makes 
sense in all kinds of areas.  I could point those out but I will 
not take the time now other than to say that things as far 
ranging as the Agriculture Marketing Programs Act to the War 
Veterans Allowance Act will be affected in this very important 
area.  It goes without saying that things like the Canada pension 
plan, bankruptcy and insolvency act and many other acts and 
statutes will be affected in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there are rights and responsibilities, there are also 
obligations.  It is important to note that we on the government 
side have recognized these all important concepts.  We have put 
them into perspective.  We have weighed them out and we have 
thought thoroughly and clearly, hard and long about what it means 
not only for us in the House, but Canadians wherever they live in 
this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, we have been able to come up with a very 
workable bill.  This is a bill that makes a great deal of sense. 
It accomplishes what the supreme court asked us to do.  It 
accomplishes, in my view, what Canadians expect the government to 
do in this important area.  In Ontario, Mr. Harris did the very 
same thing within 48 hours.  Why did he do that?  He did it 
because it made sense and it was also the right thing to do.  He 
did it because he knew that the supreme court judgment had to 
stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this great Parliament of Canada need to follow suit.  We 
need to modernize and update the very legislation that is 
important in this area.  That is precisely what we are doing.  I 
believe that ultimately Canadian people will judge us as having 
done the right thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech and he 
did make some very interesting references.  In fact, I would like 
to point out that he really showed his true colours at the 
beginning of his speech by not engaging in debate, but engaging 
in name calling, the lowest form of argument.  When one has 
nothing better to say and no logical reasoned arguments to make, 
they can always resort to the lowest form of argument, name 
calling.  That is exactly what this member has participated in 
here today and that is unfortunate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him two very specific questions.  I will be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one has to do with a comment made by his own House 
leader, the current House leader of the government, when he said 
“I object to any suggestion which would have homosexual couples 
treated in the same way as heterosexual couples” and he also 
went on to say “I do not believe homosexuals should be treated 
as families.  My wife, MaryAnn, and I do not claim we are 
homosexual.  Why should homosexuals pretend they form a family?” 
I would like to ask him if he agrees with that comment and I 
would also like to ask him why he was so opposed to including the 
definition of marriage in Bill C-23 which he voted against at 
report stage last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the 
allowing me the opportunity to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen day after day in this great House of Commons to the 
kind of thrust and parry that take place across the aisle and to 
the new leader of the Canadian Alliance, the member for Edmonton 
North.  This member speaks of name calling.  I watch the Leader 
of the Opposition very carefully and how she mocks the ministers 
and the Prime Minister, how she mocks language and speech and how 
she mocks and name calls.  That is just one example of how the 
people opposite behave in this great House of Commons.  It is 
unbelievable how they behave.  But Canadians see through that. 
They see through the duplicity of those people who say one thing 
and do another.  They see through the duplicity of people with 
their holier than thou attitudes who say something one way and 
then, quite frankly, answer from the opposite side of their 
mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get to the question that the hon. member asked.  We on 
the government side, in recognition of the sanctity of marriage, 
moved along expeditiously with supporting a motion last year that 
underlined what we believe, which is that marriage is the sole 
union between a man and a woman.  I do not know what it is about 
that the hon. member does not understand.  I do not know what 
cheap political points he wants to score, but Canadians see 
through that nonsense.  They see through it every time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member on the other 
side and I have to admit he is more than one ingredient short of 
the recipe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member this question.  What some of us 
who are opposed to this bill find difficult is to accept the 
lecturing that seems to go on and that those who are opposed to 
the bill are somehow opposed to democracy.  I finally have had it 
with being called a racist or a bigot because I cannot accept the 
fact that a spouse is a member of the same sex.  That is my right 
and, indeed, my responsibility.  I reject any attempt to try to 
muzzle people, to try to intimidate us and to paint this as some 
kind of human rights issue.  I do not see it in that light.  That 
was said by the hon. member for Mississauga West, a Liberal.  I 
will stand up and call him a racist and bigot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it really is hard to answer 
the member opposite when he gets up on his hind legs and behaves 
the way he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about ingredients.  What kind of ingredient does he 
have?  Look, by the way, at his very thin skin and the fact that 
he raised issues like bigotry and racism.  I did not do so, but 
he did.  Methinks he doth protest too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really obvious who the people opposite are.  Last night 
was a telling vote because they are the people who talk about 
grassroots participation.  They are the people who talk about 
free votes.  Yet if we look, to a person last night, they all 
voted, en masse, en bloc.  Why?  It was because they were all 
whipped into voting the way they did.  They are the people who 
talk about grassroots.  They are the people who talk about free 
votes.  What duplicity.  What hypocrisy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to follow my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in 
this final part of the debate on Bill C-23, the Modernization of 
Benefits and Obligations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House that this bill was introduced on 
February 11, 2000 and that it is basically designed, for reasons 
of equity, to modernize certain benefits and obligations in order 
to guarantee that partners in a common law relationship, whether 
of the same or opposite sex, are treated equally under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed in this bill must guarantee, in keeping 
with the supreme court decision of May 1999 in M v H, that 
same sex couples in a common law relationship have the same 
advantages and the same obligations as opposite sex couples in a 
common law relationship, and the same access as other couples in 
Canada or Quebec to the benefits to which they have contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that I am sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, who will be speaking on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois after me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that this bill is the culmination 
of multiple and long-standing efforts by people who have been 
long engaged in the battle to eliminate discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. This is a battle in which Quebec has played a 
lead role, as it was the first to enact legislation incorporating 
sexual orientation among the illegal grounds for discrimination. 
It did so by amending its charter of rights and freedoms, back in 
1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 is therefore the culmination of a lengthy battle by 
many members of society, regardless of their own opinions about 
sexual orientation or their personal choice of orientation.  It 
is the culmination of numerous attempts to change federal or 
provincial legislation. It is also the culmination of successes 
at the provincial level, for several pieces of legislation have 
been passed to put an end to discrimination in various Canadian 
provinces where benefits were concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that as the debate at third reading of Bill C-23 draws 
to a close it is important to remember how this legislative 
saga began and to put this bill into context. Like many members of my 
party, I hope it will be passed by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that the Parliament of Canada had 
decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting adults more 
than 30 years ago, in 1969.  Seven years later, in 1976, the 
Immigration Act removed homosexuals from the category of persons 
denied entry into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently, there were hardly any other federal legislative 
initiatives with respect to the legal aspects of homosexuality. 
Numerous private member's bills to prohibit discrimination based 
on orientation were introduced in the House of Commons between 
1980 and 1992, but none of them made it past first reading. 
Nor did the proposed amendments to other statutes with a view to 
eliminating certain forms of discrimination based on sexual 
orientation succeed either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1992, then Minister of Justice Kim Campbell 
introduced Bill C-108, which would have added sexual orientation 
to the prohibited grounds in the Canadian Human Rights Act and 
defined a married individual in strictly heterosexual terms.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill S-15, introduced in the Senate by Senator 
Noel Kinsella, was to add sexual orientation to the prohibited 
grounds in the same Canadian Human Rights Act.  This bill was 
passed in June 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when parliament was dissolved in September 1993, after 
a general election was called, this bill, as well as Bill C-108, 
died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, parliament passed Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
criminal code. 
The bill provided that evidence establishing that a crime was 
motivated by hate or by bias based on a number of personal 
characteristics was an aggravating circumstance that should lead 
to the imposition of a harsher sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of sexual orientation in these personal 
characteristics generated a great deal of opposition. That was 
in part due to the opinion expressed by some that this would 
lead to the inclusion of the sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, or 
that it would otherwise lead to the erosion of traditional 
family values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that opposition, Bill C-41 received royal assent in 
July 1995 and came into effect the following year, in September 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of the same year, just a few months before the 
coming into effect of Bill C-41, Senator Noël Kinsella came back 
with Bill S-2, which was similar to Bill S-15 and which sought to 
add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination 
under section 3 of the federal act, and under section 16, which 
deals with equal access or affirmative action. The bill was 
adopted by the Senate in April 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention a private member's bill, Bill C-265, 
introduced by the member for Burnaby—Douglas, whom I salute for 
the personal fight that he has been leading on these issues— 
which did not go beyond first reading stage in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 29, 1996, the Liberal government of the day, through 
the Minister of Justice at the time, introduced Bill C-33 to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act by adding sexual orientation 
to the list of illegal grounds of discrimination based on sexual 
orientation.  This bill was finally passed by both the House of 
Commons and the Senate and received royal assent on June 20, 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also not fail to mention the efforts of my colleague, the 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, or party's critic for these 
matters.  He too introduced bills in November 1994, May 1996 and 
again in February 1998 and March 1999 to end this discrimination 
in federal legislation.  These bills, like many private members' 
bills, came to nought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we reach the final stage of the passage of this bill.  Its 
passage follows on the unanimous adoption by the National 
Assembly of Quebec of a bill with similar goals amending various 
legislative provisions pertaining to common law spouses and 
putting an end to the discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation found in the laws of Quebec.  Ontario has done the 
same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore high time that the Parliament of Canada, and 
this House of Commons in particular, followed the path taken by 
other lawmakers, that is the path of equality, and gave real 
meaning to the concept of equality contained in our charters.

Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments.  I understand 
that he is a man with considerable academic credentials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have presented petitions in the House from people in Quebec 
who have asked for the definition of marriage to be reaffirmed in 
statute.  I also have in my hand a legal opinion from a senior 
counsel in Toronto who has basically said that the approach to 
define marriage as a union of a man and woman at the front end of 
an omnibus bill but not in the statute will not bring into force 
any legally binding definition of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the petitions from Quebec and the attempts of the 
official opposition to put the definition of marriage in the 
statutes where it will have significant legal effect and express 
the will of the House, would the member condone this?  If so, 
would he support the motion that this bill be referred back to 
the justice committee to consider including a meaningful 
definition of marriage in the statutes that the bill addresses? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would say to the 
member that it should be noted that in Quebec, as elsewhere in 
Canada and indeed in the world, there are various positions on 
the equality of persons with different sexual orientations, 
which are sometimes rooted in religious beliefs and sometimes in 
prejudices that a healthy upbringing could perhaps eliminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These differences must be noted, but the will of parliaments 
here and elsewhere in the world to end discrimination must not 
be thwarted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this bill is the culmination of many efforts made 
by those with the most interest in these issues, those who have 
often been the victims of discrimination.  This bill will 
finally give them true access to equality and the right to 
benefits they have been denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of marriage and its definition is touched on in 
this bill.  The Liberal government has decided to include an 
interpretation clause that may be along the lines of recognizing 
that marriage is reserved for opposite sex couples.  This debate 
will have to continue.  It is one that the Canadian Alliance 
will perhaps, and quite legitimately, wish to pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us, the fact that this question is not necessarily 
definitively resolved in this bill should not prevent us—at least 
not most of us—from being in favour of a restorative bill that 
will grant a too-long-denied equality on same sex couples.

Speaker, I realize that my colleague opposite comes from the 
civil code tradition but perhaps he could explain to our 
colleague from Calgary Centre that the definition of marriage 
already exists in common law, which has the full force and effect 
of legislation passed by the House.  It was unanimously endorsed 
by the House of Commons and is being reaffirmed in the bill now 
before the House.  Maybe he could explain that to our colleague 
from Calgary Centre.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that marriage is 
defined in both the Civil Code of Quebec and Canadian common 
law.  This is a definition that can evolve, that has evolved in 
other national jurisdictions, that can do so here in Canada, and 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, however, to be able to believe that the whole 
issue of the definition of marriage, even if addressed in this 
bill, will continue to be debated.  I believe that our societies 
are undergoing such changes that not only will common law unions 
be recognized but also that partnerships between persons of the 
same sex will be given more formal recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is debate that is not over. 
It ought not to be, because there are those who support a more 
formal recognition of common law unions between persons of the 
same sex.  There are others who wish to see marriage reserved 
for people of opposite sexes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate will progress as our society progresses.  I trust 
that this change will take place within the context of respect 
for institutions and also of respect for convictions.  I hope 
that it will, above all, take place with respect for the 
equality of men and of women. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to explain the nature and the purpose of 
this bill.  There are those who would have us think it covers a 
much broader range of situations than is actually the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has nothing to do with marriage or adoption. 
Basically, for reasons of fairness, it seeks to amend certain 
benefits or obligations so that couples living in common law 
relationships, whether those relationships are same sex or 
opposite sex, are treated equally before the law.  That is the 
essential purpose of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that the proposed amendments do is give effect to the May 
1999 supreme court decision in M and H. The purpose of the bill 
is to amend 68 statutes so as to include same sex couples in the 
definition of common law couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 20 years, most provincial governments in Canada have 
brought in legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation.  The adoption of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms changed the legal framework with respect to 
the equality rights of homosexuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to note that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
was based heavily on the Quebec charter, which preceded it. 
Already in 1977, that charter specifically prohibited 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal aspects of sexual orientation have to do with two main 
principles: first, prohibiting discrimination in order to 
protect gays and lesbians against discriminatory actions; 
second, recognizing homosexual relationships, which implies 
granting the partners in these couples the benefits and 
guarantees enjoyed by unmarried heterosexual couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is therefore not about the institution of marriage, 
even though an amendment was made to specify that the word 
“marriage” means the lawful union of one man and one woman. I 
do not see the point of that provision, but if it can reassure 
some people, fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seeks to prohibit and eliminate the most pernicious forms of 
discrimination based on the individual characteristics of a group 
or an individual, including race, language, religion, but also 
sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill recognizes that society finds it unacceptable that 
certain groups not be treated fairly, including when it comes to 
social benefits and guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the bill includes sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination does not mean that 
homosexuality is either condoned or condemned, but rather that we 
are concerned about providing legal protection to individuals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the proposed amendments are not all one 
sided. They will provide new benefits to same sex couples, while 
also imposing new obligations on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few examples. In the area of taxation, the total 
household income will be taken into account for the purposes of 
the child tax benefit, which was not the case before. The incomes 
of both spouses will also be taken into account to determine 
eligibility for the guaranteed income supplement.

be subjected to the same restrictions regarding the transfer of 
properties or of their goods before declaring bankruptcy.

a shareholder, an associate or an administrator receiving 
financial assistance from a company will extend to same sex 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Bank Act, with respect to conflict of interest, the 
partner of a director will be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canada Elections Act, a returning officer cannot appoint 
a partner as a deputy returning officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Trust and Loan Companies Act, same sex partners are 
included in connection with additional fines the court may 
impose on the partner of a person convicted of an offence under 
the act who has acquired any monetary benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are obligations that did not exist.  There will be 
benefits, but obligations as well, so that these people will be 
treated as are all citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing unique or revolutionary about this bill.  I was 
saying that it arose out of many supreme court decisions.  All 
of these cases were won by those who had brought them before the 
court.  We are confronted to fact and law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997, a number of provinces have acted, including British 
Columbia.  They have amended their laws to include partners of 
the same sex.  In June 1999, for example, Quebec amended 28 laws 
and 11 regulations to give same sex couples the benefits and 
obligations as opposite sex couples living in a common law 
partnership.  In October 1999, Ontario, under Mike Harris, 
passed an omnibus bill amending 67 laws in accordance with a 
supreme court decision.  I think this reflects a realistic 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven provinces, the three territories and the federal 
government have passed legislation granting same sex survivor 
pensions to their employees. 
This is also the case for major Canadian cities in any region, 
British Columbia, the Prairies, Ontario, Quebec, the maritimes, 
for more than 200 Canadian companies in the private sector, 
hospitals, libraries, social service institutions and banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore a strong trend, if I can put it that way, 
aimed at adaptation to the modern world, to today's situation, 
to what we are experiencing today, to what we know exists even 
if some people want to hide its existence.  This is a reality 
that cannot be made to disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls confirm, moreover, that the public wants to see an end to 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
A 1998 Angus Reid poll reported 74% of respondents were in 
favour of federal benefits to same sex couples; 67% of 
respondents were of the opinion that same sex couples should 
receive the same benefits and also have the same obligations as 
common law spouses; 84% believed gays and lesbians should be 
protected from discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these results show, this bill meets the expectations of the 
public, who feel that discrimination based on sexual orientation 
is inappropriate.  This bill proposes some concrete measures 
that go beyond declarations of good intentions.  Going beyond 
sexual orientation, this legislation gives equal treatment to 
every citizen, regardless of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dealt with this situation some fifteen years ago when I was a 
union negotiator. 
In 1986, I believe I signed the first collective agreement, in 
Quebec anyway, giving same sex couples the same benefits as 
opposite sex couples.  This trend has continued, with the result 
that in the hotel industry, the sector in which I was 
negotiating at the time, most owners of hotels in Quebec 
recognize this reality.  And this did not entail huge costs 
because these people pay taxes just like you and I do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this is not a bill about sexuality or marriage—it is 
a bill about equity.  I understand that some people are hesitant 
because of some of their values, often rooted of course in 
religious beliefs, but the religious beliefs of some must not 
become the law governing others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religion is an individual affair for which I have the greatest 
respect, but it must not be imposed on others.  On occasion, we 
must recognize values that we do not necessarily share but that 
are held by others who in no way interfere with or denounce our 
beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, I think that this bill corrects the injustices we 
are now experiencing and have experienced for a long time.  I 
believe it is time that we brought our laws into line with 
reality and the readiness of Canadians and Quebecers to accept 
those whose orientation is different but who are making a 
contribution to our society, just as they, I and we all do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am really pleased to have this opportunity today to contribute 
to the debate on Bill C-23, the modernization of benefits and 
obligations act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus legislation is about fairness and about equality 
for all people in common law relationships, but since it still 
does not seem to be fair to some members of the House, I will 
take this opportunity to state what this bill is about and how we 
got to where we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its core, this bill is about ending discrimination.  The 
courts have made it clear that benefits and obligations extended 
to common law opposite sex couples must be extended to common law 
same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent court and tribunal cases under the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act have found 
that federal policies and programs discriminate unfairly on the 
basis of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 20, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on the issue 
of spousal support in the case of M. v H.  The spousal support 
provisions of the Ontario Family Law Act were found to be in 
violation of the charter and that they unfairly denied same sex 
unmarried couples legal treatment available to opposite sex 
unmarried couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the M. v H. decision, the government of Ontario was given 
six months to amend its family law legislation.  Following M. v 
H., most of the other provincial jurisdictions also announced 
that they too would amend their laws to gain compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill before the House today is to ensure 
equal treatment in federal legislation for same sex and opposite 
sex common law couples, while preserving the clear legal 
distinction between unmarried couples and married persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill uses the term spouse or common law partner, in French 
un époux ou conjoint de fait, where no neutral term could be 
found, such as survivor.  The terms common law partner and 
conjoint de fait are defined and include both opposite and same 
sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 amends 68 statutes to ensure they encompass common law 
opposite sex couples and extend benefits and obligations granted 
to common law opposite sex couples to same sex couples and their 
family members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus bill is about benefits and obligations.  The 
following are a few examples of some of the benefits and 
obligations.  It is useful to remind people that this is the 
substantive part of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Old Age Security Act, a low income married person or a 
common law opposite sex partner may claim a guaranteed income 
supplement which is determined on the combined income of both 
spouses or partners.  Bill C-23 would provide that eligibility to 
GIS for a common law same sex partner, based again on the 
combined income of both partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Pension Plan, the surviving spouse in a 
marriage, or the surviving partner in a common law opposite sex 
relationship, may qualify for survivor benefits, based on his or 
her spouse's or partner's contributions to the plan. 
Bill C-23 will provide that in similar circumstances.  The 
surviving partner in a common law same sex relationship would 
also qualify for survivor benefits based on his or her partner's 
contributions to the plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, there is a limit to the 
ability of married persons to transfer ownership of their home or 
property to their spouse prior to declaring bankruptcy.  Bill 
C-23 will provide that that common law opposite sex and same sex 
partner will be subject to the same limitations on transferring 
ownership of their home or property to their partner prior to 
declaring bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Bill C-23 should be endorsed by all parties for it is a 
necessary piece of legislation.  It has already been entrenched 
in provincial legislation and it is an end to discrimination and 
bringing fairness.  That is something that all Canadians should 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the chance to speak on this bill 
again.  I have been listening with some interest to comments from 
the other side of the House about how this legislation is going 
to undermine marriage and families.  Mr. Speaker, if you tried to 
book a church or a hotel in this city or in any city across 
Canada for a wedding in less than a year, I think you would know 
that the institution of marriage is alive and well and thriving 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have made the argument that only people married 
should be entitled to benefits and that the purpose of benefits, 
pension plans, health plans and so on is to assist in supporting 
a family with children.  I think that proposition would lead most 
people who contribute to benefits ineligible for those benefits. 
It would exclude any family, like mine, that has already had 
their children and no longer able to have children.  It would 
exclude any married couple that does not wish to have children, 
does not plan to have children or is unable to have children.  It 
would exclude anyone who does not fit the very narrow definition 
of the traditional family, that does not represent the majority 
of families in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate members opposite have stated that Bill C-23 is 
further evidence of this government's anti-family agenda.  This 
kind of hyperbole may make good sound bytes and good headlines, 
but it does not make a lot of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the provisions of Bill C-23.  A member opposite 
made a reference this morning to “good families”.  This 
member's definition of a good family is a mother and father who 
are married and have children.  Everyone else is excluded from 
what is a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, what about lone parent families?  What 
about couples without children, families where the parents are 
common law partners, either opposite sex or same sex?  Are these 
bad families by inference?  I do not think so.  I think most of 
them have the same commitments as those who happen to be married, 
to look after each other, to share with each other and to 
contribute to their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that there are many types of families 
in this country.  This government's agenda supports families and 
does not make distinctions between what is a good or a bad 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A significant number of the provisions of Bill C-23 have been 
drafted to allow common law partners, either same sex or opposite 
sex, to name each other as beneficiaries in their pension plans, 
pension plans I remind the members opposite, which they 
contribute to either as employees or as taxpayers. These 
provisions in Bill C-23 do not take away existing benefits from 
other couples from what would fit the opposition's definition of 
a good family.  They will not take away pension provisions for 
children.  In fact, these amendments will provide additional 
protection for children whose parents are in common law 
relationships.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23 will encourage common law couples, both opposite sex 
and same sex, to plan for the financial future of their partners, 
reducing the burden on the state when people are left destitute. 
How can encouraging people in committed, caring relationships to 
look after each other be a threat to the family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is Bill C-23 anti-family when it repeals the last few 
remaining references in federal law to illegitimate children? 
What a horrendous reference. I give great credit to my colleague 
from Ottawa Centre for introducing a private members' bill on 
this subject, to remove that horrible term from all federal 
legislation.  It is finally done in Bill C-23.  It has finally 
put every child on the same footing in this society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how Bill C-23 can be anti-family when it amends a 
provision in the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal Act that 
will allow common law partners to be included in the list of next 
of kin who may receive a medal on behalf of a partner who is 
awarded a medal posthumously.  How is amending that provision 
anti-family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is Bill C-23 anti-family when it removes from the Bills of 
Exchange Act antiquated reference to “his wife, his clerk or his 
servant” or the obsolete reference to the “father, son or 
brother of a master” which currently appears in the section from 
the Trade Unions Act which is being repealed in this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is Bill C-23 anti-family by amending the Bridges Act to 
clarify that common law partners may also be included in the list 
of persons who can establish a claim in the event of an injury or 
death of a partner on a bridge?  How is it anti-family when it 
amends the Carriage By Air Act by adding common law partners to 
the list of persons who can sue an air carrier for damages when 
there is a death of a passenger? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only a few of the examples of the provisions in Bill 
C-23.  Where is the threat to Canadian society when we encourage 
people in this legislation to have a mutual relationship of care 
and interdependence?  I think that strengthens society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not take away from society or families; rather it 
encourages people to look after each other by extending both 
benefits and obligations.  It is about fairness and tolerance. 
Anybody who thinks this bill is anti-family either has not read 
the legislation or chooses to misunderstand and misrepresent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of this debate we have heard comments that are 
both hurtful and hateful.  I regret that very much because I do 
not think those kinds of comments toward anybody who is not 
married represent the views of most Canadians or of most members 
of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us legislation that further extends fairness and 
equality of treatment in our society.  That is an advance for 
society and for families.  It is not a retrograde step. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments with great 
interest.  She made some valid points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one I would like her to address.  Many people consider 
and certainly many have petitioned the House and written letters 
to all of us that in many ways marriage is the initial foundation 
for families.  Empirically the government's own report, the 
longitudinal study on children and family, showed that children 
do best when they are raised in a marriage between a man and a 
woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this bill does include a definition of 
marriage at the front end.  Unfortunately because of where it is 
placed, according to expert legal opinion, it will not have any 
force or effect.  Therefore the official opposition, the Canadian 
Alliance party, brought in a number of amendments to enact the 
definition of marriage for each of the particular acts referred 
to in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament would be giving a clear indication of its intention 
to the courts and to the public at large.  It would change this 
bill from being mute or saying nothing on the definition of 
marriage to the courts when the challenges come to redefine 
marriage.  In fact there are some cases in the court system 
already that will be before the supreme court before long. By 
putting the definition of marriage right into the statutes, which 
is what we wanted, we would actually be sending a clear message 
that we have a positive position on what the proven best 
foundation for family is, and that is marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member that if it is good enough to put in 
the preamble, why is it not good enough to put in the statutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member made two 
points and I would like to reply to him on both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law is quite clear and has existed for 150 years in common 
law.  It is exactly what marriage is and the House reaffirmed 
that definition within the last year.  It is merely being 
emphasized, and not changed, by being put in the preamble of the 
current legislation.  As a good legislator I do not like to be 
redundant.  If we already have law, we do not have to have more 
law that says the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also referred to the study on children.  It is 
important to note that we have children in our society in all 
kinds of family situations who have problems.  We put far too 
much emphasis, and the party opposite is the worst for doing it 
in my view, on punishing children when they get into trouble with 
the law rather than supporting and helping children whatever 
their family situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to pay a lot more attention to young children in our 
communities.  As communities we have to be far more supportive of 
the development of children and of the families that raise them, 
and perhaps particularly of lone parent families who have extra 
stresses on them.  One parent may be trying very hard with an 
inadequate income to raise children and deal on his or her own 
with all the pressures of parenthood.  They are not getting 
enough support from their society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the party opposite with its new name would want to take 
a new approach to children who do get into trouble that deals 
with helping and supporting them, rather than punishing them when 
it has gone too far.  Denying them benefits as children within 
whatever kind of family does not contribute to help those 
children grow up well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak Bill C-23, the modernization 
of benefits.  I would like to share my time with the hon. member 
for Elk Island which means that I have only 10 minutes to put 
together what I think is a strong argument for sending this bill 
back to committee for further study and input. I would like to 
quickly go through that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this bill is an example of a very lousy way to develop 
public policy.  Imagine a bill as broad as this one which affects 
68 or 69 different statutes and debate has been limited both here 
in the House and in committee.  That is not a good way to develop 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, limiting the number of witnesses who could appear before 
committee is a very poor way to develop a policy initiative that 
is going to have broad ramifications for years to come.  It is a 
poor way to develop policy and it was done with this bill by the 
Liberals.  It will be to the detriment of this bill in the long 
run for not having heard from people from all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that when the government wants to trot out the 
finance minister's prebudget tour, it sets aside $500,000 and all 
kinds of time in the House and on the road to talk about whatever 
the finance minister may want to talk about. However, when it 
comes to substantive policy initiatives, such as this one, the 
committee is told to stay here and not to hear from the people 
who may want to make presentations.  The government is going to 
ram the bill through and Canadians are going to have to live with 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is a refusal to acknowledge provincial interests in 
the bill.  The government would not even listen to provincial 
ministers who had interests in the bill.  It would not even 
consider their concerns on the implications that this would have 
on provincial interests. It is always a mistake to ram 
legislation through that does not take provincial interests into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this is a big issue.  A bill that will impact on 
society as much as this one will should have been preceded by a 
broad public policy debate and initiative to discuss the roles of 
the government, the private sector, individuals, the family, the 
charitable sector and other sectors in the society to come.  When 
we talk about 21st century society, these things should have been 
discussed as a preamble or philosophical underpinning on any 
future policy debates with as much impact as this one.  None of 
that broad policy debate took place.  Instead, we were handed 
this as a done deal and told we would have to live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that most of Canada's public policy 
initiatives came after the second world war, such as the Canada 
pension plan, our health system, maternity benefits and a whole 
realm of social benefits.  If we think about it, the 1940s was a 
different era in Canadian and world history.  I am talking about 
where public policy initiatives should go in the next century. 
However we are talking about an old system based on the 1940s and 
the government wants to add another category or two and continue 
on with the same old set of benefits, and they are old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public policy initiatives and interests in this type of a 
bill should be debated.  I am very disappointed the government 
chose not to have that discussion.  We could have settled a lot 
of issues about who should and who should not get benefits based 
on public interest in this bill and in many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such a poorly crafted bill that it should be rejected. 
It is interesting that throughout this debate the government has 
failed to adequately define terms, such as conjugal relationship. 
The courts will decide one day, as they have so often been forced 
to do because of poorly defined terms, poorly drafted legislation 
and frankly, the lack of political will on the Liberal side to 
take a definite position and give it to the courts.  Instead the 
Liberals say that it is a toughie so they will hide behind the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame the courts.  They will have to rule on this, as 
they should.  They will come back and say that because it is so 
poorly defined they will put the definitions in place. What a 
poor way to craft legislation that will affect all Canadians for 
years to come.  The Liberals throw up their hands and say that 
the courts are better qualified than the House of Commons.  That 
is a shame.  Lawyers are going to have a heyday. Mark my words, 
there will be case after case in the courts for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence that it is a poorly drafted bill is the last minute 
attempt to define marriage in the preamble of Bill C-23.  The 
minister came to committee, tossed in the definition and said 
“How about this definition, what do you think of it?” The 
definition is fine enough and one which the Reform Party now the 
Canadian Alliance, supports. However, it was strictly a public 
relations exercise. It does not affect any of the 68 or 69 
statutes that are going to be amended.  What it does is it allows 
the government to stick out its chest and say that it has made a 
small change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the actual statutes are concerned, there is no change. 
There is no emphasis on marriage in those statutes. In years to 
come when we open any of the some 60 statutes, we will not be 
able to find a single reference to marriage.  That is a serious 
error.  It is okay to have it in an omnibus bill but when the 
courts, the lawyers and departments get involved no one will find 
those words defining marriage in any of those statutes. 
That is a huge failure and another sign of a poorly drafted bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the refusal to include amendments of 
substance.  My colleague who has been shepherding the bill 
through the House asked if it was good enough for the preamble of 
the bill why was it not put in the statutes.  Instead of an 
answer from over there we get absolutely nothing from the 
government. The truth is that it does not want to put it in 
because it does not want to give it substance.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to ask the courts to decide.  It is 
going to ask some bureaucrats to try and fish the information out 
of somewhere, I guess out of a black hole.  The truth is that it 
refused our amendments and amendments from its own members 
because it did not want those amendments to see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does a bill that has been so poorly developed, that has had 
such little debate and has had such a low priority with 
Canadians, receive such a high priority with the government? That 
is a question we should ask today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been better to introduce a whole package of 
measures for which Canadian families have been clamouring?  This 
bill was not in the Liberals red book.  It was not on the 
campaign trail.  It was not in any of their literature.  It just 
came out of nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of addressing the concerns of Canadians, for some reason 
the bill is big enough and of high enough importance that the 
Liberals had to get it through the House.  They had to push it 
through using every procedural trickery they could get away with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on?  Why did they not make the tax regime fair so 
that families and not the taxman make decisions about their 
children and how they should be raised?  Why did they not do 
that?  They did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that every significant issue related to family 
and marriage has been brought forward by the opposition as a 
supply day motion in the House, and nothing has come from the 
Liberals.  A motion which said that the federal tax system should 
be reformed to end discrimination against single income families 
with children was defeated by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We managed to get the definition of marriage through, but 
imagine all the crying and complaining on that side about how it 
was a divisive and terrible thing to be debating.  We brought 
that forward.  We were proud to bring it forward because it ended 
up being the definition the minister used in her own amendment. 
We had to bring it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to say that health care should take priority over 
government grants.  That was this spring.  They defeated it. They 
want more government grants and less health care.  It does not 
matter what are the issues.  It could be the Sharpe case or 
protecting our children.  They would not do it even though their 
own backbenchers asked them to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition side, which will be the government one day, said 
that we should be dealing with it and the government said no 
thanks.  I have been here for seven years and the Young Offenders 
Act is still in committee.  We still are not protecting children. 
The drunk driving bill is still lost in the black hole.  The 
consecutive sentencing issue was never brought forward by the 
government.  It was brought forward by a backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional release, victims rights, at every stage when we are 
looking after the family and trying to give families priority 
from this side of the House, it is opposed by that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Where are the priorities of government members 
coming from?  I do not understand.  They are running scared, it 
seems, not just from the courts but from Canadian public opinion, 
not wanting to deal with the issues which Canadians hold close to 
their hearts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have heard members on the government's side and from 
other parties talk about the different kinds of situations in 
which people raise children today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is reality.  I am the first to congratulate parents 
who raise their children in all these various types of 
situations, from a single parent to any other imaginable 
situation.  I congratulate them for raising their children under 
what is often less than ideal circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members opposite comment on this, do they believe that the 
ideal situation in which to raise children is to have them in a 
home where there is one male and one female parent?  If they 
believe that is the ideal, is it not at least a laudable goal of 
government to try to accommodate that ideal?  I am not saying to 
try to promote that ideal.  I am just saying to try to 
accommodate it at least in law. 
That is a question I would appreciate all members on the 
government side who speak on the bill to answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Fraser Valley East believe that the bill 
helps accommodate what I believe is an ideal situation?  Others 
may feel differently about the mom, dad and kids scenario, but 
has the government tried to accommodate the situation I see as 
ideal in the tax laws?  It is certainly not the only acceptable 
situation, not reality in many cases, but the ideal.  Has the 
government through the various legislation the member has seen 
come before the House tried to accommodate that ideal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer that 
question.  In our caucus we analyze every bill that comes before 
us.  One question we ask is how it will affect the family.  It is 
not the only question we ask.  We also ask how it will affect the 
economy and how will it affect the environment.  We ask a series 
of questions as we do our analyses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions we feel is proper to ask is how it affects 
the family.  Does it somehow strengthen the family?  A family is 
anyone related by blood, marriage or adoption.  We are not trying 
to have a restrictive definition of a family, but we are saying 
that there is a role in government to enhance families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we analyze the bill we do not see how it is strengthening 
families.  We have not been able to analyze how it will do that. 
As I said earlier it is worthy of broad debate, which I think 
should have preceded the bill, on what is the public policy 
interest in the bill or in any other social service bill and 
whether we can demonstrate that it will be of benefit to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Lakeland already mentioned, there is a 
demonstrable benefit to giving parents the maximum freedom to 
raise their children in the way they see fit.  For example, why 
are single income families making $60,000 a year penalized under 
the current tax system, discriminated against and told that if 
they put their children in registered day care they will get a 
tax break?  However, if they choose to use Aunt Bessy or grandma 
or someone to look after their kids, they do not get any help. 
There is no tax benefit for them because they have made a choice. 
The taxman tells them whether or not they will get a benefit. It 
is not up to them to look after their kids the way they want. If 
they are put in registered day care they are given a tax break, 
but if they are looked after within the family unit they do not 
get any help.  What kind of a law is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely parents have the best interest of their children in mind. 
They base their decision on many circumstances.  Their desire to 
go to work, their necessity to go to work, the closeness of their 
family, the closeness of day care services, and all kinds of 
other factors are taken into account.  Based on those factors 
they decide to raise their kids whatever way they choose.  They 
may choose to look after them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, under the Liberal regime the taxman says that it is not 
up to families to make that decision.  It is up to the taxman to 
make that decision, who makes it impossible for them to look 
after their kids in that way unless they choose the way they are 
told to raise their families.  That is wrong.  That is why the 
Canadian Alliance says it should be up to individuals and 
families to make the decision, not up to the revenue minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to be able to participate in this debate.  I am a 
dad.  I am a grandpa.  I have four wonderful grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a very special day for our family.  April 11, 1935, was 
the date that my parents pledged to each other to live together 
for as long as they lived.  They are today celebrating their 65th 
wedding anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  It is 65 years of wedded bliss, according to 
my dad.  I am just kidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It seems like much longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Yes, it seems like longer.   Anyway, I want 
to take a few seconds to thank my parents.  When I think of the 
family in which I grew up, we had parents who loved each other, 
who loved us, and we knew it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have related in the House before the story of the day when I 
was guilty of a serious transgression, having gone with some of 
my older cousins to an abandoned house and broken all the 
windows.  I cannot believe I did it but there I was, a little 
nine or ten year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father, and I just love him for it, took the time to take me 
to the man who owned that house and to hold me accountable.  I 
had to ask that man to forgive me for what I had done.  Dad also 
required that for the next three or four years all the money I 
earned went to pay for the damage.  He held me accountable and I 
thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the love that our parents demonstrated to each other and 
to us, the level of discipline that requires, and the level of 
very loving discipline they gave their children.  It would have 
been almost impossible for my brother and I to have grown up to 
be criminals.  It would have been impossible because we just saw 
the opposite so richly modelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, again just thinking of my parents on their 
anniversary today, how often they reached out to help other 
people in need.  We were always participants in it.  I do not 
have the time today to talk about the details, but we had a 
tremendous example in our home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For about the last 20 years my mother used to pray that she and 
my father would outlive my invalid sister.  I have talked about 
her in the House too.  When she passed away just a couple of 
weeks ago, it was a tremendously emotional time for our family. 
While we were saying goodbye to our sister whom we loved so 
dearly, we were also saying thanks to mom and dad for all those 
years of being faithful to the trust they had to make sure that 
she was looked after.  It was my mother's heart that said “Lord, 
we want to outlive Marion so that we can make sure that she is 
looked after”.  The Lord granted that request, and for that my 
family is very grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that in preamble to my comments today, I am saying 
that strong families are indeed the backbone of a good and 
healthy society.  I do not in any way apologize for that.  I not 
ashamed of the fact that the ideal is a mom and dad loving each 
other for life. They nurture and care for their children.  They 
make sure that they are looked after physically and that they 
have a very strong upbringing.  The children are taught to care 
for others, to love one another and to forgive one another when 
we err, as we all do.  They have that strong foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of my colleagues have mentioned, I would be much better 
pleased if the Government of Canada would just spend some real 
time making sure that government policy was supportive of that 
ideal instead of doing what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague who just spoke indicated, often the decisions of 
the government are negative for families.  We have families who 
are literally struggling financially.  They cannot make ends 
meet.  They both have to go to work to pay their taxes and to try 
to provide for their children.  I cannot for the life of me 
figure out why the government cannot have as a tax policy a 
special break for families that are providing the absolute best, 
an ideal environment for the upbringing of their children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I and other members of my party have been subject to 
quite a bit of negative comment because of our stand.  I would 
like to put that to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been accusations of our hatred and many other 
terribly negative comments.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth.  I have to say that I have absolutely no interest 
whatsoever in showing any lack of support for people.  That is 
what life is all about.  It is about family.  It is about 
friends.  It is about life, and it is about love.  I reject 
outright their accusations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, I would also like to add that some of the things 
the Liberal members opposite have said about us have been 
hurtful.  We are tempted to yell back and say “You are just not 
right”. But because of the heavy emotional things which have 
gone on in my life in the last couple of months, and pardon me if 
my voice breaks a bit, I am really hurt by them.  I do not care 
whether it hurts me, but that a member can look at another person 
and make an accusation so flippantly about presumed attitudes or 
the presumed motivations of other people, without knowing the 
facts, is not good for us.  I really wish that Liberal and other 
members would not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly, I have concerns with this bill.  That does not mean 
I do not want to reach out a helping hand to those who have 
genuine need.  It is just the opposite.  In fact, if I have one 
major criticism of this bill, it is that it is passed off as 
bringing equality when in fact it will not.  All it will do, in 
true Liberal style, is bring in another group to be included in 
the circle, to the exclusion of all others.  I reject that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a number of people who have cared for and lived with 
each other for years and years.  There is nothing in this bill 
for them.  There is nothing here about equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about two of my friends, two sisters who never 
married.  They lived together with their mother for many years, 
until their mother died, and then they kept on living together in 
their house.  I assure the House that there was never any 
conjugal relationship between them.  Does the government 
recognize their need for sharing their benefits?  No.  No, it 
picks out one group and says that this is all about equality.  It 
is not.  It is about the group it has chosen, and that group 
right now happens to be people living together in homosexual 
relationships.  That is what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have heard over and over that this bill has nothing to do 
with marriage.  That is interesting.  I wondered if it did, so I 
opened it and I was absolutely amazed to find that one of the 
very first words in the bill was “marriage”.  That was before 
the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short title states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Act may be cited as the Modernization of Benefits and 
Obligations Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 amends the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act. 
Subclause 2(1)(ii) states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—marriage, in the sense that one is married to the other or to a 
person who is— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on from there. 
The government says it is not about marriage.  The very first 
word is “marriage”.  In fact, it is about marriage.  It is 
about a relationship.  The government is referring to two people 
living together in a relationship which is similar to marriage. 
That is what it is doing, in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that neither my parents' marriage nor my 
marriage will be threatened by this bill.  Absolutely not.  But 
in a way it does change the meaning of marriage when couples 
living in relationships which are not marriages are treated 
exactly the same.  Then, indeed, the practising definition of 
marriage will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that my time is up, because I could have gone on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to comment because the member for Elk Island 
referred to what we are doing as bringing another group of people 
into the circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the circle is Canadian society and we are talking about 
people who have for too long lived in the shadows and on the 
fringes of society, does the member not believe that bringing 
more people into the light and into the circle of Canadian 
society would be positive, not negative?  Does he not think that 
bringing people into the circle of the Canadian family would 
strengthen society, strengthen Canada, and would allow people to 
live full and complete lives as accepted members of society, 
rather than being seen as pariah and somehow outside the 
mainstream? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have indeed thought about 
this question over the last six years since I became a member of 
parliament.  I remember often discussing this topic.  It seems to 
me that it comes up every time the Liberals are in some sort of 
public relations fiasco.  They come up with another bill on same 
sex benefits and they keep talking about equality, widening the 
circle and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every case the Liberals have added to the list.  That is not 
what spells equality.  To me, the list is not complete until 
everyone is on it.  I do not know why they insist on simply 
adding to the list.   Why do they not come up with a policy that 
looks at needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples.  One example is the case of the natives 
in this country.  We try to accommodate the way in which they 
have been mistreated and mishandled for so many years by giving 
them special benefits based on their race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we not be better off if we looked at the needs and 
provided for people based on need, as opposed to race, colour or 
other characteristics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list will not be complete until everyone is on it.  I might 
also add, parenthetically, even fat people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the speech of the member for Elk Island.  As 
always, he brings a personal touch to it.  He jokes a bit about 
his big size, but I think everybody knows that he has a big heart 
and he wears it on his sleeve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate this subject it is interesting to note that 
tomorrow is my 25th wedding anniversary.  I do not claim any 
expertise.  In fact, I think that 25 years should qualify a 
person for a novice badge, realizing how little we know about the 
institution.  That being said, marriage has been a wonderful 
institution for me.  I have a wonderful relationship with my 
wife, Deb, which I treasure.  I work very hard on maintaining a 
good relationship and I look forward to another 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island talks about the groups that have been 
added and, specifically, homosexuals.  Does he think there are 
other types of relationships, not necessarily having to do with 
marriage, which are important?  If the relationship does not have 
to do with marriage, does it still count?  He mentioned 
relationships involving two sisters living together.  Would those 
other relationships, though not marriage, be important? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely.  I could think of 
hundreds of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of my own friendships before I was a married man.  I 
used to joke that a single man does not know what true love is 
until he is married, and then it is too late.  Of course that was 
in jest.

In fact one of them is not yet married.  They have very close 
friends.  They live together, they share costs and expenses. 
They have a relationship which I do not think should qualify 
under this bill.  The problem I have is that when the government 
attempts to come up with a list of everybody who is entitled to 
this or that, or whatever, the list never ends.  That is the flaw 
of this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the Minister of Justice for taking a bold 
approach, for her leadership and for finally putting into law 
what has been a long awaited response to an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about one aspect of the bill, which is the 
element that deals with children.  This is an omnibus bill which 
will amend a number of acts.  As part of the bill there is an 
element which is dear to the hearts of many of my colleagues on 
both sides of the issue, that is, children.  Whether people are 
in married relationships, common law relationships, whether they 
are single mothers or fathers, children are very important to all 
of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I would say that I am exceptionally happy that 
the minister is implementing an initiative which I introduced in 
parliament quite a few months ago, which deals with the removal 
of any reference to illegitimacy in Canadian law.  When I 
approached the minister and her officials on the issue the answer 
was yes, without any debate whatsoever.  It was only that it 
would be a matter of time to implement it.  I was given the 
assurance that at the most opportune time it would be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say how happy I was when this bill was first introduced 
and the minister and her officials indicated to me that the 
amendment to the bill was in place and that from here on we would 
treat all children across Canada on an equal basis, without 
reference to whether a child was born within a marriage, a common 
law relationship or out of wedlock.  We will look at children as 
children and treat them as such, and in whatever we do we will 
always look to the best interests of the child in every decision 
we make as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that element alone we have moved another step toward 
ensuring that justice will be done for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is another step toward ensuring that we respect the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and that we are in 
compliance with that convention, which clearly states that 
governments at all levels have to review their laws to ensure 
that they are in compliance with the UN convention and that they 
respect the best interests of the child and ensure that the 
child's interests are always paramount in everything we do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has taken another step toward ensuring that we respect 
the charter of rights and freedoms that treats all Canadians 
equally regardless of age, sex, place of origin, religion or 
their abilities or disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a flowery day, as it is for my colleague from Alberta 
whose parents are celebrating their 65th anniversary.  It is also 
a rosy day for a lot of children across the country, in excess of 
two million children, some of whom are sitting on both sides of 
the House of Commons.  They came up to me after I introduced a 
bill last year to thank me for doing something about it because 
they did not know that under Canadian laws they were considered 
to be illegitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, everyone here in the House is a legitimate 
individual who has the right and has earned the right to be here 
and to speak out.  I would say it is a happy day for all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it is a happy day for all of those moms and 
dads who will be able to look back and say that they corrected an 
injustice that existed in our laws.  It took this minister and 
this government to show leadership and take the bold approach to 
do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone will now be equal under the law and our children will 
be equal under the law.  Whether a child is born to a married 
couple or an unmarried couple will not longer matter.  When some 
of my colleagues stand up in the House of Commons and give 
lectures about the importance of family, what about the 
importance of the child?  Why would we not stand up in the House 
and make that priority number one?  Notwithstanding the 
background or the economic condition of the family, why would we 
not stand up and ask what is in the best interests of the child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government has done is in the best interests of the 
child.  It is not right for us to turn around and say that only 
in a family situation where the mother and the father are married 
will we have a happy situation.  That is not always the case. 
Many children do live in families where there is abuse or they 
are not receiving the proper attention and care that they 
deserve.  If it was up to me, I would rather see a child without 
a family than living in a situation where the family is abusive 
to the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, it is hunky-dory for some of my colleagues to 
stand up and give us lectures about the fact that it is important 
to ensure the family unit without taking into consideration the 
importance of ensuring the best interests of the child in that 
family unit.  Never mind whether it is same sex, opposite sex, 
single sex, double sex, quadruple sex, the bottom line here is 
that we have to do what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation, the government has done what is right. We 
had a decision by a court. 
I am embarrassed that we had to wait until a decision was made by 
the court for us to do what we should have done a long time ago, 
which is to bring justice to the floor of the House and to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there is a gentleman, we both know very well, who 
said something exceptionally good and respectful.  It was Pierre 
Elliot Trudeau, my idol.  What he said continues to ring in my 
ears every time this debate surfaces inside or outside the House 
of Commons.  He said that the government has no business in the 
bedrooms of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my colleagues over there to stand up with their homophobic 
attitude and lecture us about what is and is not civil and what 
is or is not morale constitutes an immoral intrusion into the 
bedrooms of the nation.  They have no business trying to tell 
people how to live their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected to enact legislation and laws that provide 
equality for all citizens regardless of their relations, 
backgrounds, religions and physical or colour differences.  It is 
our responsibility to ensure that we have laws that treat 
everybody equally.  The legislation that was introduced by the 
minister does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues should not concern themselves about the 
possibility of two people of the same sex, whether they be two 
males or two females, lying about about having conjugal 
relationships because the law is quite clear on that.   It 
constitutes a fraud under Canadian law and they could be 
prosecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have legislation in place that governs people in 
common law relationships.  To turn around and start twisting the 
whole issue from what it is, an issue of fairness, into a 
question of an offence on the institution of marriage, is total 
rubbish.  Frankly, that is skirting the debate in the wrong 
direction.  It takes it from one end of the spectrum and puts it 
in the bush where it does not belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue to focus on what is before us.  The institution 
of marriage is not affected.  If members opposite want to define 
a marriage between a single man and a single woman, great, but 
our society today is different from our society of 100 or 200 
years ago.  Our society is a modern society that tolerates 
differences and takes into consideration the needs of the people. 
Our government has to reflect the needs of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we move ahead with some of the suggestions by my colleagues 
we will be a troubled society.  We must move forward and in order 
to do that we must be the mirror of society and respond to the 
needs of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is great news for two million children across the land 
who will be waking up tomorrow with a smile on their faces 
knowing that justice has finally been done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to have been given the opportunity to speak in 
support of this legislation.  It is my hope that when it goes to 
the Senate it will pass quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a number of letters from across the country 
referring to this whole notion of differentiating between 
children, those born out of wedlock and those born of a single 
man and a single woman.  Some of them felt terrible.  Some are 
national journalists, politicians and prominent business people. 
Some of are members of the House in very prominent positions. 
These are good people and we have to treat them with dignity and 
respect.  We have to do what is right for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite honoured to be the member of parliament who 
introduced the bill, but I am more honoured to be associated with 
a minister who finally had the guts to stand up and correct the 
injustices that existed for such a very long time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for bringing children into 
this debate because I, too, feel very strongly that this 
legislation has an enormous impact on children.  Indeed, this is 
one of the reasons why I support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It finally defines same sex relationships as being outside 
marriage and because it defines, at last, marriage as being a 
lawful union of a man and woman, it creates a situation where, 
all things being equal, a child has the right to have 
heterosexual parents rather than same sex parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty in my view was that the courts were poised, up 
until this legislation, to define marriage as a same sex 
relationship.  Had they done that, they would have extinguished 
the rights of a child, all things being equal, between a same sex 
couple as parents and an opposite sex couple being parents, to 
have heterosexual parents as the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens now with this legislation is that it does not 
exclude same sex partners from adopting children.  What it does, 
though, is it makes sure that the authorities have the discretion 
to make the choice between same sex parents or opposite sex 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never been one who was prepared, in the interests of 
expanding the rights of one group, to extinguish the rights of 
another, especially children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that this legislation is imperfect. I agree to some 
degree with the opposition that what it really ought to be about 
should be dependent partners.  Sex should in no way be involved 
in this legislation.  However, we had to move for the children 
because the courts were poised to determine that a marriage or a 
spouse would be an opposite sex relationship.  If they had done 
that, then the right of a child to have heterosexual parents over 
same sex parents would have been extinguished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that same sex parents cannot be good parents. 
However, we do not know yet if heterosexual parents are 
absolutely equal to same sex parents.  It does appear to us far 
more natural to have opposite sex parents.  I should say far more 
normal because, whatever we are, we are all creations of nature 
or creations of God.  I do not accept that it is unnatural to be 
homosexual.  We are what we are, but it is certainly, shall we 
say, not normal as parents to be a man and a man or a woman and a 
woman, which is what this legislation addresses.  It makes sure 
that, all things being equal, that children have the right to be 
adopted first and foremost by heterosexual parents as opposed to 
homosexual parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate it if my colleague would comment on those 
remarks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me just go back to what 
this bill is all about.  This bill is about implementing a 
decision that was rendered by a court.  Plain and simple, the 
court over and over again looked at this issue and has sent over 
and over again the same signal to the government that what we 
have to do is ensure that there is no discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a large extent the institution of marriage is not affected at 
all.  In fact, my colleague the minister has taken the extra step 
in order to make an unequivocal statement in the bill to say that 
for greater clarity, a marriage is between a male and a female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say for any of my colleagues to try to take the debate 
from what it is into a new territory is not doing justice any 
good.  Simply put, the bottom line is that the court is telling 
us, “You have been discriminating against people who are living 
in a conjugal relationship who are of the same sex”.  We have a 
charter that clearly states unequivocally that we cannot 
discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, as a parliamentarian I have to respect the law 
of the land.  We have to implement what the law is telling us to 
implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to some of my colleagues that we have to get out 
of our shelters, go out in society and speak to our friends, 
speak to our families, speak to people we know in our 
constituencies and smell the roses.  Societies have changed.  I 
have no business trying to impose my beliefs on someone else. 
With regard to a person's a sexual orientation, it is not my 
business to tell them how to live.  It is not my business at all. 
The law tells me that it is discrimination for me as a 
parliamentarian to impose my personal beliefs on others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I think shifting the debate from where it belongs 
to something else is not right, it is not fair and it is not 
appropriate.  We need to get the facts straight.  It is no longer 
acceptable in our society to discriminate against people based on 
their sexual orientation, their beliefs, their lifestyle, or on 
their background.  We have to treat everyone fairly without any 
exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why every few seconds my colleagues stand up 
on the other side of the House to try to lecture us on what is 
moral, rather than telling us really and truly what is their 
problem.  Why can they not just realize that society nowadays is 
different than society was 500 years ago?  Why do we have to 
continue to live in the dark ages of the 1200s?  Why do we not 
move into the new century and do what is right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases I understand that it may not be popular for some 
of my colleagues to stand up and support what is right, but do 
you know what, Mr. Speaker?  If I were in the shoes of any one of 
my colleagues, I would stand up and I would vote for this bill 
because that is the right thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me congratulate my colleague from Ottawa Centre.  He 
made a very fine presentation to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched on one point that I would like him to expand on.  He 
mentioned children. 
It is society's attitude toward those children and how we must 
show that we can be accepting of them and not be discriminatory 
toward them and some of the struggles they are going through in a 
society which is all too often homophobic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no doubt 
in my mind that what we as a society have to do is move to the 
next step and really start looking at the issue, as one of my 
colleague always says, with a holistic approach, which is to look 
at every element of the law, whether provincial, federal or 
municipal, and always ask how this legislation or law will help 
the children and how this law is going to serve the interests of 
the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, at other levels of government, that is what is 
lacking.  At this level of government in the House, what the 
government has been doing every single time legislation has come 
before parliament, whether very recently in the Department of 
Industry or the Department of Justice right now or the Department 
of Transport before that or the treasury board, every one of 
these ministries has introduced legislation in the House and we 
always find something in their bills dealing with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I would tell my colleague that he is quite right. 
Everything we do must first have the interests of the child at 
heart. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke asked why we have to take 
things back to the dark ages.  What I want to do is bring this to 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I knew who wrote this but apparently it is anonymous. 
For the record, I want to indicate that there are four classes of 
people.  There are those who do not know and do not know that 
they do not know.  They are foolish.  There are those who do not 
know and know that they do not know.  They are simple and should 
be instructed.  There are those who know but do not know that 
they know.  They are asleep, and we should wake them.  The fourth 
are those who know and know that they know.  They are wise and we 
should listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many Canadians who fall into the fourth class.  They 
know that they know.  It has to do with marriage.  They know what 
the institution of marriage is and they know that they know that. 
They also know what the definition of marriage is:  the lawful 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
They have told us that in thousands of letters, thousands of 
faxes, thousands of phone calls and thousands of e-mails.  That 
is why the minister brought in an amendment to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need clarity on this bill.  Why do we need it?  The way the 
government will vote on this particular bill will determine 
whether it really believes in democracy or whether it simply 
wants to promote its particular agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the people that the government will listen to, or will it 
ignore the representations which have been made and pursue an 
agenda it has set for itself in the interest of a particular 
position it wants to advance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three points I want to make in the time left to me. 
The first is the need for clarity in legislation.  The second is 
the need for a clear expression of the intent of parliamentarians 
as to what they want the courts to interpret in terms of law. The 
third is the need to recognize the significance of the message we 
send to society.  It is for our children that we send this 
message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of the meaning of a word reminds me of a passage 
from <I>Alice in Wonderland</I>:  “When you use a word it means 
what we choose it to mean, neither more nor less.  It is simply a 
question of who is the master, that is all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of that coin is that whoever determines the 
meaning of a word is the master.  That suggests then that the 
master in Canada is the court, which decided what marriage should 
mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it ought to be is that we as parliamentarians better define 
what that meaning is if we want to be the master of the intent of 
what is meant and how we want the courts to rule.  We had better 
decide, not the courts and not the judges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliament, we need to clearly express what we intend 
marriage to mean.  I have already indicated what various people 
in Canada have told us what it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to the next point which is for our children. I 
notice there are five hon. members from the government side of 
the House listening.  I congratulate them for being here.  I want 
to register the point about the message parliament is sending to 
people.  That is do we really want to look at what the people 
have told us they want marriage to mean or are we going to put it 
somewhere else?  We need to be careful in this matter because it 
will establish the truth of what we believe.  Are we a democratic 
institution or are not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yes, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  I am so glad the hon. member over 
there said yes, yes.  I expect him to vote according to the way 
his constituents want him to, not the way the agenda has told him 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It matters what history has told us.  Our custom has been very 
clear, that marriage shall be the lawful union of one man and one 
woman to the exclusion of all others.  That has been our history 
and tradition.  Much has been said that that is what the 
definition is and it will continue to be.  Parliament put that on 
record last June by passing Motion 216-55.  It was very clear 
that parliament should do every thing it could.  If the minister 
had really wanted to make the definition of marriage in her 
amendment legally binding, she could have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to David Brown, a constitutional expert and litigation 
lawyer in one of the reputable firms in Toronto, if she really 
wanted to do that, there were three things she could have done. 
She could have done something to amend the Marriage Act to 
include a specific definition of marriage.  Or, she could have 
amended the bill to include an enacting section which provides 
that “for the purposes of all federal legislation, the word 
`marriage' means the lawful union of one man and one woman to the 
exclusion of all others”.  Or, she could have amended the bill 
to include amendments to each affected act enacting in each such 
act a specific definition of the word marriage.  She did none of 
those three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what she did was put it into the interpretation 
section.  What was the amendment?  She said “For greater 
certainty, the amendments made by this act do not affect the 
meaning of the word marriage, that is the lawful union of one man 
and one woman to the exclusion of all others”.  If that is what 
she really meant, she should have put it in an enacting section 
in the law.  It would have meant something.  The way it is 
written now does not have that impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have hon. members opposite who are in the legal profession 
and who know jolly good and well that this is the case.  The 
Minister of Justice knows this is the case.  There is absolutely 
nothing new in what I am telling the hon. minister.  She knows 
better.  So do certain other ministers who are sitting across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for us to tell the truth and to recognize that 
the people of Canada do want marriage to be defined as the lawful 
union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
They want that in the law of Canada.  That is what they have told 
us.  If these government people are going to honestly reflect 
that, they are going to vote that way.  It would be incorrect for 
them not to vote that way and vote the way the whip tells them. 
I would suggest that it is an abuse of the power of the whip to 
force each one of them to vote a particular way.  They should 
vote according to the way the people have told them to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not do that we then have to be very clear that that 
group of people over there is anti-family and not in favour of 
marriage.  We have to be absolutely clear what this is about.  It 
is time that we determine what we are.  Are we democratic?  Do we 
really mean that marriage is one man and one woman lawfully 
united?  Is that the issue or is it something else?

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a 
matter involving the travel of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, there have been consultations 
among the parties and I think you would find unanimous consent 
for the adoption of the following motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK227">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Group “A”, composed of members of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, be authorized to travel 
to Ankara (Turkey), Istanbul (Turkey), Baku (Azerbaijan), 
Tbilisi (Georgia), Yerevan (Armenia) from May 6 to 16, 2000, and 
Group “B”, composed of members of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, be authorized to travel 
to Almaty (Kazakhstan), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Astana 
(Kazakhstan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) from May 6 to 16, 2000, in 
order to examine Canada's foreign policy interests in the South 
Caucasus and Central Asia, and that the necessary staff do 
accompany the committee.

<A NAME="LINK230">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 15, 1999, consideration of the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When debate was 
suspended the hon. member for Churchill had five minutes 
remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again I thank my colleague from Churchill River, Saskatchewan for 
bringing forth Motion No. 237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it has been a while since the motion was last before the 
House, I would like to read it again.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the 55th parallel as the identified Canadian boundary 
for participation in the international circumpolar community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 55th parallel is very important to me.  I have lived in 
Thompson, Manitoba for about 27 years.  We recognize ourselves as 
being north of the 55th.  We identify with northerners throughout 
the other provinces in Canada and throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the opportunity to meet with people and we deal with 
a lot of the same issues, the same problems.  In a lot of cases 
our peoples are the same in those northern areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it somewhat interesting that within Canada we do not 
recognize the 55th parallel as being the boundary which should 
enable us to belong to the circumpolar group represented 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would certainly give us that opportunity.  It would 
give the peoples of those northern communities the opportunity to 
meet with the peoples of the circumpolar regions of the world on 
a regular basis, and to discuss more formally how they could 
address the problems they may be having and the issues they may 
be dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that at this crucial time in our history, with 
global warming, now more than ever it is important that the 
peoples of these regions come together to identify the problems 
which are resulting from global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the region of Churchill, Manitoba there is documented 
evidence that polar bears are not able to sustain their lives the 
way they have in the past because of global warming.  The ice is 
not staying in long enough, so they cannot get out to eat enough 
seals to keep their weight on to get them through those long cold 
winters in northern Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now more than ever it is a crucial time to recognize that 
Canada, and those regions of Canada which are north of the 55th, 
should be part of that global family which is recognized as the 
circumpolar region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The different peoples involved in these regions are similar 
throughout the world.  Indigenous peoples in the Arctic areas 
have concerns about the effects on wildlife and themselves of the 
long range transport to the north of contaminants.  Again, this 
would provide an opportunity for them to come together to address 
those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 237 asks that the House, by adopting this motion, 
recognize that northern impacts are not limited to the 60th 
parallel box.  That is the area which Canada recognizes as 
belonging to the circumpolar group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canada itself which is recognizing this, so we as 
parliamentarians have the opportunity to change that.  I would 
hope that my colleagues would consider that.  It is important to 
the northern region of Manitoba, my region, but I am sure it 
would be important as well to the other provinces of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate on this motion, as it is a motion in 
which I am most interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague who spoke previously, I have spent a good deal 
of my life at 55 degrees north in two different situations.  I 
lived in the north of England in the British Isles, and I lived 
for three years in Schefferville, which, like Churchill, is about 
55 degrees north in northern Quebec.  It is interesting that I 
have lived at both of those locations, at 55 degrees north, and 
both of them are very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also spent well over a year of my life at 80 degrees north, 
which is pretty far north.  I do not think there would be any 
debate about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that three of the great cities of the 
world, St. Petersburg, Helsinki and Stockholm, are all very large 
communities and are located at 60 degrees north.  Again, they are 
located at very different locations from Churchill, Yukon, 
northern Quebec and the British Isles.  Those great cities are 
located in Scandinavia and Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member uses the argument of global warming.  When we lived 
in Schefferville, in northern Quebec, we argued that 
Schefferville was in the north, not because it was warm or 
getting warmer, but because it was very cold.  Because of the 
wind, the snow and the storms, it was even colder than average 
conditions would suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start at Labrador and northern Quebec and move through 
northern Ontario, across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, into 
B.C. and Yukon, using average conditions, they get better.  I 
would argue that the town of Schefferville is as far north as one 
could possibly get in terms of the severity of weather conditions 
and the lack of comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I like about the member's motion is that it is a way of 
raising awareness in Canada of the north and of the importance of 
the north.  It is true that we are a great northern nation, but 
we lack awareness of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other countries I have mentioned, even the British Isles, 
have a strong sense of the north in some parts, and yet by our 
standards in Canada we do not think of them as being northern at 
all.  Here in Canada, with our very high Arctic territory, more 
than any other country, there is a very low awareness of that 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion I think is excellent and draws attention to 
the people and the conditions of the middle north.  He is doing 
us all a great service by bringing forward his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done a remarkable amount of work with respect 
to the circumpolar community.  It was Canada which really brought 
together the Arctic Council, which represented the eight polar 
nations and three great, different, indigenous peoples' 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Arctic Council came into being after the Soviet Union 
disappeared.  Canada persuaded the United States, through Alaska, 
that it should be part of a council which would have an overview 
of the circumpolar community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Arctic Council has been very active.  It was the Liberal 
government which appointed, for the first time, an ambassador of 
circumpolar affairs, Mary Simon.  It is interesting to note that 
Mary Simon was the elected president of the Inuit Circumpolar 
Conference, the great international organization of Inuit from 
Greenland to Siberia.  It was the Inuit Circumpolar Conference 
which brought forward the idea of the Arctic environmental 
protection strategy, which is a self-explanatory strategy 
instrument, which has been taken over by the Arctic Council.  The 
council now represents all circumpolar nations and is being used 
as the basis for the protection of the environment in the entire 
circumpolar north.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Arctic Council and the ambassador for circumpolar affairs 
are both examples of something which the government has done to 
bring attention to things northern, as the hon. member is doing 
here very effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the people at 55° north or anywhere else on the 
globe, I point to the establishment of the University of the 
Arctic by the Arctic Council.  The University of the Arctic now 
exists in form.  It is not yet offering courses.  I believe its 
secretariat is based in northern Finland at the moment, but it 
will be a moving secretariat.  The University of the Arctic will 
offer courses through the Internet which will be available all 
over the world, but which in fact will be particularly valuable 
to residents of the middle north, the near north and the high 
Arctic.  I see the University of the Arctic as a positive outcome 
of the Arctic Council which was established by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Arctic Council was established, I note that the 
government has continued with activity which has stimulated 
interest in the north across Canada, as the hon. member is trying 
to do, and stimulated interest in circumpolar affairs, in which 
the hon. member has mentioned he is equally interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out a 1997 review of northern interests entitled 
“Canada and the Circumpolar World:  Meeting the Challenges of 
Co-operation into the Twenty-First Century”.  That was followed 
in 1998 by the Sustainable Development in the Arctic:  Lessons 
Learned and the Way Ahead conference which was held in 
Whitehorse.  It involved the federal government, the territorial 
governments of both the Yukon and, as it was in those days, the 
Northwest Territories government.  Now of course it would include 
Nunavut.  Those conferences were designed to gather information 
about the north from the people of the north and also to 
stimulate interest in the north across the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister commissioned a consultation paper to order northern 
foreign policy for Canada.  Through it, the ambassador for 
circumpolar affairs, Mary Simon, whom I just mentioned, conducted 
hearings not only in various northern locations, but also in 
southern Canada, including in my own community of Peterborough. 
Like the hon. member's motion, that activity stimulated interest 
in Canada in both our north and the circumpolar north, and it 
stimulated interest in what Canada is doing and what Canadians 
are doing in their own north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the hon. member is putting this motion forward.  I 
commend him for it.  I am not personally sure of the 
practicalities of shifting to 55° north for the reasons I have 
mentioned.  Of the other circumpolar nations, I suspect those 
that have capitals and major cities at 60° might well have some 
concerns about bringing in latitudes as far south as the British 
Isles, such as Ireland, for example.  However, I strongly support 
his motivation in raising awareness of the people of Canada's 
north, including my daughter who was born at 55°, and the people 
who live farther north in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too wish 
to congratulate the hon. member for Churchill River, for giving 
the House this opportunity for discussion and no doubt to go 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many reasons to wish to speak to this motion.  I was not 
on the foreign affairs committee when it carried out its study 
proposing the addition of the entire circumpolar aspect to 
Canada's foreign policy, but I can say that I have already been 
the Parti Quebecois adviser on this program, and as such proposed 
the addition of a component for the north.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot look at a map, know the history or be interested in 
international relations, or know society—I am speaking of 
Quebec—and not know that the north is inhabited by native 
peoples, nations, totally original societies, that developed 
mores and, in terms of the environment, for example, are 
inheriting problems generated in the south.  They do not always 
have the means to resolve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also aware of the need for the various societies in the 
north to talk to each other. I am pleased as well to hear the 
member point to the major contribution by a geographer, an 
anthropologist, Louis Hamelin, a historian as well, who really 
contributed to giving the north, northern societies and northern 
Quebecers, their letters patent of nobility.  I think he really 
pushed us to expand our interest in the north, but he also pushed 
for organization of the people in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these reasons heighten our interest, because we have to 
learn from others and must get organized.  The member for 
Churchill will not, however, be surprised to hear me raise a 
question, which in Quebec and no doubt in the other provinces, if 
it applies, is of interest:  it is the question of the 
translation. For the expression “frontière canadienne”, in 
English, instead of saying Canadian border, they say boundary. I 
have had some research done, and this is confirmed by 
international research. 
The word frontière is closer to the English term border, while 
boundary is a better equivalent of limite or “limite 
territoriale”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition that I found reads as follows: “Border: noun, 
edge of a road, etc.”. The second meaning is that of a “dividing 
line between two countries”. This is not what the motion of the 
hon. member for Churchill River is about. On the other hand, the 
definition of boundary says “noun, border, anything marking a 
limit” and adds “between countries”, “frontier”. So, I urge this 
assembly to allow us to continue the debate on the member's 
objective by accepting the following amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<A NAME="LINK234">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing, in the French version, 
the word “frontière” with the following: “limite 
territoriale”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will realize, and I am sure the hon. member does, that 
we completely change the meaning of his motion if we change the 
border of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this is not at all what he intended. His intention is 
to define a boundary within borders, but a boundary beyond which 
people recognize themselves and are defined as being from the 
north, as being nordic people and as being part of the 
circumpolar circle. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members wondered whether the 55th parallel should be 
debated.  I think we could discuss it, but not if the word 
“frontière” is kept instead of “limite”.  I have not spoken with 
Mr. Hamelin, but I think he would agree with the word “limite” 
instead of “frontière”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to move this amendment because, otherwise, we are no 
longer talking about the same thing.  We are talking about 
redefining borders and I do not think that the member for 
Churchill River intended, by his proposal, to create societies 
completely detached from the province to which they belong. 
I believe he wants people living in northern regions to be able 
to form groups, with the approval of the provinces and NGOs, in 
order to define goals, bring pressure to bear, run programs or 
take part with parliamentarians in the proceedings of the Arctic 
Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I congratulate the member on raising this issue in 
the House and I urge him to take into consideration the reasons 
for my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The amendment is in order, 
but I wish to know whether it applies to the French text only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. In English, the word 
used is not border but boundary.  The purpose of my amendment is 
so that the word used in French is what I consider the best translation 
of the word boundary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Fine.  The amendment is 
therefore in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think by my rising and speaking in the English language the 
interpreters who are interpreting from French to English must be 
heaving a huge sigh of relief after your work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I take that as a 
compliment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I did not mean it to have any derogatory 
sense at all, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to debate Motion No. M-237, 
which is interesting.  What the amendment has done is put into 
French what we were understanding.  Had the hon. member for 
Churchill proposed to change the boundaries of the provinces, 
there would have been quite a bit more discussion on this.  He 
would have found himself in many interviews with the press and 
many other exciting events had he actually proposed that we move 
the boundaries of all of the provinces down in order to 
accommodate this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the motion as given: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the 55th parallel as the identified Canadian boundary 
for participation in the international circumpolar community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, he is not changing any borders.  All he 
wants to do, when it comes to negotiations and participation with 
other countries involving the circumpolar region, is include all 
of those people who are north of the 55th parallel. 
I wish he would look at me and nod so that I understand the 
motion.  He is nodding yes.  Thank you.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many people here are aware of an interesting 
fact about Canada.  I happen to live just outside of Edmonton, 
Alberta.  Edmonton is at 53 degrees.  This suggestion means that 
we would be taking a line approximately 220 kilometres north of 
Edmonton, everything north of that would then be considered to be 
in the circumpolar region if this motion were to pass.  Another 
way of putting it is that we are moving the boundary south 
approximately 560 kilometres from the present 60th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting fact about Edmonton and about Canada is that 
Edmonton is farther from the equator than any land mass in the 
southern hemisphere is from the equator, other than the 
Antarctic.  In other words, if you went to the very southernmost 
point of South America, Africa or Australia, you would still be 
nearer the equator than we are in Edmonton.  We have a lot of 
people who live north of the 55th parallel.  We are indeed a 
hardy population in Canada.  We believe in sticking our faces 
into the wind and the snow and carrying on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has to do with the inclusion of people who are living 
between the 55th and the 60th parallel for the purposes of these 
international debates and discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that living in the northern climate is a 
challenge.  It is a harsh climate.  It is one that demands a lot 
of respect for the people who for centuries have lived in that 
region, have survived there and have done very well. They are a 
hardy people.  We ought to congratulate and admire them for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes a great deal of sense that, when we deal with the 
question of how to survive in such a harsh climate, we work with 
other countries that have similar situations so that anything we 
discover or invent that will help us to live comfortably in that 
part of the world we would then share that with people of other 
countries who are also in this circumpolar region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this part of the country is very rich in resources.  A 
lot of people are not aware of that.  We tend to think that life 
begins in Toronto, stretches over to Montreal and ends in Ottawa. 
A lot of this country that is outside of that Bermuda Triangle 
that I have just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North of the 55th and 60th parallels, there are many resources. 
We are talking about huge mineral and mining resources, such as 
oil, gas, and all the natural resources which exist up there. As 
well, it is a part of the world that is very rich in animal life 
and vegetation.  There are many different forms of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings challenges to all of us who live in that kind of a 
climate.  I cannot but encourage us to work together with other 
countries that are developing their resources in similar 
climates, to share our resources and, hence, improve the quality 
of life of more people than just our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some serious questions on this subject.  I am always a 
great one for asking questions and then allowing other people to 
try to find the answers.  I have some serious questions about our 
work with other countries in this particular regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that Canada very quickly tends to help form or 
join any and every organization that comes up. We see our Prime 
Minister going overseas.  Part of this country's foreign policy 
seems to be developed as information goes from the Prime 
Minister's brain to his mouth.  It is not fully formulated when 
it leaves his brain but, by the time it gets to his mouth, we 
have some pronouncements.  We have heard that in the last couple 
of days.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How effective is the Arctic Council?  When we deal with other 
countries through it, are we getting a kick for our dollar?  I 
wonder if there are better ways in which this can be 
accomplished.  Can the finance minister tell us what studies have 
been done to show that this is a wise investment and that it is 
worthy for us to be participating in these organizations with 
other countries in this way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What often happens is that these organizations tend to grow as 
soon as government resources are put into them.  It is not only 
from Canada but other countries as well.  It is not necessarily a 
corollary that a larger organization gives more benefits to the 
taxpayers in whatever country, including Canada.  However, I 
think Canada is particularly vulnerable to joining and spending 
money without being really cognizant of tangible and measurable 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could maybe just put it under the auspices of HRDC 
and see what happens.  It could not be much worse than what we 
already have.  I am being facetious so I had better say that.  I 
do not think <I>Hansard</I> records the sound of sarcasm.  Now I 
have it on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I have concerns the relationship between the 
provinces and the federal government.  We already have a lot of 
tension between the provinces and the federal government in the 
areas of health care and others.  If this boundary were moved 
down then a portion of each province would once again have to 
work, I think, through the federal government in foreign policy 
in order to deal with foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we will say to these organizations that are 
dealing north of the 55th that they have carte blanche, that they 
can do whatever they want.  It invariably has to be in consonance 
with federal foreign policy, which is, of course, controlled by 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have another organization in parallel to what we already have 
instead of working within that is questionable in my view and 
would need more answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, I congratulate the hon. member for Churchill River 
for again showing us genuine, legitimate concerns about the north 
and how the people of that part of the country are working 
together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Churchill River has introduced an interesting 
concept into the House debates.  It is worth reminding ourselves 
that the concept of territorial frontiers is a relatively modern 
conception, and it is of course a European conception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were reminded by the brilliant Algerian jurist, Mohammed 
Bedjaoui, who later became president of the world court, in the 
western Sahara case, that it really did not have much meaning for 
non-European people until the Europeans arrived without 
invitation on non-European shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked very carefully at this and I sympathize with the 
motivation behind it.  One point to bear in mind, however, is 
that a unilateral declaration by the Canadian parliament on 
recognition of membership status in any organization is not 
something that one can impose on others.  It may be a King Canute 
type declaration that nobody else accepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every recognized official international organization has its own 
credential committees, its own criteria for membership and the 
status of membership. 
This is a rather distinct group of organizations that we are 
dealing with here.  I note the comments of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He highlighted the many and interesting new partnerships that 
are on the horizon, particularly with Russia and the Baltic 
States.  He cited existing partnerships such as the Arctic 
Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council of the European Union 
and the Council of Baltic Sea States.  The Euro-Arctic Council 
created committees to serve as forums for co-operation.  I am 
talking of a collection of international organizations without 
legal status or decision making powers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with voluntary organizations like the 
Commonwealth and, to some extent, La Francophonie that are created 
but do not have decision making powers.  Therefore, the strict 
rules that we apply to the United Nations, or it applies to 
itself and its subsidiary organizations do not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The valuable aspect of this suggestion is to take note of the 
formula that Paul Martin, Sr., the minister of external affairs in 
1965, and the then premier of Quebec developed for 
federal-provincial co-operation and for the federal government, 
without sacrificing its autonomy as a federal government, 
voluntarily to include representatives of the provinces in 
Canadian delegations to international conferences, including 
those within official United Nations organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion by the member for Churchill River could be 
interpreted as being an invitation to the Canadian government to 
recognize the artificiality of the distinction between the 60th 
and 55th parallels and the many elements of the Canadian 
community, then I would endorse it.  The Metis are a perfect 
example, as are the Indian communities much further south in 
Canada.  If it is an invitation to the Canadian government to 
consider naming these people as part of the Canadian delegations, 
then I think it is a recommendation that I would endorse and 
favourably recommend to the government.  I think the government 
could accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly within the spirit of these larger northern 
organizations that we recognize a common ethnic link between the 
peoples of Russian Siberia, northern Finland, northern Sweden, 
northern Norway, Iceland and our Indian peoples, aboriginal 
peoples and the Metis people.  Why not take advantage of that? 
One of the powerful instruments of Canadian foreign policy 
is to profit from the plurality of our peoples and our cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light, I would suggest that the government can and 
should take notice of this suggestion. 
The hon. member for Mercier is a very thoughtful member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mercier has moved an amendment about the 
distinction between boundaries and borders. English legal 
language does not, in my opinion, afford any legal significance 
to this distinction, but, in French, I certainly accept her 
suggestion.  It seems to me the best English translation would 
be to substitute a concept such as “the southern limit”, or 
something like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, I can certainly accept the suggestion, which 
seems quite valuable.  It also indicates the plurality of our 
thought on this issue, and it is in this spirit that I willingly 
accept the proposal by the member for Churchill River. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has reminded us that this is a plural country.  He has 
reminded us that Canada is more than just the European descended 
peoples and the concept of territorial limit based on the 55th 
parallel has an artificiality that is certainly Eurocentric in 
its origins.  Therefore, in the future, Canadian delegations will 
take advantage of our peoples who are linked by ties of 
consanguinity to the northernmost people above the 60th 
boundaries and will be an extra richness for our delegations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague for 
Richmond—Arthabaska has already spoken to Motion M-237, 
introduced by the hon. member for Churchill River. However, I 
would like to add a few more points. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of things can be said in reference to the bill, but indeed 
the cornerstone of the bill is where does the north start?  Does 
it matter that the border is placed at the 55th parallel or the 
60th parallel?  And what are the consequences of this change? 
What is the purpose of it?  What are we trying to accomplish 
here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we do not think enough of the north and I think 
this is a shame as the north is full of natural resources.  We 
are all aware that our Canadian economy is primarily based on the 
export of natural resources.  Indeed, we should pay better 
attention to the northern people as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my colleague from Churchill River has attempted 
to catch our attention through this motion, and for that I 
congratulate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question that I think we should ask is will modifying the 
circumpolar boundary have such significance or is there not 
another way to increase the strength of the people from the 
north?  Of course, by setting the border at the 55th parallel we 
would increase the political weight of the north within Canada as 
we would be including more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to deal with such a motion, we have to study the impact 
of the changes within Canada.  For instance, what will happen to 
the provinces?  How will they react to this?  What about certain 
governmental departments like natural resources, Indian affairs 
and others? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain provinces, then, might have to comply with new 
obligations because of this change.  If part of the territory of 
certain provinces were to become part of the Canadian north, this 
would have an inevitable impact on the provinces.  But are they 
in a position to respond to that impact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be important for the provinces to be consulted on this 
matter, because their boundaries will be affected if the parallel 
change is made. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the purpose of the motion presented by 
my colleague from Churchill River is good, the Progressive 
Conservative Party could not support the motion because of the 
way it is presented.  We feel that a great number of elements are 
missing and that it could create more damage than good if the 
motion were passed as it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian north is one of our best kept secrets.  It is true 
that measures should be taken in order to develop its tremendous 
potential and that we should collaborate with the people who live 
there, but the PC Party just does not believe that changing the 
boundary will achieve that.  Maybe it would give the people of 
the north more political weight inside Canada, but still, I do 
not think this is the real solution to developing the north. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High technology is often referred to in connection with the 
world economy.  We have only to look at the investments here in 
this region, in Silicon Valley North, and in other regions of 
Canada in the areas of pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and 
high tech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are fields that are in rapid expansion, and they represent 
a real economic force.  The north, however, is going to take on 
more and more importance as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, let us not forget that even though high tech is the 
future, Canada's economy still relies primarily on its natural 
resources and that most of them are located within the north. 
Instead of changing the boundary, should we not focus on 
developing northern Canada? 
The PC party believes that if efforts are being carefully 
directed, the Canadian economy could even grow stronger through 
proper development of our natural resources in the north and high 
tech in the south.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure indeed to rise in support of the 
motion put forward by my friend and colleague from Churchill 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want in the beginning simply to indicate as he has speaking at 
a previous time that what we are talking about here is not 
changing the borders and boundaries of provinces and having some 
new definition here that would create a whole rearrangement in 
the way government is done, at least in terms of borders and 
territories.  What my colleague has said is that the circumpolar 
world uses the 55th parallel as its definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at it on a map from the top of the world, so to 
speak, from the Arctic looking down, we see that that parallel 
would take in entire countries such as Finland, Sweden and vast 
swaths of Russia, but in Canada the way it works now is that the 
border is set at the border of the Northwest Territories.  When 
these people get together to talk about common issues and 
concerns, and certainly there are common issues and concerns no 
matter what country they happen to fall into, in Canadian terms 
there are vast and large reaches of what we consider to be the 
north which are not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague I think is saying is that we are not talking 
about changing political borders.  We are talking about changing 
borders perhaps in the way that we think and perceive.  I will 
give a few examples of this based on my own experience growing up 
in the southern area of the province of Saskatchewan, whereas my 
colleague grew up in the northern area.  There are vast 
differences in history, in geography and many other aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the river systems in Saskatchewan.  The South 
and North Saskatchewan Rivers which arise in the Rockies and go 
on through Saskatchewan up into Manitoba and empty into Hudson 
Bay drain an area which is very different than the northern area. 
In fact the 55th parallel falls between the Saskatchewan River 
systems and the Churchill River to the north, not to mention the 
Peace-Athabasca system which runs out of Lake Athabasca one way 
and ends up on the coast and the Mackenzie River system ends up 
going straight north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been in history, the fur trade for example, very keen 
and perceived differences between these areas, the area drained 
by the Saskatchewan River system and the areas drained further 
north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use one example, I have read significantly fur trade 
literature.  A great writer and map maker named David Thompson 
spent many years first in the area of what is called the 
Saskatchewan River system and later on in further points north. 
In very descriptive writing he talks about the significant 
differences between the Cree and the Chipewyan people which he 
described extremely eloquently, not to mention the Dene and Inuit 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences among those people but they pale in 
comparison to the differences historically in many other ways 
between those people and the Europeans who came to settle the 
more southerly areas of our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know from the time I have spent in my own home province of 
Saskatchewan as a resident and a journalist that there have been 
attempts and recognitions by our provincial government, a belated 
one I might add, but in the early 1970s there was a recognition 
that the way in which southern Saskatchewan was governed was not 
working to the benefit of what we consider to be northern 
Saskatchewan and again the line would come pretty close to the 
55th parallel as described by my colleague from Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day, the government of Premier Allan 
Blakeney, observed that things were not working in the north and 
that there had to be some new efforts made.  The department of 
northern Saskatchewan was created.  There were attempts to have 
new ways of governing take place.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These attempts were not entirely successful but they were indeed 
a recognition between the vast differences between what we 
consider to be the south and the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that one of the considerations given was that there 
should be some form of revenue sharing for resources extracted 
from the north because, as we know, unfortunately we have tended 
to extract resources in northern areas inhabited by aboriginal 
peoples and take the benefits and the riches south.  That is 
common not only in the province in which I was raised, but also 
in the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague, the member for Churchill River, is saying is 
that we must recognize that the situation I am describing in 
Saskatchewan historically is one which could be said to have 
existed in all of the provinces and that Canada's way of dealing 
with the people in northern territories has been similar.  We 
exploit the resource but the people who live there are often 
disadvantaged by the ways in which we exploit the resource that 
has an environmental component and also by the loss of wealth to 
the region which they inhabit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that kind of stepping out of the box that my colleague and 
friend from Churchill River is asking us to do.  He is saying 
that the international community has identified the 55th parallel 
as its recognized boundary for circumpolar participation.  He is 
not saying that we should change the boundaries of our country in 
any political way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are eight member states in the Arctic Council.  They are 
Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and 
the United States, because of the state of Alaska.  These people 
do get together and they have many important things in common to 
discuss.  I believe that is why this motion is important.  It is 
to extend membership or at least the possibility of 
representation to people living further south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend and colleague, the member for Churchill River, has 
talked about the fact that people in these northern areas are 
environmentally disadvantaged, if I may put it that way, from 
pollution which they did not create but with which they have to 
live.  I remember reading not long ago in a newspaper front page 
story about an aboriginal woman in Churchill whose son had 
developed what we would call sunburn.  That has to do with the 
thinning of the ozone layer, particularly in northern Canada.  We 
have heard recently, and this is a cause for great concern, that 
the ozone hole there is depleted by about 60%.  The woman's young 
child had developed a rash on the back of his neck and she, in 
her language, did not have a word to describe sunburn.  That is 
the kind of thing that is happening to people in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Churchill River is not saying that somehow we 
should split that part of the country off from the other in any 
politically identifiable boundary sense.  He is saying that these 
people also have a concern.  They also share in the fate which 
may befall them, much to their chagrin, if things keep going 
along the way they are environmentally.  He is saying that people 
in a place like Churchill have much more in common with people 
further north than they might have with people in Winnipeg or 
Saskatoon or Thunder Bay and they have a common way of looking at 
the world and some common problems that we do not quite share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is asking, at the very least, when these international 
conferences occur which do look at the world from a certain point 
of view that is very valid and very grounded in the life they 
have lived for thousands and thousands of years, that the people 
in northern Canada, the part of Canada between the 55th and 60th 
parallel, be given the opportunity to participate and extend this 
world view and explain it to the rest of us so that we might 
begin to look at that part of the world a little differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is certainly talking about governments.  He has talked about 
how the Canadian government has taken a very colonial mentality 
toward those areas.  He is saying that we have to change.  This 
motion is only a motion, it is not a bill.  The world will not 
change overnight if we pass it, which I certainly hope we do.  I 
recommend to other members that they support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is simply saying let these people participate in this 
organization and some other organizations which have a similar 
intent. 
He feels that there will be an advantage if this occurs.  I 
certainly agree with him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise 
to speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Churchill River for giving 
the government an opportunity to speak to our ongoing recognition 
and support of the many challenges and opportunities facing 
Canadians in northern communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond adequately to my colleague from Churchill River I 
feel that I should first say something about the government's 
vision and agenda for the north. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the widest sense our long term objectives for the north 
parallel the goals we have for other parts of Canada and reflect 
the broad themes of “Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”. These are as follows.  First, democratic, 
effective, and accountable governments give their citizens input 
into the decisions that most directly affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, individuals and communities, whose fundamental rights 
are protected, under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for 
example, receive services and programs comparable to those 
received by Canadians elsewhere, but their diversity as 
northerners is safeguarded and encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, prosperous local economies develop in a dynamic and 
sustainable way, strengthened by the knowledge and research 
needed for success over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, fiscal relationships provide governments with the 
resources and stability needed to act effectively in the present 
and to plan for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's vision includes ensuring the protection of 
aboriginal rights and that market-based economies with 
conventional regulatory structures are adapted in the north. 
Real progress is being made.  Aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
groups are communicating better and with the settlement of 
claims and agreements on self-government the groundwork is being 
laid for even more progress and co-operative institution-building 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international front, our previous preoccupation with 
asserting sovereignty over the north has been replaced by a more 
productive and positive focus on encouraging circumpolar 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concrete steps have been taken toward these goals with 
indigenous participation in international forums such as the 
Arctic Council and the work of the Canadian Polar Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991, the Canadian Polar Commission has played a critical 
role with respect to monitoring, promoting and disseminating 
knowledge of the polar regions; contributing to public awareness 
of the importance of polar science to Canada; enhancing Canada's 
international profile as a circumpolar nation; and recommending 
polar science policy direction to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's commitment to promoting the development and 
dissemination of knowledge of polar regions has been evident 
through the commission's participation in the interdepartmental 
committee for the Northern Science and Technology Strategy, and 
through the efforts to foster the advancement of traditional 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the commission's work with respect to enhancing 
Canada's profile as a Circumpolar Nation through its involvement 
with the International Arctic Science Committee and the 
Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research has, indeed, been 
invaluable.  The point of all this is to highlight the fact that 
we have an excellent vision and agenda for the north that is 
producing real benefits for northerners and for the country as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the core of my hon. colleague's motion today is his assertion 
that the government rigidly defines the north as only that 
territory which lies north of the 60th parallel.  Let me be 
perfectly clear from the start.  We, in fact, do not have one 
singular, inclusive definition of the north.  I believe that I 
can best illustrate the government's position on this question 
with a few examples.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of this government's programs administered to the north, for 
example, is the food mail program.  This program is designed to 
make nutritious, perishable food more affordable in isolated 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, for 1999-2000, the program's budget is 
$15.6 million.  The program provides funding to Canada Post for 
transporting nutritious, perishable foods to isolated

down.

in the House of Commons numerous times starting back in April of 
last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the entire federal NDP caucus, I call on you to: 
expand DU testing to include tissues and other samples necessary 
to detect presence of DU and its effects; ensure this testing is 
undertaken by an independent and respected laboratory; provide 
testing for immediate family members on request; have Canada take 
the lead in working toward an international treaty banning the 
use of DU in weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, to ensure the health of our veterans and their 
families, I call on your government to do the right thing and 
initiate a full Public Inquiry on the medical effects of DU on 
our Forces, their families, and any Canadian civilians who may 
have been exposed to this substance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the United States, Canada does not have legislation 
allowing it to pay compensation to Gulf War veterans who have 
been disabled by undiagnosed chronic illnesses.  Since early 1995 
the United States Veterans Administration has been providing 
compensation payments to chronically disabled Gulf War veterans 
with undiagnosed illnesses under the Persian Gulf War Veterans' 
Act.  This benefit was expanded under an April 1997 regulation 
that essentially eliminated the date of initial manifestation of 
latent symptoms as a consideration in the adjudication through to 
the end of 2001.  Under these regulations a disability is 
considered chronic if it has existed for at least six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that Canada has chosen to treat veterans and 
others suffering from these disorders so poorly compared with our 
neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention, however, that I was very glad the minister 
recently met in Halifax with veterans suffering from these 
conditions.  I attended part of these sessions and I believe the 
minister would like to treat our troops suffering from illness 
relating to their service with respect.  But as we all know, good 
intent is not enough.  Concrete, positive action is desperately 
needed in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the approximately 750,000 troops deployed to the Persian 
Gulf, 4,500 of which were Canadian, approximately one-tenth are 
reporting a series of symptoms, the majority of which include 
fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, diarrhoea, skin rashes, 
shortness of breath and chest pains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The famous epidemiologist, Dr. Rosalie Bertel, has the following 
to say about depleted uranium: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DU is highly toxic to humans, both chemically as a heavy metal 
and radiologically as an alpha particle emitter which is very 
dangerous when taken internally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon impact, the DU bursts into flames.  It produces a toxic and 
radioactive ceramic aerosol that is much lighter than uranium 
dust.  It can travel in the air tens of kilometres from the point 
of release, or settle suspended in the air waiting to be stirred 
up in dust by human or animal movement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very small and can be breathed by anyone, from babies and 
pregnant women to the elderly and the sick.  This radioactive and 
toxic ceramic can stay in the lungs for years, irradiating the 
surrounding tissue with powerful alpha particles.  It can affect 
the lungs, gastrointestinal system, liver, kidneys, bone, other 
tissues and renal system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the response that we will now hear regarding my comments, I 
ask the Liberal government to give direct answers to the points I 
have raised.  Will the government expand the new testing, as I 
have outlined, and ensure that testing is undertaken by 
independent and respected laboratories?  Families of those people 
who are suffering from and have suffered from depleted uranium 
poisoning and other post-traumatic stress are waiting for a 
complete and positive response to these questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the hon. 
member will be quite pleased by my remarks this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has said many times previously, he cares about 
the health and welfare of CF members.  We must take care of 
anyone who was healthy when they were deployed but were sick when 
they came back.  I urge anyone who thinks they may be ill to seek 
medical attention.  Those who want depleted uranium testing 
should contact the Centre for Injured and Retired Members and 
Their Families at 1-800-883-6094 or their nearest CF medical 
facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reviewing proposals from a number of laboratories, the 
department selected two different independent companies to do the 
testing.  Results from the testing will be sent to a civilian 
consultant for independent interpretation.  Arrangements are now 
in place to begin testing current and former Canadian forces 
members who have asked for the procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are offering depleted uranium testing as a way of answering 
any possible concerns of CF personnel.  The vast majority of 
scientific evidence indicates that depleted uranium is not a 
hazard to Canadian forces personnel.  Normally, the CF test 
personnel for depleted uranium if there is evidence they have 
been exposed to it.  The Canadian forces has tested several 
personnel who had potentially been exposed to depleted uranium 
and the tests were negative.  The total uranium radiation was 
below detectable limits. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out to the House that Canada does not use depleted 
uranium at the moment and that there is no plan to acquire 
depleted uranium ammunition for the Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arsenal of some countries currently includes depleted 
uranium ammunition.  For a ban to be viable and make sense, the 
countries in question would have to be convinced to do without 
their depleted uranium ammunition, something that seems unlikely 
in the near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to follow up on a question I recently asked 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs about the consequences of the 
elections in Iran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year ago I had the great opportunity of visiting Iran 
and met a lot of the young people and the authorities.  I was 
extremely impressed by the young dynamic population of that 
country.  More than 50% of the population is under the age of 25. 
These young people want changes.  That was obviously indicated in 
the consequences of the recent elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president, Mr. Khatami, is a very positive individual.  He 
wrote a book called “Dialogue of Civilizations”.  He is very 
interested in having a dialogue with other countries and has a 
very positive view of what Iran can do and the role it can play 
in the world today.  We see a real change in attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade this morning, we had a group of responsible Canadian 
businessmen who are presently very active in this area.  They 
told us that they could see real signs of change in Iran.  There 
is co-operation between the Iranian and western authorities about 
controlling the drug trade with Afghanistan.  There is a lot of 
effort on behalf of the Iranian authorities to collaborate with 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there are very disturbing indications in that 
country.  The army is still in control and in the hands of the 
supreme leader, the Ayatollah.  The security apparatus is not in 
the hands of democratically elected officials.  The courts 
consist of clerics who are not responsive to change and the 
police carry on rather arbitrary activities which threaten the 
lives of ordinary citizens.  We see arbitrary actions of 
authority. 
We see things like the way in which tax laws are applied.  I was 
told by a group of businessmen when I was there that the 
arbitrariness of the tax laws is such that it is very hard to get 
foreign investors in the country because they do not really know 
the nature of the regime they are going into.  They do not have 
the juridical security they would like to have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We now come to today's situation and we are looking at some 
months since the last elections.  There is a parliamentary 
majority in favour of reform.  I would like to follow up my 
earlier question by asking the parliamentary secretary if he 
could tell us a bit about the changes that are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still read in the newspapers about how they are seized.  The 
morality police are still harassing young people.  There is a 
question as to the courts and how responsive they are.  There is 
a concern which I raised in the House today about the trial of a 
group of Jewish citizens of Iran which is taking place on 
Thursday and the nature of the protection they will receive and 
the nature of religious freedom that is taking place in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks as if this is a case of two steps forward and one step 
back.  I suppose that is true in all political situations.  I 
would like to know what we are doing about it.  What are we doing 
to encourage change?  How are we helping Iranians who want change 
to get change?  What visits are MPs, ministers and trade 
officials making?  It seems to me that now is the time to move. 
Now is the time to encourage those in authority in Iran to open 
their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that we might be a bit more active.  I 
would like to encourage the government to help and encourage the 
forces of change in Iran, and restrict the movement of those who 
wish to stop change, for the benefit of all Iranians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the February 18 legislative 
elections in Iran profoundly changed the balance of political 
power in the country.  The reformers of President Khatami won a 
majority of the seats.  Canada congratulates the people of Iran 
for honouring the democratic spirit of the elections and voting 
in such large numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the electoral process was open and fair and that it 
truly reflected the democratic will of the Iranian people. 
Results indicate that Iran is turning toward a more democratic 
system based on the rule of law and far removed from the 
ideological inflexibility of the past. 
With the presidential elections and the municipal elections in 
March 1999, this makes three times there has been a heavy 
pro-reform vote by the people of Iran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada hopes that the path the Iranian people has chosen will 
make it possible to renew connections with Teheran and to ensure 
the ongoing reintegration of Iran into the international 
community.  The government of President Khatami has done a great 
deal to improve its relations with its Arab neighbours and has 
turned to the West in hopes of expanding its relationships still 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has adopted a policy of limited engagement toward Iran, 
which restricts official visits between the two countries to the 
deputy ministerial level. The reason for the policy was Canada's 
concerns with Iran's human rights position, as well as its 
support of international terrorism, its opposition to the Middle 
East peace process and its support to groups that reject that 
process, and its search for weapons of massive destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we are greatly encouraged by the outcome of these 
elections, we are now waiting to see improvements in these 
strategic areas of concern.  We have seen some progress as far as 
human rights are concerned; the Baha'i are now allowed to 
register their marriages, thus improving the status of their 
children.  The government has, moreover, declared that it will 
hold a public trial for the 13 Iranian Jews and others who were 
arrested a year ago and charged with spying for Israel and the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has made it clear to the Iranian government that the 
suffering of these individuals is still of considerable concern 
to it, and that it did not see its way clear to normalize 
relations between the two countries as long as Iran had not 
resolved the situation to Canada's satisfaction.
