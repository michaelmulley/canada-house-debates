	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
inform you that I have decided to resign from the caucus of the 
Bloc Quebecois and to sit from now on as an independent 
sovereignist member.
<P>
	I entered politics in 1984 to promote decentralization, personal 
responsibility, sound public finances and national reconciliation. I 
was re-elected in 1988 for the same reasons and to finalize the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the Meech Lake 
accord.
<P>
	I resigned from the Progressive Conservative Party on June 26, 
1990, when English Canada refused to ratify the Meech Lake 
accord. On the 29th of the same month, I invited other former 
Conservative members to my office in Longueuil to discuss our 
future and our contribution to sovereignty plan for Quebec.
<P>
	At that meeting, we chose Lucien Bouchard as the leader of our 
parliamentary group. In the fall, we set up our caucus so as to be 
more effective in the House. On September 20, I was given the 
position of president of the caucus and became the group's main 
organizer.
<P>
	When it was decided to establish the Bloc Quebecois party in 
early February 1991, I agreed to be interim director general and to 
be responsible for the party's organizing activities in the 
Montérégie.
<P>
	In Tracy on June 15, 1991, the Bloc Quebecois became a party, 
and I had the honour of being the signatory vice-president. 
Subsequently, I was on the winning team in the 1993 election. Our 
party's platform was twofold: to defend the interests of Quebec and 
to promote sovereignty until a majority voted in favour of this 
concept in a referendum.
<P>
	Unfortunately, after the 1993 election, decision making within 
the Bloc Quebecois became rigid and  authoritarian. Opportunities 
to promote my own ideals and those of the business community, 
especially those of Quebec's small businesses, which is my 
background, were steadily dwindling.
<P>
	During the recent leadership campaign, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, who was a candidate, confirmed that he 
would maintain the same rigid policies. As we all know, the hon. 
member was elected leader and will continue to promote his 
political vision, which is diametrically opposed to my own.
<P>
	But that is not all. In fact, some fairly reliable rumours lead me 
to believe that the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie headed 
the group of members which brought about the departure of the 
former leader, the hon. member for Roberval. We have never had a 
satisfactory explanation of this situation.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, you will understand that I can neither 
come to terms with nor support the leadership of the hon. member 
for Laurier-Sainte-Marie. After spending so much time and 
energy on the party and our cause, I sincerely regret that I must 
resign from the caucus of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Several colleagues and party members very sincerely insisted 
that I should let bygones be bygones and continue to sit with the 
Bloc Quebecois, even if this meant staying home, so as to avoid 
tarnishing the image of the party and our cause just before a major 
election.
<P>
	Keep silent, me? Me, a member of Parliament from Quebec for 
nearly 13 years, and in a party I founded? Certainly not. Never.
<P>
	Others accused me more openly of putting my own insignificant 
self before the cause. I say to them: does the greatness or 
insignificance of an individual depend on the person's ability to be 
a sacrificial lamb or on moral and ethical integrity?
<P>
	Can they not understand that the rules of morality and ethics are 
not so many obstacles that we can circumvent at will?
<P>
	I cannot remain in the caucus of the Bloc Quebecois. This would 
only lead to tension and conflict that would be just as bad.
<P>
	My constituents in Longueuil, who have known and supported 
me since 1984, know that to me, honesty and frankness are sacred. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9060"> 9060 </A></B>
<P>
I am sure they will realize, although  they may not like it, that this 
decision was inevitable and is in the best interests of all concerned.
<P>
	I would like to say to my colleagues who honoured me with their 
trust and friendship that I appreciate their co-operation and wish to 
express my sincere thanks.
<P>
	As for the future, I will continue to work where I feel I will be 
most useful to defend the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	 <B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, this is my ruling: this is not a 
question of privilege but most certainly a personal statement.
<P>
	Since this is a personal statement and not a question of privilege, 
no other members will be recognized to speak to this matter. I wish 
to thank you for your personal statement.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment made by the Senate to Bill C-70, an act to amend the Excise 
Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the 
Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act and related acts be now read the second 
time and concurred in; but</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, while disapproving of any infraction of its privileges or rights by 
the other House, in this case waives its claim to insist upon such rights and privileges, 
but the waiver of said rights and privileges is not to be drawn into a precedent; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours therewith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I was listening to 
your point about the government asking us to waive certain rights 
and privileges. I wonder if we could get an explanation of what 
these rights and privileges are before we get into debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not the wording of the Chair. That 
is a matter of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in support of Bill 
C-70. My remarks today will focus on an amendment that was 
adopted in the other place last week.
<P>
	As hon. members will recall from earlier debates in the House, 
the purpose of Bill C-70 is to implement the harmonized sales tax 
in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland 
and Labrador. As of April 1, 1997 the harmonized tax will replace 
the GST and provincial retail sales taxes in those provinces.
<P>
	This legislation also proposes over 100 technical amendments to 
the Excise Tax Act. These technical improvements will apply not 
only to the harmonized sales tax, but also to the GST in the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	A key element of the legislation that was debated by the House a 
few weeks ago is tax included pricing. This is the feature of Bill 
C-70 that the hon. senators propose to amend. Specifically, the 
proposal is to delay tax included pricing until such time as 
provinces with sales taxes that comprise at least 51 per cent of 
Canada's population have harmonized or otherwise adopted tax 
included pricing.
<P>
	To repeat, the proposal is to delay tax included pricing until such 
time as provinces with sales taxes and that comprise at least 51 per 
cent of Canada's population have harmonized or have otherwise 
adopted tax included pricing.
<P>
	I would like to make two points concerning this development.
<P>
	First, in every other respect the proposed legislation that is the 
subject of today's debate is identical to the legislation that was 
passed by the House on February 11. The postponement of tax 
included pricing is the only change on which the hon. members will 
be asked to vote.
<P>
	Second, the government continues to recognize the importance 
of tax included pricing. As I have said many times, consumers want 
tax included pricing. This is a policy to which the government 
remains committed. As more provinces harmonize in the future, we 
will welcome tax included pricing as the solution to the annoyance, 
the inconvenience and the frustration that consumers now 
experience at the cash checkout every day.
<P>
	I would now like to explain the practical considerations that 
govern our approach today.
<P>
	Essentially, opposition senators on the banking, trade and 
commerce committee gave us a choice: either postpone tax 
included pricing or delay passage of the bill beyond the April 1 
implementation date.
<P>
	Speaking for the Progressive Conservative Party, Senator Angus 
stated emphatically that if the pricing requirements remained in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9061"> 9061 </A></B>
<P>
bill, it would not see the light of day by April. He said in no 
uncertain terms that his party would delay the bill regardless of the 
chaos and  confusion that such a delay would entail for businesses 
and everyone else that are gearing up for harmonization to come 
into effect 15 days from now.
<P>
	Given the potential for chaos, and given the fundamental 
economic benefits that harmonization will bring to the Atlantic 
economy, the risk of missing the April 1 deadline is a risk the 
government is not prepared to take.
<P>
	In the course of the banking, trade and commerce committee's 
recent hearings on the legislation, witness after witness spoke of 
the real and immediate advantages of the HST. The Atlantic 
Provinces Economic Council argued that the harmonized sales tax 
will make Atlantic Canada more competitive by ridding their 
economy of embedded sales taxes and by bringing the relatively 
high sales tax rates into line with those of other provinces. They see 
it as a way to reduce costs for businesses and stimulate consumer 
spending.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The government and its provincial counterparts also see 
harmonization as a way to reduce administrative costs. These and 
many other points were eloquently endorsed by the finance 
ministers of the participating provinces. All three ministers took 
the time to appear before the Senate committee.
<P>
	No matter how it is looked at, this is legislation that will work to 
the benefit of Newfoundlanders, Nova Scotians and New 
Brunswickers. That is a point these ministers came to Ottawa to 
make in the face of criticism from opposition parties that think they 
know better and that want to tell that region of the country what it 
should or should not do.
<P>
	On balance, the gains in this legislation outweigh the 
postponement of tax included pricing. We accept Bill C-70 in its 
amended form because of the long term economic benefits it will 
bring to the Atlantic region.
<P>
	A more immediate consideration is that April 1 is fast 
approaching and we must ensure the transition to a harmonized 
sales tax does not cause disruption and confusion for businesses 
and consumers.
<P>
	From the time the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Finance began studying options for replacing the GST three years 
ago, the goal of an orderly transition has been a guiding principle in 
developing the harmonization model that is before us today.
<P>
	In its current form, Bill C-70 contains several features that will 
contribute to a smooth transition. The harmonized tax will have the 
same tax base and same basic operating rules as the GST. There 
will be no requirement for GST registrants to obtain new 
registration numbers. Most businesses already know and 
understand the rules for applying the GST and for claiming input 
tax credits. These rules will continue to apply under the 
harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	The Atlantic business community needs certainty, a smooth and 
orderly transition to the harmonized system. The importance of a 
smooth transition is not lost on lawmakers in those provinces or on 
us in the House, for they have given their respective harmonization 
bills swift passage, something we are anxious to do as well. It is 
now time for hon. members to do likewise by supporting the 
proposed amendment to Bill C-70.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are faced with a monumental farce. If being ridiculous 
were fatal, all of the members of the government would be dead. 
Why?
<P>
	I would like to begin by reminding my listeners what our debate 
is about at this time. Bill C-70, which sets out the mechanisms for 
harmonizing the GST with the provincial sales taxes in three 
maritime provinces, was reviewed by the other House.
<P>
	The other House proposes, contrary to what is set out in the bill, 
which provides for the inclusion of the new harmonized 15 per cent 
tax in the price in three maritime provinces, to postpone 
implementation of this provision, or in other words to continue the 
status quo. This means that a consumer's receipt, and the price 
label on the item, will show the price, with the new tax rate beside 
it. The senators are asking that tax-inclusive pricing be postponed 
until 51 per cent of Canadians, and therefore a certain number of 
provinces, accept this inclusion in the price.
<P>
	How does the government respond to this proposed amendment 
by the Senate? As follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, while disapproving of any infraction of its privileges or rights by 
the other House, in this case waives its claim to insist upon such rights and privileges, 
but the waiver of such rights and privileges is not be drawn into a precedent; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours therewith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What this means is that the government is bowing to the other 
House, whose members are unelected, and part of an archaic, 
outmoded system that absolutely must be abolished. They accept 
the arguments of the other House, provided that this does not create 
a precedent.
<P>
	It is shameful to see them bowing to an unelected House with an 
archaic system, and moreover to arguments which were presented 
by elected members throughout the entire debate on Bill C-70.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Allow me to explain. One of the major points made throughout 
the entire debate-three readings and the report stage as well-by 
the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, which is made up of 
elected members, was precisely the fact that the new harmonized 
tax was being included in the price.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9062"> 9062 </A></B>
<P>
	In January, the finance committee heard witnesses representing 
maritime businesses and consumers tell us that including the new 
harmonized tax in the price made no sense, and would create 
chaos, total turmoil in the maritimes, particularly for companies 
doing business across Canada.
<P>
	We in the Bloc and the Reform Party as well-both of which are 
made up of duly elected members-hit the nail on the head. Yet, 
every time, the response was: ``You are wrong, the new harmonized 
tax must be included in the price right away, otherwise there will be 
total chaos in the maritimes, the system will be inefficient, and 
there will be chaos at the fiscal level''.
<P>
	Now, when the other House, which is made up of unelected, 
illegitimate members, proposes a similar amendment to the one we 
debated, the one to which the government turned a deaf ear, it gets 
presented and accepted, of course. We trust this will not serve as a 
precedent, that it will not reduce the rights and privileges of the 
House of Commons, of the duly elected members of the House of 
Commons. It makes no sense whatsoever to present things in this 
way.
<P>
	It does not make any sense either to make us debate and work for 
weeks on the finance committee to try to come up with something 
worthwhile, to try to listen to criticism and opinions from people 
from the maritimes even, to end up wasting time and taxpayers' 
money in this exercise, when we arrived at the very same 
conclusion as is being proposed today by the outmoded and 
outdated other House. We went through the entire process: lost 
time, wasted energy, overspent taxpayers' money so that the 
government could accept today, for purely partisan and election 
purposes, the amendment of the other House.
<P>
	Democracy has never been so badly served. The rights and 
privileges of the elected members of the House of Commons have 
never been so badly served as in this matter, which has been a 
disaster since the start.
<P>
	If that were the only issue, but there is also the one of 104 
individuals, whose appointments were totally partisan, who were 
appointed by the office of the Prime Minister. There is worse yet. 
The entire bill should be dumped.
<P>
	It is still around and it should be dumped, because it is not right, 
after the government's capitulation before unelected officials on 
the point of not including the new harmonized sales tax in the cost 
price, that we find ourselves back at the start- in other words, with 
the GST not harmonized with the provincial sales taxes. What is 
this situation? The GST remains, the problem remains in its 
entirety, politically. This government lied about its intentions and it 
is presenting this legislation to us as the bill of the century.
<P>
	Democracy is being very badly served, when, even before we 
passed Bill C-70, a few weeks ago, $961  million was paid out to 
the maritimes. Even before the bill was passed, even before 
democratic process was applied to this bill, the government had 
decided that democracy was of no importance.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	They do not care about the rights and privileges of members of 
the House. They released the funds they are already paying out to 
the maritimes. Under what pretext? Under the pretext of avoiding 
chaos, a chaos they created in the first place with this flawed and 
partisan bill to buy the maritimes with nearly $1 billion in 
compensation. This chaos is their doing. They would not listen to 
us, in the official opposition, when we told them that including the 
new harmonized sales tax in the price made no sense. Now, the 
same suggestion, coming from the 104 dinosaurs in the other place, 
is looked upon favourably.
<P>
	Sometimes, there is no logic in politics. What we have before us 
is a motion totally devoid of logic. Indeed, after going through the 
democratic process of debating a bill, where is the logic in the 
government going along with whatever nonsense the other place 
may have come up with? The government is overlooking the 
privileges of members of Parliament and forgetting the importance 
of the House of Commons. It has reached a point where the 
sovereignists have more respect for this institution, its rights and 
privileges, than the federalists, who claim to be 100 per cent behind 
the federal system, including its greatest manifestation: the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	It is a sad day for democracy when funds are released before the 
appropriate legislation is passed. At this rate, what will be the use 
of the House of Commons, of elected representatives, of debates on 
issues as fundamental as this one? One billion dollars is taken out 
of the pockets of taxpayers and literally thrown out the window. 
The GST problem remains unresolved. Nothing has been resolved. 
Even innovations like tax included pricing were no use, since the 
other place rejected the idea. Where does that leave us?
<P>
	We are back to square one. It is the provincial sales tax in three 
maritime provinces, three Atlantic provinces, that is being 
harmonized with the GST. The GST remains, but the new 
harmonized tax rate will drop to 15 per cent, at a cost of $1 billion 
to Canadian taxpayers. The initial situation was strangely similar to 
that prevailing in Quebec in 1993.
<P>
	We in Quebec harmonized our provincial sales tax with the GST, 
and not the other way around as provided for in the initial plan. We 
did not include the tax in the price. The situation in the maritimes is 
exactly the same as Quebec's situation since 1991. If that is the 
case, it means the people across the way owe us $2 billion. That 
amount was calculated based on specific criteria, on readily 
identifiable costs incurred in harmonizing Quebec's sales tax with 
the GST. The federal government owes us $2 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9063"> 9063 </A></B>
<P>
	This morning, we have an opportunity to demand that the 
government treat Quebec fairly. If our province were the only one 
making that claim, if it had no ally in this great federation, one 
might say ``Quebec is always complaining'', but three Canadian 
premiers support Quebec's claim. The British Columbia premier 
even said that if, based on the calculation method and the 
transition costs used, the maritimes were entitled to $961 million 
in compensation, then Quebec also deserved a compensation, 
estimated at $2 billion. There is basically a Canada-wide 
consensus that Quebec must be compensated for its harmonization 
efforts.
<P>
	If there is a matter in which the government is acting like a 
clown, in which government members, including the finance 
minister, are acting like clowns, it is definitely the GST. The 
Liberals made an issue of the GST during the last election 
campaign. Promises were made by the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister. These commitments were not fulfilled. Not 
only did the Liberals not fulfil their commitments, they also 
created total chaos in the maritimes.
<P>
	Earlier, the hon. member talked about uncertainty. He said that 
business people need certainty.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Business people need certainty. Big deal. The Liberals 
themselves created situations filled with uncertainty. So much so in 
fact that, just a few weeks ago, eminent representatives of business 
people from the maritimes no longer knew what to expect. They 
were told all sorts of things, such as: ``You could, perhaps, in the 
first three months, not include the new harmonized sales tax in the 
price. However, after three months, you should include that tax''. 
People no longer knew what to do. National companies no longer 
knew what to do, because they were now required to have a dual 
labelling system. They were now required to have a dual storage 
system for the goods they sell in the maritimes and those they sell 
elsewhere.
<P>
	Then the Senate came up with an amendment saying: ``Until 
such time as 51 per cent of Canadians agree to include the new 
harmonized sales tax in the price, we will not force them to do so''. 
What do business people think now? They are saying to 
themselves: ``We set up a system that allowed us to implement the 
main provisions of Bill C-70. Now the government is changing its 
mind because of the 104 anachronisms in the other place''. If that is 
not uncertainty, if that does leave businesses wondering where to 
head next, I do not know what it is.
<P>
	It was such an unsatisfactory bill that, the very day it was 
introduced in the House, the government decided it had better table 
over a dozen amendments along with it, right at the outset. For a 
government that knows where it is headed, when you introduce a 
bill and a dozen amendments to it at the same time, it is pretty hard 
to take. And then, at the end of the line, they accept to set aside one 
of its a provisions.
<P>
	So I continue to say that this bill makes no sense. It solves 
nothing. It is costing us almost $1 billion, outside the maritimes, in 
Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta. The taxpayers in these provinces are the ones who will be 
footing the bill for this compensation that is still unjustified and 
unjustifiable when we look at the treatment received by Quebec 
with respect to the harmonization process.
<P>
	And now, on top of that, the members opposite now say that they 
do not care about the rights and privileges of elected members. 
They are handing over part of the rights and privileges of the House 
of Commons to the 104 anachronisms in the other place, in a 
completely outdated institution which most Quebecers and 
Canadians would like to see abolished at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
	Therefore, in light of all this, and we will have some explaining 
to do during the upcoming election, we can only reject this motion 
because it comes from an institution we condemn, an institution 
that is costing taxpayers $43 million annually and does nothing 
more than add additional layers of uncertainty that the government 
bows to in agreeing to waive the rights and privileges of this 
House.
<P>
	We will also oppose this motion because overall this bill makes 
no sense to us. It is a bill that is costing Canadian taxpayers $1 
billion, and $1 billion in compensation to the maritimes should in 
the normal course of events lead to $2 billion in compensation to 
Quebec. But the government is turning a deaf ear to that.
<P>
	We are not about to congratulate this government, nor am I about 
to congratulate my colleague, because caving in like this in the face 
of a real process to reform overall taxation-something it defended 
when in opposition-and caving in as well before such an 
outmoded institution is unbelievable. We reject this motion, as we 
rejected Bill C-70.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again I rise to speak to Bill C-70. It seems to pursue us like a bad 
dream, having returned with amendments from the other place.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about some general principles which most 
people would hold to be extremely important. They are ones people 
would normally expect the government to adhere to. Most people 
believe very strongly in the principles of honesty, equality and 
accountability. The government has ignored those principles in 
bringing about Bill 70 again, and in bringing it about in the first 
place. I want to elaborate a little on that.
<P>

<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	During the last election campaign a great fraud was perpetrated 
in this country. The opposition at the time, the Liberals, criticized 
the government for years on end over the goods and services tax. It 
had gone on and on.
<P>
	The rhetoric was extreme. The Liberals said over and over again 
that they would get rid of the GST when they came into power. I 
have all kinds of quotes. I will not run through them again but I 
have stacks of quotes from prominent members across the way who 
now sit in cabinet who said that the GST would be gone when they 
came into power.
<P>
	The current defence minister was involved in this, the current 
finance minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and of course the 
Prime Minister. There were many other backbench members as 
well. In their campaign literature many said they would get rid of 
the GST. That was the tone of the debate.
<P>
	Hon. friends opposite will say that in the red book on page 22 
they said they would replace the GST. Indeed that is true. I 
acknowledge that. However, what is important to point out is while 
they were saying that and distributing it in the red book, which 
went to about 70,000 people with about three weeks left in the 
campaign, they were saying something quite different on national 
television. They were using the mass media to communicate a very 
different message.
<P>
	It is convenient that they could have both messages out there. 
They thought it would allow them to escape from a tight spot. In 
fact they did not escape. In the last few months we have seen this 
whole issue come back to bite them once again. I will touch on that 
in a moment.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that the end can never justify the 
means. My hon. friend, the parliamentary secretary for finance, is 
arguing that there are some positive changes in this legislation that 
will aid business. I acknowledge that tax simplification is a good 
idea. To the degree that business can work together with 
government at all levels and with consumers to simplify things so 
that it is easier for everyone, we should all support that. However, 
the ends do not justify the means.
<P>
	We have a situation here where the government set out quite 
deliberately in my judgment to take people down a course where 
they believe they were going to get rid of the GST. If we pass this 
amendment and legislation we are sending completely the wrong 
message. We are sending the message that they can dupe 
Canadians, that they can draw them in with what is nothing more 
than a huge mistruth and get them to vote for them, then turn 
around, do something completely different and it is okay. That is 
what the government is essentially saying.
<P>
	I cannot go along with that. There is a greater principle at stake 
here than just simplifying the tax system. We have a problem in 
this country where we actually have the public so cynical about 
what governments say they  will do in election campaigns that we 
have a lawsuit going on in British Columbia. Some people in that 
beautiful province have decided that they will not put up with it any 
more. They are actually suing their provincial government because 
they are tired of being mislead during election campaigns.
<P>
	That is precisely what has happened to this point where we are 
now talking about passing legislation that would change the GST. 
There is a huge principle in that. There is far more at stake here. It 
is far more important than the one that has been talked about by the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Simplification of the tax system is an important issue. No one 
really disagrees with that. However, the big issue is does one allow 
governments to go ahead and do things that they said they would 
not do simply to get elected. That is the big issue.
<P>
	That is the issue that is more important to a great majority of 
Canadians. The government has, frankly, mislead Canadians over 
the last three and a half years.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit more about that. Some hon. friends across the 
way are saying that is not the case. However, I would remind the 
chairman of the finance committee and other hon. friends across 
the way that the Prime Minister himself was caught in a trap on the 
GST at a town hall meeting on CBC just a few short months ago 
when he denied that he had said he would scrap the GST, get rid of 
it. When he was challenged by a young waitress from Montreal on 
this issue, he said ``I did not say any of those things''.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	What happened? The CBC just happened to have all kinds of 
footage of the Prime Minister saying precisely those things. Again 
the trust of the public was undermined.
<P>
	This is a far more important principle than whether we should go 
about simplifying the tax system. It was not just that. We had a 
byelection because the Deputy Prime Minister said on national 
television two weeks before the last election campaign that if the 
GST were not scrapped she would resign. She did indeed resign, 
and we were glad about that, but she took a poll first to find out 
whether it was okay to resign so she could run again.
<P>
	The issue here is whether politicians should be allowed to go 
ahead and make those kinds of promises only to turn around and 
completely refute them and then expect to get re-elected and expect 
to have people jump up and down about legislation that they are 
bringing through to simply cover up what it was they were trying to 
hide in the first place.
<P>
	I think people today are very cynical. It is interesting that this 
bill would come down on the eve of an election. To me this is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9065"> 9065 </A></B>
<P>
poster child for the GST, for the broken promises that the 
government has been unable to fulfil  since the last election. Of all 
the different promises that the government has broken, on things 
ranging from NAFTA, to the CBC, to day care spaces, to 
unemployment, this has to be one of the biggest broken promises.
<P>
	I would certainly encourage Canadians who are watching to hold 
the government accountable to the greatest degree that they can on 
this issue in the upcoming election.
<P>
	I also want to say a few words about equality. Equality is 
something most Canadians believe in very strongly. They believe 
that we should treat all the provinces equally. However, I would 
argue that by paying the Atlantic provinces, with the exception of 
Prince Edward Island, a billion dollars to go along with this deal, 
the government has done something that just flies in the face of 
what most Canadians believe to be fair and right, which is to treat 
all the provinces differently. It decided that it was going to pay a 
billion dollars to Atlantic Canada because that was the only way it 
could get it to go along with the deal.
<P>
	If members remember the atmosphere leading up to the 
agreement with Atlantic Canada, Atlantic Canadian provinces 
simply were not coming forward to the government saying ``boy, I 
wish you would offer us a harmonization deal''. They did not say 
that. In fact, the government was caught at that time because it was 
facing tremendous heat from the Canadian public because it had 
broken its GST promise so it needed a way out. Therefore it went to 
the Atlantic provinces and told them it would give them a billion 
dollars if they would go along with the harmonization deal. 
Because the Atlantic provinces are of course strapped for cash they 
said they would take the deal. That is how it happened.
<P>
	When the other provinces said they would be interested in 
talking about this too if there was that kind of money involved, all 
of a sudden there was no money left. The government could only 
provide for Atlantic Canada. The people of Quebec were asking for 
$2 billion in compensation. Ontario wanted over $3 billion. The 
government of course said it just could not do it. It points to how 
the government thinks differently about what the notion of equality 
is.
<P>
	Most Canadians feel that equality should be equal opportunity. If 
it is offered to one then it should be offered to everybody. The 
government has a different notion. It thinks that equality means 
equality of outcome. It thinks that equality means that we take from 
some provinces and give to other provinces and that makes 
everyone happy. It really does not work that way. In fact, all it does 
is divide Canadians. That is precisely what this legislation has 
done. It has divided Canadians on the notion that somehow some 
provinces are more equal than others.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I want to say a few words on the whole issue of accountability. I 
have talked about honesty, I have talked about equality and I want 
to say just a couple of words about accountability. Accountability 
is a common theme through the whole sorry tale of this legislation, 
going back to 1993 when the Liberals raised this as an issue during 
the election campaign. At that point they said they were going to 
scrap the GST.
<P>
	Unfortunately now Canadians would like to hold them 
accountable on that issue and they cannot, at least not until the next 
election campaign. In the meantime other things have happened 
that really raised the issue of whether or not we can properly hold 
our politicians accountable in this country, not just at the federal 
level but also at the provincial level.
<P>
	We had a situation, as I mentioned a minute ago, where the 
Atlantic provinces took $1 billion to introduce harmonization in 
those three provinces. But when that happened there were no 
hearings between the provincial governments and their own people. 
We all know that was a huge mistake because the province of New 
Brunswick for instance had to back down from the tax inclusive 
pricing portion of the legislation. It saw that the public simply did 
not support it there. Those people would have known better if they 
had talked to their people beforehand when they were accepting the 
money from the federal government.
<P>
	It does not just end there. There are all kinds of problems with 
the lack of accountability with respect to this legislation. It was not 
very long ago when other members of the finance committee and I 
sat here in Ottawa during the January break and we voted on an 
amendment that my party moved that we go to Atlantic Canada to 
have hearings on this issue. The Liberals voted against that. They 
denied the people of Atlantic Canada the chance to have a say on 
whether they wanted this legislation in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	In the United States people fought a war over taxation without 
representation. In Canada I guess we look at things a little 
differently. Newfoundland is going to be celebrating 500 years of 
history this year. We would think the government would say to the 
people of Newfoundland ``after 500 years we think it is probably 
okay for you to have a little say in how your taxation system should 
be structured''.
<P>
	The Liberal government denied them that opportunity. It took 
the unelected, patronage filled Senate to do it. It took the Senate to 
show the government what it means to go and talk to people, to 
consult with people. To me, that is absolutely ridiculous that they 
would be denied the chance to do that before their elected 
representatives in the House of Commons, but that is precisely 
what happened. That is so fundamentally wrong. It is completely 
wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9066"> 9066 </A></B>
<P>
	The accountability issue again is notable by the fact that very 
few Atlantic MPs have risen to speak to this issue, even though 
we know it was a major issue in Atlantic Canada. It fact, 16,000 
people signed a petition on the tax inclusive pricing issue alone. 
There were hearings before the provincial legislatures because 
there was such a public outcry.
<P>
	Where were the Atlantic MPs? Why did they not stand up for 
their constituents? There were stores closing down in many of their 
ridings. Did they stand to protest before the finance minister, 
before the government to say that there are problems? They were 
silent because they were afraid of what would happen if the party 
whip was put in place. We have seen how the government has dealt 
with dissenters in the past.
<P>
	There were a number of different occasions where the issue of 
accountability was raised and it was proven in this legislation that 
the government has no intention of being held accountable on an 
issue that is of vital importance to the people of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I want to speak about some of the specifics now. During the 
hearings we had back in January my party raised over and over 
again the issue of tax in pricing.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	At the time hon. members said that everybody in Atlantic 
Canada was on board. Now we know that was false. The 
government of New Brunswick said that it did not want tax in 
pricing after it had rethought it. Many businesses, almost entirely 
to the person, said that they did not want tax in pricing in one part 
of the country at one time, that it made no sense. We also know that 
consumers spoke out against it. Provincial politicians came 
forward to say that it would be a nightmare.
<P>
	What did the government do? It did nothing. Again it took the 
unelected patronage filled Senate to push the issue. That is a sad 
commentary. It does not say much for the government. They are the 
ones who have to take the pulse of the public along with my party 
to get the government to change its mind. Nevertheless it happened 
and people can judge for themselves what it says about the 
government.
<P>
	A concern with the legislation is how the government has over 
the years led physicians and providers of ambulance services on to 
believe that perhaps someday it would actually change the GST 
legislation to allow them to pass on the GST just like many small 
businesses pass it on, or at least to have it zero rated. Unfortunately 
the government has led these people on for a long time. It has 
basically slammed the door in their face over the last several 
months saying it was not on.
<P>
	We have a situation where doctors cannot pass on GST costs. It 
is one of the aggravating factors that causes physicians to flee the 
country to other places like the United States, which leaves us with 
a shortage of physicians in rural areas. Again the government has  
misplaced priorities. It has lots of money when it comes to 
providing funds for its friends at Bombardier but not when it comes 
to providing funds to ensure health care across the country and that 
all people are treated equally in the taxation system. All of a 
sudden it cannot find the money. It should be criticized very 
strongly for that.
<P>
	The final point I will make is with respect to the notional input 
tax credit. Over the last several days it has been interesting to 
watch the papers. There has been considerable discussion about 
how the government has been hiding millions of dollars of revenue. 
We need to point to one of the most least understood tax grabs the 
government has yet to bring about, one of the biggest tax grabs it is 
to bring about, that is the removal of the notional input tax credit on 
many different items.
<P>
	It will mean the government will bring in hundreds of millions of 
dollars. Some people estimate that it will $1 billion year more in 
revenue for the government. The people it hits are low income 
people because the notional input tax credit applies primarily to 
used goods. People who buy used goods are paying tax on tax on 
tax. The beneficiary of that is the federal government. It brings in 
hundreds of millions of dollars more a year in tax.
<P>
	For some reason the government has ignored this message and 
will push ahead with it anyway. The people who will pay the price 
are the people who can least afford it.
<P>
	I will wrap up by simply saying that the government has broken 
some very big principles: the principles of honesty, equality and 
accountability. Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That motion be amended in the first paragraph by deleting all the words after the 
word ``That'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House agrees with the principle set out in the amendment made by the Senate

to read as follows: pages 334 and 335, clause 242: replace lines 40 to 45 on page 334 
and lines 1 to 4 on page 335 with the following: `Subsection (1) comes into force on a

<B><A NAME="9067"> 9067 </A></B>
<P>
	I would be interested in hearing from him what impact that 
would have, especially in Alberta. What will we do with Alberta? 
Will it continue to be the lowest taxed province? Will it continue 
to have the highest rate of growth? Will it continue to have the 
best job creation program with lower taxes? Does he believe the 
idea that lower taxes equal more jobs would continue with the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his most 
excellent question.
<P>
	The question of what would happen with Alberta would 
ultimately be answered by Alberta. The whole amendment is 
contingent upon the province and the people of Alberta agreeing 
with what the federal government is proposing. It would ultimately 
be up to the people of Alberta to make that decision.
<P>
	The people of Alberta believe that taxes are a cancer on job 
creation, to use a phrase the finance minister has used in the past. I 
would argue that high taxes are ultimately the reason for the 
country failing to meet its job creation targets. It is the reason the 
Liberal government has failed to make any real progress on the 
issue of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	I spoke a minute ago about the Liberal promise on the GST. One 
of the biggest promises the government has broken for reasons that 
are worthy of our attention is that it would create jobs, jobs, jobs. 
There is such a tremendous tax burden on Canadians overall and 
particularly in payroll taxes that job creators, the small business 
people who create about 85 per cent of all jobs, simply do not have 
the incentive to create jobs. The federal government is proposing to 
increase premiums on CPP by 73 per cent, which will make it even 
more difficult for job creators to create jobs.
<P>
	In Alberta we have very low taxes relative to the rest of the 
country. The people in my province have a tremendous incentive to 
make money. When they do that they know they will be able to 
keep most of it. That gives them the incentive to keep working 
harder and harder and harder.
<P>
	In high tax jurisdictions, which I would regard Canada as a 
whole as being-and certainly relative to our G-7 neighbours that 
is true-it is difficult for people to get excited about creating jobs, 
knowing they will have to pay more and more in taxes the more 
money they make.
<P>
	I hope that adequately answers my friend's question.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the end 
of the speech by the member for Medicine Hat he spoke about 
notional tax credits being eliminated not only in Atlantic Canada. 
We thought the harmonized sales tax was applicable to only 
Atlantic Canada but we found that it was applicable right across the 
country.
<P>
	For example, every time a car changes hands, and cars get traded 
quite frequently, the government will take 7 per cent tax. It will be 
on new goods and on used goods. The government will be there 
with its hand out saying: ``7 per cent, please''.
<P>
	I recall some years ago when the Liberals were on this side of the 
House and they adamantly forced the Tory government of the day 
to make an absolute guarantee that used goods would never be 
taxed.
<P>
	Does the member for Medicine Hat feel this is another broken 
promise of the Liberal government? Is taxation which is usurious 
and ongoing beneficial to the economy, or does it kill more jobs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the tough question. It is a 
broken promise which we could add to the long list of broken 
promises on taxation.
<P>
	My friend mentioned the notional input credit. The removal of 
the notional input tax credit would mean that people would have to 
pay more for used books. Another broken promise is that the 
government was to get rid of the GST on reading material. It did 
not do that even though it promised to in a letter from the Prime 
Minister to the Don't Tax Reading Coalition and in a number of 
policy conventions. In many respects the government is penalizing 
people who read, which is flying completely in the face of what it 
said it would do.
<P>
	My hon. friend has it right. The government has broken promises 
on the taxation issue and to people it thought would support it on 
the basis of its promise not to tax reading materials.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to follow my friend and colleague from Medicine Hat.
<P>
	Let me clear up a few misunderstandings. Are Reform Party 
members advocating that no used goods should be subject to the 
GST? Are they saying that people who sell used goods should be 
favoured as opposed to people who sell new goods? Is this what 
they are trying to prejudice?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> You are the guys who are trying to change the 
policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Are they advocating that no used goods should be 
subject to the GST? Are they saying that services should not be 
subject to the GST? Do they want a level playing field or do they 
not? They cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	The hon. member for Medicine Hat made great issue about 
compensation being paid to the three Atlantic provinces over a 
three-year period. He said it was a breach of equal treatment for 
provinces.
<P>
	Let us take a look at it. Every province that wants to harmonize 
the GST at a lower rate and loses money will be entitled to 
compensation. That is what we call equality of opportunity for all 
provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9068"> 9068 </A></B>
<P>
	We must remember the combined sales tax rates in 
Newfoundland were about 20 per cent. In the other two provinces, 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, they were about 19 per cent. 
These are punitive rates. Why should these provinces have to pay 
outlandish rates of taxes just because they are the poorest 
provinces? We are pleased they were able to benefit consumers 
by getting their combined rates of tax down to about 15 per cent. 
I am proud of that.
<P>
	If the provincial governments lose money because of it, I am not 
upset at all if some compensation is to be paid over a three-year 
period to help those provincial coffers adjust to that temporary loss 
of revenue.
<P>
	Members will say it was not fair. Have we not in other 
circumstances helped other provinces?
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	The member talked about Alberta, which has the lowest rate of 
tax. There is no provincial sales tax in Alberta. Why is that?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We do not need it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Why is that? Because it has a tax other provinces 
do not have. It has a tax on its energy royalties. It gets a tremendous 
tax revenue out of its energy which no other province does.
<P>
	In spite of that, what did the federal government do recently? It 
gave tax incentives which would allow the tarsands to develop. It 
amounted to millions upon million of dollars. Did they complain 
about that type of grant not being offered to other provinces? No. 
They cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I do not apologize for one minute that this government is in the 
position of making loans to enterprises which are employing 
Canadians, creating exports, building planes and putting us at the 
leading edge of the global economy.
<P>
	This is a responsible use of federal power. Let us not shrink for 
one minute from the fact that in these areas we do have leading 
edge technology. Our companies are world leaders because we 
have a partnership, not through grants but through loans.
<P>
	Let me return to the issue of the harmonized sales tax. We have 
looked as a finance committee and as a Parliament at this issue for 
a long period of time. Our committee had the privilege in 1993-94 
of looking at alternatives to the goods and services tax. The thing 
that we found most compelling was that Canada is the only country 
in the world that had not just one retail sales tax but ten different 
retail sales taxes. Canada was the only country in the world that had 
more than one retail sales tax.
<P>
	What did that mean to Canadians? It meant that we were 
supporting as taxpayers ten bureaucracies instead of one. It meant 
that businesses had to assume the incredible cost of complying with 
not just one sales tax regime but ten different regimes. Some 
European countries have a value added tax. Canadian consumers 
did not have the benefit of tax included pricing. The price they saw 
advertised on the item was not what they had to pay when they 
went to the cash register.
<P>
	One witness appeared before us, among many, who put on the 
table $40,000 in cancelled receipts from irate customers who, when 
they got to the checkout counter and found they had to pay more 
than the price shown, decided not to buy the item. That is the 
phenomenon of sticker shock or counter shock.
<P>
	We have found through extensive surveying and working with 
consumer groups that consumers want to know what they have to 
pay when they get to the cash register and take the money out of 
their wallets. Overwhelmingly, 86 per cent of Canadians surveyed 
on the issue of tax inclusive pricing for the three Atlantic provinces 
involved wanted tax inclusive pricing. Why should they not? Why 
should merchants not want to give it to them? After all, the price 
they see is the price they should have to pay.
<P>
	Another advantage of the harmonized tax system goes to our 
business competitiveness and our capacity to create jobs. Today in 
Canada businesses are paying about $6 billion in provincial sales 
taxes on their business inputs. These are things which they must 
purchase in order to carry on business, such as a car, a computer, 
furniture and so on.
<P>
	Why should Canadian businesses have to pay this type of tax 
burden when their American counterparts do not?
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This is why businesses in the three provinces of Atlantic Canada 
were paying $580 million in provincial taxes on their business 
inputs. This made them non-competitive in many cases with their 
American counterparts. They should not have to pay provincial 
sales taxes on their business inputs. It is against all good tax policy.
<P>
	Therefore this was one of the great advantages of this 
harmonized sales tax. No longer would Atlantic provinces have 
their businesses at this competitive disadvantage when it came to 
creating jobs.
<P>
	Through the harmonization process they have gone through, they 
will have these tax savings. They will be able to pass much of those 
savings, if not all of them, on to consumers in Atlantic Canada. 
Those businesses will have a competitive advantage over 
businesses in Ontario and other provinces where the provinces still 
tax their business inputs in terms of creating jobs and being 
competitive.
<P>
	These are some of the compelling reasons why we need 
harmonization and why no one in this House has spoken against 
harmonization. Not one witness before our finance committee 
spoke against the harmonized regime.
<P>

<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat was quite right in suggesting that 
tax inclusive pricing was a bit of a problem. If a national retailer 
based outside Atlantic Canada had to publish another catalogue 
showing the real price people would have to pay, or if someone 
had to retag the price of goods, that would be an added cost.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. There were some added costs to businesses 
that were going to be doing business in Atlantic Canada but were 
not getting the benefit of the input tax credits because they did not 
purchase any of their business inputs in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	If someone had a business based outside the three harmonized 
provinces and they were not spending money in that area, or very 
little money, because what they were doing was running a retail 
operation, bringing the goods in, selling them and not making a lot 
of purchases there, they were not going to get the benefits. All 
witnesses realize this. They would not participate in that $580 
some million of tax savings per year. It is quite understandable that 
businesses that were going to have the added costs from tax 
inclusive pricing that were not offset by the tax savings on their 
business inputs were going to complain.
<P>
	I have no problem with that. They were quite right in doing it. 
However, for the hon. member for Medicine Hat to say that what 
the Senate did was create a victory against tax inclusive pricing is 
wrong. We were not going to take the chance that we could not get 
this bill through on time.
<P>
	The Senate threatened to hold it up beyond the implementation 
date of April 1 if we were not capable of doing something about tax 
inclusive pricing. Therefore, we said maybe we have to go along 
with that because what is really critical to Atlantic Canada is that 
we get the harmonized tax in place, even without tax inclusive 
pricing.
<P>
	The Senate did not reject tax inclusive pricing as a fundamental 
concept of this tax. It said that as soon as provinces with 51 per cent 
of the Canadian population are on board, it will then insist on tax 
inclusive pricing for all provinces.
<P>
	This is an acceptance, even by the Conservative majority in the 
Senate, of this concept of tax inclusive pricing. It recognize it is 
good for consumers. We have held all along that it is important to 
consumers to know exactly what they will pay.
<P>
	This is supported by not only the polls of consumers but by the 
Consumers' Association of Canada. It has has argued very strongly 
in front of our committee and Parliament that we need the concept 
of tax inclusive pricing. Telling people in advance how much it is 
going to cost them out of their wallet is just fairness.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I regret that we are not able to proceed with the tax inclusive 
pricing. However, let me be clear. We were not dogmatic about how 
it went into effect. We in the finance committee, along with the 
government, suggested many compromises that would have 
softened the burden of tax inclusive pricing for most businesses. 
For example, we told businesses they only needed to have one 
catalogue, not two, if they were a national advertiser. We told them 
they could advertise at one price throughout the whole country but 
to put a little disclaimer somewhere in the catalogue stating that 
provincial sales taxes are not included.
<P>
	We suggested to businesses that they did not have to reticket 
every item that was in inventory. They could go to other things 
such as rack pricing, bin pricing and dual ticketing on items that 
were there. For certain items they could even have certain types of 
signage which would indicate what the prices were. In other words, 
we suggested that there were many ways we could achieve benefits 
for consumers of tax inclusive pricing and reduce the cost from 
those which were originally contemplated and would apply under a 
fully harmonized, hardline, tax inclusive pricing regime.
<P>
	We were working with business groups. We worked with the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business. It was working with 
its members to come back to us in order to find ways to implement 
the tax in such a way that the burdens were reduced and the benefits 
for consumers were still there.
<P>
	I am pleased that we have proceeded with the harmonization in 
these three provinces. I think this is just a step on the journey to 
achieving a fully harmonized sales tax system throughout Canada. 
It is inevitable that it will come. Taxpayers do not want to support 
the duplication and overlap of now eight different systems as 
opposed to ten. It is just stupid. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business castigated us and asked us when we were 
finally going to get our act together as politicians, federal and 
provincial, and do what was right for the people to help make 
businesses competitive and help get rid of the unnecessary costs. 
We are on that road and we will do it.
<P>
	When we brought in the concept of the Canada Health Act there 
were only two provinces that initially signed on. It took some years 
before all the other provinces agreed to go along with it. This is 
what I envisage in terms of the future of it. No one is arguing 
against that concept and the inevitability that we should have one 
sales tax system throughout Canada based on the GST model, and 
this is what we will achieve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to point out that he was talking about the inevitability of 
a universal sales tax right across this country when three and a half 
years ago they were talking absolutely and categorically that there 
would be  no sales tax courtesy of the federal government. So this 
is an absolute, complete turnaround on behalf of the member for 
Willowdale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9070"> 9070 </A></B>
<P>
	While the member talks about a universal sales tax right across 
the country, it seems to me he is talking in the same model that they 
have proposed for Atlantic Canada of 15 per cent right across the 
board. What does he intend to do for the province of Alberta which 
has no provincial sales tax at all at this point in time and the people 
of Alberta have no intention of having any provincial sales tax of 
any kind? Is it the intention of the member that the government 
would compensate the province of Alberta by reducing its rate, 
according to what kind of vision he has, so that it would only pay 
the federal rate so that Albertans would recognize that they are not 
subsidizing the rest of Canada as they have done in many other 
issues?
<P>
	We think back to the national energy policy of 1983 where 
Albertans basically carried the federal government and the rest of 
the country on their backs. They felt that they were being hard done 
by as billions of dollars flowed from the province of Alberta to the 
rest of the country.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member when he envisions this universal 
sales tax right across the country, whether or not Alberta is going to 
pay more than its share again and how inevitable is this tax when 
three and a half years ago the Liberals were telling us there would 
be no tax at all?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for St. 
Albert for his question.
<P>
	It is very simple. Canada is a difficult country to govern, as we 
all know, with its various jurisdictions. When the members of the 
finance committee recommended that the 10 different sales taxes 
be replaced by a single national value added tax we contemplated 
two things. We did a lot of work on this.
<P>
	We contemplated and recommended a tax that could be brought 
in one province or two provinces at a time. In other words, not all 
provinces had to accede to the new regime at the same time. 
Second, although it makes a more complicated tax, provinces did 
not have to come in all at the same rate.
<P>
	Over time I can see provinces coming in at different rates. For 
example, Premier Harris had promised before the last Ontario 
election that Ontario recognized the incredible advantages to that 
province of having a harmonized sales tax system. Ontario could 
probably harmonize at about 13 to 14 per cent instead of 15 per 
cent and be revenue neutral. Why would it come in at a higher rate?
<P>
	The tax system in place, as the member for St. Albert well knows 
because he has a strong accounting background, envisages the 
possibility of different rates. It would be easier to administer if the 
rate is the same in  every province and maybe over years, after all 
the provinces have acceded to the tax, the rates will come together. 
That will be a further step in the process of simplification.
<P>
	When the member goes back to the perceived injustices of the 
national energy program of the 1980s, why does he not talk about 
the billions of dollars of tax grants that were given to make the tar 
sands available just recently? Is he ashamed of that? Why does he 
not talk about the millions on millions of dollars that we are giving 
to the farmers in western Canada, the western diversification fund, 
in helping them transport their goods to market or to diversify and 
get away from their dependence on some of the funds they have 
had?
<P>
	What bothers me most about this debate is that we can differ as 
parliamentarians about the HST. But when members deliberately 
set out to create a balance sheet where they do not put in all the 
figures on what provinces are receiving from Confederation, they 
are trying to be divisive and set provinces against provinces, rather 
than recognizing that we are so fortunate to be in this country.
<P>
	This country is diverse, with different economic circumstances 
from coast to coast. But part of being a nation is to help those 
regions from time to time with things like equalization and perhaps 
special breaks that will help them with their resources, with their 
transportation needs or whatever. That is the essence to me of being 
a country.
<P>
	I do not shy away from these programs which are entered into in 
the spirit of helping those regions that need it most. This, to me, is 
what this nation is about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Spea-ker, I just wanted to make one quick comment.
<P>
	In the finance committee report on the harmonized sales tax, I 
had the privilege of drafting, and later getting approved by my 
colleagues, the idea that perhaps the tax in pricing should be 
suspended for the provinces. If the government had followed my 
recommendation, then it would have saved itself all this 
embarrassment.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I agree that tax in pricing at this stage is a good thing to do. 
Because of the fear that the Conservatives had over the ability of 
the government simply to raise taxes by one little percentage point 
on the harmonized sales tax and get away with it because people 
would not notice it is just not true. In western Europe we have seen 
that when the German government tried to do that it had a major tax 
revolt on its hands. The Conservative argument in the light of those 
experiences is not valid.
<P>
	In the hearings of the finance committee the member and I heard 
from 1,000 witnesses the suggestion that we still have a real bad 
monster on our hands, a value added tax which has in it 
exemptions, zero rating and all kinds of complications which are an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9071"> 9071 </A></B>
<P>
accountants' nightmare. Witnesses suggested getting rid of this, 
put the same rate on everything at a much lower percentage than it 
is right now. If there are good causes-magazines and poor people 
who need subsidies-write them cheques. Give them explicit 
subsidies. It will be open and everyone will know about it.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member's position on this 
suggestion. Does he see any hope that a reform of this sort will be 
carried through in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound for what I think is a very important 
question.
<P>
	I agree with him that from a strict tax policy point of view the 
ideal tax would be the simplest. It would apply to everything, no 
exemptions. That would mean a lower rate. For example, if the 
GST were to apply to basic groceries it could probably be reduced 
by about 0.7 per cent. Everything in the country would have a 
slightly lower tax rate.
<P>
	In asking this question the member has displayed the type of 
integrity and intellectual honesty which we in the finance 
committee have to come respect over the last three years. I 
commend him for this. The problem is from a tax policy point of 
view. It might be right but Canadians at this point are not yet 
prepared to accept that the tax should apply to things such as basic 
groceries, certain medicines, drugs and health devices.
<P>
	I do not mind that debate being held. I commend the hon. 
member for bringing this forward but at this time I do not think 
Canadians are ready to accept that type of tax reform. We are 
having enough difficulty getting the harmonized tax in place. 
Maybe that is something that can be contemplated down the road.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended in the first paragraph by deleting all the words after

<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. You have been 
trying to clarify that amendment which comes from a party that 
promises to practise politics differently.
<P>
	Can the Chair or the Reform members clarify whether the

harmonization to Atlantic Canada because one province does not 
have a sales tax and it calls for-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary knows that is 
not a point of order but debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Standing Committee on Finance held three days of hearings on Bill 
C-70 in January. Here are some powerful examples of what was 
contained in the briefs. I will provide a quick overview.
<P>
	For example, the Retail Council of Canada, which submitted a 
brief, represents over 65 per cent of all retail business in Canada. 
Even though this body supports the harmonization of provincial 
and federal sales taxes, it opposes the inclusion of the tax in the 
selling price in the maritimes as a policy that will drive up costs 
and add to the confusion among consumers.
<P>
	By approving several different ways of displaying the price with 
the tax and by providing a number of exceptions to these rules, 
federal policy seriously complicates the situation. How is it 
possible to compare costs at two retailers that use different 
methods to display a price with the tax?
<P>
	Consumers will be faced with different labelling within a single 
store. For example, some products will display the price with the 
tax, others without; others will have a package label without tax, 
but a shelf label with it and then there will be products that are tax 
exempt or that do not need to have the price indicated with the tax. 
How are we going to know the total cost of our purchases with such 
a system, with such confusion? A single product could have as 
many as four different prices on the label: the regular price with 
and without tax, and the discount price with and without tax.
<P>
	In short, as these examples show, it will be much more difficult 
for the consumer to discover the price of merchandise quickly and 
easily.
<P>
	The tax can be included in the price over a four month period, as 
the legislation provides. The Retail Council of Canada claims, and 
rightly so, that the firms including the tax in the price ahead of the 
others will be shooting themselves in the foot, because they will 
display a price on a product that will be higher than at a 
competitor's.
<P>
	The buffer period may well be useless, because, in all likelihood, 
every firm will be waiting until the last minute to display prices 
with the tax included.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9072"> 9072 </A></B>
<P>
	In terms of the costs involved in Bill C-70, the Retail Council 
of Canada estimates it will cost the retail industry $90 million in 
recurring annual costs and another $85 or $90 million for the 
initial adjustment to switch over from the old way to the new 
harmonized Liberal tax.
<P>
	Finally, the council vehemently criticizes the fact that hearings 
were held on only three days in January. It also criticizes the 
Standing Committee on Finance for holding hearings only in 
Ottawa, thus preventing a multitude of small retail merchants from 
testifying and expressing their opinion.
<P>
	The Council said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``These tactics leave retailers wondering whether legislators 
have any interest in their views whatsoever''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It should be pointed out that the Bloc Quebecois supported the 
Reform motion to continue hearings in the maritimes, a motion that 
was defeated by the Liberal majority in committee. I clearly 
remember that hearing day; I sat on the committee as a Bloc 
Quebecois member.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	In its brief to the committee, and this is a second example, Sears 
Canada, said, and I quote: ``For Canadian retailers, tax inclusive 
pricing in a partially harmonized system will mean higher costs 
and more complex systems''.
<P>
	Sears will produce 52 million catalogues in 1997, but the 
production of ``harmonized'' catalogues, to accommodate the 
standards applying to the maritimes, will cost Sears a fortune. It 
may also mean fewer catalogues or higher retail prices for 
consumers in the maritimes.
<P>
	Sears also testified that, while the purpose of this legislation is 
not to limit product availability in harmonized provinces, this will 
certainly be the result''. In addition, like many other large chain 
stores, Sears labels its products before shipping them to its stores. 
With Bill C-70, the company will have to keep two separate stocks, 
depending on whether the price includes the tax or not, with the 
related increase in production costs being reflected in retail prices. 
Goods will have to be divided in lots and stored separately before 
shipping, which complicates things, be it only by imposing the use 
of a dual stock system.
<P>
	The brief submitted by Woolworth Canada Inc., a company with 
over 100 stores and 14,000 employees in the provinces affected by 
harmonization, included the following: ``Given that the proposed 
legislation applies only to three small provinces, and given the 
current proposals regarding tax inclusive pricing, we believe that 
costs will significantly increase for retailers and  consumers, and 
that this legislation will also result in extreme confusion''.
<P>
	In its brief, Canadian Tire writes the following, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are opposed to the piecemeal approach to the application of tax inclusive 
pricing as part of the introduction of the new HST. This would create very significant 
ongoing costs as well as extreme confusion to our customers-for the retail industry, 
any benefits derived from input tax credits are more than offset by the significant 
cost increases resulting from tax inclusive pricing. There are no savings; in fact there 
are increased costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Here are a few excerpts taken from the Liberal minority report of 
November 1989 on the GST, when the Conservatives decided to 
introduce this consumer tax, and I quote: ``The Liberal members of 
the finance committee maintain that the goods and services tax 
proposed by the Tory government is bad and that no 'repair job' of 
any kind will make it fair for taxpayers''. You can find that quote 
on page 283 of the report.
<P>
	What are the Liberals doing with Bill C-70, if not a repair job? 
Except for the fact that the tax is hidden in the price, the GST 
remains the same and its rate remains the same. In fact, it is the 
provincial tax that is being harmonized. Therefore, the Liberals are 
only doing a repair job on the Conservatives' GST and, if we are to 
believe their own words, this new HST is as bad and unfair for 
taxpayers as the old GST. ``Moreover, if the GST is hidden in the 
sales price, it will be a lot easier for the government to raise it 
later''. This is from page 298 of the same report.
<P>
	Based on the Liberal logic, one can conclude that the Minister of 
Finance will certainly increase the GST in the maritimes in his next 
budget, since he is in the process of hiding that tax in the sales 
price. In 1989, the Liberals condemned the idea of hiding the GST 
in the price. However, in 1997, they are doing just that, on the false 
pretence that this is what consumers want.
<P>
	Consumers want the Liberal government to fulfil its 
commitments, including the promise to scrap the GST; they do not 
want the government to hide it in the price or partially harmonize 
it.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Why, then, have the Liberals systematically refused, since they 
have formed the government, to carry out such a total reform of the 
Canadian taxation system?
<P>
	Even though this ill advised promise will cost Quebecers and 
other Canadians close to $1 billion, all the Liberals can think about 
is getting out of the mess at any cost and as quickly as possible. Just 
as they did with the Airbus affair, Pearson and the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	This is therefore not the first time the Liberals have made 
colossal errors that will cost taxpayers hundreds of  millions of 
dollars but not taken any responsibility for their actions. Even in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9073"> 9073 </A></B>
<P>
the case of the GST, the Liberal government showed its contempt 
for democracy by preventing opposition members from doing their 
job.
<P>
	Yet the Liberals came up with 13 important amendments, those 
were their words, to Bill C-70, the very evening of the third and 
final day of public consultation, claiming that these amendments 
were a response to the complaints heard during the three days of 
hearings. If it was possible to find 13 amendments in three days, 
imagine how many we would have had if we had been able to 
extend the public hearings by one or two weeks.
<P>
	In their haste to leave behind the embarrassing issue of the GST, 
the Liberals do not want to hear what people have to say; they are 
afraid that people in the maritimes will tell them the plain truth: 
Bill C-70 is a botched job, a very bad bill. The Liberals are standing 
in the way of democracy by preventing citizens from expressing 
their views during the legislative process, and by moving full steam 
ahead, worrying more about their electoral agenda than about doing 
a good job of serving the citizens who will pay for this new tax, and 
who, in the meantime, are paying their salaries.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed as a block to this bill 
to harmonize the GST in the maritimes. This is a botched bill. It is 
based purely on political and electoral considerations. It is badly 
written. People have pointed out all sorts of shortcomings that the 
government does not even want to hear about. It is not the 
harmonization model that maritimers deserve and are calling for.
<P>
	What is more, in order to convince the three maritime provinces 
in question, the federal government had to promise political 
compensation of $1 billion, while it has systematically refused to 
pay Quebec, in all fairness, the $2 billion it lost by harmonizing its 
provincial sales tax with the GST in 1991.
<P>
	If the federal government is able to come up with $1 billion for 
the maritimes, let it also find a way to come up with the $2 billion 
owing Quebec. Otherwise, everyone should receive the same 
treatment and the federal government should stop subsidizing New 
Brunswick's corporate raiding in Quebec using Quebecers' tax 
money.
<P>
	For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is calling upon the 
government to go back to the drawing board, to start from scratch 
with a new bill on its plan to harmonize the GST, this time taking 
the time required to present a serious bill, and particularly taking 
the time to listen to what people have to say.
<P>
	The Liberal government had winning votes in mind when it 
spoke out against the partial removal of the tax from books. Only 
educational and literacy institutions will pay no GST on books 
purchased, while what I would call the normal taxpayer, the person 
who buys books at  the neighbourhood bookstore, will continue to 
pay it. No doubt what the Liberals want is to be able to say, during 
the next campaign which is almost upon us, that they have taken 
the GST off books. But that is not true.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that, with the Senate 
amendment to Bill C-70, there will be no further reference to 
including the GST in the price as long as a minimum of 51 per cent 
of the population of Canada does not have a provincial sales tax 
system harmonized with the federal sales tax. During all of the 
House debates on Bill C-70, the Bloc Quebecois spoke out against 
the government's haste to get rid of the GST business before the 
election.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois spoke out against, and voted against, Bill 
C-70, asking the government, as I have said, to go back to the 
drawing board, to propose another model for harmonizing the sales 
tax, since this one was full of defects.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Liberals would not listen to us. But now we 
have the Senate proposing an amendment to Bill C-70 which is, 
basically, along the same lines as what we were finding fault with 
in the bill, and the Liberals are preparing to adopt it.
<P>
	I would therefore like to say in closing that the Minister of 
Finance has stated, on a number of occasions, that Bill C-70 would 
introduce inclusion of the GST in the price in response to the 
wishes of the people. Now that they are preparing to remove 
inclusion of the tax in the price from Bill C-70, what is left of Bill 
C-70? Nothing. The GST is still the GST. What is being 
harmonized is the provincial tax, not vice versa, despite what they 
are trying to make us believe. And for that they are going to pay the 
maritimes $1 billion, while Quebec gets turned down when it asks, 
in all fairness, for $2 billion for having done the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I promise I 
will not use the word you and I debated in the House a little while 
ago or refer to the definitions the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance was so worried about.
<P>
	I will call it an inducement. I will call it a payment to another 
province that tried to make up for a shortfall in revenue in terms of 
the provincial sales tax it was charging. They have now converted it 
to a broader base of goods and services which in effect has the final 
impact of raising the GST in the three Atlantic provinces from7 per cent to 15 per cent.
<P>
	After two or three months consumers will realize that they have 
to pay more for goods and services in the three provinces thanks to 
the Liberal government and thanks to Atlantic MPs. During the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9074"> 9074 </A></B>
<P>
election campaign I hope  they remember that and vote for the 
people who will represent their region.
<P>
	I find it interesting that two groups are responsible for having the 
bill come back to the House. It passed third reading; it was pushed 
through. The Liberal government was praising its merits and the 
value of a harmonized sales tax. One of the two groups is the 
provincial government of New Brunswick and Premier Frank 
McKenna.
<P>
	He is no longer a Liberal in the true tradition in that he has 
broken with the rank and file Liberal philosophy. He has chosen to 
do something the Reform Party prides itself in doing. He has 
chosen to represent the people who voted him into power. He 
listened to the people in his region and argued their position so that 
they got a chance to have an impact on a collective group like the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	The second group that had influence was the Senate banking 
committee. If it were not for its members taking the time to go to 
the Atlantic provinces, the government would have been able to 
force, pressure, foist, push, cajole or put it on to the people of 
Atlantic Canada and then brag about how good the harmonized 
sales tax was for the rest of the country.
<P>
	The Senate committee listened to the people of the Atlantic 
region. As a matter of fact the master of myth, the Minister of 
Finance, even felt it was so important that he should show the 
courage to show up at the committee to tell Atlantic Canada why he 
felt he had to have tax inclusive pricing.
<P>
	Having done so it all came out: all the things Reform Party 
members said in the House of Commons and all the things 
committee members said in the Standing Committee on Finance on 
what was wrong with harmonized sales tax: that it was ad hoc, that 
it was partial, that it was confusing, that it was coercion.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Yes, that payment of $961 million to the Atlantic provinces was 
definitely an influencing factor for those three provinces. Not that 
it was better for business or for anybody, because at the end of the 
day everybody in the Atlantic provinces who made representation 
to the Senate committee complained. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business and the Retail Council of Canada 
complained that the Liberals were not listening. However, the 
finance minister said that consumers wanted this and the 
government was going to give it to them. That is why we have tax 
inclusive pricing.
<P>
	The minister was not listening to the people. This was strictly a 
poorly concocted, politically motivated effort so that in the next 
election the Liberals can stand up and say they kept their promise 
to replace the GST.
<P>
	Because the deputy leader quit, we all know the Liberals did not 
keep the promise they made door to  door to get elected which was 
that they would kill the GST. They said they hated it, they would 
kill it, they would abolish it and they would scrap it. They know 
they did not keep that promise, so they want to shift the debate on 
to another level, another plane which is to read the red book which 
said ``replace''. They wanted to put this in there. They wanted to 
change the name. They wanted tax inclusive pricing so they could 
call it the harmonized sales tax and nobody would be referring to 
the GST.
<P>
	They did not get their way. The GST is still there. I am very 
disappointed that at the end of the day we have a bunch of 
politicians who end up lacking integrity and losing their principles. 
How can a person as knowledgeable and as competent as the 
Minister of Finance lose his principles? How can a person like that, 
who sat in opposition dreaming of being in government and who 
finally is in government, entrench the GST in people's lives forever 
when he said that if one ever combines a provincial sales tax with 
the goods and services tax we would have the net result of 
entrenching the GST? Is this his legacy to the people of Canada? Is 
this his idea of representation and doing what is in the best interest 
of all Canadians or is this just an example of partisan politics at its 
worst?
<P>
	Another gentleman, one I respect an awful lot and one I think is a 
Reformer in Liberal clothing, is the current Minister of National 
Defence. I remember when he was minister of transport, the job he 
did there, the way he did it and how he took that department and 
downsized it. He did not fire 44,000 employees like the secretary of 
Treasury Board has. He had all those people relocated. He 
privatized some aspects of the service of that department that 
should be in the private sector and retained those aspects of the 
department that should be in the public sector. He then went to the 
area of unemployment insurance and was on his way of doing a 
good job there and then the rug got pulled from underneath him 
because they needed help in defence. Now he is there.
<P>
	However, as much as I respect him I will criticize him. I criticize 
him for a lack of integrity and for changing his principles. Is it not 
important to stand on principles? He is one of the Atlantic MPs. 
When he was on this side of the House he said there was no way a 
government should ever impose a hidden tax. He said that the tax 
must be open and visible because that was the only way to hold the 
government accountable. Both the finance minister and the defence 
minister were right then. What has happened? Why have they 
changed their minds? It is not wrong. It is right. That is the right 
attitude and the right philosophy.
<P>
	I sadly conclude that the only reason they have done this is 
strictly for politically motivated purposes. Where are the Liberals 
today? They are sheepishly talking about how they are going to 
meet the deadline of April 1. They  are going to go ahead with this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9075"> 9075 </A></B>
<P>
bill because harmonization is important. They have backed off on 
the tax inclusive pricing because the Senate has forced them to do 
it.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Why are they not standing up and condemning the senators? 
Why are they not condemning all those people in front of the 
hearings who said they did not like this tax and the government 
knows better than the people do on what is good for them?
<P>
	Why are they not praising today tax inclusive pricing? Where are 
all those advantages that they talked about before, how the 
harmonization would blend in nicely with the consumer and the 
retailer, and that the price the consumer sees on the item is the price 
they pay at the till, everybody will just spend more money, 
everybody will be happy, the whole economy will grow and 
everything will be wonderful?
<P>
	Why are they not talking about that today? They are not 
hammering on all those advantages any more. Where did they go? 
This was so important. What about the consumers, Mr. Finance 
Minister? Mr. Finance Minister, you said that you will give the 
Canadian public what it wants, and what it wants is tax inclusive 
pricing and this government gives the people what they want. 
Where is he today? Where is he on this issue?
<P>
	I am proud of the fact that Canadians and especially those 
Canadians in Atlantic Canada took the time to go to those hearings 
and made themselves heard. I am proud of what the senators did. I 
will give them a lot of credit too. They have some power.
<P>
	We as members of the third party here have no power. It shows 
the dangers of a democratic dictatorship that does not listen. All the 
things that we pointed out have come to pass. They are true. The 
Senate has done its job. That is why I am always in favour of a 
Senate; the type of Senate is another story and another debate. At 
least it is a check and control. It is a chamber of sober second 
thought.
<P>
	The government and the cabinet need a lot of second sober 
thoughts. They are ramming some of the worst legislation in the 
history of this country on Canadians. From gun control to 
endangered species to financial institutions, the government is 
wreaking havoc on the whole economy and the rights and freedoms 
of Canadians and corporations across the country.
<P>
	This harmonized sales tax is another example of that. The 
government is setting bad precedents. We have a finance minister 
who has been criticized by the auditor general and who made this 
$961 million payment to the Atlantic provinces one year ago. He 
charged it off to the year ending 1996.
<P>
	I will read from the public accounts how we are supposed to do 
our accounting and how we are fairly  supposed to represent the 
finances of the nation. This finance minister who has been getting 
all the credit and all the praise from the left wing leaning Liberal 
press in this city has gone against generally accepted accounting 
principles. The auditor general says so, most CAs, most CGA, 
CMAs, RIAs and MPs would say so who have an accounting 
background.
<P>
	In the public accounts of 1996 the auditor general said: ``The 
inclusion of the transitional assistance of $961 million in the 1996 
deficit and accumulated deficit represents a departure from both 
sound accounting practice and the government's own accounting 
rules''.
<P>
	Second, so that people who are listening understand what we are 
to do when we charge something into a current year's budget, we 
have to have an agreement in place on how the money is going to 
be spent and who the two parties are that are involved, not a letter 
of intent, which is what the finance minister argues on this or, as it 
says here, the financial obligations are reported as liabilities if the 
underlying event occurred prior to or at year end.
<P>
	We are speaking of March 1996. This deal takes effect April 1, 
1997. We still do not have a harmonized sales tax in place. Why did 
Atlantic Canada get $961 million, if not as an inducement to 
procure these signed agreements? Even today the agreement is not 
in place and the money has been put out.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about integrity. These are the finances of the 
nation and we have a finance minister who is so cocky, so 
overconfident that he feels he can do anything with any piece of 
legislation, that he can ram it down the throats of Canadians and 
nobody will question him on it.
<P>
	Thank God there is a Senate, especially with this kind of House 
where we are fractured, where we cannot hold the government 
accountable because we do not have enough manpower to do it.
<P>
	I think the Liberals are very lucky to have a free thinking, open 
minded Liberal premier in the province of New Brunswick. I 
predicted that those three premiers in the Atlantic provinces would 
lose their jobs if they went ahead with the harmonized sales tax, the 
tax inclusive pricing. At least somebody was listening.
<P>
	Frank McKenna, in a newspaper article written by April 
Lindgren of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, said he is unapologetic for doing 
what he did even though he is a Liberal premier: ``When you are a 
provincial government and the federal government is of the same 
persuasion, there is no law requiring that you park your brains and 
your opinions at the door''. That is what the backbenchers from 
Atlantic Canada have done on the issue. They parked their brains 
and their opinions at the door. They are like trained seals. They just 
follow the pack, do what the cabinet says must be done and what 
the finance minister says should be done because they are  high in 
the polls. Everything here is related to polls. They are trying to get 
<P>

<P>
themselves re-elected. Liberal members support what is in their 
own self-serving best interests and not the interests of Canadians.
<P>
	I commend the premier of New Brunswick for having the 
courage to tell the truth. The truth is that the consumers will have to 
pay the tax.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know that consumers, as I, will wait with bated 
breath for the end of your speech. You still have four minutes and 
the floor will be yours if you wish at the end of question period 
today.

<P>
	Currently, Mr. Speaker, you address members according to

	The Canadian National Institute for the Blind and severely

unfair, given that blind persons cannot read members' names and 
province of origin as printed on the screen.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 1997 is a banner year for la Francophonie. This year we 
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Charte de la langue française, 
the 10th anniversary of the Semaine du français, the 5th 
anniversary of the Semaine internationale de la Francophonie and 
the 7th anniversary of the Journée internationale de la

combined in the Francofête, being held for the first  time from 
March 16 to March 23, with the author Marie Laberge as honourary 
chair.
<P>
	The Francofête is an event marked by pride and excellence. At 
the heart of this event we find the French language, the official and 
common language of Quebecers at work, in communications, 
business, culture and education.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party's fresh start for justice has the Liberal Party's spin 
doctors scrambling for answers.
<P>
	An access to information request clearly points to the Liberal 
failure to deal with hardened criminals who make a career out of 
hurting or killing innocent Canadians. The Liberal justice minister 
believes that capital punishment and truth in sentencing are 
``buzzwords'' and are an act of revenge.
<P>
	The Liberal idea of a safer society is to release violent offenders 
earlier because it is cheaper to do so, all under the name of 
rehabilitation. Liberals do not believe that the punishment should 
fit the crime. Neither do they believe that criminals are responsible 
for their actions. They say that you and I and society are to blame.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the Liberal government continues to 
support criminals with its weak laws. On the other hand, innocent 
citizens are victimized and to the Liberal mind this is good.
<P>
	The Liberal government is deluded. Fresh start for justice is the 
only answer to law and order in this country.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, for more 
than a decade this government and the previous one have pursued 
the same economic policies: deregulate, cut spending, lay off 
workers.
<P>
	Both business and government have sung the same tune. Has it 
worked? We have 45 per cent more child poverty in the country 
than in 1989 when this House passed a motion to do away with it. 
Today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> reports that the working poor are now6 per cent worse off than 10 years ago.

	University of Saskatchewan economists tell us that realized net 
farm income for their province was $315 million in 1996, or about 
$5,000 per farm. The projections are that it will be lower in 1997.

	Bankruptcies hit record levels in 1996 under these policies. Real 
income for most Canadians is declining as are living standards. 
However, big business profits are up and so is the stock market. But

presentation.
<P>
	Canadians have a right to be proud of the accomplishments 
toward deficit reduction: proud of moving from being referred to as 
a third world country financially in the early nineties under the 
previous administration to today, once again, being the envy of the 
industrialized countries of the world.
<P>
	Canadians are proud also that the deficit reduction 
accomplishments have provided the flexibility for financial 
investment in health care, student education, children and families, 
rural Canada, the tourism industry, the infrastructure program 
extension and programs to foster small business, economic growth 
and jobs.

as legislators in one of the richest and most senior members of both 
organizations, to recognize and promote the value of foreign 
assistance.

	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as an Ontario MP I have been hearing a lot of whining 
from Mike Harris and his chorus line in the Reform Party. They are 
trying to blame every cut in Ontario on the federal government.
<P>
	They are tossing out accusations that Ontario's transfers have 
been cut by over 40 per cent. The fact is, when this government 
assumed office, total transfers to Ontario, cash and tax points, 
amounted to $10.3 billion. This year it is $9.1 billion.
<P>
	The real reduction is 11 per cent, which only represents 2.5 per 
cent of provincial revenues. The 1996 budget includes a plan to 
start increasing transfers once again.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	How much has Mike Harris cut? More than $6 billion from 
hospitals, schools, municipalities, social assistance and shelters for 
battered women. And why has he had to make these cuts? To pay 
for an irresponsible $5 billion tax cut for his rich friends.
<P>
	Reformers can say what they like, but my constituents do not

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday thousands of Quebecers filled St. Catherine Street to 
celebrate St. Patrick's Day, when all Quebecers become 
O'Quebecers, as Cardinal Turcotte pointed out.
<P>
	St. Patrick's Day is a time to remember when this community 
came to Quebec from its country of origin some 150 years ago to 
escape the potato famine. The conditions for these immigrants on 
board ship and subsequently in quarantine on Grosse-Île remain 
painful memories that testify to the courage and determination of 
the Irish.
<P>
	In his sermon yesterday in St. Patrick's Cathedral, which was 
founded 150 years ago, Cardinal Daly recalled the warm welcome 
extended in the past by Canada's francophones who, together with 
the Irish already established in Montreal, worked so hard to 
alleviate the suffering of these Irish newcomers.

the people of Cariboo-Chilcotin support the protection of 
endangered species but they oppose Bill C-65, the federal 
government's endangered species protection act.
<P>
	Bill C-65 threatens the rights and livelihoods of thousands of 
responsible ranchers, miners, foresters and landowners in the B.C. 
interior. It gives federal authorities the power to dictate to 
responsible landowners and users how they will use their land. It 
offers no compensation to landowners and users who are forced to 
leave productive land dormant, and Bill C-65 allows activist 
groups to go to court solely to stop resource development. This bill 
is an unfair, unbalanced and unsatisfactory piece of legislation.
<P>
	Fortunately there is a better way. The Reform Party has proposed 
42 amendments that would ensure fair compensation, co-operation 
by all concerned and a commitment to the preservation of all 
endangered species. If the government refuses to pass these 
amendments I will vote against Bill C-65 on behalf of the people of

announcement by the Minister of Transport abolishing Ports 
Canada Police bypasses the democratic process in this House. Bill 
C-44, the Canada marine act, is presently before the House. There 
are provisions in that bill that deal with ports police. It is confusing 
that the minister would abolish ports police before Bill C-44 is 
passed.
<P>
	In the announcement the minister has placed access control in 
the hands of the ports and municipal police forces to ensure 
standard police services at the ports. But the minister made no 
reference to the present ports police officers. What are the 
minister's plans for these dedicated and specially trained people? 
And what is he going to do about continued funding for such 
services?
<P>
	The ports police officers are specialists in their field. They are 
trained and knowledgeable in national and international crime. 
Why is the minister subjecting our communities to the possibility 
of increased crime? I urge this minister and this House to 
reconsider what came out on Friday.

Irish countryside and Irish tenants were fleeing their homeland.
<P>
	Today Canada, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day, also 
celebrates the great migration of those people who became the 
backbone of so many of our communities. Whether it is corned 
beef and cabbage at the historic Victoria Tavern in Windsor or a 
green beer at the Knights of Columbus in Tecumseh, the people of 
Canada are all Irish today.

that is focused on patient care and wellness and not one that offers 
fewer services at fewer locations.
<P>
	Let us be clear. Premier Harris has decided to close hospitals in 
Ontario. That is his choice and no one else's. The National Forum 
on Health stated that Canadians want the federal government to 
continue to play a strong role in protecting our publicly funded 
medicare system. The government has demonstrated that support 
through the recent budget which invests in the delivery of health 
care services.

that Edmonton is a city of champions.
<P>
	Kevin, along with lead Don Bartlett, second Rudy Ramcharan, 
third Don Walchuck and fifth man and coach, Jules Owchar, won 
the 1997 Brier yesterday in Calgary with a thrilling 10-8 victory 
over the powerful Vic Peters rink from Manitoba.
<P>
	All who helped organize this year's Brier championship are to be 
congratulated. A quarter of a million people attended the event 
during the week.
<P>
	It looked bad when we lost to Peters in the round robin during the 
week, but on Friday night in the quarter final we squeaked out a 
win and it was then one game each. Then Sunday was the all-time, 
ever-lovin', championship tie-breakin' round. In the eighth end my 
heart sank when Peters stole two, but in the ninth we  scored three 
back and then in the tenth end we stole one for the win. What a 
finish.
<P>
	Now it is on to the world championships where once again 
Martin will prove that we are the best of the best. Way to go Kevin 
Martin, you are the champ.

	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Renewable Fuels Association and its members are 
gathering in Ottawa today to discuss the environmental and health 
benefits of ethanol fuels. Ethanol and other renewable fuels can 
greatly reduce vehicle tailpipe emissions, the leading source of air 
pollution and related health problems. The use of ethanol in our 
vehicles will reduce ground level ozone, carbon monoxide and 
particulate matter in the air we breathe.
<P>
	A healthy and vibrant ethanol fuel industry in Canada will 
provide the following benefits: clean air, reduced health care costs, 
a domestic and renewable fuel supply and a stable domestic market 
for Canadian grains.
<P>
	It is time for all Canadians, both rural and urban, to adopt the 
vision of cleaner air through renewable fuels like ethanol. It 
benefits all of us.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will now proceed to oral question period with 
the new Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9080"> 9080 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday a crowd of over 600 demonstrated noisily in 
front of the Hell's Angels headquarters in Saint-Nicolas.
<P>
	These citizens turned out, despite low temperatures and gang 
members' attempts to intimidate them. They are calling for 
concrete and rapid action from this government to put an end to the 
biker war. They even carried placards asking politicians how many 
more victims it would take to get them moving.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: How many victims 
will it take before this government makes up its mind to take action 
and finally introduce a bill outlawing gangs like the Rock Machine 
and Hell's Angels as criminal groups and known law-breakers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, on behalf of all members of the House, I would 
like to congratulate the new Leader of the Opposition on his 
democratic election as leader of his party. I wish him much good 
luck, not too much, obviously, but enough to enjoy his new duties, 
which I have already performed and which are not very easy. It is 
not always easy to lead a party. I come from Shawinigan, and I 
know whereof I speak.
<P>
	I would just like to say that you have already been in the House 
for some time now and that we are ready to work in everyone's best 
interests.
<P>
	Obviously, I had occasion to answer the hon. member's question 
last week. The Quebec Minister of Public Security, Robert 
Perreault, echoed the words of his predecessors last week when he 
said that an anti-gang law would not resolve the problem, that it 
was a question of the administration of justice. Sufficient staff were 
needed to work on this problem.
<P>
	Furthermore, the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said 
that Pierre Sangollo was the man most qualified to speak on this 
topic. He quoted Mr. Sangollo as saying that the bomb problem 
would not go away because of anti-gang laws; the only way to 
restore peace to Quebec was to increase the number of Carcajou 
investigators and give them the tools they need.
<P>
	This could be sorted out if you were to call the head office in 
Quebec and ask them to bump up the number of investigators in the 
Carcajou squad, as Mr. Sangollo recommended.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is interesting because Mr. Perreault also said that he 
was open to a public debate.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister telling us that if he receives a request from 
Quebec-because the Criminal Code is a federal statute, is it 
not-he is prepared to respond positively, to take action, to outlaw 
groups like the Rock Machine and the Hell's Angels as criminals 
and law-breakers? If he were to receive a request from the  
Government of Quebec, am I to understand that he would agree to 
take action?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> By its wording, the question is a hypothetical one, 
but if the Prime Minister wishes to reply, it will be allowed to 
stand.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am aware that the Solicitor General and the Minister of 
Justice are in constant communication with responsible authorities 
in all provincial governments. This is not a problem peculiar to 
Quebec; groups like this exist throughout Canada. It is very 
difficult to define with any great precision which are criminal and 
which are not.
<P>
	I am certain that my colleagues, the Minister of Justice and the 
Solicitor General are presently holding discussions with provincial 
authorities. If they have any good proposals to make that require 
legislation, the government will consider them, as we always do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is almost the only person in Canada 
who does not know who the Rock Machine and the Hell's Angels 
are. We are not talking about choir boys or a bowling team, as 
everyone knows.
<P>
	There is an emergency in Quebec. People have been killed as a 
result of what is going on. Bombs are going off weekly. Is the 
Prime Minister ready to hold an emergency debate, here, today, this 
evening, on the issue of biker gangs in Quebec, because that is 
where they are raging?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the administration of justice is a provincial 
government problem. The responsible police forces in Quebec 
report to the provincial government and are directed by one of the 
opposition leader's predecessors. If the Quebec police need the 
federal police, we are always prepared to come to their assistance, 
but the responsibility is Quebec's.
<P>
	He could call his former leader and tell him what to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, the Prime Minister appears to be out of touch 
with Quebec reality. There is a bikers war in Quebec, and it has 
been going on for some years, but the Prime Minister keeps 
blathering on, as though nothing was wrong.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister contend, as he did today, that we 
have all the tools necessary to combat the activities of criminal 
biker gangs, when in Quebec not one week goes by without 
buildings being blown up, or worse, innocent bystanders being 
killed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government appreciates the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9081"> 9081 </A></B>
<P>
confusion and dismay biker gangs are  causing in the Quebec City 
area. It is a very serious and dangerous situation indeed-and a 
tragedy, in the case of young Daniel Desrochers, who was killed in 
Montreal last year.
<P>
	At the same time, the Prime Minister said, might I remind the 
hon. member, that this is essentially a provincial matter. It concerns 
the administration of justice, which falls primarily under the 
jurisdiction of the provincial government.
<P>
	The Solicitor General of Canada and myself have made it clear 
that we are prepared to work with our Quebec counterparts to find 
appropriate ways and tools for the police to fight organized crime. 
We said so six months ago, at the national forum on organized 
crime that was held here in September. We are prepared to work 
with our counterparts to find tools that can help the police.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister will neither hold an emergency debate, 
as requested by the Bloc Quebecois, nor undertake to act on 
proposals made by the Government of Quebec to deal effectively 
with the gang war. Meanwhile, the Hell's Angels and the Rock 
Machine are causing mayhem in Quebec.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister and I would like him to 
answer because this is a very important question. Will the Prime 
Minister admit that, by being stubborn, he is protecting criminal 
biker gangs instead of protecting the life and safety of innocent 
people in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are more than 800 sections in 
the Criminal Code to assist peace officers in the performance of 
their duties. I do not think there is a simple or magical solution.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Robert Perreault, the Minister of Public Security in Quebec, said 
essentially the same thing. In his opinion, an anti-gang law is not a 
magical solution; it would cause more problems than it would 
resolve.
<P>
	Former Quebec Minister of Public Security Serge Ménard made 
the following comment: ``I remain convinced that what we lack to 
fight organized crime is not legislation but sustained law 
enforcement''. That is the solution: police work. As I said, if we 
can help police in any way by adding something to the Criminal 
Code of Canada, we will gladly do so.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday it was reported that personal bankruptcies had jumped22 per cent for last year over 1995. Almost  80,000 Canadians went 
broke thanks to Liberal economic policies.
<P>
	Not only have the government's high tax policies given us the 
worst string of unemployment numbers since the great depression, 
they are causing Canadians to go broke at near record numbers.
<P>
	What does the Prime Minister have to offer the unemployed and 
the bankrupt other than his empty election promise of jobs, jobs, 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I tell everybody that the government is trying very hard to 
make sure the economy performs very well. At this moment, as I 
have repeated in the House, we have the lowest interest rates we 
have had in 35 years. Everybody who reads the newspaper realizes 
that housing is picking up, that people are buying more cars, and so 
on.
<P>
	We have seen the country producing net more than 700,000 new 
jobs, more than as I have said Germany, France, Great Britain and 
Italy. It is not enough. The level of unemployment went from11.4 per cent to 9.7 per cent. We wish it would be lower but we 
have done the right thing to achieve these goals. That is why in the 
last week of reports in terms of optimism in the country for 
investment it is the best in many years.
<P>
	We had to tackle the problems that were left to us when we 
formed the government, a deficit that was $42 billion. We had to 
reduce it and we have managed to create a lot of jobs in the 
meantime.
<P>
	We are working very hard. I know the people of Canada will 
have an occasion within the next 18 months to make a judgment on 
our policies and the flip-flop of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is one 
thing to talk about flip-flop. These kinds of numbers and 
encouraging words the Prime Minister fools himself with are no 
comfort and mean absolutely nothing to people who are 
unemployed and looking desperately for jobs.
<P>
	The Liberals' flowery words and rosy predictions are absolutely 
cool comfort to the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians and the 
nearly 80,000 Canadians who went broke last year.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister's jobs strategy has failed miserably and 
since he has ruled out tax relief, I ask him to get to the facts and not 
give us the flowery numbers and predictions he knows are glossy. 
How does he plan to keep his red book myth of jobs, jobs, jobs that 
he tried to snow the people with in 1993?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have explained, we have seen the confidence of 
consumers growing very fast in the last quarter. For example, 
residential investment has grown by 23 per cent.  Consumer 
spending is
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9082"> 9082 </A></B>
<P>
increasing by 5.6 per cent and fixed business investment by more 
than 23 per cent.
<P>
	We do not claim we have solved all the problems, but I am 
telling the hon. lady we have done our best with the right 
preoccupations. We are not a party that is just proposing.
<P>
	I know they can say that because they will not form the 
government. The only goal they have whenever they get up is to 
make sure there will be no more old age pension or Canada pension 
plan for the poor and that there will be tax cuts for the rich.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to hear this rhetoric.
<P>
	In 1992 someone who sat exactly there with 1.5 million 
unemployed, Brian Mulroney, told us not to worry, that Canada had 
the best job creation record in the G-7.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Now in 1997 with 1.5 million still unemployed someone who 
sits in the very same chair, the present Prime Minister, is saying: 
``Don't worry, Canada has the best jobs creation record in the 
G-7''. It is the same old story.
<P>
	We could not trust Mulroney with that line in 1992. Why in the 
world should we trust the Prime Minister with the same old line in 
1997?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was not the same line that we had because it was not our 
slogan. The member is right that it was Mr. Mulroney's slogan of 
jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	We said to the Canadian people that we would restore confidence 
and tackle the deficit and the debt of the country. When we formed 
the government interest rates were four points above those of the 
Americans. Now our interest rates are below theirs. At this time our 
interest rates are 2.5 per cent lower than those of the Americans. 
We have not seen that in 40 years.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that we are paying the price 
because we had nine years of the Tories in government, and they 
are not about to come back.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	With the election fast approaching, the Liberals should be 
ashamed of their poor performance in job creation. In addition to 
the fact that 45 per cent of all new jobs since 1993 were created in 
1994, only 288,000 jobs were created in the years 1995 and 1996 
together.
<P>
	How can the minister shamelessly predict the possible creation 
of 300,000 to 350,000 new jobs in 1997, given that, for 1995 and 
1996 together, only 288,000 new jobs were created, 60 per cent of 
which were part time jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, as a government, we 
cannot be pleased with the figures regularly heard in this House.
<P>
	We are constantly striving to create an economic climate that 
will convince people to invest more. We also implemented job 
creation initiatives like no government before us. We changed an 
unemployment insurance system that acted as a disincentive to 
work, and replaced it with job creation funds, with a transitional 
job creation fund.
<P>
	This morning, I was pleased to announce, in the east end of 
Montreal, an $8 million subsidy from the transitional job creation 
fund that will help create 3,000 jobs in the textile sector in the east 
end of Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it takes 
some nerve for the minister to boast about using the transitional 
fund to create jobs when the $300 million to be spent over three 
years comes from the UI fund and the cuts affecting the 
unemployed.
<P>
	The minister talks about creating many new jobs in 1997, in the 
private sector, but he is trying to hide the reality of massive job 
losses in that sector. Indeed, from February 1996 to February 1997, 
85,000 workers in the private sector lost their jobs. Of the 189,000 
jobs created in 1996, 125,000 were precarious independent jobs.
<P>
	How can the minister use such a smoke and mirrors approach in 
promising 350,000 new jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Canada is lucky enough to be a 
member of the OECD, one of the world's foremost brain trusts, and 
it relies on the economic studies made by that organization.
<P>
	The hope to create 350,000 jobs in our economy in the next year 
is based on the serious work done by these people, who have 
identified our economy as the most promising, since it is basically 
sound.
<P>
	It is perfectly normal to have jobs of a different nature than in the 
past, including independent jobs, which are perfectly acceptable in 
the new economy, and which should not be looked down on.

out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians. This represents about 
$1,700 per family.
<P>
	In a related story the government has been busted for going $9 
billion over target on the spending projections put forth in its 1995 
budget. In the case of regional development it is about 50 per cent 
over its target, just like the money the minister announced.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

<P>
	Members of the Reform Party should read some of the 
independent comments about Canadian government policies. I 
suggest they read, for example, the comments of Maureen Farrow 
of Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon Limited who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>International investors, whom I talk to every day, are looking at Canada as if it 
we've sort of arisen from the ashes. It's fascinating because it's the deficit, the 
debt-the current account, the contained inflation-the overall competitiveness, the 
restructuring of the export sector, and we've gained enormous market shares across 
the board on our export markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She was referring particularly to markets in the far east. That is 
an economic success. Those are not the problems the hon. member 
is talking about. He is talking about non-existent problems. 
Definitional problems were mentioned in the particular article. As 
usual for the Reform Party, the numbers he quoted were incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
eagerly await the member's retirement.

	It is obvious government members are using creative accounting 
and tax increases including $3.7 billion in user fees to cover up 
their managerial incompetence. They are as guilty of fudging the 
books as the Tories before them.
<P>
	How can Canadians trust anything government members say 
when it is obvious they have blown their spending reduction 
targets, just like Michael Wilson did, and covered them up with tax 
increases?

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Last night, CTV reported that Agriculture Canada has for years 
subsidized research enabling cigarette manufacturers to use plants 
with a high nicotine concentration, and here the government has 
just passed its anti-smoking legislation claiming to have the health 
of Canadians and young people at heart.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Health confirm whether the federal 
government has supported research on levels of nicotine in the 
past?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada does not fund research on 
nicotine. We do measure the amount of nicotine in plants in a 
similar way that we measure sugar in plants. We measure the length 
of tobacco plants. We measure placement of the leaves on plants, 
but we do not research in the area of putting nicotine into plants.
<P>
	Quite frankly those types of measurements are done on all 
products grown as a crop in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	It is very clear that the nicotine level in plants that have been 
approved by agriculture Canada, the varieties, has gone down from 
high levels in the 1980s through the 1990s consistently. The level 
of nicotine in plants has dropped in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a recent 
study by Health Canada revealed that nicotine levels in tobacco 
increased 53 per cent in the past 27 years-that is a scandal.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Health. Aside from his fancy 
speeches on health, does the minister intend to do what is needed to 
reduce nicotine levels in tobacco in order to fight addiction to this 
product at the source?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very hard time remaining seated. These are the 
members who last week were on their feet trying to block our bill 
banning tobacco advertising directed at young people. Such 
hypocrisy.
<P>
	Last week they voted against a bill that restricts advertising on 
tobacco and today they are complaining about tobacco. The people 
of Quebec, however, will understand that they have once again 
failed to look after the interests of young Quebecers who give in to 
smoking.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would prefer that words 
such as ``hypocrite'' and ``hypocrisy'' not be used.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tobacco 
companies say they do not manipulate nicotine in tobacco 
products. We have found out that they do not need to. Agriculture 
Canada is doing that very thing by searching out and researching 
strains that raise the nicotine level in those strains.
<P>
	The Liberal government is directly implicated in this search. 
Why the double standard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate 
the fact that we are not. We had very high levels of nicotine in the 
1980s. Through the 1990s those levels have been decreased 
consistently with every brand coming forward.
<P>
	I might well point out while I am on my feet that the research in 
agriculture Canada is for agronomic purposes, making sure our 
environment is safe, making sure that we have alternate crops for 
those people who are involved in agriculture with tobacco.
<P>
	We have taken out over 50 per cent of the tobacco growers in this 
country in the last 10 years. As a matter of fact, 90 per cent of the 
research dollars that have been spent in agricultural research in 
tobacco have been taken away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree. I will 
quote a research arm of this government. This is what the research 
is doing: ``Overall these lines have improved yield and grade 
quality and will contribute greatly to the economic well-being of 
who? The tobacco companies''.

	The new tobacco bill has a proposal in it that would allow this 
government to control nicotine levels. We thought, frankly, that it 
would lower it. What has it done? Research that will raise it.

	The tobacco companies lost the battle on ads. It looks like they 
have won the war on addicts. Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
point out that the nicotine levels are generally set on an 
international basis. Within those structures on the international 
basis the levels of tobacco that have been approved in Canada, that 
go forward in Canada, have declined through the 1990s. The 
number of people who are growing tobacco has declined. There has 
been absolutely no commercial tobacco production in the maritime 
provinces, the Atlantic provinces, since 1996.
<P>
	We have reduced the number of people growing tobacco. We 
have provided alternate crops. We have changed the whole 
mechanism by which tobacco is grown.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
January 23, 1996, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development recognized an interim band council to administer the 
Lac Berrière reserve.
<P>
	This irresponsible act led to 100 children having their school 
closed for more than a year, several roads being barricaded, 
numerous court cases, a community divided, and a trilateral 
agreement coming to an end on December 31 of last year.
<P>
	My question: since the Liberal government bears the bulk of the 
responsibility for this crisis, will the minister finally make up his 
mind to take action to put an end to this situation, which has gone 
on far too long already?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem in the Algonquin 
First Nation of Barrière goes back to the 1950s and 1960s. There 
was an outburst in 1964. The community has been in rough shape.
<P>
	The chief did not hold elections for 15 years. We spent half a 
million dollars with the province of Quebec to look at abuse on the 
reserve. A petition came forward asking for an election.
<P>
	We have the most qualified person I could find to go in there, 
Judge Réjean Paul, an aboriginal superior court judge, and two 
elders. They have been working with the band. It is difficult. 
However, I am sure that the hon. member would not want to use 
this incident, which is a tragic incident, for political purposes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the opposition, I am entitled to ask questions. One thing 
is clear: the entire situation at Lac Barrière is paralyzed at present, 
and the minister is directly responsible for this state of affairs.
<P>
	The barricades make it difficult for all of the forestry activities in 
this region to be carried out. In order to make things easier for the 
businesses in this region, will the minister commit to negotiating 
with the Lac Barrière band council and the Government of Quebec 
a new trilateral agreement on the 10,000 square kilometres of forest 
resources around the reserve?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we had worked in the past with 
the province of Quebec on a trilateral agreement. It was not 
mandatory in the federal government to do so. We did pay a fair 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9085"> 9085 </A></B>
<P>
share of the  moneys. We are prepared to work co-operatively with 
Quebec on the forestry problem.
<P>
	On the band itself, Judge Réjean Paul, who had actually quit, was 
convinced to go back and put a last proposal to the band. Hopefully 
it will accept this proposal and perhaps get on with its future.
<P>
	It is a problem that has been there for four decades. Using this 
group for political purposes does not cover the hon. member in 
grace.

<P>
	Last October 16, the minister and the president of the Canadian 
Pediatric Society indicated their concerns about fetal alcohol 
syndrome, stating that the wisest decision for a woman to make 
was to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.
<P>
	Can the minister clarify for us what initiatives his department 
intends to take in support of this recommendation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member will know that the improving of the health of 
Canadian mothers and babies is an important priority not only for 
the federal government but certainly for provinces and other 
stakeholders.
<P>
	Four initiatives have been undertaken by my department. We are 
working in partnership with the Canadian Paediatric Society. We 
have developed a joint statement on the prevention of fetal alcohol 
syndrome. Health Canada has also provided funding to the 
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse to operate its 1-800 
information service. We produced and are distributing public 
awareness materials.
<P>
	Finally, prevention through early intervention programs such as 
the Canada prenatal nutrition program reinforces the government's 
commitment to giving children the best start in life.

Major Armstrong appearing before the Somalia inquiry stated that 
in his opinion the shooting of Ahmed Aruush on March 4, 1993 was 
a murder.
<P>
	He reported this to his superiors and it seems that headquarters in 
Ottawa was also advised. It then took six weeks to dispatch a police

contributed to the torture death of Shidane Arone on March 16.
<P>
	Neither the justice review nor the committee of four can tell the

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

gentleman refers to the work done by a retired chief justice of the 
supreme court, Mr. Dickson, and his team on the military justice 
system. I know that the hon. member has deep concerns about the 
Canadian forces and how the military justice system works, how 
the military police organization responds to the kinds of challenges 
that obviously occurred in Somalia.
<P>
	I have now received the report from Mr. Justice Dickson. I will 
be reporting to the Prime Minister before the end of the month. I 
think I can say without equivocation that the hon. member will be 
as impressed as I have been by the work done by Mr. Justice 
Dickson.
<P>
	That having been said, with specific reference to the question he 
put today, the hon. member will know that I have not in the past 
commented on testimony brought before the Somalia commission 
of inquiry and I will not do that now. I will have nothing to say 
about how it has dealt with that issue until such time as it has 
prepared its recommendations and has submitted them to the 
government.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member and Canadians look forward to 
receiving the report of the Somalia commission of inquiry no later 
than the end of June.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the justice committee probably has provided good 
recommendations but that does not deal with the problem of what 
happened at NDHQ after that report. It seems that there may have 
been several cover-ups at several levels, in Belet Huen, in 
Mogadishu and then the so-called damage control in Ottawa.
<P>
	The commission may be able to answer the questions about Belet 
Huen and Mogadishu, but with the inquiry shut down it will not be 
able to establish the facts of what took place in Ottawa.
<P>
	How does the minister intend to deal with this apparent attempt 
of a cover-up of murder?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

which the hon. member refers have been the subject of various

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	According to the minister, one of the characteristics of the new 
Employment Insurance Act is to calculate the number of hours 
worked, and no longer the number of weeks. However, the 
Employment Insurance Act still excludes one class of casual 
workers. I am referring to the 20,000 members of the army reserve 
whose assignments for less than 30 days do not count for 
employment insurance. However, members of the reserve very 
often have assignments of less than 30 days between September 
and June.
<P>
	What explanation does the minister have for the fact that 20,000 
members of the reserve are partly excluded from the provisions of 
employment insurance, while according to the government, the 
purpose of the new legislation is to allow a larger number of people 
to qualify for employment insurance benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it will be a pleasure to look into 
the particular case of members of the reserve.
<P>
	The fact is that we want to encourage people to accept more 
work. As soon as workers finish their first hour of work, we start 
covering them. We want to encourage people to accept more hours 
of work.
<P>
	Obviously, to obtain the amount necessary for coverage and 
benefits, we think it is also important that people have an incentive 
to look for work other than what they can get within a certain 
period on the labour market. That is what we are doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
has shown his ignorance in this respect.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to make a commitment, as of today or at 
least as soon as possible, to do what is necessary to remedy the 
situation and provide equal  treatment to 20,000 members of the 
reserve by removing this unfair and inequitable exclusion?
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that a question such as this which is rather technical and concerns a 
group of people who are very important to us at the Department of 
National Defence, should be asked without prior notice, because 
otherwise we could have checked all aspects of the legislation.
<P>
	As members know, very few members or ministers in this House 
are in a position to know every detail of every act, however 
complex it may be.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the government is doing what 
it can to encourage people in the public service to participate, if 
they so wish, in the activities of the reserve or the militia. We want 
to do everything we can to encourage Canadians who are 
interested, because we are increasing the membership from 20,000 
to 30,000.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member, as the Minister of Resources 
Development just did, that we are doing everything we can to be 
fair and equitable to everyone who needs employment insurance.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a week ago today the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn said in this House: ``Everybody knows 
Clifford Olson will not be granted parole''.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Justice if he agrees with this 
former chair of the justice committee. If so, why is he allowing 
Clifford Olson to terrorize his victims over and over again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the application brought by Clifford 
Olson will be determined by a jury in a courtroom in British 
Columbia in the months ahead.
<P>
	In the last three and a half years that it has been my privilege to 
be Minister of Justice, I have made it my business to meet as often 
as I can with those who survive and grieve the loss of victims of 
crime. One thing I have learned about that process and the victims 
of crime is that it is terribly important not only to sympathize with 
them and their terrible grief but to be honest with them. I know the 
hon. member would want to be honest with the victims of crime.
<P>
	It should be remembered that it is not the present government 
that created section 745. Section 745 has been part of the criminal 
law of this country since 1976. It is this government that introduced 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9087"> 9087 </A></B>
<P>
important changes to section 745 so that multiple murderers will 
never be able to apply in the future, so that juries will have to be  
unanimous, so that judges will first screen even those applications 
that can be brought.
<P>
	My point is let us be honest about what is going on. There was no 
easy way to roll back Clifford Olson's right to apply under section 
745. We have taken care of the section for the future. When we 
introduced those changes the hon. member and his party voted 
against them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remind this House that it was Liberals who brought in 
section 745.
<P>
	Are the Liberals trying to rehabilitate Clifford Olson by allowing 
him telephones, fax machines, word processors and early parole? 
Are you trying to rehabilitate-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, please be sure to address your 
questions to the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fate of Clifford Olson and his 
application, as I have already said, will be determined by a jury in 
the courtroom. That is where such matters should be dealt with.
<P>
	I want to be clear in response to the hon. member's more general 
inquiry. This government has on many justice issues stood four 
square with victims of crime. Victims of crime were in this very 
building the day that Bill C-68 came up for a vote in the House of 
Commons, the gun control bill. My hon. colleague and his fellow 
members of the Reform Party voted against the gun control bill.
<P>
	Victims of crime were one floor away in tears as they recalled 
their tragedies. They implored the members of the Reform Party to 
vote for gun control, and the members of the Reform Party voted 
against it. This government stood with the victims. The 
government stood with the victims when it amended the Young 
Offenders Act to provide for victim impact statements at 
sentencing, and the Reform Party voted against it.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	Let me close by saying that at times there have been differences 
with victims on matters of principle, but victims know the 
government stands with them in strengthening the criminal law of 
the country.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In moving grain to the west coast it is obvious the railways have 
failed to perform. Yet they bear no responsibility. The $65 million 
of losses due to demurrage and non-performance of contract are 
borne by farmers. Non-performance is not the fault of farmers, of 
grain companies or of grain handlers. Only the railways were 
responsible.
<P>
	Does the government now realize this and is it prepared to 
amend the Transport Act to rebalance the relationship between 
shippers and railways by including the right of shippers to 
performance guarantees with appropriate penalties for poor rail 
performance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to report to the House that there have been 
very dramatic improvements in the shipment of grain to the coast. 
Rail car unloads for the last week for which I have figures were at 
4,500 cars as compared to under 4,000 for the previous week.
<P>
	Things are improving and I hope we will soon have the backlog 
dealt with. There is a reduction in the ships waiting on the west 
coast from 39 to 30.
<P>
	However I have been requested by the ministers of 
transportation of three of the four western provinces to look into 
the issue by way of an inquiry. I am in  discussion with them on 
whether that is

the best approach. Our objective in government is to make sure we 
come up with new approaches which will prevent the types of 
delays we had this winter.
<P>
	This will take the co-operation of all parties. I reject out of hand 
the suggestion of the New Democratic Party of simply pointing the 
finger of blame at one of the various parties. We have done that for

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a petition signed by hundreds of Canadians from the east coast to 
the west coast. Some are from Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners are very concerned about the 7 per cent GST on 
reading materials. They feel the GST is an unjust taxation on 
reading materials, that education and literacy are critical to the 
development of our country, and that an aggressive tax on reading 
handicaps this development.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the government to zero rate books, 
magazines and newspaper under the GST.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 36 I have a petition from a number of petitioners 
in the Campbell River, B.C., area who are petitioning the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	They believe police and firefighters are often required to place 
their lives at risk in the execution of their duties on a daily basis. 
They also believe that employment benefits of police and 
firefighters often provide insufficient compensation to the families 
of those killed while on duty.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to establish a fund 
known as the public safety officers' compensation fund for the 
benefit of families of public safety officers killed in the line of 
duty.

	They urge all levels of government to demonstrate their support 
for education and literacy by eliminating the sales tax on reading 
materials.
<P>
	The petitioners ask Parliament to zero rate books, magazines and 
newspapers under the GST. In those provinces with the HST they 
ask that both levels of government consider harmonizing their sales 
taxes and that reading material be zero rated under the provincial 
sales tax as well.

	The petitioners state that because the national highway policy 
study identified job creation, economic development, saving lives,

<P>
	The first petition comes from Mississauga, Ontario. The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that our 
police officers and firefighters place their lives at risk on a daily 
basis as they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families of officers are 
often killed in the line of duty and left without sufficient financial 
means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of families of police officers and 
firefighters killed in the line of duty.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families who choose to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged and the 
disabled.

which is a small community that is literally at the end of a road in 
Kootenay East. It has been cut off as the result of the federal 
electoral boundary changes and is going to be included in the 
Okanagan riding. It is a grievous error.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament take the 
necessary action to correct this error and return Riondel to the 
federal electoral district of Kootenay-Columbia.

	The petitioners argue that the security of central and eastern

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52 of the House of Commons, 
I wish to request that an emergency debate be held regarding the 
social, economic and human consequences of the war being waged 
by some biker gangs in Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois represents the majority of Quebecers in the 
House of Commons, and the biker gang war recently moved from 
Montreal to the Quebec City region where, in the past year, some 
80 criminal incidents have taken place.
<P>
	The Quebec government took action by setting up an operational 
co-ordination group, as well as a regional intervention group 
against organized crime, known as the GRICO unit. The provincial 
government earmarked $1.5 million for Operation GRICO. In spite 
of all the efforts made by the public and the government, people are 
absolutely helpless against what is happening.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois listened to our party's grassroots 
during our national convention and passed an urgent motion in that 
regard. We must not forget the recent rally in Saint-Nicolas and last 
weekend's bomb.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would therefore ask that you consider favourably 
our request for an emergency debate.

raised by the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata is a serious 
one, which causes great concern in Quebec and elsewhere in 
Canada.
<P>
	However, upon reading the Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons, it seems to me that the hon. member's request does not 
meet the prescribed requirements. Should the context change, the 
hon. member could always avail herself of the same process.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOAMENDCERTAINLAWSRELATINGTOFINANCIALINSTITUTIONS">AN ACT TO AMEND CERTAIN LAWS RELATING TO 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-82, an act to amend certain laws relating to financial 
institutions, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not 
mind that Orders of the Day being changed halfway through the 
day. As you know, we were talking about the amendments by the 
other House to Bill C-70. Now we find, with no consultation, we 
will be debating Bill C-82.
<P>
	We think of the co-operation that we have given the government 
side on the tobacco legislation and other legislation. Now we find, 
with no consultation whatsoever, it changes the order of business 
and we are now expected to debate another bill today when we have 
been talking about the harmonized sales tax all morning.
<P>
	I am wondering where the government is coming from in 
changing the Orders of the Day like this.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will appreciate that 
Standing Order 40(2) states that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Government Orders shall be called and considered in such sequence as the 
government determines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the same point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, I am not going to listen to any more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Well, it is a new point of order then.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That will be judged very quickly, whether 
or not it is a new point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, prior to 
question period starting at two o'clock, I was on my feet during my 
20 minute allotment. I was not finished. I was told by the Speaker 
who chaired question period that I would get the floor after Routine 
Proceedings. I do not have the floor. I was given a certain amount 
of time to finish my speech because I have some very important 
things to say on that bill.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has raised an interesting 
point. Speaker Parent did give an undertaking that the member for 
Calgary Centre would speak right after question period. 
Undoubtedly the Speaker thought that the bill would be recalled 
and the member could finish his intervention.
<P>
	Of course, if there is unanimous consent, we can do anything that 
the House wishes to do. I wonder if the member wishes to ask for 
unanimous consent to complete his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps when Bill C-70 is brought back there would be favourable 
winds to having the hon. member finish his speech at that time.
<P>
	The government has the prerogative to call what business it 
wishes. I know you have already ruled on that.  I would remind my 
hon. colleague from St. Albert to refer to the House business 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9092"> 9092 </A></B>
<P>
statement that was given on Thursday which clearly indicates that 
Bill C-82 is coming forward today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It goes without saying that the hon. 
member will be entitled to finish his intervention the next time that 
matter is called.
<P>
	I take it from the comments of the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader that there will not be unanimous consent 
to allowing the member to finish his remarks.
<P>
	Accordingly, we are caught by the Standing Order. I have heard 
enough on that point of order. The Standing Order is very clear. The 
government can call any order it wishes at virtually any time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. I had 
the floor prior to question period. As a member of Parliament, my 
privileges are that I am allowed to give a speech with a certain 
allotment of time.
<P>
	Because question period comes at a certain time and interferes 
with my speech, I should not be denied my right as a member of 
Parliament to finish my speech which has four minutes left.
<P>
	If this government is in such a darn hurry to get on with other 
legislation without letting me finish my four minutes, this is just 
another example of the dictatorial power that these-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I had the floor, Mr. Speaker. My privileges are being 
denied.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There was the possibility of a solution 
which, obviously, is not one that is acceptable to all the members of 
the House as it must be. Accordingly, it is my duty under the orders 
to put the bill presently before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You 
alluded to the fact that you thought there was no unanimous 
consent. I do not recall you seeking unanimous consent of the 
House to let the hon. member for Calgary Centre finish the four 
minutes of his speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is correct. There was not a call for 
unanimous consent. Perhaps the easiest thing to do is ask if there is 
unanimous consent to let the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
finish his speech?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair heard a no, therefore there is 
not unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If we are 
not going to debate Bill C-70 this afternoon as I was told we were, 
could you advise us please on what day next week we will be 
debating it?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Saint John probably 
does not realize that the Chair does not know these things. The 
Speaker is not able to do that. Perhaps the hon. Secretary of State 
for International Financial Institutions will do that in his remarks.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I have a quick question 
which I hope you can answer. The Speaker told me as a member of 
Parliament that I would have the floor after question period for four 
minutes. That Speaker left and there was a transition when the 
Speakers changed. If that is what happened I still stand in my place 
and I insist that I get my four minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The same point was made before. I will 
try to put it in other words. The government is entitled under our 
rules, which have been passed by all members, to change the order 
of business whenever it wishes to do that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to add my voice to those of hon. colleagues in the 
government in support of Bill C-82. I hope my other colleagues 
will be equally supportive.
<P>
	I attach particular importance to the consumer protection 
measures in Bill C-82. We live in a period of rapid evolution in the 
financial sector. Technological advances, globalization of financial 
services markets and a changing competitive landscape are some of 
the broad trends at play. All of these trends have major implications 
for consumers, most of which are positive in nature.
<P>
	Canadian consumers enjoy more choice and convenience in the 
financial services market than ever before. Long gone are the days 
when we had to go to the bank between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on a 
week day to take out money and write cheques to make payments. 
Now we can get cash at any hour of the day or night through 
automated banking machines. Payments can be made using 
convenient new mechanisms like direct debit and pre-authorized 
debits. In addition, we can do the basic banking we want, apply for 
loans or seek insurance coverage from our home computers or by 
telephone.
<P>
	Technological innovations have been accompanied by an 
ever-increasing array of financial products from a range of service 
providers. For example, insurance products can be tailor made to 
fit an individual's circumstances. Consumers who carry credit card 
balances can reduce their interest costs by using one of the new low 
rate credit cards on the market, and consumers can satisfy many of 
their financial needs through one stop shopping. For example, they 
can take out mortgages, invest in guaranteed investment 
certificates and buy mutual funds from the same trust company.
<P>
	These innovations bestow countless benefits on consumers. At 
the same time, they have led to changes in the relationship between 
financial institutions and their  clients. Consumers want this 
relationship to be balanced and fair, and have therefore expressed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9093"> 9093 </A></B>
<P>
the desire for better protection in their dealings with financial 
institutions.
<P>
	The government agrees that consumer protection must be 
enhanced in the context of a rapidly evolving financial sector. Bill 
C-82 proposes several measures to accomplish this.
<P>
	One key measure deals with privacy. Privacy protection is of 
utmost importance to the government. This is an age where 
technological advances permit increasingly easier access to and 
analysis of personal information. In this environment, consumers 
want to maintain control over their own information. They want to 
know why their information is being collected, how it will be used 
and how it will be stored.
<P>
	In the financial sector the collection and handling of personal 
information is a significant issue. Financial institutions rely on 
extensive amounts of often sensitive information to offer their 
services. As a result it is important that they take privacy protection 
seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, do we have quorum?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is correct. There is not a 
quorum. Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are now 20 members in the House. 
We have a quorum. Resuming debate, the hon. secretary of state.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Speaker, financial institutions have made efforts 
to deal with privacy concerns. For example, they participated with 
consumer groups, government representatives and other business 
groups in the development of the Canadian Standards Association 
model code for the protection of personal information which was 
finalized in April 1996.
<P>
	The government wants to build on these efforts. Accordingly, the 
bill provides the authority to make regulations in the area of 
privacy. Specifically, it allows for regulations requiring financial 
institutions to establish procedures governing the collection, 
retention, use and disclosure of customer information and to 
inform customers about these procedures. In addition, the bill 
provides the authority to require financial institutions to establish 
procedures for dealing with complaints on privacy and to report 
annually on complaints received and actions taken to respond to 
them.
<P>
	Following passage of the bill, the government intends to 
establish regulations to implement all of these requirements. I am 
sure that hon. members will agree with the merits of this proposal. 
Although privacy protection is an issue that cuts across industries, 
and the government is developing a broader approach to privacy 
protection, it is important to take this opportunity to  respond to the 
immediate concerns of consumers of financial services.
<P>
	Bill C-82 also provides for enhancements to the cost of credit 
disclosure provisions in the legislation. These provisions were 
designed to ensure consumers are informed about the cost of credit 
before they enter into loan contracts.
<P>
	As part of the internal trade initiative, federal and provincial 
governments agreed in September 1996 to harmonize cost of credit 
disclosure requirements across jurisdictions. The objective of the 
harmonization exercise is to ensure uniform disclosure practices 
across the country and to ensure consumers benefit from a 
consistently high standard of protection.
<P>
	Accordingly, the bill proposes amendments to the disclosure 
provisions in federal legislation. These amendments will allow the 
government to implement all aspects of the agreement with the 
provinces.
<P>
	Under the new cost of credit disclosure regime, consumers will 
receive fair, accurate, timely and comparable information about the 
cost of borrowing. Armed with such information, they will be 
better able to assess credit options and obtain the most economical 
credit for their needs.
<P>
	The government has been working to better protect consumers in 
other ways. I would like to report on significant initiatives in two 
areas: access to basic financial services and information about fees.
<P>
	During the course of the 1997 review, several consumer groups 
expressed concern that low income individuals often have 
difficulty in getting access to basic financial services such as 
opening accounts and cashing cheques. For example, it was pointed 
out that financial institutions' identification requirements often 
include credit cards and a driver's licence which not everyone has. 
To remedy the situation the government held discussions with 
consumer groups and with financial institutions.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that the major banks have made a number 
of important commitments to improve access. In particular, banks 
have agreed that they will require only two pieces of signed 
identification instead of three to open accounts or to cash cheques. 
They will also accept sponsorships from responsible customers 
known to the branch. In addition, employment will not be a 
condition of opening a bank account. Bank staff will be trained to 
follow these policies and to be sensitive to the needs of low income 
individuals.
<P>
	The government has also encouraged improvements with respect 
to information about service fees. While consumers have access to 
a broad range of accounts in deposit taking institutions, they often 
find it difficult to compare the changes applicable to various 
accounts and therefore choose the best account for their needs. 
After discussion, the major banks have agreed to ensure that  clear 
information about their products and services is available in 
publicly accessible areas of their branches. This will include 
information about low cost accounts and tips on minimizing fees. 
The banking industry is also working with Industry Canada to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9094"> 9094 </A></B>
<P>
provide information about bank accounts on Industry Canada's 
Internet site.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I believe that the measures I have discussed today will provide 
important benefits to consumers of financial services. We are 
confident that these initiatives will help ensure a healthy balance in 
the relationship between financial institutions and their clients.
<P>
	In closing, on behalf of the government I would like to extend 
sincere appreciation to the various consumer groups that played a 
role in shaping these initiatives. These groups gave freely of their 
time and energy to ensure that the consumer voice was heard in this 
review, and the government has listened.
<P>
	I call on my colleagues in the House to do the same by giving 
their support to Bill C-82.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, more than 
anything else, Bill C-82 is a technical revision of the Bank Act. It 
does not contain major changes such as the deregulation of 
financial institutions, for example, allowing banks to sell insurance 
and the merger of major banks.
<P>
	The government does, however, propose some legislative 
novelties, one might call them, which, although they do not go as 
far as the white paper and the Liberal finance committee report, do 
merit our further attention.
<P>
	In addition to technical amendments to the Banking Act, Bill 
C-82 seeks to modify or develop legislation on two main themes: 
enhancing consumer protection, on the one hand, and lessening the 
burden of regulation imposed on financial institutions on the other. 
It must be noted that implementation of a new access system for 
foreign banks will, it seems, come in a separate act slated to come 
out by the end of the year.
<P>
	The government will adopt clauses on the protection of 
confidential information, better information on the cost of credit, 
and protection of consumers from tied selling. After discussions 
with the government, the banks will take a number of steps to 
improve access by low-income individuals to basic financial 
services, as well as information on banking services which, we 
must admit, have been virtually non-existent until now, possibly to 
the detriment of users of banking services. Banks must also adopt a 
policy on tied selling, and set up mechanisms to handle complaints 
on this. Some banks have already taken such initiatives.
<P>
	As for tied selling, the government is naive almost to the point of 
complacency. These measures apply only to banks, while the same 
thing is not required of other  financial institutions. This is because 
banks fall under federal jurisdiction, while the other institutions, 
such as insurance companies, come under provincial jurisdiction. 
The federal government should let the provinces set the rules and 
require its federal institutions to adhere to the provincial 
legislation. This is the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois. That way, 
the legislation would not have the double standards it does at the 
moment.
<P>
	The government also states that the clauses to amend the Bank 
Act so as to prevent high-pressure tied selling will come into effect 
only if they prove necessary. Banks are being asked to create their 
own internal complaint handling system, and the act will apply 
only if this proves insufficient-but using what criteria?
<P>
	The government is therefore doing nothing concrete about tied 
selling. What is proposes to do eventually is not even the right 
thing, in our opinion. It just refers to tied selling in order to gain 
brownie points as the elections come closer, but in actual fact it 
strikes us that this is nothing but hot air.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	If the government wants to do something concrete, it should 
make the banks subject to the same legislation as financial 
institutions that come under provincial jurisdiction, which offers 
consumers genuine protection.
<P>
	We deplore the fact that the federal government is trying to 
interfere, through the back door, with areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. Under sections 254 to 259 of the Insurance Companies 
Act, an insurance company with a federal charter or a foreign 
company regulated under this act is currently prohibited from 
selling its policies in Canada to another insurance company that is 
provincially regulated.
<P>
	Since most foreign insurance companies operate in Quebec 
under a federal charter, Quebec insurance companies cannot buy 
their policies when these companies withdraw from the Quebec 
market.
<P>
	This is unfair to Quebec insurance companies for the following 
reasons: first of all, they cannot freely enter into transactions with 
another insurance company that is federally regulated, even to 
purchase a block of policies that are all held by Quebec policy 
holders. Second, it is against the spirit of NAFTA because through 
Ottawa, artificial trade barriers are being created in Quebec. Third, 
banks and trust companies do not have the equivalent in their 
legislation, so that a federally regulated bank or trust company may 
buy blocks of business from their provincially chartered 
counterpart.
<P>
	In other words, Quebec insurance companies are not treated as 
well as foreign companies and this, in their own country. In a joint 
brief dated February 1996, the Canadian Life and Health Insurance 
Association, the Canadian Bankers Association, the Insurance 
Bureau of Canada, Canada Trust, the Trust Companies Association 
of Canada and the Credit Union Central of Canada-this  is starting 
to look like quite a crowd-asked the federal government to allow, 
with the approval of the minister, the transfer of policies in Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9095"> 9095 </A></B>
<P>
from a federal insurance company to a provincial insurance 
company.
<P>
	The Government of Canada did not respond to this request in 
Bill C-82, thus perpetuating the unfair treatment of provincially 
chartered insurance companies like those in Quebec. If nothing is 
done, C-82 will continue to restrict the opportunities for expansion 
of provincially regulated insurance companies, so that many will 
prefer to obtain a federal charter. Let us not forget that insurance is 
a strictly provincial matter. The federal government has always 
tended to forget that.
<P>
	The reason the federal government is prohibiting the sale of 
policies by a federally chartered company to a provincially 
chartered company is that the latter is outside its control and 
supervision. On the other hand, the federal government is 
permitting the sale of blocks of insurance policies by a provincially 
or federally chartered company to a federally chartered 
company-the reverse is not permitted-on the grounds that the 
latter is under its supervision and must be a member of the 
Canadian Life and Health Insurance Compensation Corporation.
<P>
	Clearly, it is a one way street: what goes one way does not go the 
other. It has been this way since 1867, always to the federal 
government's advantage. Over time, companies, and especially the 
major ones, end up with only a federal charter, because a provincial 
charter penalizes them by preventing them from acquiring blocks 
of policies from a federally chartered company.
<P>
	The provincial market, which is shrinking as a result, may well 
disappear. Sooner or later, if there are no more companies with a 
provincial charter, the province, as we know, will become a 
redundant lawmaker, and this is how the federal government will 
take total control of an area that, under the Constitution, comes 
totally under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	In such a situation, the Bloc certainly has nothing against the 
protection of consumer information, but this is a matter of civil 
law, an area of provincial jurisdiction. Quebec already has 
legislation on consumer protection, on the protection of personal 
information, on insurance and on market intermediaries, which is 
to be reviewed shortly.
<P>
	The aim of the federal government is to be able to make 
additional regulations in an area of jurisdiction where it has no 
business, by duplicating and overlapping what already exists. In 
this regard, federal policy never changes.
<P>
	This is to be found in section 459 of the Bank Act, which is 
amended by clause 55 of Bill C-82, which is before the House 
today. The government claims in its fine speeches to want to 
eliminate overlap and allow the  level of government best suited to 
provide the public with the services it needs to do so. In fact, 
however, it continues to trample all over fields of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It cites an agreement between the provinces in order to legislate 
in this area. That is not what federalism is about. It is not because 
ten provinces agree on a subject that the federal government has the 
right to make laws and regulations in an area of jurisdiction that is 
not its own.
<P>
	The federal government claims with Bill C-82 to be improving 
access to basic financial services for low income Canadians. For 
instance, only two pieces of identification instead of three would be 
required to open an account or cash a cheque, photo ID being 
considered desirable but not mandatory. This is a mere facade, 
since the problem remains.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments forbid banks to ask for 
some identification that most Canadians carry, including their 
social security number. The solution would be to think of a piece of 
ID that everyone has and that banks are allowed to ask for to check 
the identity of individuals. More often than not, the only cards they 
can ask for are credit cards, which very few low income people 
have.
<P>
	Banks are not allowed to impose undue pressure on their clients, 
but the legislation does not say what constitutes undue pressure. In 
any case, it is up to the provinces to define this undesirable 
practice, as consumer protection is a provincial responsibility. 
However, the federal government reserves the right to make 
regulations in an area under provincial jurisdiction where there is 
already duplication and overlap, as pointed out earlier, in the case 
of Quebec. This is unacceptable to us, Bloc members.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-82 makes a distinction between undue 
pressure and favourable tied selling in subsections 459.1(2) and 
(3).
<P>
	This policy raises major questions, since the goods that are tied 
seldom have the same life or expiry. This will make control 
extremely difficult, in a word, it cannot work. Why not require 
banks to comply with provincial consumer protection and tied 
selling regulations?
<P>
	We know that, for the federal government, streamlining and 
duplication are synonyms, while harmonization really means 
interference. But this must stop, particularly if the government 
wants to fulfil the commitments made in the last speech from the 
throne. We feel that Bill C-82 provides the government with a good 
opportunity to show that it intends to fulfil its fine promises by not 
legislating and by not adopting regulations that duplicate and 
overlap what is already being done at the provincial level.
<P>
	The federal government is imposing on banks standards that are 
not imposed on other institutions that  come under provincial 
jurisdiction. Given that all these financial institutions are 
ultimately competing against each other, the only way to ensure 
they are subjected to the same rules is to let the provinces decide 
how these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9096"> 9096 </A></B>
<P>
institutions, including banks, must deal with the issue of consumer 
protection, including complaints relating to tied selling.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The Insurance Brokers Association of Canada fears that federal 
regulations in the financial planning sector would interfere with 
what is already being done. According to the association, the code 
of ethics on the disclosure of personal information, which is 
currently adhered to on a voluntary basis, is too soft on banks, 
given what is required of intermediaries in the marketplace.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois expressed a number of reservations 
regarding Bill C-82. The government should correct the irritants 
that we mentioned today. Then, and only then will we be able to 
support Bill C-82.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon. 
member sitting next to me just made an excellent speech. He gave 
some advice to the government, but I notice that there are more 
Bloc Quebecois members than government members, or even 
Reform Party members, in the House of Commons. I am asking the 
Chair to check to see if there is a quorum.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are now more than 20 members in 
the House, we can therefore resume debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address Bill C-82. I would like to go over a number of issues and 
review some of the items that are in the bill which the 
parliamentary secretary has pointed out.
<P>
	I would also basically like to submit to the House a lot of the 
work that was done by my colleague from Okanagan Centre who is 
our critic for industry and who has been monitoring and following 
the impact of this bill on Canadians and the four pillars of our 
financial institutions in Canada. A lot of what I do will be some 
work that he has done and that he has monitored.
<P>
	I will express the overall outline of the Reform Party and then 
explain to Canadians who are watching how standing committees 
work, what actually is presented at standing committees by various 
groups and how that has an impact or no impact on final legislation. 
I will then read into the record a report by the member for 
Okanagan Centre which he has sent to the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions. That way our position as a 
party and our contribution to this debate on this issue will 
definitely be moved forward.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
indicated that Bill C-82 was really about protecting consumers. In a 
sense that is right but there are objections I have to that comment. 
How do we protect consumers when we increase their taxes? How 
do we protect consumers when we confuse them across this 
country, for instance, with the harmonized sales tax in three 
provinces but not in the other provinces? How can we implement 
tax reform and how do we encourage financial institutions and the 
four pillars to know what is going on when we have one tax regime 
in three provinces and a different one in other provinces?
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	We saw that big flaw. We saw that the direction of the 
government in terms of taxation was the wrong direction. We saw 
that in terms of another bill we debated earlier today, Bill C-70, the 
harmonization tax, the blended sales tax or the tax inclusive pricing 
which the Senate sent back to the House. I thought we were 
finished with it.
<P>
	Although the amendment is headed in the right direction on that 
bill, tax inclusive prices in three provinces confuses consumers and 
lenders. The bill does not go far enough. I do not see why the bill 
should not have had, along with being open and visible, a national 
harmonized sales tax, not a partial one, and a single rate, not a 
mid-double digit rate. A lower rate would force the federal 
government to keep its expenses down and not overspend. There 
should have been another amendment to allow doctors to claim the 
GST on input credits.
<P>
	The Liberals are very lucky they have a Senate and senators who 
went on a trip. Because of the power they have in the other place 
they were able to send the bill back to this House. At least they 
understand the meaning of representation and what is in the best 
interest of an area or a community. The Liberal premier of New 
Brunswick also understands the meaning of representation. He puts 
the people of New Brunswick first and not the Liberals. He puts the 
people he represents first and not his party. He puts his province 
first and not the Liberal federal government. Many Atlantic MPs 
will benefit from that decision.
<P>
	I said many times that the harmonization effort was not really 
based on economic benefits for Canadians. I submitted sufficient 
proof that it bears a high cost. Yet the parliamentary secretary just 
said on Bill C-82 that he is worried about consumers.
<P>
	Consumers are taxpayers. Taxpayers have had to pay three 
provinces $961 million. Taxpayers are consumers. They have a 
traditional cost in terms of their businesses and government 
transitional costs of $200 million. They are over a billion dollars 
now. There will be a huge increase in costs to consumers when the 
blended sales tax is applied in the three provinces after April to 
goods and services the provincial sales tax never applied to before. 
It will represent a 7 per cent tax increase to consumers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9097"> 9097 </A></B>
<P>
	I have read all the news about the government and what the 
Liberals are doing by introducing this bill and that bill and by 
jumping back and forth one to another. A new issue has come up 
that amazes me and disappoints me. The Liberals truly sound like 
the Conservatives before them.
<P>
	During the Charlottetown accord Mulroney labelled anyone who 
voted against his accord as enemies of Canada. Now certain 
Liberals feel threatened by the actions of the Liberal premier of 
New Brunswick, Frank McKenna, in terms of the Liberals' 
re-election chances federally. They are angry he did a flip-flop on 
the harmonized sales tax. They are angry he did an about-turn and 
does not support the harmonized sales tax the way it was being 
shoved down the throats of Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	McKenna sided with the Senate banking committee to defer tax 
inclusive pricing, much to the embarrassment of the Liberal 
government and in particular the finance minister who claims that 
he was representing the consumers of Canada, the consumers of 
Atlantic Canada. Yet he is contradicted by the Liberal premier.
<P>
	A disgruntled Liberal MP claims that ``people are getting tired of 
his shenanigans'', referring to Premier McKenna and his actions. 
The Liberal MP goes on to state further ``on the condition of 
anonymity''. This is a public servant elected by people and he 
speaks on the condition of anonymity. Does that shows real 
courage? He says: ``I have never seen a premier accumulate so 
many enemies in three and a half years''.
<P>
	Because a Liberal premier, no less, disagrees with the federal 
government on what is best for the constituents of New Brunswick, 
he is labelled an enemy of the federal Liberals. Shame. Arrogance 
abounds on the government side.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	All members of Parliament should be evaluating the 
consequences of increased taxes. All members of Parliament 
should be evaluating the consequences of tied selling, allowing 
banks to get into all businesses and becoming a stronger oligopoly. 
All MPs should be interested in representing the wishes of their 
constituents.
<P>
	Our job as politicians is to represent voters across the country, 
not just the wishes of the federal Liberal government. If they do not 
agree with the government they should not be labelled as enemies 
of the country, as enemies of Canada, or as enemies of the Liberal 
government. If the Liberal government cannot keep an election 
promise it is not the fault of those who oppose. Nor should they be 
labelled as enemies.
<P>
	I spent some time on the aspect of consumer protection. That is 
what Bill C-82 is all about. After the review will the bill improve 
things for the people of Canada, the consumers, as the Secretary of 
State for International Financial Institutions claims?
<P>
	Let us look more specifically at what the legislation does for 
Canada and for Canadians. Some of the more notable clauses in the 
bill provide that more detailed information be available to the 
consumer regarding cost of credit disclosure. They require 
simplified and improved dissemination of information to 
consumers about basic financial services, low cost options and fees 
on products and services. They also allow non-deposit taking 
institutions to opt out of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
and loosen subsidiary requirements. So far so good.
<P>
	They introduce regulations to allow financial institutions to enter 
into joint venture agreements and propose changes that permit 
mutual insurance companies to issue participating shares. They 
require that large mutual insurance companies remain widely held 
after conversion to a stock company. They also permit foreign 
banks to be regulated as Canadian banks.
<P>
	In terms of foreign competition the Reform supports competition 
in the financial sector. We support permitting foreign banks to be 
regulated as Canadian banks. The Reform feels that competition 
leads to the best service and to a lower cost for the delivery of that 
service.
<P>
	There is also an item called coercive tied selling. The whole 
issue of tied selling is probably the single most controversial aspect 
of the bill the government will have to address and be held 
accountable and responsible for. The issue raises serious concerns 
with regard to tied selling. Subsection 459.1(1) in clause 55 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A bank shall not impose undue pressure on, or coerce, a person to obtain a 
product or service-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subsections (2) and (3) set out provisions where the banks are 
allowed to offer loans to persons on more favourable terms and 
conditions, on the condition they buy other products and services 
from a particular person. A bank or one of its affiliates may offer a 
product and service to persons on more favourable terms, on the 
condition a person obtains a loan from the bank.
<P>
	Although subsections (2) and (3) are intended to be 
interpretative clauses for the courts, it is our opinion that they 
permit tied selling and give the banks considerably more power 
than they enjoy now.
<P>
	We recommend that these clauses be deleted. If not, the banks 
will have the ability to pressure individual and small businesses to 
consolidate their financial activities and requirements into a single 
provider. This would not be considered fiscally prudent. Having 
assets under one roof increases the relative influence of the bank to 
determine who is granted loan capital and who is denied access.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	In order to ensure a balanced system that respects both the 
interests of the consumer and the integrity of Canada's financial
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9098"> 9098 </A></B>
<P>
institutions it is necessary to ensure  that legislation such as the 
Bank Act is clear in its meaning and intent.
<P>
	We must be prudent in all cases and ensure that access to capital 
is freely available without constraints of any kind. That point is 
trying to strengthen the argument that tied selling is a very delicate 
and potentially divisive issue. It deserves further review and 
discussion.
<P>
	Earlier I said I would talk about some items raised in the 
Standing Committee on Finance in October last year. This is where 
the issue was discussed and certain groups came before the 
committee to make representations.
<P>
	I will read the fourth report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance of October 1996 under tied selling:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tied selling occurs when a vendor requires a customer to purchase one produce or 
service as a condition of purchasing another one. As the white paper points out 
``concerns have been raised that the special nature of the relationship between 
financial institutions and their customers renders their customers especially 
vulnerable to coercion and that market forces and the Competition Act may not 
provide sufficient safeguards for these consumers''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee is concerned that tied selling must not be confused with cross 
selling. Cross selling, in essence, involves offering a lower price for a particular 
product or service if the customer agrees to purchase another product or service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is like a volume discount. It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Non-coercive cross selling may actually result in savings to customers who often 
find package sales attractive. As well, banks may find it worthwhile to make small 
business loans only if other services to that customer are part of a package, and the 
committee does not wish to discourage lending to small business. It is not always a 
simple matter, however, to distinguish between tied selling and cross selling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That gets back to my earlier point that the Bank Act must be 
clear in its language and in its intent, and I do not believe it is. It 
goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Independent Investment Dealers Association brought three specific cases of 
alleged coercive tied selling by banks before the Senate Committee on Banking, 
Trade and Commerce. The Canadian Bankers Association has disputed that these 
cases involve tied selling. Without investigating the details of each case, the 
committee cannot judge their merits. Suffice it to say, however, the committee 
remains concerned about the possible abuse of power by not only banks but by all 
financial institutions and insists that their customers not be subjected to abusive 
practices involving tied selling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Competition Act currently prohibits tied selling by ``a major supplier of a 
product in a market that is likely to</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) impede entry into or expansion of a firm in the market,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) impede introduction of a product into or expansion of sales of a product in the 
market, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) have any other exclusionary effect in the market with the result that competition 
is or is likely to be lessened substantially''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee does not believe that any of its concerns about tied selling of 
financial services can be dealt with by the Competition Act prohibitions since undue 
pressure on an individual customer would not meet the test of substantially lessening 
competition in that market. Accordingly, arguments to the effect that the Competition 
Act can resolve this committee's concerns about tied selling are specious.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition to the Competition Act prohibitions against tied selling, section 416(5) 
of the Bank Act states as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``No bank shall exercise pressure on a borrower to place insurance for the security of 
a bank with any particular insurance company-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee received representations from both the Canadian Bankers 
Association-and the Independent Investment Dealers Association-on this 
provision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The IIDA asked that section 416(5) be amended to read as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``No bank shall exercise pressure on a borrower to purchase or obtain any 
financial product or service from any particular supplier''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The CBA objects to the use of the word ``pressure'' as it currently applies, and to 
the expansion of its prohibition beyond ``insurance for the security of the bank'' to 
``any financial product or service''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee shares the concerns of the CBA that the word ``pressure'' is not 
defined and that many aspects of selling could involve an element of pressure. As 
stated by the Consumers' Association of Canada, what is important is that the 
pressure not be undue or coercive. The committee therefore recommends that 
section 416(5) of the Bank Act be reconsidered with a view to reflecting that it is not 
just any pressure, but only undue or coercive pressure, that amounts to unacceptable 
behaviour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Secondly, the committee recommended that the prohibition in section 416(5) of 
the Bank Act against undue or coercive pressure should apply to the provision of 
``any financial product or service'' and not just ``insurance for the security of the 
bank''. There is no reason why such pressure should be permitted in any instance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thirdly, the committee recommends that a provision similar to section 416(5) of 
the Bank Act as amended above apply to all federally regulated financial institutions. 
Undue or coercive pressure should not be prohibited only among banks. 
Recognizing the possibility that constitutional issues might arise, the committee 
recommends that the government undertake discussions with the provinces with a 
view to obtaining this protection for consumers of all financial institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fourthly, the committee recommends that financial institutions would be required 
to:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>designate a senior level officer in each financial institution to implement procedures 
for dealing with consumer complaints;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>provide customers with details on how customers can make complaints; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>report annually on the complaints received and the actions taken to respond to these 
complaints.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fifthly, the committee recommends that customers who believe their complaints 
have not been dealt with adequately by the financial institution concerned shall be 
informed of their right to complain directly to the Consumer Protection  
Bureau-under the Minister of Industry, and the CPB shall report to Parliament on such 
complaints.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sixthly, in the event the largely self-regulatory regime proposed herein proves 
inadequate to protect customers against undue or coercive pressure from tied selling, 
stronger measures should be undertaken.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lastly, the committee recommends that officials study the laws and jurisprudence 
in other jurisdictions to assist in determining more precisely the difference between 
tied selling and cross selling. For example, section 106 of the 1970 Bank Holding 
Company Act of the United States spells out in some detail the instances of activities 
of banks that are not considered to be tied selling and which are therefore 
presumably for the benefit of consumers. Various provincial laws dealing with this 
issue might also prove helpful.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the conclusions drawn by the Standing Committee on 
Finance based on the submissions given by various witnesses on 
the issue of tied selling.
<P>
	One can see how technical this issue is in the sense that it is hard 
to understand and is hard for anybody to really get it clear in their 
mind the difference between tied selling and cross selling, when 
they are going from one by placing conditions into the other where 
they are just suggesting a better deal or a lower rate and a real 
benefit if they are offering cross selling.

<P>
	I would like to read from a document written by the member for 
Okanagan Centre, our chief critic of industry, who is not here 
today. It is just a short article that he entitled ``It's Time to Stop and 
Take a Good Look at the Financial Sector''. Having read this, I 
share the general thrust and view of his position on this.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	He goes on to write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The finance minister] surprised many in his 1996 budget speech by assuring 
Canadians that banks would not be allowed to sell insurance through their branch 
networks-this year. This soft ball, so deftly tossed our way, neither assuaged our 
concerns or addressed the issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The real issue is not whether the banks should be allowed to sell insurance or enter 
into the car leasing business but whether true competition exists within the financial 
sector and thus whether the consumer and the economy will benefit if banks are 
allowed to enter other markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The banks assure us that their own industry is competitive and not the oligopoly 
that Canadians suspect. This is difficult to believe when the six largest banks in 
Canada move en masse to raise or lower interest rates every time the bank rate so 
much as twitches. The only competition in this case is, who will move first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The four pillars of the financial sector, banking, insurance, trust companies and 
securities dealers, have crumbled as deregulation and technological progress has 
blurred the lines of distinction. The banks have been applying pressure ever since to sell 
insurance in their branch networks, enter into auto leasing, and increase their interest in 
the securities market. Further deregulation and the subsequent increase in the size of 
banks, however, could reduce competition in the financial sector and hurt consumers. 
These are perennial issues in Parliament  particularly when a review of the Bank Act is 
scheduled. Major reviews are conducted every 10 years, interspersed with minor 
reviews every 5 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1997 brings a minor review but it is a major review that is required. We need to know 
a good many things: How do our financial institutions interact? How do they operate in 
relation to other sectors of the economy? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the 
current regulatory structure? Not only will the answers reveal whether or not true 
competition exists within the banking sector and thus, whether or not they should be 
allowed to expand into other financial services, the answers will determine the veritable 
strength of our financial sector as it heads into the 21st century. Until such a review is 
completed, a moratorium should be placed on making further decisions about financial 
institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Furthermore, Parliament must be the venue, perhaps in the form of a joint 
committee of the finance and industry committees. It is the only way we can assure 
all interests will be recognized and the process will be both accessible and 
transparent. Canadians must be able to see the process in order to put faith in it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As lobbyists from all sides pressure members of Parliament to take sides and 
others to try to frame the issue within the overly political constraints of a war 
between big and small business, the challenge will be to keep our eye on the ball. 
That is, to ensure true competition exists and is free to function within the 
marketplace, that stability is maintained in respect of financial sectors, and a prudent 
regulatory structure is in place to protect the consumer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the bottom line is met, Canadians and the economy will indeed emerge as 
winners.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Centre, who was our chief critic on industry.

	I would like to continue, but I notice members on the opposite 
side are either wanting to take a breath of fresh air outside or they 
want me to finish speaking.
<P>
	I want to add that if I would have been given unanimous consent, 
which Liberal members denied me, I would have finished that four 
minutes, I would have gone back to my office and I would not be 
making these people yell ``time''.
<P>
	For the sake of clarification and for their benefit, I would like to 
let them know how much time I have left in this speech. I believe I 
have another 15 minutes, if I am correct. Will the Liberal members 
kindly indulge me and allow me to finish my remaining 15 minutes 
without yelling ``time''?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you please clarify that. I 
understood that the member had 20 minutes for his speech. He has 
now spoken for approximately 25 minutes. He seems to be under 
the impression that he has more time remaining.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is allowed 40 minutes 
for his intervention. He has 12 minutes and 26 seconds left in his 
intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you add another minutes for this 
intrusion and please make it 13 minutes and 20 seconds. These 
people want to rush things through in such a dictatorial 
undemocratic fashion. They have used closure more times than the 
previous government, which is not democratic. Now I am off on a 
tangent which I will take a minute to do.
<P>
	When you are in opposition you have the rules of the House 
which are here to protect the interests of the minority. Obviously 
the Liberals have such a strong majority and they are representing 
the wishes of those people who put them in here. But for the 
protection of all Canadians and all provinces the Liberals have to 
take the time and give us time to be heard. They have to allow us to 
tell them what we think is right or wrong about a bill. They have to 
give us the opportunity to point out what we feel on a constructive 
basis could make the bill better.
<P>
	If they do not have the integrity or the fortitude to sit there and 
listen, then they are not really interested in the people of Canada; 
they are interested in themselves. They have no place to go this 
afternoon. They have nowhere else to go except for here where they 
can sit and listen, and that they will do at least while I have the 
floor for another 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
<P>
	This is meant to be a democratic institution. I wish government 
members would recognize that just because they have a majority 
they do not have the right to trample over our rights in the minority. 
We have to be heard. We insist on being heard. The games this 
House leader plays and the way the Liberals fool around with the 
government orders with no notice, a lack of notice on this bill. Our 
chief critic is not here. He is not able to tell the people what he 
really thinks. He has been in the standing committee. He could 
shed a heck of a lot more light on this bill than I could.
<P>
	I have some experience with banks and financial institutions so I 
feel qualified as a businessman to speak on this bill. I will get little 
<P>

<P>
more personal if not as technical on this bill once I have read this 
letter which was sent by my colleague from Okanagan Centre to the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions. This is 
the kind of work that Reform Party members do. It is a sample of 
the kind of hard work that Reform members of standing 
committees have done.
<P>
	My colleague from Capilano-Howe Sound sits on the Standing 
Committee of Finance and has been our chief finance critic. He has 
made a number of valuable interventions in standing committee. 
They have been good, open, democratic and non-partisan 
suggestions. Here is an example from the member for Okanagan  
Centre. I hope the government listens to what he has to say. The 
reason I want to read this into the record is to show Canadians how 
things work in Parliament. It is not just debate and question period. 
For the media and for a lot of people it is just question period, it is 
theatrics. The real work is done right now on debate like this where 
people get up and put forth their arguments for or against a bill. 
Then the bill is sent to committee where people come forward as 
witnesses and argue their points of view, how they feel a certain bill 
will impact on them. And then there is the work that gets done 
behind the scenes.
<P>
	Here is a sample of some work behind the scenes, a letter to the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions written by 
the Reform member for Okanagan Centre:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Minister,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As the Reform Party critic for financial institutions, I wish to express a concern 
that a growing number of small business people and I have with Bill C-82, an act to 
amend certain laws relating to financial institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Specifically our concern rests with clause 55, section 451.1 subsections (2) and 
(3).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While 459.1(1) states explicitly that no bank shall impose undue pressure on, or 
coerce, a person to obtain products and services, subsections (2) and (3) appear to 
contradict 459.1(1) by allowing the banks to do just that. In our opinion these 
provisions for tied selling give the banks considerably more power than they enjoy 
now.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As acknowledged by your officials, the definitions of tied selling and coercive 
tied selling are numerous. While sectors do practise tied selling or product bundling, 
we feel caution must be exercised where coercive or pressure tied selling is 
concerned. Any legislation which could be interpreted as giving the banks the ability 
to coerce or exert pressure is grievous. Mechanisms such as conditions for preferred 
rates on loans and/or products and services which unduly influence the consumer to 
consolidate assets within one financial institution is not prudent in our opinion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While we understand subsections (2) and (3) are considered to be interpretive and 
are intended to assist the courts, the Reform Party feels it would ultimately be in the 
best interests of all concerned to delete (2) and (3) thereby allowing 459.1(1) to 
stand on its own merits and to remove any chance of misinterpretation which would 
give the banking sector grounds for unfair advantage. Any resulting confusion can 
be adequately clarified by the provisions set out in 459.1(5) via the regulatory 
powers of the Governor in Council.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Barring this amendment, we would like to suggest an alternative amendment to 
Clause 45 and Clause 55 be deleted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are extremely aware of the time constraints inherent in the Bank Act which 
emphasize a preference for speedy passage of Bill C-82 through the House. The 
Reform Party does not wish to unduly delay the passage of this Bill. However, since 
a growing number of small business people, including members of the casualty and 
property insurance sector, share our concerns, I feel it would be irresponsible of me 
as a critic to advise our caucus to support Bill C-82 as long as Clause 55 stands as is.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would like to see an amicable resolution to our concerns and wish to express our 
support for the merits of this legislation. Our main objective is and will always be to 
ensure that the integrity of our financial institutions remains intact and the interests of 
the consumer and the small business person are balanced with the interests of the 
financial sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I ask that you give fair and reasonable consideration to these concerns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	It is signed by the Reform member of Parliament for Okanagan 
Centre.
<P>
	As members can see, our main concern with this bill lies in that 
aspect which controls tied selling and the difference between that 
and cross selling. One must be very careful when passing 
legislation and making laws that one does not step on people's toes 
or infringe on the rights of the corporation or the individual.
<P>
	Banks are in a position to offer a lot of services. However, when 
looking at the size of banks and the number of people who are 
dependent on them, there has to be in anyone's mind some concern 
that legislation is not passed that allows the banks to have an unfair 
advantage over smaller or specialized businesses. That specialized 
business may be a large insurance company which offers just one 
service. It is not in a position to cross sell its product or offer 
volume discounts unless a person takes out a bigger life insurance 
policy or leases a more expensive vehicle or something like that.
<P>
	When these smaller businesses are involved in their own 
specialized niche, it is important that when dealing with the banks 
that legislation is not imposed that gives the banks more power 
than the other financial institutions and investment dealers raising 
money, who can be offering chequing services and who cannot.
<P>
	I have heard arguments from people who are anti-bank or bank 
bashers who say that the banks can get into any business they want. 
They can lend money for any purpose they want, provide insurance 
services or provide leasing facilities or whatever. We should then 
allow other people like investment dealers or other institutions to 
get into the banking business.
<P>
	They do not like that so why not allow that so that we can have 
these specialized businesses if they have sufficient capital to offer 
other services? It seems to me that insurance companies have 
sufficient cash around. They could be in the deposit taking 
business, chequing business or credit card business which is a big 
business. We notice in the the Eaton's bankruptcy application that 
the most successful portion of its business is the credit card 
business and it is highly profitable.
<P>
	We are trying to review the Bank Act, trying to make it fair for 
consumers and, at the same time, not make it punitive for the 
banks. We have to make sure that while one is applying for a loan 
for a house and the bank is approving the mortgage, it can suggest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9101"> 9101 </A></B>
<P>
one may need  insurance for the house, so while one is there the 
bank might like to show its package.
<P>
	The problem is how can one be inside that room or how can we 
pass legislation that puts one inside the law inside that room? We 
do not know what the bank manager or the account manager is 
saying.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The manager is telling the customer that the bank is giving him 
or her a mortgage. There is a big difference between your mortgage 
is approved, you have the proper credit facility and you know what, 
we can offer you insurance. Here is our package and I think it is a 
heck of a deal. You should take a look at it. That is okay and is cross 
selling in my mind. However, if the manager says that your 
mortgage is approved if you also take this insurance policy on the 
house, they come together, that is tied selling. That is not right. 
That is coercive. That is undue pressure on the consumer.
<P>
	I feel that a lot of my intervention today was technical in nature, 
but I wanted to tell Canadians that a lot of work goes into bills like 
this. A lot of different people with different points of view make 
contributions. It is not easy: tied selling, cross selling, the 
difference, who is inside that room, how do you know.
<P>
	Although the intent of the bill is is necessary and we agree with 
the majority of it, the one area that we are still unhappy with is the 
area of the tied selling in that clause.
<P>
	Consequently, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-82, an act to amend certain laws relating to financial institutions, be not 
now read a second time; that the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the 
subject matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Industry''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are very concerned about that one area, tied selling versus 
cross selling. As I said earlier in my speech, the Bank Act must be 
clear and concise in its language so that people can interpret it 
without ambiguity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I would think that 
great herd of Liberals could somehow manage to maintain a 
quorum.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate, the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess for some of the members 
opposite math is difficult.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre has carried on in a diatribe 
about his not being permitted to finish the last four minutes of his 
speech on the previous bill. I am sure which all members look 
forward to hearing from him on Bill C-70 when it is taken up again.
<P>
	I want to point out, because he has harped on this, that in the 
Thursday question the House was informed that the government 
would commence consideration of Bill C-82 with respect to 
financial institutions no later than 3 p.m. today, Monday and that is 
exactly what we did.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to start 
the second reading debate on Bill C-82.
<P>
	This legislation proposes important measures to better protect 
consumers of financial services, to lighten the regulatory burden of 
financial institutions, and to define some of the provisions in the 
legislation affecting these institutions.
<P>
	These measures are the results of a thorough consideration 
process and of widespread consultations. Therefore, I would like to 
take advantage of this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the 
government, the many consumer groups, industry members and 
other stakeholders who shared their opinions with us.
<P>
	I want also to mention the very helpful participation of the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance and of the 
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Canada has one of the strongest financial systems in the world, a 
system that is effective, efficient and stable. It strikes a balance 
between our financial institutions' competitiveness and their 
stability. We want this to continue. That is why the Canadian 
government is keeping a close eye on the evolution of the financial 
sector and considering ways of evaluating the system.
<P>
	In 1992, we eliminated a large number of restrictions that 
prevented financial institutions from freely competing with each 
other. The consensus seems to be that these changes had a positive 
effect. When the 1992 bill to amend the legislation on financial 
institutions was passed, it was agreed that the legislative 
framework would be reviewed five years later. That is why the 
legislation contained provisions calling for a review in 1997. We 
embarked on this legislative review with two objectives in mind: to 
determine whether the measures adopted in 1992 had yielded the 
desired results and to see whether the legislative framework was 
still appropriate in view of the financial sector's evolution.
<P>
	Following extensive consultations and in-depth analysis, the 
government came to the conclusion that the framework put in place 
in 1992 was working well in general and that its main components 
had to be maintained. The majority of stakeholders agree with this 
evaluation. However, we believe it is possible to make a number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9102"> 9102 </A></B>
<P>
major changes to give consumers better  protection and to bring the 
legislation more in line with the new realities of the markets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me now turn to the specifics of these adjustments. They 
involve amendments to statutes governing financial institutions 
and related acts, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit 
Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, the Trust and 
Loan Companies Act, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Act and the Canada Payments Association Act.
<P>
	Several of the proposed adjustments are aimed at strengthening 
consumer protection. Relationships between financial institutions 
and their clients are in constant evolution and regulation needs to 
reflect this changing environment.
<P>
	The bill proposes a number of amendments to improve 
protection for consumers in their dealings with financial 
institutions. The first of these changes involves privacy. The 
protection of personal information is an area of growing concern to 
consumers. Accordingly, the bill provides the authority to require 
financial institutions to establish procedures governing the 
collection, retention, use and disclosure of customer information, 
to implement complaints handling procedures and to report 
annually on complaints. Regulations will be passed to implement 
these requirements.
<P>
	The bill also proposes to enhance cost of credit disclosure 
provisions in the financial institutions statutes following the recent 
federal-provincial agreement on harmonization of disclosure 
requirements. These changes will result in improved and uniform 
disclosure practices throughout the country.
<P>
	Another matter the government will address is tied selling. The 
matter is a complex issue and, indeed, members opposite have been 
talking about it for a few minutes and should hear the reply.
<P>
	Tied sales can be beneficial in many situations where a consumer 
pays less for one product if he or she purchases a second product. 
However, concerns have been expressed about the potential for 
financial institutions to exert undue pressure on consumers when 
selling financial products. In response, financial institutions will be 
asked to adopt a policy on tied selling and establish procedures for 
dealing with complaints in this area. While the government is 
confident that this is the best approach, we are prepared to go 
further if the need arises. The bill includes an amendment to Bank 
Act to prohibit coercive tied selling.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Financial Institutions issued a press 
release on February 14 which suggested that the government would 
proclaim this amendment if necessary. After additional 
consideration, the government is now prepared to set a specific 
date for proclaiming the amendment. We intend to bring it into 
force on September 30, 1998.
<P>
	At the same time the government wants to provide an 
opportunity for the institutions to address the tied selling matter 
through the establishment of appropriate policies and procedures. 
Therefore, the government is requesting that, before the 
proclamation date, the House of Commons finance committee 
carry out a review. This review would assess the degree to which 
tied selling remains a problem and the extent to which financial 
institutions have responded to the challenge. It would also consider 
methods to differentiate between beneficial practices such as when 
discounts are offered for taking more than one service, something 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre did not want consumers to 
have the advantage of, and those forms of tied selling that might be 
anti-competitive. These matters would be reflected in regulations.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Consumers raised other issues during the 1997 review, including 
the difficulty many low income individuals face in getting access to 
basic financial services and the difficulty of comparing service 
charges across financial institutions. While the government is not 
proposing legislative changes in these areas, I am pleased to report 
that discussions with major financial institutions and consumer 
groups have resulted in concrete commitments to address these 
problems. I am confident that these commitments will result in 
significant improvements in access and information on service 
charges.
<P>
	The government recognizes that to promote a proper climate for 
economic growth and jobs, we need to ensure regulatory 
requirements that are fair and necessary. The bill identifies several 
areas where the regulatory burden on financial institutions can and 
should be eased.
<P>
	First, several rules governing the operations of foreign banks in 
Canada will be modified. These will streamline regulatory 
requirements and lower costs for foreign banks. In particular, the 
legislation removes the requirement for regulated foreign banks 
which own a schedule II bank to own other financial institution 
subsidiaries only through a schedule II bank. It also includes 
changes to ease regulatory requirements for near banks.
<P>
	Near banks are entities that do not generally take deposits and 
are not regulated as banks in their home jurisdiction but provide 
banking type services. Approval requirements will be reduced for 
near banks in certain circumstances and near banks will be 
permitted to own non-bank financial institutions.
<P>
	Another element of the bill that will reduce regulatory burden is 
deposit insurance opt-out for eligible institutions. Many banks in 
Canada specialize in serving wholesale customers whose deposits 
far exceed the amounts insurable by the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. Such institutions will be permitted to opt-out of 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, CDIC coverage, provided 
they are not affiliated with another  CDIC member. As a result they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9103"> 9103 </A></B>
<P>
will no longer have to fulfil the reporting requirements associated 
with CDIC membership. Banks serving retail customers are still 
required to be members of the deposit insurance program.
<P>
	In addition, subsidiary requirements will be eased. Currently 
financial institutions can engage in certain types of business only 
through subsidiaries. To reduce operating costs the legislation will 
permit financial institutions to carry on both information 
processing and specialized financing activities in-house.
<P>
	The bill also includes a number of changes to streamline the 
self-dealing regime. These involve streamlining the operations of 
the conduct review committee, narrowing the range of related 
parties and allowing subsidiaries of a federal financial institution to 
transact with each other.
<P>
	Changes are also necessary to keep the financial institution 
statutes current with evolving trends. The bill proposes a number of 
changes in the area of corporate governance. Although the 
corporate governance provisions were updated in 1992 and are 
generally considered to be working well, changes are needed to 
keep the legislation in tune with evolving standards. The bill 
proposes measures to update and improve corporate governance 
procedures, including clarifying the duty of the audit committee 
and enhancing policy holders' rights.
<P>
	Regulatory adjustments will also be made to provide more 
flexibility to financial institutions seeking to enter into joint 
venture agreements. The requirement that the eligible joint venture 
be controlled by a financial institution will be removed. These 
adjustments will enhance the ability of financial institutions to 
compete both in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	The legislation includes a number of amendments to enhance 
access to capital for mutual insurance companies. They will be 
permitted to issue participating shares. In addition, the 
demutualization regime will be extended to apply to all mutual life 
companies and added flexibility will be provided. Large mutual 
insurance companies will be required to remain widely held after 
conversion to a stock company.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The Superintendent of Financial Institutions will have the 
authority to exempt companies on specific aspects of the 
demutualization regime on a case by case basis. The Minister of 
Finance will have the authority to exempt companies in financial 
distress from any aspect of the demutualization process. Details 
will be set out in regulations to be developed in consultation with 
industry participants over the coming months.
<P>
	Bill C-82 also includes a number of amendments of a technical 
nature that are aimed at further streamlining the statutes governing 
financial institutions and the agencies that govern them.
<P>
	Among the technical amendments are changes to the Bank of 
Canada Act to remove outdated impediments to certain activities of 
the bank. These include expanding the range of instruments that a 
bank may buy and sell in clarifying the ability of the bank to carry 
ancillary activities such as licensing anti-counterfeiting 
technology.
<P>
	The bill also includes technical amendments to the Bank Act, the 
Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies 
Act, the Trust and Loan Companies Act, the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act, the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions Act and consequential amendments to the 
Winding-Up and Restructuring Act and the Greenshield (Canada) 
Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The financial services sector is in constant evolution. It is 
absolutely necessary to update constantly the regulations 
governing this important sector of our economy to reflect the 
various changes that occur.
<P>
	Even though it is agreed that the system works well in general, as 
I said earlier, it will be improved immediately through the bill 
before you. We are still focused on the future. That is why we have 
established a task force on the future of the Canadian financial 
services sector. The task force will be responsible for advising the 
government on the appropriate framework for the financial sector 
in the 21st century, a framework that will promote economic 
growth and job creation.
<P>
	We have also undertaken a review of the payment system. 
Moreover, we are reviewing the access rules for foreign banks, 
which will lead to a system for establishing branches. Legislative 
proposals on this subject will be made public by the end of the year.
<P>
	We have to approach tomorrow's challenges intelligently, but the 
same applies to the changes before us today. This is an important 
bill for many Canadians and I urge the House to adopt it as quickly 
as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask a couple of questions of the parliamentary secretary to 
the finance minister.
<P>
	One of the amendments to the bill allows foreign banks to branch 
directly into Canada. I do not disagree with that. It is a good thing. 
It helps increase the number of service providers. It increases 
choice which should lead to more efficiency and lower cost of 
services.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member, on the other side of the 
coin, has the government addressed the Canadian banks' concerns 
regarding what they need? What is the government doing to help 
our banks compete in foreign markets?
<P>
	Foreign banks are now allowed to come in here. What have the 
big banks, if anything, said to the finance committee with respect 
to their expansion abroad? What has the government done there? 
That is one question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9104"> 9104 </A></B>
<P>
	The second question I would like him to touch on is with respect 
to tied selling. In the press release that the government issued, it 
said that it would introduce tied selling safeguards. I do not think 
he would argue that there is a difference between tied selling and 
cross selling, and that one is good and yet the other we have to be 
careful about. I know that even in my intervention I used 
terminology which is difficult to understand. If we do not go slowly 
it is difficult to convey the message we are trying to pass along to 
consumers.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	What specific protection is the government providing for 
consumers, as the bill stands now? What are the safeguards against 
tied selling? I assume the member is also against allowing the big 
banks to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I regret, because I have great 
regard for the member opposite, that he has it wrong. The bill does 
not allow foreign branching. There was an announcement at the 
time the bill was introduced that a foreign branching regime would 
be put in place by the end of the year. However, a great deal of 
study needed to be done about many features of the foreign 
branching proposal. He is not quite right on that, but he makes an 
important point about how that will enhance competition in certain 
sectors.
<P>
	He is right, there is a flip side to that, which is the position of 
Canadian banks abroad. I can assure the member opposite that the 
government would not have taken the step of announcing the 
possibility of direct branching, as opposed to the current regime, 
unless it was assured that in those major jurisdictions where 
Canadian banks operate, namely the United States and Europe, they 
were gaining additional access.
<P>
	If he talked to bankers today he would learn that the doors have 
been increasingly opening south of the border to allow greater 
expansion for Canadians doing business there. Recent changes, 
particularly under their securities acts, have made that an even 
more hospitable environment than just a few weeks or months ago.
<P>
	I am glad the member asked the question because it gives me a 
chance to reinforce something which I said in French and will now 
say in English, that is, the establishment of the task force on the 
future of the financial services sector. That task force, which is 
under way and will report to the minister roughly 18 months hence, 
will address the very question of what the shape of the sector 
should look like, both to ensure that our institutions can be 
competitive internationally and to serve the needs of Canadian 
consumers.
<P>
	That brings me to the last point, which dealt with tied selling and 
cross selling. I agree with the member  opposite that there are a lot 
of terms involved which can be quite confusing. As a former 
competition lawyer I can tell him that it is a very interesting but 
complex field.
<P>
	If he was concerned, as he asserts, about the ability of banks to 
grow and compete internationally, then I invite him, when the 
finance committee studies further this issue, to read up on it, do a 
bit of work on it, talk to people who know something about the 
field and share his views with the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not appreciate the answer I was 
given. I asked two questions. On the first issue the member gave a 
nice political speech about foreign banks and what is not in the 
legislation.
<P>
	He said that I am confused. Yes, maybe I am confused. I am 
confused because the government shoves legislation down our 
throats, does not even give us a copy of the legislation and expects 
us to debate it.
<P>
	The press release to which I referred was issued by the 
government on February 14. That was four weeks ago. It said what 
it was going to do. It said that it had listened to everybody. It said 
that the matter had been reviewed, that it was different from the 
June 1996 white paper and that it was going to include a new 
regime allowing foreign banks directly into Canada. That is where I 
obtained that information. If the government can change its mind in 
four weeks, maybe it should give all of us notice.
<P>
	The member did not answer my second question on tied selling. 
The question was: What safeguards are in the legislation for my 
benefit as a person who has not had a chance to read the final 
version of Bill C-82? I wonder how many Liberals have read the 
final version. What is in the bill that will satisfy the concerns which 
some Canadians have about the issue of tied selling? What is in 
there to protect the consumer from undue pressure and coercion? 
What is in the bill which allows the banks to hold their heads up 
high and claim they are not doing it? What is in the bill? I would 
like an answer to that question.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry if I offended the hon. 
member opposite. He has not done his homework by his own 
admission. When I rise to ask questions on questions and 
comments I have usually read the sections I am asking about, read 
the press releases properly, and know generally what I am talking 
about.
<P>
	The foreign branching regime will be the subject of additional 
legislation in place by the end of this year. It is not in the bill. The 
press release makes that perfectly clear. That was his first question.
<P>
	His second question was on our banks abroad. I answered it.
<P>
	His third question was on tied selling. I am tempted, as lawyers 
say in court sometimes, to respond to all three questions by saying 
asked and answered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9105"> 9105 </A></B>
<P>
	Specifically on tied selling, we have proposed a change in the 
law with respect to coercive tied selling in direct response to the 
testimony we had. We would welcome the member's input at the 
finance committee on what he thinks should be done.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion of the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre is acceptable as to form.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are: the hon. member for Frontenac-agriculture; the hon. member 
for Mackenzie-railways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party 
indicated, in 1992, the federal government conducted a 
comprehensive review of the legislation governing the operation of 
financial institutions and changed things that had remained 
unchanged for 50, or even 60 years, in some cases.
<P>
	At the time, the industry asked that the act or amendments 
thereto be reviewed after five years to see what, if anything, had 
gone wrong with the 1992 reform. That is why we are doing this 
now, in 1997.
<P>
	We have before us Bill C-82, an act to amend certain laws 
relating to financial institutions. My hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party referred to this bill as a highly technical 250-page 
bill, which it is indeed. These amendments will affect a fair number 
of acts. It will affect the Bank Act, the Cooperative Credit 
Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, the Trust and 
Loan Companies Act, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Act and the Canadian Payments Association Act, to name a few.
<P>
	This bill is very much a symbol and an object lesson for Quebec. 
A symbol because, once again, it contains provisions that encroach 
upon Quebec's jurisdiction-but I will get into that later; we have 
used the word ``encroachment'' so often in the past three and a half 
years that it is beginning to stick in my craw-encroachments that 
fly in the face of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	It is kind of funny to see Quebec being taken to the Supreme 
Court of Canada to find out whether we have the right, under the 
constitution, to take a democratic step in this country, while every 
day, the Liberal Party, the government in office, encroaches on, 
invades provincial areas of jurisdiction without even bothering to 
ask permission, thus violating its own law. It even amended the 
Canadian constitution in 1982 without asking Quebec's 
permission. In fact, it did so in spite of the unanimous opposition of 
Quebec's National Assembly, which included federalists. The 
federal government uses the constitution when it wants to and  the 
way it wants to, while forcing Quebec to comply with it.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to stress that the decisions to be 
made in the next Quebec referendum will not have to take into 
account what the Supreme Court of Canada thinks, what the 
Minister of Justice thinks, or what the Prime Minister of this 
country thinks. Quebecers will make a decision that concerns them 
alone. I am reminded of a famous line coined by Mr. Bourassa, who 
was a known federalist in Quebec. He used to say: ``Quebec is, 
today and forever, the master of its own choices and of its destiny''.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The bill is also a great object lesson in that it tells us a lot of 
interesting things I will get back to later.
<P>
	Generally speaking, we can live with the bill in its present form. 
However, we deplore the fact that the federal government is trying 
to interfere, as I was saying, in areas under provincial jurisdiction, 
through the back door as it were, as is often the case. That is why 
our main amendments-and I give advance notice, there will be a 
few covering the bill as a whole once we have gone over it in 
depth-will be along the lines that the federal government should 
just require federal institutions to respect, which they do not do, the 
provincial legislation in effect where they conduct their activities, 
when these activities come under provincial jurisdiction; insurance 
being strictly a provincial matter.
<P>
	In a joint brief mentioned by my colleague, the member for La 
Prairie, some twenty minutes ago, which was signed by a number 
of people, including the Canadian Life Insurance Association, the 
Canadian Bankers Association, the Insurance Bureau of Canada, 
Canada Trust, the Trust Companies Association of Canada, and 
Credit Union Central of Canada-we are talking about a lot of 
people here-they all asked the federal government to allow, with 
the minister's approval, life insurance policies in Canada to be 
transferred from a federal to a provincial underwriter. This is not in 
the bill, with the result that the injustice to provincial underwriters 
and specifically those in Quebec continues to exist.
<P>
	A provincial underwriter may not buy blocks of insurance 
policies from a federal underwriter under the law as it now stands. 
What exactly does this mean? It means that when underwriters 
want to obtain a charter, they are better off going for a federal 
charter, which lets them buy up blocks of provincial insurance 
policies, because the reverse is not permitted under law. In the long 
term, underwriters in Quebec and elsewhere will always be better 
off obtaining a federal charter, while Quebec already has 
legislation covering this. In the long term, underwriters will 
gradually switch over to federal charters, with the result that, in a 
few years, the federal government will be able to say that the 
legislation we  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9106"> 9106 </A></B>
<P>
have in Quebec covering these fields of activity is redundant, 
without purpose, and should be abolished.
<P>
	This is how the federal government has gradually taken over the 
provinces' and specifically Quebec's fields of jurisdiction. In the 
long term, the purpose of this interference is to increase Ottawa's 
powers. This has been going on for a long time. People have been 
talking about it as far back as 1867, well before my time. This is 
how they have gradually turned Canada from a confederation into a 
federation.
<P>
	The term ``confederation'' has an extremely specific meaning. 
First of all, it is the name that was given to Canada: the Canadian 
confederation. A confederation is a group of virtually autonomous 
states which decide to provide themselves with a central 
government less powerful than the sum of themselves, to pool 
certain things. That is what we are seeing in Europe. Europe will be 
a confederation.
<P>
	But, gradually, the central power has taken over certain 
jurisdictions, or taken over from some participants in this power, 
and the circumstances have gradually turned Canada into a 
federation. In other words, the central power is now greater than 
the power of the provinces, not what the Fathers of Confederation 
initially planned. This has led to the political impasse we are now 
at, going from one referendum to another, until the next one.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The goal of all of the federal government decisions is to transfer 
more and more power to Ottawa, more and more political power, 
while the economic power is being transferred, generally speaking, 
to Ontario. To refer to Gordon Gibson's famous book, <I>Plan B</I>, 
which I think my Reform friends have read, he says that the major 
problem in Canada is not Quebec, the problem is Ottawa.
<P>
	I recommend that my colleagues, who think we are the only ones 
saying this, read Gordon Gibson's famous <I>Plan B</I>, where he states 
that the federalists are the problem. The problem is Ottawa, and the 
senior public servants, the bureaucracy that exists here, which is 
perpetuated by inertia.
<P>
	I will return later to a discussion of the invasion of jurisdictions, 
but this act is one of the many we have spoken out against since 
coming to this House. I could not begin to list the laws we have 
spoken out against as invading Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, as 
gradually transferring powers that belong to Quebec to the central 
power in Ottawa.
<P>
	We know very well that being a political minority leads 
inevitably to being an economic minority. The one with power over 
the purse strings has control, and vice versa. The more power, the 
more control. Ottawa is gradually assuming all of the power by 
invading Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, and it is making the 
decisions. This bill represents a decision to invade one area of 
jurisdiction:  insurance, which belongs literally to the provinces. It 
has been decided to pass legislation to cover all insurance, whereas 
Quebec already has a set of laws governing this.
<P>
	So this is a minor decision in a 250-page piece of legislation that 
will have long term consequences for Quebec insurance 
companies.
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of minor decisions made in 
the past that have had disastrous economic consequences in the 
long term. Take for instance when they dug the St. Lawrence 
Seaway. At one point it was decided to dig the St. Lawrence 
Seaway. What have the consequences been for Quebec? Well, 
Montreal lost its basic economic infrastructure. As you know, ships 
used to stop in Montreal before the seaway was built, and all the 
plants were there. The government wanted to shift the economic 
centre to Toronto to have direct access to the core of the U.S. 
market: Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, via the Great Lakes.
<P>
	So they created the St. Lawrence Seaway, which took away 
Montreal's basic economic infrastructure, and you do not have to 
take my word for it. Mordecai Richler said as much himself in his 
book <I>Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!</I> My dear friend Mordecai tells us:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Once the St. Lawrence seaway was in place Montreal's 
slippage was inevitable''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Once the St. Lawrence Seaway was built, Montreal's decline 
started. It was inevitable. A minor decision made in Ottawa which 
had disastrous consequences for Quebec, in the long term, exactly 
like those we find in Bill C-82.
<P>
	Another example, much more recent, is the Borden line. In 1963, 
the federal government started to regulate the sale of crude oil by 
establishing the Borden line. All oil sold in Ontario had to be 
western oil, and the pipeline built from the west to Sarnia ended in 
Sarnia. At the time, the petrochemical industry was in the east end 
of Montreal, in my riding, in Montréal-Est, in Anjou. That is where 
the oil companies were. We were refining the oil.
<P>
	So what happened as a result of this minor political decision? 
The oil companies in Montreal that were refining oil had to get the 
oil in Sarnia, refine it and return it to Ontario. In the long run, the 
oil companies realized they would be better off if they transferred 
their refineries to Sarnia, got the oil locally, refined it and then 
delivered the finished product to Quebec. We lost 8,000 jobs when 
four of our six major oil companies moved out.
<P>
	A minor decision was made in Ottawa, with disastrous economic 
consequences in the long run for Quebec, like the decision we see 
in Bill C-82.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9107"> 9107 </A></B>
<P>
	What about the auto pact? The entire automobile industry was 
established in Ontario. Quebec never got any of the tens of 
thousands of jobs in that sector.
<P>
	Air transportation: more minor decisions were made in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	They decided one day to build the Mirabel airport, because 
Dorval was busy and had too much air traffic. Once the Mirabel 
airport, which cost an arm and a leg, was built, and tens of 
thousands of people were moved out of their homes, a minor 
political decision was made: the requirement that air carriers 
arriving from the east serve Montreal ahead of all other Canadian 
cities was lifted. The requirement was eliminated.
<P>
	What costs airlines the most is not flying time, but take offs and 
landings. So it is to their advantage to land in only one place to 
serve Canada, and of course they chose Toronto.
<P>
	Once Mirabel was emptied, hundreds of millions of our dollars 
were allocated to expanding Pearson airport in Toronto. Money was 
spent to empty the place, because a decision was made in Ottawa, 
just like the decisions that appear in C-82.
<P>
	What happened as the result? Ottawa could then question the use 
of having the air traffic controllers' school in Montreal, when 
Toronto was where the action was. So the school was moved to 
Toronto, and the head office of Air Canada was moved to Toronto, 
because that was where the action was. A minor decision to transfer 
things to Toronto had dreadful economic consequences.
<P>
	In the energy system, what about the billions of dollars that were 
spent? I think $12 billion was spent in all over 20 or 25 years in 
Ontario to create 40,000 jobs in atomic research, whereas Quebec 
all on its own developed the single it controls, hydro electricity. 
One quarter of the $12 billion came from Quebec and went, 
because of a government decision, to the development of atomic 
energy in Ontario, which will eventually become a competitor.
<P>
	Then there was the tobacco debate. Today in Oral Question 
Period, we saw that the federal government has been doing 
research up to now to increase levels of nicotine. I worked in the 
tobacco fields in Ontario for a number of years, and the research 
centre is in Delhi. I know this city well, because I spent some time 
there.
<P>
	They did studies for about ten years in order to increase the 
nicotine content in tobacco and then they turn around and, choking 
with emotion, make decisions in the House to show their concern 
about smoking among young people and they abolish tobacco 
company sponsorships.
<P>
	Where does most of the tobacco sponsorship occur? In Quebec. 
In two to three years, we may lose the Montreal Grand Prix, the 
Jazz Festival or the Benson &amp; Hedges  Symphony of Fire because 
of a government decision. All this is happening because the 
government has decided to pass laws and make decisions 
encroaching on our areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	All those cases are examples of small decisions with 
catastrophic consequences, the same way a small provision in Bill 
C-82 encroaches on Quebec's jurisdiction. The government is 
trying to justify this-and what an object lesson it is-by claiming 
that the transfer of insurance blocks between a company with a 
federal charter and a company with a provincial charter raises a 
problem of civil law and common law by virtue of what is called 
``novation'', an extraordinary word.
<P>
	This means that someone cannot transfer his debts to another 
person without the agreement of his creditor. In other words if I 
borrowed, for instance, $6,000 from a bank, I cannot tell the bank 
that my brother will pay my debt. Under the principle of novation, 
a bank will never accept that, and the peculiar thing is that this 
principle is being used in bill C-82 to encroach on one of Quebec's 
areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Double standards again, if that principle applies-and, as I just 
explained it largely does-a debt is not transferrable. The 
government has used this principle in a bill to encroach upon 
Quebec's areas of jurisdiction and has failed to specify that the 
same principle would apply to the transfer of Canada's debt.
<P>
	You will remember, I am sure, that the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission received three studies. One was conducted in France, 
the other in England and the other, if I am not mistaken, under the 
aegis of the C.D. Howe Institute. They all came to an extraordinary 
conclusion saying that Quebec is not legally required to take on 
part of Canada's debt if it becomes a country. These studies were 
conducted by people outside the government.
<P>
	We all remember what Ross Perot said. During the presidential 
campaign in the United States, he said: ``Poor Quebecers, you do 
not have to carry that debt''. Those are the words of Ross Perot, 
who was then in the running for the presidency of the United States. 
He did not get in, but he did say that.
<P>
	These studies tabled before the Belanger-Campeau Commission 
explained the principle of ``novation'', and they were taken up by 
English columnists across Canada. I will briefly read from one of 
those texts to show that whenever you refer to principles in a bill, 
you have to recognize that these principles apply everywhere and at 
all times. The principle is the following; I am quoting in English 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9108"> 9108 </A></B>
<P>
from a December 13, 1994 article by David Crane. As you know, 
David Crane is the financial editor of the Toronto <I>Star</I>. He said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Canada's foreign creditors would not want to transfer part of 
Canada's debt to Quebec. This is money they loaned to Canada, not 
Quebec. There is no way in the world you can go to an international 
banker and for every $100 Canadian bond get a $75 Canadian bond 
and a $25 Quebec bond. In a way that helps Quebec because it 
means that Canada would have to reach an accommodation with 
Quebec. Since Canada cannot force Quebec to take its share of the 
debt technically Quebec could walk away from its share of the 
debt''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is all. I yield the floor to my friends. However, William 
Johnson has a similar text.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, once again 
we are witnessing in this House an attempt on the part of the 
Liberal federal government to meddle in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, as my colleague from Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies so 
ably proved. He gave several examples. What is the federal 
government trying to do?
<P>
	We have every right to believe that we will have an election in 
the spring. During the last referendum, the Liberal government 
promised it would recognize distinct society. It is so distinct that as 
soon as we turn around, it tries to step into yet another area of 
provincial jurisdiction through its spending power.
<P>
	One may well wonder if the Prime Minister gets it. He knows 
full well though that when it comes to provincial powers, 
Quebecers are adamant. We would like to repatriate the powers 
Ottawa took away from us, and now he wants to interfere in areas 
that come under our jurisdiction. It is very rude on their part. If we 
are on the eve of an election, why are they doing this? They know 
full well that Quebecers are going to say: ``This time you will not 
get away with it''.
<P>
	It is supper time, young people at home are watching us; I would 
like my colleague from Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies to quickly go 
over what he explained earlier so that people really understand 
what is at stake here, the dark side of Bill C-82, and why it is so 
important for Quebecers to pay attention and remember how the 
Liberal government is intruding. People must understand this and 
let the government know what they think come election time.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to repeat the examples that clearly 
show how the Liberal government, the Prime Minister, the member 
for Shawinigan, are once again trying to pull the wool over our 
eyes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know if I should 
repeat everything I just said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Give other examples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> There is indeed no lack of examples showing 
that, every time Canada's and Quebec's interests come into 
conflict, our friends opposite, originally from Quebec, 
francophones from Quebec, are the first to come down on Quebec 
and vote in a way that serves Canada's interests at the expense of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I think that my hon. colleague can fully understand that, any time 
nationwide issues are discussed, Liberal members from Quebec, 
who are a minority in their own caucus, will eventually toe the line 
of the Canadian majority, and put Canada's interests before those 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Take for example the tobacco issue. Every single member on the 
other side, including those from Quebec, voted with the 
government, knowing full well that this legislation directly affects 
all festivals held in Montreal. They all voted with the government.
<P>
	We will recall that, when we were dealing with the raw milk 
cheese issue, in a fanciful departure from reality, the Minister of 
Health decided it was harmful to people's health, even though 
people have been eating raw milk cheese for ages and no one has 
ever died from it. All of a sudden, the minister decided that raw 
milk cheese, which just happens to be sold, made and widely sold 
in Quebec, was bad for our health and that its production should be 
discontinued. The Bloc Quebecois then had to organize a sampling 
of this ``poisoned'' cheese in this House to show the public and 
those voting on the other side that there was nothing wrong with it. 
Not one member from Quebec on the other side took a stand with 
us on this issue.
<P>
	These two recent examples show that members from Quebec 
elected under the Liberal banner inevitably stand on the side of 
Canada, for the interests of Canada, as opposed to those of Quebec.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I will remind you of the famous words of the 
Minister of Interdepartmental Affairs who, just a few months 
before the referendum, and that is why he was made a minister, said 
in Toronto-I heard him myself and could not believe my 
ears-that the best way to resolve the Quebec issue was to make 
Quebecers suffer.
<P>
	A member from Quebec, paid by Quebecers and sent here to 
look after their interests, comes here with only one idea in mind: to 
make Quebecers suffer. That is what Quebec members on the 
Liberal side are like.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to rise in the House 
today to debate Bill C-82 and to discuss its provisions and some of 
its impacts on consumers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9109"> 9109 </A></B>
<P>
	Having just listened to the previous speech in the House I will try 
to address the bill as opposed to having a diatribe about something 
that was not relevant to the bill.
<P>
	The bill is about making important progress to ensure that our 
banking regime, our financial institution regime, is more 
responsive to the needs of consumers wherever they live in Canada, 
be it in Quebec or elsewhere.
<P>
	This is part of an ongoing process undertaken by the Liberal 
government. We are trying to combine the best of our financial 
institutions. There are some positives we want to maintain as a 
society and as a government.
<P>
	Our banks are successful corporations. They are strong. They are 
world leaders in finance. They provide financial stability to the 
country, far more so than the banking industry in many other 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	Today the banks in Canada employ 500,000 people. They 
represent 3.5 per cent of the whole Canadian workforce. The 
financial services industry in Canada represents about 7.5 per cent 
of GDP. These are all important aspects of financial institutions in 
Canada and something we as a government and we as Canadians 
want to ensure continues.
<P>
	However, we need to balance that as well. We need to balance 
that with the need to ensure that these financial institutions are 
serving consumers. We need to balance that with the need to 
protect consumers who use our financial institutions from potential 
abuses. Regardless of their socio-economic status, we also need to 
ensure that consumers of all stripes have access to our financial 
institutions.
<P>
	What this bill is about is combining those two things, 
maintaining what is best in our financial institutions but also 
ensuring that we have the appropriate protection for consumers 
built into legislation.
<P>
	This is not something that is just happening today. It is 
something we have done all along. I had an opportunity, when we 
dealt with the issue of access to capital as part of the industry 
committee's examination of the banking industry, where we 
worked as a government to institute changes with the banks so that 
there would be better protection for consumers. Coming out of that 
process was some progress. We were able to put in place a number 
of tools to help our small business community to have better access 
to capital. One of the tools was ensuring that the banks would have 
to establish a code of conduct that governs how they deal with their 
small business customers.
<P>
	I would say to all of those small business men and women who 
may be watching today, when they are talking to their account 
manager at their local branch they should ask for that code of 
conduct. It sets out the  rules on how the banks are going to deal 
with their accounts.
<P>
	A second tool that was put into place was an alternative dispute 
resolution system. If someone is not pleased with the process that is 
taking place with their account manager there is a mediation 
process available at their banks and they should ask to use it.
<P>
	As a third tool, all the financial institutions, the banking 
institutions anyway, have an ombudsman in their operation to 
whom the consumer can appeal his or her problem if they are not 
pleased with the decision of the account manager. The banks have 
come together now and have an industry-wide ombudsmen 
consumers can appeal to if they are not satisfied with what is 
happening in the institution.
<P>
	The fifth tool that we have been able to put in place is the 
requirement that the banks provide to the government and to the 
people of Canada quarterly statistics on their small business 
lending. In fact, I believe it is close to 19,000 different stats that are 
provided each quarter on small business lending.
<P>
	Some of these tools that we were able to develop through the 
industry committee and working with the financial institutions are 
finding their way into the legislation that we are debating in front 
of the House today. The code of conduct is one where the rules have 
to be set out up front and in writing so that the consumer 
understands exactly what the rules are and that the institutions 
understand exactly what the rules are that they are going to play by.
<P>
	We see those types of tools coming out in the privacy code that is 
being suggested in this piece of legislation. We are seeing, in the 
whole issue of tied selling, that there will be a code of conduct that 
outlines what is and what is not permissible, that it is public and 
that the consumer knows in advance.
<P>
	We also see the use of the ombudsmen in this piece of legislation 
where if the consumer is not satisfied on the issue surrounding tied 
selling, that the institution is following its code of conduct, then the 
consumer should appeal it to the ombudsman.
<P>
	The third tool that we see coming out in this piece of legislation 
as well is the whole issue of reporting. The financial institutions 
will have to report the number and nature of the complaints they 
are receiving on the issue of privacy and on tied selling so that 
there can be public accountability of what they are doing.
<P>
	It has been mentioned by a number of speakers in the House that 
this bill is fairly technical in nature in the changes that it is 
proposing. However, there really is some important application to 
what everyone will actually see in dealing with their financial 
institutions.

<P>
	First is the whole issue of privacy and privacy protection. Most 
consumers who deal with financial institutions are concerned when 
they see the array of computers and the massive amount of 
information that banks have on individuals. They are rightly 
concerned that the information is going to be maintained in a 
confidential nature. None of us would like that type of information 
to be exchanged with phone marketers or whoever else it might be 
given to.
<P>
	This bill calls on the financial institutions to develop a public 
code of conduct as to how they will deal with privacy issues. It 
calls on them to publish that code. It calls on the financial 
institutions to establish a method by which consumers can 
complain and put forward their concerns that the privacy code is 
not being maintained and to make those types of complaints and 
concerns public. That is positive. Consumers want to see their 
privacy protected.
<P>
	Another issue that is being addressed in the review of the 
banking and financial services industry is disclosing the cost of 
credit. Over the years Parliament has moved and financial 
institutions have moved on the need to disclose the cost of credit. 
That is very important to someone who is obtaining a loan or a 
lease, although I believe more work has to be done in terms of 
disclosure. The consumer needs to know what will be the actual 
cost.
<P>
	Although we have had disclosure laws for some time, this will 
make those disclosure laws more uniform so that a consumer can 
make an informed comparison between the disclosure of one 
company and the disclosure of another company, or between one 
industry and another. That is something which is being taken on 
with this review and it is positive.
<P>
	Then there is the whole issue of tied selling. That is of real 
concern to consumers. All of us would agree that it would be 
inappropriate if somebody from a financial institution said to 
someone ``I will approve this loan only if you buy something else 
from me''. That is the type of tied selling which we do not want to 
see. It is different from cross selling and up selling, which is quite 
appropriate and a normal business function. However, we do not 
want to have tied selling.
<P>
	That is why I am pleased to see that this legislation contains an 
amendment to the Bank Act which would prohibit tied selling if the 
self-regulation that I talked about a little earlier was not enough, 
that being the development of a published policy, a public 
complaints procedure, an appeal mechanism to an ombudsman and 
a reporting by the ombudsman on what he or she believes are 
infractions. If we find that is not going to be enough, if we find that 
is not going to ensure that this practice does not become 
widespread, then there is some legislative fallback position that we 
are able to provide ourselves.
<P>
	This legislation will lead to an entry policy review, which the 
minister has committed to completing in this calendar year. We 
will take a look at streamlining the procedures by which foreign 
banks can operate in Canada. Most of us would see that as being 
positive. If we can increase the amount of competition in the 
financial services industry in this country, most people believe that 
will lead to improved service, improved access to capital and a 
whole range of good things that will come through increased 
competition. Most people in Canada would see that as being 
positive. I am pleased to see that the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions is proceeding with that review 
and will complete it in fairly short order.
<P>
	There are a couple of things the minister was able to announce 
which came out of the review he has been undertaking and the 
discussion paper which he put forward some months ago. One of 
them has to do with the access to basic financial services.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	I think there are a lot of consumers who have been frustrated in 
dealing with their local financial institution when they try to cash a 
cheque and do not happen to be at their own institution or they try 
to deposit a cheque and then find out that the funds will be held and 
they cannot get access to the funds for a week or two. Perhaps they 
are trying to open an account and for some reason there are 
arbitrary rules in the institution and they will not be allowed to 
open an account.
<P>
	Often it is low income Canadians or those who are not in the 
workforce who have great difficulty accessing these financial 
institutions. It is not appropriate. There should be equal access to 
financial institutions.
<P>
	I was pleased to see as part of the discussion paper and in 
discussions with the financial services community that a number of 
standards have been put forward and the institutions have agreed to 
work toward and implement within their branches things like 
lessening the identification requirements, explaining clearly 
whether a hold funds will be placed on the individual's account, 
eliminating employment as a condition of opening an account, 
ensuring that there is no minimum deposit requirement in order to 
open an account, training of staff to be more sensitive when dealing 
with consumers who might be opening a small account. I think 
these a positive things that needed to be worked out and I am 
pleased to see that has been done.
<P>
	As part of the discussion paper some important work has been 
done which has been discussed in the House, the need for the banks 
and other financial institutions to proactively advertise their low 
cost services. We heard that in the discussion on credit cards where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9111"> 9111 </A></B>
<P>
many institutions have low cost credit cards. When it is pointed out 
some would say they did not even know that existed.
<P>
	I was pleased to see that in response to the discussion paper the 
financial institutions have made a commitment to proactively 
advertise their low cost services. I look forward to seeing that 
implemented and the changes taking place.
<P>
	In conclusion let me say that with the legislation the government 
is moving along the road to find a balance between keeping those 
things about our financial services industry that are strong and 
helpful to the country and to the citizens of our country. We want to 
make sure that financial stability is maintained and that 
employment opportunities that are presented by financial 
institutions are maintained.
<P>
	We also want to make sure it is done in a way which will protect 
individual consumers and will give consumers the right to access 
those services.
<P>
	This has been an ongoing process by the government over the 
last three and a half years and progress is being made. I am sure the 
task force which was struck to look at future changes and at our 
financial services sector going into the 21st century will continue. I 
look forward to its findings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my 
colleague, John Chant, for having been named the director of 
research for the task force on financial services which was 
appointed in response to Bill C-82 and some of the difficulties that 
were raised in that context.
<P>
	Professor Chan is a trained economist who was for a long time 
the chairman of the department of economics at Simon Fraser 
University. I have spent many hours with him in seminars, tenure 
committees and various other official functions. I am very pleased 
that the government has appointed him to this position.
<P>
	As a result of my acquaintance with him, I am sure that the 
report which will come out will be superb. All the research papers 
will be of the highest quality. What the government does with it is 
another question.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The white paper on financial services was tabled in June 1996. 
The first draft of Bill C-82 was discussed in the finance committee. 
We heard from many witnesses. My special interest was on the 
restraints to be put on foreign banks because I had written and done 
research in that field. It was of great interest to me to see what 
innovation would take place.
<P>
	There is a lot of scepticism about what committee hearings do, 
whether or not they are a waste of time, and in the end the 
government does what it wants to do anyway.
<P>
	After this experience I must say I am very encouraged. At the 
same time I am also somewhat concerned about how it was 
possible the white paper of June 1996 could  do what it did. What 
did this paper do? What did we find out was wrong in Bill C-82 
with respect to foreign banks?
<P>
	It turns out that foreign banks in Canada are now required to 
operate at all times as subsidiaries of their foreign parents. That 
imposes a huge cost on the operation of foreign banks in Canada. It 
has prevented the establishment of a lot of banks. In recent years it 
has driven out a large number of them. The owner is required to 
have capital of at least $10 million, to have a board of directors, 
and to issue every six months very large and onerous reports.
<P>
	We were told in the finance committee hearings that this was a 
serious detriment to the expansion of further foreign competition in 
the country, which almost everybody agrees would be to the benefit 
of consumers.
<P>
	That is not all. I was even more disturbed when I heard witnesses 
telling us that they had been providing services of extreme 
importance to Canadians. For example, a company told us that it 
was about to introduce a new credit card system under which it 
would be possible to charge an interest rate of about half the current 
normal charge under bank cards issued at the moment.
<P>
	The company has developed a computer program which allows it 
to investigate the credit worthiness of large blocks of people. As a 
result of that and the experience of operating in the United States, it 
is able to break even and make a normal profit on a much lower 
interest rate. It would be a great innovation if such a system were 
introduced in Canada. It would put downward pressures on all 
interest charges on credit cards. At any rate if Canadians do not 
want it they do not have to go to that company.
<P>
	Bill C-82 suggested in its first draft that the company wanting to 
introduce the new credit card would have to incorporate itself, 
spend $10 million on a capital base, have a board of directors and 
have all kinds of onerous reporting requirements.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Similarly there has been a company in Canada for many years 
specifically aimed at making loans to people who have been turned 
down by conventional banks, people who cannot get credit 
anywhere. This is often the last recourse for certain borrowers.
<P>
	The company happens to be owned by an American company. 
The first draft of Bill C-82 suggested that this organization would 
have to incorporate with a minimum of $10 million. We were told 
that if the company had been forced into doing that it would simply 
have left Canada, to the detriment of the Canadian public.
<P>
	I find very disturbing how these ideas got into the first draft of 
Bill C-82. I asked very pointed questions of the witnesses, 
especially people, namely the representatives of the big banks who 
argued that those rules were in the interest of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9112"> 9112 </A></B>
<P>
	The answers received from the representatives of the big banks 
were not very good. They did not look very good when they tried to 
answer my questions in a rhetorical fashion without going into 
details on why it was taking place.
<P>
	While there is this disturbing aspect about how this could have 
been put into the bill in the first place, it raises questions about the 
power of banks and their influence.
<P>
	The people of Canada should feel confident that the second 
reading of the bill has eliminated this onerous requirement for 
foreign bank subsidiaries. Now they can operate as branches. Those 
companies that provide a limited range of financial services even if 
they are owned by a foreign banks will not have to incorporate.
<P>
	This is a great victory for the parliamentary system and the 
functioning of the finance committee. To anybody wishing to read 
the blues or the reports of the finance committee on what went on I 
will take a little credit for complaining about how bad this part of 
the bill was. It was removed in 18 months.
<P>
	The task force will report. I hope and trust, knowing John Chant 
and knowing the quality of the people on the task force, we will get 
more competition from foreign banks or from other financial 
intermediaries. That is the only way to make sure there is no 
concentration of power in the banks or in the financial system.
<P>
	This ends my discussion of Bill C-82. I welcome the changes. 
However I would now like to turn to an issue raised by John Geddes 
in <I>The Financial Post</I> last weekend. The story has the potential of 
hurting the credibility of the government on an issue on which it 
invested a great deal of credibility going into the next election.
<P>
	When the 1997 budget document came out there were tables, 
summaries of transactions, what money was coming into the 
government over the next two years, what was going out and where 
it was being spent.
<P>
	In 1995-96 in that same document there were tables outlining the 
size of departmental spending. It was broken down separately. 
These numbers are almost impossible to obtain except if one goes 
through the onerous job of looking at the estimates.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	In the past departmental spending in 1993, 1994 and 1995 was 
always there. There was a lot of bragging in the document of two 
years ago about how the program review undertaken by the head of 
the Treasury Board would reduce departmental spending from $51 
billion to $42 billion or by 19 per cent. I wondered why that was 
not there this year.
<P>
	In previous documents the yearly target for each department was 
clearly outlined. The yearly obligated spending cuts in the 
departments of defence, transport, native affairs, natural resources, 
heritage and culture were outlined, but for this year they were not 
there. I did not think through why the information was not there. I 
asked someone who said it just was not done this year.
<P>
	This week the Senate finance committee is holding a hearing in 
which it will ask the government precisely what happened and why. 
The government is supposed to be cutting 19 per cent of 
departmental spending and is not on target. It is way off target at 
only 9 per cent. Less than half the proposed cuts have been 
undertaken.
<P>
	The article goes on to discuss how the people in the Treasury 
Board are trying to spin this scandal. The scandal is not just that 
they did not meet the target. In the eyes of the Liberals there was a 
certain fairness in the way in which they distributed the burden of 
fiscal restraint. They claimed they would download a certain 
percentage on the provinces because everybody has to share 24 per 
cent. They said that was okay because they cut their program 
spending by 19 per cent. They did not and they will not. Let us see 
how they will fix it up over the next two years. If they do not fix it 
in this year's budget, when will they do it?
<P>
	I remind the people of Canada that the government came in with 
a deficit of $42 billion. By 1998-99 there will still be a $6 billion 
deficit, which means that the Liberals have projected to eliminate 
$36 billion from the deficit. I ask viewers to test themselves as they 
listen to this debate. What percentage of the $36 billion total came 
from cuts to government spending? I have what is alleged to be $9 
billion from departmental spending. Now we find out that is not 
true. Instead of $9 billion it will only be $4 billion.
<P>
	How did government members break the back of the fiscal 
crisis? It was by increased revenue. They say that it was the gross 
dividend but nevertheless it is higher taxes. Some $28 billion worth 
of higher taxes is the main instrument used by the government to 
eliminate the deficit. It was supposed to have cut $9 billion in 
departmental spending. Now it turns out the government is way off 
target by $4 billion.
<P>
	Let us look at that in the context of what the government asked 
the provinces to absorb. It has reduced transfers to the provinces by 
$7.5 billion. The government was supposed to have cut its 
departmental spending by now and it is not even delivering on this. 
I believe this is really a major scandal. This raises major questions 
about the ability, the seriousness and the integrity of the 
government on its highly touted fiscal plans.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It is true that the Minister of Finance has set hurdles about one 
inch high, jumped over them, cleared them by a large margin and 
then bragged that he is hitting his targets, that he is doing better 
than his targets. I must congratulate him on the ability of his spin 
doctors to so  fool the people of Canada into thinking that he is 
doing the right thing, that all of the attention in the aftermath of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9113"> 9113 </A></B>
<P>
budget release was focused on hitting the targets, exceeding the 
targets.
<P>
	That to a very large extent was due to circumstances over which 
the minister had no control. One of them was lower interest rates. 
We know there were lower interest rates, not just in Canada but 
throughout the world. It was the world interest rates which came 
down.
<P>
	I am prepared to admit that there were also some reductions in 
the gap between the U.S. and Canadian interest rates which should 
be attributed to the deficit reduction progress made. I do not deny 
this. Nevertheless, the attention on this low barrier that the minister 
set for himself, and was exceeded and was very easily exceeded, 
was due, first, to the lower interest rates created outside of Canada. 
Second, it was created by economic growth which resulted in 
bracket creep and higher tax take. That is how the government 
came to the position of being able to brag as it did.
<P>
	Because of this excellent, superb spin doctoring by the minister 
and his department, nobody noticed until the Senate finally got 
around to it that the government is away off target on the spending 
for which it is directly responsible, namely what is known as 
departmental spending. It is supposed to be $9 billion when it is 
only $4 billion. I say shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I find myself in the rather 
awkward position of thinking that we had heard the last from the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound last week and standing up to 
thank him on that occasion for his even-handedness in giving credit 
where credit is due. Now to my great chagrin I see that he will not 
stay dead and I am going to have to put a stake through his heart 
once more.
<P>
	I did mean what I said last week about him doing politics a little 
differently but today his colleagues seem to have got to him. I think 
he has been a little unfair in his comments today.
<P>
	There are two targets that matter, the targets for reducing the 
deficit and reducing overall program spending. We are on target for 
both. In fact, we are doing better than we projected for both. There 
has been no increase in program spending as today's article that the 
hon. member referred to claims.
<P>
	Projected program spending would amount to $106 billion in 
1997-98 and $105 billion in 1998-99. With program review the 
1997 budget forecast program spending was revised downwards, as 
the member knows. As with our deficit reduction targets we are 
ahead of our original projections.
<P>
	I will use this time to say that. It is in the nature of a comment 
because I care not to ask him a question.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, this is spin doctoring at its best. 
However, as I have great respect for the hon. member, I do not 
think this is the cause of his problem.
<P>
	There is a difference between program spending and 
departmental spending. I am not talking about program spending. 
Sure, the downloading went ahead as expected. The problem I have 
is with something that is called departmental spending which is 
part of program spending.
<P>
	Since this was not stated in the budget, I can only rely on the 
graph that has been provided here. For example, government 
services were supposed to have gone from about $6 billion to $4 
billion in the 1997-98 fiscal year. Where is it? It is still at $6 
billion. This goes on and on. The only department that hit its target 
is the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I would be happy to learn from the hon. parliamentary secretary 
if he has in his briefing notes a page dealing with this issue. His 
comments concerned program spending, which I have no problem 
with. However, the issue that is being discussed this week in the 
Senate committee deals with departmental spending. I would love 
to hear why this article is wrong. I would love to be able to tell my 
people in the next election that the government is really on track 
but these numbers suggest it is not. I wonder what went wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
always listen with great interest when the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound takes the time to make a speech. I 
especially listen when he goes off any written text because I find 
then he gives us the benefit of what he is really thinking and it 
comes out a lot clearer.
<P>
	I would like to get something straight. I have never read that 
newspaper article to which he referred. I do not have a clue what he 
is talking about.
<P>
	Therefore, as an individual MP sitting here, I am hearing for the 
first time that the government is behind in its departmental 
spending cuts. It has not made the size or kind of cuts in 
departmental spending that it had projected it would when it 
bragged about how it was going to eliminate the deficit. It did that 
by downloading 25 per cent or 29 per cent on to the provinces. The 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound told me that we also had to get 
our spending under control. We are all going to share this equally.
<P>
	What the member just said is that the government indicated it 
would cut departmental spending by 19 per cent, which means $9 
billion. It has not done that. Nor does it appear that it is going to be 
able to achieve that. I just want to get this perfectly straight and 
clear because I know this member does not say things just to win 
political brownie points like members on the opposite side do. He 
does not take cheap, political, partisan shots like members on the 
other side do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9114"> 9114 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Like you do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Like I do sometimes. However, he does think things 
through. I would like to know, as a taxpayer, will the government 
be able to achieve what the master of myth, the finance minister, 
set out in budgets? Where is the government on its $9 billion in 
spending cuts by departments now? Has it cut anything at all? How 
much has it cut? What is there left to cut? How much time does he 
have to get there?
<P>
	Over a four year period has the government pulled the wool over 
Canadians' eyes? Has the master of myth led the Canadian 
taxpayer astray again by not coming clean on where we are on 
departmental spending?
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, if I may read from an article from 
the <I>Financial Post</I>, dated March 15-17, authored by John Geddes, 
it states that according to figures published last month by Treasury 
Board, with the government's main spending estimates: ``The 
government projects that its departments will spend about $50 
billion in fiscal 1997-98 beginning April 1, compared with the 
target of just under $42 billion set out in Martin's landmark 1995 
budget''. This budget said the spending cut would be 19 per cent. In 
fact, it will be only 9 per cent. This is a true scandal.
<P>
	The only department which has met its 1995 target is the defence 
department. Even the department headed by one of the most 
effective managers in the government, namely the department of 
transport, has fallen by a steep 38 per cent, but that still does not 
equal the 51 per cent cut which was targeted in 1995.
<P>
	I urge anyone who is interested in this to have a look at this table. 
It raises serious questions about the integrity of the government. It 
keeps on talking about how far it has exceeded that one-inch target 
it set for itself. What really counts is smaller government. What 
really counts is doing what is right but is politically hard, namely to 
undertake the cuts in departmental spending.
<P>
	Why has that not taken place? What is going on? How much 
more is missing from the 1997 budget as we go into an election?
<P>
	I hope that the other House in its committee work will make sure 
that if there are other skeletons in this closet they will be dug out 
and the government will be held accountable for not carrying 
through with the grandiose plans it had. We will not be diverted by 
spin doctors from what is going on in government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his answer. I 
guess what he is really saying is that over the last four years the 
government has cut $7.5 billion in transfers to the provinces and 
only $1 billion of departmental spending and that the reduction in 
the deficit has come from increased taxes. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, that is correct. If I may repeat 
those numbers, of the $36 billion improvement, $28 billion came 
from increased taxes through bracket creep.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it has 
been interesting listening to the debate on Bill C-82. We have had 
the government interpretation and we have had the Reform 
interpretation. We have not heard a lot of interpretation by the 
Bloc.
<P>
	I thought that it might be of value to read into the record a totally 
independent interpretation written by the law firm of Gowling, 
Strathy &amp; Henderson in Ottawa. It is entitled ``Financial 
Institutions Legislation and Foreign Branch Banking''. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In mid February the Secretary of State for Finance-tabled legislation to 
strengthen consumer protection, ease the regulatory burden on financial institutions, 
and ``fine tune'' certain provisions in the financial institutions statutes. Bill C-82, an 
act to amend certain laws relating to financial institutions, responds to proposals set 
out in the June 1996 consultation paper, the 1997 Review of Financial Sector 
Legislation: Proposals for Changes, and to comments received during the 
consultative hearings. The legislation establishes March 31, 2002, as the new 
``sunset'' provision for all federally regulated financial institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government has given itself expanded authority to make regulations 
governing privacy and enhanced cost-of-credit disclosure. The Bill also introduces 
tied-selling safeguards, and provisions to improve dissemination of information 
about fees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To update and fine tune financial institutions regulation, banks that do not take 
retail deposits will be allowed to opt out of the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation coverage, more flexibility will be provided to financial institutions 
seeking to enter into joint venture arrangements and access to capital for mutual 
insurance companies will be enhanced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Changes to the provisions governing the operations of the foreign banks in 
Canada include: ``near banks'' (entities which do not generally take deposits and are 
not regulated as banks in their home jurisdiction but do provide one or more banking 
type services) which have received approval under the Bank Act to enter the 
Canadian market will no longer need to seek further approvals, provided their 
unregulated activities do not include taking deposits;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Removing the requirement for regulated foreign banks owning Schedule II banks 
to own their own financial institution subsidiaries through the Schedule II bank; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Permitting near banks to own non-bank financial institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Peters also announced that separate legislation will be made public before the 
end of the year to allow foreign banks to branch directly into Canada. The easing of 
foreign bank entry was a priority recommendation contained in separate reports 
released last fall by the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce and the 
House of Commons Committee on Finance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government's decision to act in this area prior to receipt of the report of the 
Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector was ``noted'' in 
the Finance Minister's February 18 budget when he stated: ``the increased 
competition this [foreign branch banking] should produce will increase the 
financing options-that is, the increased access to capital required by small- and 
medium-sized Canadian businesses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9115"> 9115 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Before I go on to conclude this analysis by the law firm I might 
say that any action that the government, indeed any government, 
can take which will increase access to capital required by small and 
medium sized Canadian business surely must be a positive activity. 
What is stopping so many operations in Canada from being able to 
survive, let along thrive, is a lack of access to capital. If in the 
judgment of our industry critic this bill turns out to be a tool that 
will work in that direction, then if for only that reason I would be 
inclined to support it.
<P>
	Carrying on with this analysis:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The main characteristics of the new branching regime would be as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Foreign bank branches would not be allowed to take retail deposits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ability to operate branches would generally apply to foreign banks with at 
least $25 billion in assets on a world-wide basis, a limit that would permit most 
foreign banks operating in Canada as subsidiaries to operate as branches.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Superintendent would have the power to require the maintenance of assets in 
Canada with an unrelated approved financial institution to cover liabilities of the 
branches.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A capital equivalency deposit of at least 5% of branch liabilities would have to be 
maintained at all times with a recognized financial institution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The foreign bank would have to be regulated on a consolidated basis in its home 
jurisdiction in line with internationally recognized regulatory standards acceptable to 
the Superintendent, with appropriate co-operative regulatory arrangements in place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Branches would be subject to appropriate Canadian reporting, auditing and 
taxation requirements. In cases of branch liquidation all assets in Canada of the 
foreign bank could be seized to satisfy the obligations of the Canadian branches.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government will also review all other aspects of foreign bank entry policy. 
Pending completion of this review, foreign companies offering a limited range of 
financial services which now operate unregulated in Canada as well as new entrants 
that meet certain criteria, (i.e., non-deposit taking with a $200 million ceiling on the 
assets of Canadian operations) will be allowed to carry on their activities without 
being regulated, but will be required to disclose to creditors and customers that it is 
not regulated as a financial institution in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A final decision on the status of those unregulated foreign companies now 
operating in Canada and of those intending to set up operations during the interim 
period, will be taken once the branching regime and review of the foreign bank entry 
policies have been completed. It is expected that once the banking regime is in place 
a number of these companies will convert their Canadian activities to branch 
operations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	I wanted to put on the record an independent analysis or 
evaluation of what is a very technical bill. I recognize that not 
infrequently members end up in some fairly partisan sparring, and 
various things are said sometimes in jest and sometimes in the heat 
of the moment.  However, with us having the unfortunate title of 
politician, sometimes we act like politicians.
<P>
	The bill is probably one in which each of us would do well to rise 
above the normal partisan discussion which is going back and forth 
because it is so key to what ends up impacting Canadians in every 
day of their lives.
<P>
	As I understand it from a summary that has been given to me by 
our industry critic, the bill will provide that more detailed 
information will be available to the consumer regarding cost of 
credit disclosure.
<P>
	I recall that very frequently, almost on an annual basis, there is 
discussion in the public domain about the cost of credit cards of 
banks as well as credit cards of the financial institutions. I note that 
in the current Eaton's difficulty that the credit card section of the 
Eaton's empire is one of the strongest assets it has. It is reported to 
be a part of the corporation that does not require support and ends 
up contributing to the bottom line of the Eaton's group.
<P>
	We also note that most of the banks issue credit cards with 18, 20 
and 24 per cent interest rates on an outstanding balance. While 
Canadian consumers have a personal responsibility for what they 
do and must not always be looking to the government to be 
protected, on the other side of the coin there is a clear 
understanding that the Canadian consumer who has a piece of 
plastic, a credit card by which he or she can access all sorts of 
goods and services, has a responsibility in the way that credit card 
is used.
<P>
	Clearly, as the credit card balance goes up and particularly where 
there is a very high interest rate, it is important that there be 
detailed information available to the consumer so that he or she 
may understand what the cost of constantly carrying a balance will 
be. I wonder how many Canadians are really aware if they have a 
$2,000, $3,000 or $5,000 balance on their credit card, that as long 
as they leave it on their credit card, just how much more interest 
they will actually end up paying for the use of that money? It is the 
equivalent of a very high cost loan.
<P>
	A second part of Bill C-82 requires a simplified and improved 
dissemination of information to consumers about basic financial 
services, low cost options and fees on products and services.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	It works to the the advantage of some of us to pay a $25 monthly 
fee or whatever the fee is where everything is rolled in whether it is 
inclusive of a safety deposit box, perhaps a credit card with no 
further fee, perhaps overdraft protection that is available on the 
side that simply needs to be activated. But all of these financial 
services end up costing money.
<P>
	In a lot of instances when people started to use their bank card, 
they were drawn into the practice of using that card on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9116"> 9116 </A></B>
<P>
assumption that their transaction was not going to cost them 
money. Indeed, some banks actually did that.
<P>
	I applaud what the government is bringing forward where there 
is a simplified and improved dissemination of information to 
consumers about what the services are and what the costs are.
<P>
	Allowing non-deposit taking institutions to opt out of the Canada 
Deposit Insurance Corporation and loosen subsidiary requirements 
makes sense. This becomes a user pay kind of a situation of which 
the Reform Party is completely in favour. We believe that people 
who are making use of any service, whatever the service may be, it 
is their responsibility to make sure that the service is properly and 
adequately funded.
<P>
	If non-deposit taking institutions are required to pay into the 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation the danger is much the 
same as the danger that we have realized with both the 
Conservatives and now the Liberals leaving people with no option. 
Both have told people that they have to pay into the unemployment 
insurance fund, for example. Where there is a mandatory 
requirement, where there is a sucking in of money we can count on 
the fact that there is a government somewhere in the background.
<P>
	In this instance the fact that the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation will permit non-deposit taking institutions to opt out is 
only fair, right and proper.
<P>
	It introduces regulations to allow financial institutions to enter 
into joint venture arrangements and proposes changes that permit 
mutual insurance companies to issue participating shares. This gets 
into a slightly trickery area in my judgment.
<P>
	On the surface it appears to be a very sound move. Not 
infrequently people will end up in a business situation where they 
require someone, some corporation, some financial body, some 
venture capital. That venture capital has to come from an 
organization with very deep pockets. Quite frankly, I cannot think 
of a better description of banks than an institution with deep 
pockets.
<P>
	It would allow the bank entering into joint venture arrangements 
for that bank to be able to get into the boardroom, into the decision 
making process should it so choose if the venture is going off track. 
One of the difficulties in my constituency, and I suspect with a lot 
of businesses all over Canada, is that when they enter into an 
arrangement with the bank, almost invariably the bank ends up 
making sure that it is triple secured for any of the money that it 
actually extends in the form of a loan.
<P>
	When it is triple secured it ends up falling back on a feeling of 
comfort. Perhaps they do not have to look over the shoulder of the 
entrepreneur to the same extent. Not looking over the shoulder of 
the entrepreneur in itself  ends up creating some difficulty or some 
problem. More often than not, the financial institution, the venture 
capitalist, having a vested interest, will be able to foresee 
difficulties.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I note that you are giving me the high sign. I 
will sit down. I know that the House will just be waiting with bated 
breath for me to continue my intervention the next time this topic 
comes up.

Motion No. 13 agreed to.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 24. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 24 obviates the necessity of putting the question on 
Motion No. 25. A negative vote on Motion No. 24 necessitates the 
question being put on Motion No. 25.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the 
House would agree I would propose that you seek unanimous 
consent that members who voted on the previous motion be 
recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House.
<P>
	At this time I would draw your attention to deleting the name of 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Otherwise Liberal members will be 
voting nay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, the official 
opposition will be voting nay.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
you have such a good memory that you probably remember that, 
last Tuesday, I put a question to the Minister of Agriculture. I was 
not very pleased with the answer, that goes without saying. That is 
why I want to take advantage of these Adjournment Proceedings to 
revive the debate; I am ready to listen to the answer of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, who is 
currently in Japan to promote Canadian exports.
<P>
	My question is quite simple. Pursuant to the agreement we 
signed three years ago with GATT, now known as the WTO, the 118 
signatory states agreed to reduce direct farm subsidies in their own 
countries.
<P>
	Canada is preaching by example. Of course, it is benefiting from 
all this since it is saving money on the backs of farmers, who will, 
of course, pass on higher prices to all consumers.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. Here, in Canada, over a three year 
period, the government has, under the helm of the Minister of 
Finance, reduced direct farm subsidies by 21 per cent, or more than 
one fifth, compared to 23 per cent for our neighbours south of the 
border.
<P>
	Some members will say: ``Yes, but Jean-Guy, that is 2 per cent 
more''. Yes, I agree, but these cuts are being implemented over 
seven years instead of three, which is more than twice as long. All 
things considered, the cuts in Canada are more than twice what 
they are in the United States. Our farmers are directly affected.
<P>
	The most striking example is without any doubt the total 
elimination of subsidies to industrial milk producers over the next 
five years.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	To keep their income at the level it was two years ago, farmers 
must raise the selling price of industrial milk. And you know as 
well as I do that each time the price of butter goes up, consumption 
goes down.
<P>
	We are in a dilemma and our milk producers are able to increase 
dairy production by 5 to 10 per cent fairly easily. But if we raise the 
price, we will have to reduce the quotas. Thus, we are in a catch 22 
situation with this government.
<P>
	For example, the Western Grain Transportation Act was 
suddenly abolished in the West. That meant $860 million each year. 
Sure, since that was in western Canada, this good government of 
ours gave almost $3 billion as a bonus to farmers, while there was 
no bonus to the dairy producers when their grant was cut; there is a 
double standard.
<P>
	Moreover, the Federation of Dairy Producers of Canada formally 
asked the agriculture minister to postpone until February 1, 1998 
the next 15 per cent cut in the grant to industrial milk producers, 
which is to take effect on August 1, 1997. It is only a matter of six 
months. We are waiting for an answer and if you consult the 
calendar, you will see that there will be an election in June. I 
suspect our good Minister of Agriculture will make his 
announcement during the next election campaign, which I for one 
would find quite dishonest on his part.
<P>
	We are only four months away from August 1, and I wish the 
agriculture minister would make that announcement, which would 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9131"> 9131 </A></B>
<P>
be most reassuring for our dairy producers, since, according to 
reports, the income  of Quebec dairy producers has fallen every 
year because of these famous cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
government is eliminating dairy subsidy gradually at the dairy 
industry's request so as to avoid any disruptions.
<P>
	The dairy industry is continually improving its efficiency and 
competitiveness so consumers can expect that dairy products will 
continue to represent good value in the future as they have in the 
past.
<P>
	The Canadian Dairy Commission has been instrumental through 
its pricing policies in maintaining fair returns for efficient dairy 
producers and ensuring a continuous supply of high quality dairy 
products for consumers are affordable prices. I am confident that 
the dairy sector will be able to adapt to the changes in the subsidy 
that remain to be implemented because they will be gradual and 
foreseeable.
<P>
	Comparing support for agriculture between countries is best 
done by looking at producer subsidy equivalents, PSE. The PSE 
measures how much farm revenue results from policy transfers 
counting both expenditures by government and support created by 
market regulations. The PSEs are estimated consistently for all 
OECD countries.
<P>
	In 1996 the PSE for Canada for all agriculture was 22 per cent 
and for the dairy sector it was 57 per cent. In the United States the 
PSE for all agricultural products was considerably lower at 16 per 
cent and for the U.S. dairy sector it was lower also at 48 per cent.
<P>
	Expenditures for agriculture overall in Canada are expected to 
decline over the next few years. Spending on income support 
especially for subsectors other than dairy, poultry and eggs is 
declining, but the spending is also being shifted from passive price 
or income support toward the development of transitional 
assistance. In the United States spending is targeted less on 
adjustment and more on plain income transfers.
<P>
	The Canadian government's resolve to cut back on spending 
overall, not only in agriculture, has helped to create an economic 
environment that is conducive to investment and development. 
Interest rates are lower in Canada than in the U.S. Agriculture 
benefits for Canada are very positive.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, some 
weeks ago I asked a question in the House to which the minister of 
agriculture chose to respond. It had to do with the establishment of 
branch lines after the change in the Transportation Act that 
occurred in the House the  last year. The protection of branch lines 
which was intended to last until the end of 1999 simply 
disappeared.
<P>
	As a result we have seen at least the CNR post its list of branch 
lines that will be abandoned. That list is becoming very instructive 
for communities looking to see what will happen to them if they are 
living on branch lines.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make with the government was that we 
are finding time after time the railways have announced that they 
will no longer maintain or provide service to branch lines. When 
community groups or others investigate to see whether or not they 
should buy them, they find the railway has already achieved an 
agreement with the elevator companies along the lines to agree 
they will not sell to anybody attempting to use the elevators and 
purchase them later.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make with the minister of agriculture 
because he represents a seat on the prairies was that the envisioned 
creation of a whole bunch of short lines will not happen.
<P>
	We have several actual examples. One is in my riding. It is light 
rail. A short line could exist if they moved traffic out slowly and 
they are willing to set up a short line. There is a large alfalfa 
dehydrating plant at the end of that short line which provides quite 
a lot of tonnage. To make the short line efficient and effective 
economically they will also have to continue to haul the grain 
gathered on those lines.
<P>
	The two companies that have elevators at three or four points 
along that line decided to build inland terminals 30 or 40 miles 
away. They do not want their own gathering outlets competing 
against the capacity of those inland terminals. They have an 
agreement which seems to be held by the railway that the line can 
only be purchased by someone who refuses to move grain on the 
line. That makes it uneconomical for the community short line to 
exist.
<P>
	The minister being a political person decided to make some 
politics with his answer. He decided to ignore the question 
completely and say that if there were no short lines in 
Saskatchewan it would be because of the provincial law.
<P>
	If he had listened at the short line conference he and I were in 
attendance at, he would have heard existing short line operators 
point out that it was not a problem for them at all. They could 
simply constitute themselves first off as a Canadian corporation 
and use Canadian successor right laws. In fact the operators already 
in existence say Saskatchewan successor right laws are not an 
impediment whatsoever. Their real problem is having the elevator 
companies stay in existence along those lines.
<P>
	We are back to the situation we had 100 years ago before we 
started regulating rail lines and elevator companies, where the 
elevator companies and the railroads simply have farmers at their 
mercy.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, by 
streamlining and shortening the current process for rail line 
rationalization the Canadian Transportation Act will encourage the 
conversion of underutilized rail lines to short line railroads as 
opposed to their abandonment.
<P>
	The main line railways are required to make available a 
three-year plan showing which lines they intend to keep and which 
they intend to sell, lease or discontinue.
<P>
	Once the railways have advertised their intention to divest 
themselves of a particular line, parties interested in setting up short 
line railroads on that line would then have at least 60 days to 
indicate their interest to the railway. The elevator companies 
cannot prevent the creation of short lines.
<P>
	Within the legislation there is a provision that states the railroads 
must negotiate with the interested parties in good faith. It is a 
business decision of the elevator companies whether they continue 
to operate an elevator or close the elevator to consolidate their 
operations.
<P>
	It is anticipated that there will be line abandonments due to 
elevator closures. However it is also anticipated that opportunities 
for short line operators will arise on branch lines that have 
operational elevators and sufficient volumes.
<P>
	Short line operators have to take into consideration the 
consolidation of an investment plan of grain companies when they 
make decisions on potential purchases of lines. If no interest is 
expressed by short line operators, the CTA allows provincial or 
municipal governments to acquire the lines at net salvage value.
<P>
	In summary, new provisions of the CTA encourage the transfer 
of lines where it makes economic sense and provides opportunity 
for governments to acquire lines if it is in the public interest to do 
so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Pursuant to 
Standing Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.55 p.m.)
<P>
