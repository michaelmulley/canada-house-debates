	The House resumed from October 3, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-55, an act to amend the Criminal Code (high risk 
offenders), the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the 
Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the 
Department of the Solicitor General Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to this bill today. It is an important criminal 
justice bill which has been talked about and anticipated for a long 
time and parts of which have been demanded for a long time by 
members on this side of the House and by Canadian citizens.
<P>
	There is both good and bad in the bill, as is the case in many bills 
the government brings forward. I would like to go through some of 
the positive things which are in this bill and some of the things 
which we think are mistakes, and to offer my advice and enter into 
the debate on whether Bill C-55 should be supported.
<P>
	Usually on this kind of bill which is of a technical nature I try to 
do work on behalf of my constituents to bring forward what I think 
would be their analysis and their concerns. The criminal justice 
system is an issue which is often top of mind in my riding. From 
my own phone surveys and from more technical surveys that I have 
had done and from the letters and phone calls I receive in my 
office, I can say that people are not convinced that the criminal 
justice system is operating on behalf of the best interests of 
law-abiding citizens. There is a feeling in many parts of the 
country, and certainly in my own riding, that there is too much 
emphasis on the rights, opportunities and demands of the prisoners 
and not enough emphasis on the rights of the law-abiding citizen.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about an individual case that happened in my 
own constituency which has ramifications for this bill. Many 
members of Parliament will probably be able to relate to stories 
like this because we all have situations which we confront from day 
to day.
<P>
	This constituent's name is Carol. She was married to an abusive 
husband. Her story is really the plight of thousands of women, and 
even some men I suppose, across Canada. Day in and day out they 
live in silent fear, not just fear of abuse, but in Carol's case fear for 
her own life. She was badly beaten by her husband in 1993. She did 
the right thing, the one which I always encourage spouses in 
abusive situations to do, and that is to get in touch with the police. 
She called the police and her husband was charged.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as is often the case this made her husband very 
angry. Instead of becoming a chastened man who realized the error 
in his ways, he became a very angry and dangerous man. And this 
is where our criminal justice system failed my constituent.
<P>
	As a bit of an aside, in the October 3 Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> it was stated 
that even the police are angry at the courts for granting bail to a 
man accused of forcing a woman out of a 10th storey window. Is 
there no sense of justice in the justice system? People must ask: 
How on earth can we grant bail to some of these horrible people? 
How can the immigration minister grant bail to dangerous 
offenders? A person who has been convicted of a crime and has 
escaped justice in the United States can come to Canada, throw 
himself at the mercy of the Canadian system and say that he needs 
refugee status, that he is a poor abused person.
<P>
	The justice system is not balanced. It does not understand that 
when people do serious crimes, especially personal injury crimes, 
they need to be addressed in a serious manner. That has not 
happened to date.
<P>
	In the same way, the system let my constituent Carol down. Her 
abusive husband came back with a vengeance. There was a 
restraining order against him, as there often is, but that was useless. 
The total protection offered to this poor lady was that the courts had 
a restraining order on someone who had already beaten her to a 
pulp. This scuzzy excuse for humanity stalked his former wife, 
eventually kidnapped her, stabbed her six times nearly killing her, 
and he was sentenced to two years less a day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5098"> 5098 </A></B>
<P>
	That sentence does not sound too horrible, but this is what it 
was about. He would come around and tap on her window with 
a butcher knife. When she would open the drapes there he would 
be. Although this was well known and well documented, that is 
what happened. He was charged with aggravated assault for what 
he did to Carol. He should have been charged with attempted 
murder but he was charged with aggravated assault and received 
only a two year sentence. This man will be out of jail any time 
now and his former wife, Carol, who has changed her name, once 
again lives in fear.
<P>
	I sat in the office with this lady, who has made a remarkable 
recovery, and her father. As with many members of Parliament, 
these cases are outside my realm of reference. I had no way of 
knowing how to handle this case. I keep a box of Kleenex on my 
desk for the people who come in to tell me these stories which I just 
cannot believe.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	They sat there and told me the lead-up to their story. The father 
said: ``Chuck, what would you have me do when this happens 
again? There is no justice in the justice system. They knew he was 
trying to kill my daughter. He stabbed her six times and for that he 
gets two years less a day for aggravated assault. I will tell you what 
I am going to do. If he taps on my daughter's window again, I am 
going to kill him. What would you do in that situation?'' I told him 
if he did that he would get 25 years for protecting his daughter, 
because it would be premeditated murder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> He will be able to appeal after 15 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> As my hon. colleague says, he will be able to appeal 
after 15 years under the new regulations but I do not want to get 
into that.
<P>
	What could I tell this father when he asked what I would do if 
somebody tapped on my daughter's window with a butcher knife 
and the police just said: ``Hey, you take your chance''?
<P>
	I wrote to the Minister of Justice and the attorney general of the 
province of B.C. to ask if there was something we could do to 
change the system. The system is broken. It is not working. It is not 
protecting people like Carol.
<P>
	I wanted the standard of proof in the Criminal Code to be 
lowered in the case of attempted murder. I also wanted to allow 
probation to be imposed along with sentences longer than two years 
less a day, which was not allowed at that time, so that judges would 
be free to give inmates longer sentences knowing they could be 
supervised afterward. Let me run through what happened after that 
to indicate the sad sorry state of justice.
<P>
	The attorney general of British Columbia, whom I do not see eye 
to eye with politically on a lot of things, did have the courage to 
undertake a study of the Criminal  Code. He is not in charge of 
criminal law but he did undertake a study on my behalf and he in 
turn made the two suggestions to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	When I met with the Minister of Justice upstairs in Centre Block 
he gave me this advice: ``Why not try a civil restraining order 
instead of a criminal, court ordered restraining order?'' That was 
the sum total of advice and help for this lady: ``Last time he was 
under a restraining order from the courts, he stabbed you six times. 
That did not seem to work too well. So why not try a civil 
restraining order? That ought to fix him''. That was it for an answer 
and that is not good enough.
<P>
	This lady is running, hiding, changing her name. She has been 
beaten with a rifle butt. He has tried to throw her in the river. She 
has been stabbed six times. She has been living in fear and is on the 
run. So get a civil restraining order because the courts cannot deal 
with it. That is not good enough and that is why I made the 
demands I did at that time.
<P>
	This was one of the first cases I dealt with when I became an MP. 
Three years later, the B.C. attorney general and I have been 
badgering the Minister of Justice. He has asked to have the issue 
put on the federal-provincial Criminal Code review. Finally after 
three years we are starting to see some changes in the law, and 
some of those changes are reflected in Bill C-55.
<P>
	But again the minister has fallen short. There is nothing in Bill 
C-55, nothing in the legislative agenda, nothing in the works 
anywhere, nothing in the hopper that I can find to deal with this 
problem of attempted murder. It is not dealt with in this bill of 
course. It is not dealt with in any bill. We just have to put up with it.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The reason attempted murder is almost never successfully 
prosecuted in British Columbia is that it has to be proven, without a 
doubt, that the person meant to kill their victim.
<P>
	I will cite this example again. This woman was stalked for 
months. She was beaten with a rifle butt. She was stabbed coming 
out of her apartment. Thankfully she did not have her children with 
her. She was stabbed six times until she dropped to the ground and 
lay unconscious.
<P>
	The man told the crown prosecutor that he had stabbed her a few 
times, that he had stalked her, that he had beaten on her window 
with a butcher knife, that he had beaten her with a rifle butt, that 
she had fallen to the ground unconscious with blood pouring out of 
her, but that he had not meant to kill her. He told the crown 
prosecutor that he was just sending her a message. He said he was 
warning her.
<P>
	It is sicker than sick. What does it take? What does a person have 
to do to be convicted of attempted murder, sever the head from the 
body?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5099"> 5099 </A></B>
<P>
	This is wrong. The minister has to address it. The attorney 
general of British Columbia has demanded that the law be changed 
to stop this from happening. Regularly in British Columbia they 
plea bargain away the attempted murder charge because it has to 
be proven, beyond any doubt, that murder was intended.
<P>
	What does it take? The case against this man was plea bargained 
away. Worse yet, it was plea bargained away over Carol's 
objections. It was plea bargained away without telling her. It was 
plea bargained away when they had promised her they would not do 
it. It was plea bargained away when she had told them that she 
wanted the case to be pushed to the maximum degree. This animal 
has to go away not only for the protection of the woman but for the 
protection of her children.
<P>
	It did not happen. Again it did not happen. I have to wonder what 
it takes. I sat down with the minister and he empathized with me. 
He said: ``Yes, that is a tough one. Why do you not get a civil 
restraining order on the guy?'' That is not what I want. That is not 
what Canadians want. Canadians want animals like this to be 
treated as animals.
<P>
	I believe all members of the House could cite cases in which a 
victim of crime asked to be notified if the perpetrator was going to 
be transferred to a nearby prison. They want to know for their own 
security. I have chased these cases down to the warden of the prison 
where the guy is incarcerated. I have asked the warden to flag the 
guy so that when he is transferred to Chilliwack, for example, I will 
know it has happened and my constituent will know that it has 
happened. It can happen, but we deserve to know.
<P>
	Do victims have rights? They do not. Prisoners are transferred. 
Sometimes we read in the newspapers that the guy has escaped 
from jail. The officials come back to us and say ``gee, he slipped 
through the cracks''. Victims were not notified. Victims have no 
rights. It is always written in terms of ``we should consider 
notifying them''. It may be that they will be notified. That is not 
adequate. That is why people continue to rise on this side of the 
House to speak on behalf of these people who say the minister is 
missing the boat.
<P>
	There is something about mandatory supervision in the bill. The 
bill allows for some high risk offenders to be subject to ten years of 
supervision after release from their sentences. That is half of what I 
ask from the minister.
<P>
	Up until this bill was introduced judges were frequently saying 
``I am going to give him two years less a day because then there can 
be some mandatory supervision afterward''. If the guy gets 10 
years, like he deserves, he cannot be supervised. He gets out and he 
is gone. This bill at least addresses that.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	For that, maybe my three years of letter writing, begging and 
pounding doors and desks had an impact. I hope so. One never 
knows. The minister, I am sure, would not give me any credit. At 
least it is something I have been asking for, begging for, 
demanding, however you want to say it. At least it is there.
<P>
	I want to note that there are provisions in the bill that I disagree 
with as well. There are accelerated parole provisions for so-called 
low risk non-violent offenders which will permit them to return to 
the community after serving only one-sixth of their sentence, a 
maximum six months in jail.
<P>
	It seems there is something wrong. I do not know if this is the 
minister's idea of truth in sentencing. I do not know what it means. 
It seems there is an indictment of our entire penal system in this.
<P>
	Why sentence criminals to jail time at all if the sentences are 
basically meaningless? They say to somebody, whatever the crime 
that if you do that, you are going to get a couple of years in jail. If 
you sentence the person, everybody walks away and says that 
should be the end of that.
<P>
	Then they find out: ``We do not want to punish them and, of 
course, we are not going to really rehabilitate them. We just do not 
want to have them, so jail sentence suspended''. Off they go, 
one-sixth of their time.
<P>
	This bill also gives courts the power to put people under 
electronic monitoring, even those who have never been charged 
with an offence. Do I want to see things toughened up in the 
criminal justice system? You bet. Do my constituents say that the 
criminal justice system is failing the law-abiding citizen? You bet.
<P>
	They ask whether we should supervise and monitor dangerous 
offenders, pedophiles, sexual perverts, violent offenders and stuff. 
You bet. They want them supervised. They want to know where 
they are. They want to know who they are. They want to know 
when that person applies for a job in a day care centre. They want 
to know all that.
<P>
	I do not think they want to take it the next step, which is to say 
that someone who has never been charged, I am going to put the 
shackles on him and he has no say. I do not know. Get tough on 
criminals, but criminals who have been convicted of something. 
We have to follow the rule of law.
<P>
	The evidence points to a conviction in the case I mentioned. I 
think it is pretty clear. If the guy has attempted murder, at least I 
would toss the guy away and lose the keys. Besides that, people 
would say there is a due process that we have to follow. The due 
process includes getting before a lawyer, having their day in court. 
If they are found guilty, the full force of the law comes down on 
them. Protection of victims is paramount.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5100"> 5100 </A></B>
<P>
	In our system people are innocent until proven guilty. I hope 
the government would listen to the concerns of many people who 
are concerned about civil liberties who say ``I understand why you 
are doing it, I understand you want to protect the people, and so 
on''.
<P>
	I am not prepared to say that without their day in court, without a 
formal charge, without a hearing, without time to defend 
themselves, as some official says, that the person should be 
specially marked, the shackles thrown on him and we will be able 
to follow him around to the ends of the earth. I am not happy with 
that.
<P>
	The government is schizophrenic on this. On one hand, it 
coddles the criminal. On the other hand, it lets people out after 
one-sixth of their sentence. On the other hand, it will not eliminate 
section 745.
<P>
	It coddles the criminal in many ways. We could go into what 
goes on in the prison system. I could tell about the prison breakouts 
in my area. In prison now they refuse to wear certain coloured 
T-shirts. They just rioted in Kent. They say: ``I can't be expected to 
wear a T-shirt that reflects my position as a prisoner. I want to wear 
whatever I want''. They get away with it.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	I wish I could say more. I have more private member's bills 
which I will be bringing forward on the criminal justice issue in the 
coming weeks. In my office I have a petition bearing 25,000 names 
dealing with sexual predators and the way the justice system treats 
them and what I and the people in my constituency would like to 
see done. I am happy to bring forward these concerns from my 
constituents and I hope that somewhere the justice minister or his 
people are listing to the concerns of Canadians. It is not evident in 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the member for Fraser 
Valley East, I could not help but remember a truism that to give no 
information is bad but to give misinformation is worse. The 
member for Fraser Valley East just said there was nothing in the 
bill. He emphasized those words.
<P>
	I would like to say to this member that all my colleagues on the 
government side are definitely committed to the safety of the entire 
Canadian citizenry. That member, of course, is again not telling the 
truth.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> I wonder if the member for Fraser Valley East 
and the other member would be polite enough to allow reasonable 
debate, which may be also part of civility in our society.
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley East said there was nothing in the 
bill. I wonder if the member has read clause 9(1) of the bill, dealing 
with potential serious personal injury offences. It is a special 
amendment to the Criminal Code. For the member to say there is 
nothing in  the bill is entirely false. Where the attorney general 
feels there are reasonable grounds to fear that another person will 
commit a serious personal injury offence, as the expression is 
defined elsewhere in the bill, in respect of one or more persons, the 
attorney general may lay information before a provincial court 
judge whether or not the person or persons in respect of whom 
there is fear that the offence will be committed are named.
<P>
	Within that section are enumerated the many grounds that could 
be included in that order by a court, including the non-possession 
of firearms.
<P>
	I think the member for Fraser Valley East has to be forthright in 
the Chamber, forthright with the Canadian public that this bill is an 
advance in ensuring the safety of Canadians. I can see the member 
is finally agreeing with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say there was nothing in the 
bill. As a matter fact, I said I was happy to see that after three years 
of my bashing my head against the minister's wall there are some 
provisions I approve of. I said that in my speech. I like the idea that 
there can be mandatory supervision for up to 10 years after. That is 
a good provision. I like that. I have been demanding for three years 
to get that. The AG of British Columbia has been asking for it.
<P>
	I did not say there was nothing in the bill. I talked about some of 
the things that have not been addressed in their entirety in the 
criminal justice system and I used this opportunity to talk about a 
few of those. However, do I think that people who have uttered 
threats using a firearm should have their firearms taken away from 
them? You bet.
<P>
	When it comes to firearms and threats with a weapon, I 
personally have a zero tolerance policy. If we had a better system in 
place in British Columbia we would not have had the tragedy in 
Kelowna. Somehow that person received permission to own a 
handgun even though he had threatened his wife's life. It turned out 
that he took not only her life but nine members of the family. It was 
a real tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	The tragedy is that the government has taken the easy route, the 
publicity route, especially on firearms. It says we have to get the 
hunters of this world, the shooters of this world, the Olympians of 
this world to register their weapons and the world will be a safer 
place. That is the problem with the justice system, the law-abiding 
people are made to jump through the hoops.
<P>
	Let me tell you a story of another case in my riding. A guy 
slipped across the Canada-U.S. border at Columbia valley. The 
police sent out someone to intercept him. A police women 
apprehended him. He lunged at her, grabbed her gun, shoved the 
barrel into her mouth and said: ``It's curtains, lady''. Thankfully a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5101"> 5101 </A></B>
<P>
passerby came  over and talked him out of this, even though he had 
the gun cocked and shoved in her mouth.
<P>
	Thankfully, because of this passerby, he eventually turned her 
loose. However, he stole the four-wheel drive cruiser and drove it 
into the mountains. He had the shotgun, his own illegal 
unregistered gun, the police woman's weapon, the police car. He 
set it all on fire, burning everything to the ground. The police got 
the dogs out and they caught the guy.
<P>
	In Canada you can get five years for having an unregistered clip 
for your gun. This guy got two years. He is not that bad. He entered 
Canada illegally, he assaulted a police officer, he threatened to kill 
her, he stuck the gun to her head, he did $50,000 damage to federal 
property, he evaded arrest, he had possession, and he had a track 
record of former convictions. What he did not have was not worth 
talking about. What sentence did he get for these crimes? Two 
years, but he will be out in six or eight months.
<P>
	Ask the police in my area what they think of the justice system. 
It is weak. A guy like that is an animal and probably should never 
be let out of jail. Instead laws are passed that make honest, 
law-abiding people jump through hoops. Many of them will 
become criminals through ignorance and this guy, instead of 
having the book thrown at him, is left to walk free in a few months. 
It is not right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-55 mainly because I am a 
government MP. As a government MP I naturally would prefer to 
support my government in any legislation that it brings forward. 
Indeed I try to do so in all instances.
<P>
	As a government MP I feel that I have a fundamental obligation 
to signal my concerns when I see something in the government's 
legislation that concerns me deeply. The reason this is important 
for a government MP is that when a law passes the courts go back 
to the parliamentary debates and examine the discussions and pay 
particular attention to what government MPs say about the 
legislation. They believe what they hear from both sides of the 
House represents the thinking of Parliament with respect to 
legislation. Judges use that as a means of interpreting the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Gun control legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> I am coming to that, gentlemen, if you would just 
wait a minute.
<P>
	My concern with this legislation has to do with electronic 
monitoring provision. Ironically I find myself in agreement with 
some of the observations of the member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	Last night I took time at home in my apartment to read George 
Orwell's famous novel <I>1984</I>. George Orwell, if members recall, 
made famous the expression ``big  brother''. The novel was written 
in 1949 just after the world had experienced the tyranny of Hitler 
and had just entered into the deepest phase of the cold war when red 
army troops had seized eastern Europe. Most of the former 
democracies and countries of eastern Europe had fallen under the 
totalitarian sway of Stalin. Orwell's book is a depiction of the 
ultimate totalitarian state in which big brother, the state, controls 
every aspect of human behaviour. Orwell creates a picture of this 
man-his name is Winston-in which Winston's only problem is 
that he wants to express a certain amount of individuality. He wants 
to be a human being, if you will.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	However, the state has prescribed the type of behaviour it wants 
from its citizens and has set up an elaborate means of monitoring 
their actions. Ultimately the state's purpose, big brother in George 
Orwell's novel, is to put shackles on the freedom of movement of 
people in society so that they always have to act according to what 
the state prescribes as the correct behaviour.
<P>
	Orwell in writing this novel created the ultimate nightmare. It 
led to a series of other books and popular culture stories that 
involved the state control of individual behaviour by electronic 
means, by implanting devices that controlled individuals and 
restrained them. You can see the parallels that come out of <I>1984</I> 
which in that period was regarded as the ultimate horror for society, 
state control.
<P>
	Then I read in the proposed legislation that the government is 
now considering electronic monitoring. These monitors are 
intended to be a sort of bracelet. People are ordered to wear these 
bracelets to restrain certain forms of behaviour. The bracelet can be 
used to keep track of their whereabouts. If the judge wants to 
prevent a person coming near some home because it has been 
decided that the person is a threat to someone, this bracelet would 
electronically monitor the whereabouts of the person.
<P>
	Once we enter into this whole business of an electronic shackle, 
and that is what it is, an electronic shackle, an electronic ball and 
chain, all kinds of opportunities present themselves in the George 
Orwellian model. We can have a bracelet that remotely inflicts pain 
on an individual wearing this bracelet should that individual be 
about to engage in behaviour that the state wants to prevent.
<P>
	As the bill is currently constituted, it basically addresses people 
who have the potential of committing violent offences. It could 
also be used on, say, a heroin addict. With a smart chip in the 
electronic bracelet if the addict approached a drug dealer the chip 
could scent the heroin and could immediately administer an 
electric shock to the individual to prevent this behaviour. And so it 
goes. The possibilities with a smart chip in this kind of bracelet are 
endless. We could restrain all kinds of behaviour remotely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5102"> 5102 </A></B>
<P>
	According to this legislation it is proposed that this is going 
to be aimed at only a certain type of offender. The problem is that 
when we get into this kind of thing, we are addressing very 
fundamental liberties. We are going right to the bottom of our 
basic freedoms. It is the same thing as our freedom of speech and 
the constant struggle there is between how to put limits on 
pornography while still maintaining freedom of speech.
<P>
	An electronic shackle is the ultimate limitation on liberty. It 
allows the individual some movement in society, but in fact it is the 
same type of shackle that the Romans used and that was used in the 
slave trade.
<P>
	I will explain what a shackle is as opposed to a rope or a prison 
cell. A shackle is restraint. We have used the nice words judicial 
restraint. In fact a shackle is something that limits behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	Let me give an classic example. When slaves used to work in the 
fields picking cotton or sugar cane, they were shackled with an iron 
bar, the idea being that if the slave attempted to escape through the 
fields the shackle would get caught in the underbrush restraining 
their movements so that they could not get away. The ball and 
chain held the same idea. The ball was a weight that they had to 
drag and they could only get so far before they became exhausted. 
These were the means used by overseers to restrain their slaves in 
the field for work and not actually have to keep them in prisons. It 
was an economic tool that was very useful in the days of the slave 
trade.
<P>
	To me there is not a great distinction between this electronic 
shackle and the old ball and chain. Let me just finish a point here. 
As proposed, this electronic shackle is only going to apply to 
certain types of individuals who pose certain types of risks.
<P>
	One of the things I have learned in my three years in the House 
of Commons is that the great danger when we pass legislation that 
contains a subsection of a subsection that actually impinges on 
basic liberties is that while in this particular legislation it may be 
restricted to one group of individuals, at a later time legislation 
may come along that will pass in this House that will extend the 
application of the provision.
<P>
	I will give an example. Right now the legislation applies to 
individuals who pose a threat of inflicting bodily harm. I think it is 
directed primarily toward sexual offenders. However, drunk drivers 
are a threat to society. Drunk drivers are capable of inflicting 
physical injury and death. Why not some day have this bracelet 
imposed on people who have two or more convictions for impaired 
driving? As members can see, it is so easy to take it to the next step 
and the next step and the next step until we have an Orwellian state 
in which any form of dissent or some form of dissent results in an 
electronic  shackle. We can do all kinds of things with that. We can 
prevent all forms of behaviour remotely.
<P>
	Where does this concept come from? I suggest the concept 
comes once again from our neighbour to the south which is 
confronted with a major crime problem. It is an epidemic problem 
in the United States. The Americans are building prisons faster 
than any country in the world and they are actually experiencing 
economic difficulties because of the difficulty they have in 
providing enough prison spaces for the number of people they are 
incarcerating.
<P>
	One of their reactions to crime, which has been a subject of 
much debate in this House, has been unlimited acquisition of 
firearms. Canada has reacted in quite a Canadian way to this issue. 
We have had a very aggressive debate in the House about the whole 
question of firearms. Regardless of what side we are all on in the 
House, we all agree that Canadians do not want to see the weapons 
possession that exists in the United States. The government has 
gone to great lengths with the gun control bill to create a different 
answer to violence that does not involve the availability of guns for 
protection. Therefore, Canadians have found an alternate solution 
to what the Americans have found with respect to arming 
themselves against the criminal menace.
<P>
	The other side of the coin is that the Americans have come out 
with this electronic shackling as an economic measure. They are 
building so many prisons and it is costing them so much that it is 
cheaper and more economically feasible, instead of putting people 
in jail, to apply electronic shackles. I am not saying they have gone 
that far yet, but the opportunity is there. We can see in American 
society the advantages of using electronic shackles to prevent 
people from committing armed robberies. They could be used in 
the drug trade. If these things could be put on people, crime could 
be limited in certain areas.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The difficulty is that in the United States, crime is centred upon 
one group in society. The Americans collect statistics based on 
race. I hate to bring this issue up, but we must talk about the 
Americans. They feel they have demonstrated to their satisfaction 
that blacks in particular have a higher proportion of incarceration 
than other categories in their society.
<P>
	That is a frightening statistic. I am pleased this is not the kind of 
statistic which is collected by Canada. Nevertheless, because the 
Americans are very conscious of this, if electronic shackling is 
pursued to its ultimate end, then we will see the re-enslavement of 
a people in the United States. Instead of being shackled to the ball 
and chain of the overseer on the cotton plantation, they will be 
shackled by an electronic device which will be more common in 
one racial group than in any other. This has the appalling potential 
of returning to the 19th century to an era which we must leave 
behind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5103"> 5103 </A></B>
<P>
	We as Canadians, on all sides of the House representing all 
points of view, must not be driven by the type of social forces 
and dilemmas the Americans are confronting, be it the question 
of the availability of firearms or the question of the availability 
of an electronic shackle, an electronic ball and chain. I am very 
concerned that my government has brought forward the suggestion 
of the electronic shackle.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague from Fraser Valley East that it is 
particularly dangerous because it is not intended to apply simply to 
people who are convicted of crimes, it is also designed to apply to 
people who may be perceived as potential criminals. Before the 
suspect has actually committed the crime, they may be shackled. 
That is a huge step. I would say it is a dangerous and a frightening 
step.
<P>
	There is an easy solution to the problem. We can have this type 
of restraint if we write into the legislation that it is voluntary. The 
person to whom the order is to be applied would have the option of 
electing whether they will go to jail or some other option instead of 
accepting the electronic shackle.
<P>
	In some instances I would think that people would voluntarily 
accept the electronic shackle. If a heroin addict wants to shake his 
habit, or if a person is a pedophile and cannot control his or her 
impulses but wants to control them, they might want to have a 
shackle. Then it becomes a positive thing because we are 
respecting human will.
<P>
	I hope the members of the justice committee will read my words 
and the words of others who have been worried about this one 
provision. I hope they will think very carefully about the option of 
making it a voluntary provision.
<P>
	I will make another analogy. Anyone who is a farmer will 
recognize what is called a cattle grate. When a farmer has cattle in 
the field and he wants to go back and forth with his tractor and he 
does not want to go to the trouble of opening the gate every time he 
goes through, he takes the gate off and he puts in what is called a 
cattle grate. It consists of a few bars of a certain spacing and is 
about a foot deep. The cattle can never cross. When they approach, 
they see the grate. They know that if they try to cross they could get 
caught in the grates and could break their legs. The animals 
recognize this and consequently they are restrained in the field pen.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The grate works very well for all hoofed animals. It is very very 
good for cattle. It works for pigs, it works for horses and it works 
for sheep. One thing we do not want to do in any legislation we pass 
in this House is to reduce our allowance for human will. We are 
human beings with some freedom of will, some ability to decide 
between right and wrong. When we reduce human beings by a 
shackle or by any kind of restraint to the level of animals,  I think 
we are creating a very sad and despairing problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on the very 
reasoned presentation by the member for Hamilton-Wentworth. I 
have always appreciated his sincerity on any issue of potential 
controversy and I am addressing this issue on that basis.
<P>
	I can see his point that such a judicial restraint would be a 
limitation to freedom; that is a given. But even the charter of rights 
in the Canadian Constitution allows for limits to freedom where it 
can be demonstrated in a democratic society that such a limitation 
is allowable. Who will interpret this allowance? Ultimately it will 
be the Supreme Court of Canada. For example, the laws on hate 
where we may not spread hate propaganda definitely represent a 
limitation to freedom of speech.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada would like to establish that the 
goal to be achieved in any limitation to freedom is a very laudable 
goal for society at large. In terms of the subject under debate now, 
the limitation would be imposed in the case of serious injury to a 
Canadian citizen and there is no other alternative that we could use 
as a tool. I am sure that in this instance, any court of law in Canada 
would take that into account when trying to pass judgment on such 
an application by an attorney general of a given province. I am sure 
the courts would like to see that such a means would be capable of 
achieving that ultimate goal.
<P>
	Being a non-lawyer, I do not recall all the tests that Canadian 
courts of law have applied when a balance must be struck, when 
limits to freedom have to be imposed. I continue to have faith in 
our judicial court system.
<P>
	The very learned member spoke about shackles. I could imagine 
the physical shackles and not being able to move with the restraint 
of the weight on one's legs. I remember historical photos. But if 
electronic monitoring is used, it would likely be non-visible, 
non-intrusive to the eyes of others. Perhaps only the person upon 
whom this device would be imposed by a court of law would know 
that such a device existed on his body. I am sure this will be taken 
into account. To compare the electronic monitoring to shackles as 
we were used to imagining them is extending our imaginations a 
little too much.
<P>
	The member indicated that this may be a return to enslavement. 
The only enslavement I can see in this would be the enslavement of 
risk. We will now have one additional tool with which to control 
risk of serious injury to others with this control being imposed on 
other members of society.
<P>
	It is a huge step but the challenge of personal safety which is 
before society is very huge indeed. On that basis I would like to 
submit that such a provision in the bill is reasonable. Considering 
that it has only to be determined by the attorney general of a given 
province based on  reasonable grounds of fear that the person is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5104"> 5104 </A></B>
<P>
about to commit a serious personal injury, there will be an 
examination of this during the hearings.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	My last point is that electronic monitoring is not a monitoring 
that will be imposed on the person for eternity. It is only for a 
period of 12 months. In other words, there is a finite period. If the 
person's behaviour has been sustained such that such an occurrence 
is not likely to happen again, then the person will be freed of his 
electronic monitoring.
<P>
	I submit that this is a reasonable approach to a serious problem 
that faces society. Therefore, I concur with this initiative on the 
part of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the member's 
judgment and sincerity in all the issues he addresses.
<P>
	If I may say so, he put his finger on what is the precise problem 
with this kind of legislation. It is that it springs from consultation 
with the courts. He has said that the courts have been consulted on 
this legislation and then it was written.
<P>
	I submit that this is one of the great problems we have in 
legislation in this House all the time. It is not remembered that this 
House of Commons is the highest court in the land. It is we the MPs 
who look to our constituency to try to understand the nation, to try 
to understand who we are as Canadians and to write the laws. It is 
wrong in my view to consider legislation and to consider how the 
courts will interpret that legislation rather than considering its 
moral and ethical impact on society. It is putting the cart before the 
horse.
<P>
	I am not prepared to give the judges of the land who sit in their 
chambers a better acknowledgement of what Canada is all about 
than members of Parliament. It is we who have to interpret the 
ethics and the propriety of the laws.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You seem to be on a roll. I was afraid to come in 
too fast but it being 11 a.m., we will proceed to Statements by 
Members.

<P>
	This annual event is held to raise funds for the Farah Foundation,

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last week the federal Liberal government wined and 
dined over 100 hand picked delegates gathered in Ottawa for a 
three day national conference. The aim was to have these youth 
delegates help provide solutions to growing problems faced by 
young people in Canada today.
<P>
	The problem is the federal government did not invite any student 
groups, where corporations were welcomed with open arms, 
showing once again how this government believes that only the 
wealthy and large corporations really matter.
<P>
	Obviously the government believes that rising tuition costs, 
decreasing quality of education, high student debt, chronic student 
unemployment and decreased accessibility to university education 
are irrelevant and trivial issues for the youth of today.
<P>
	The chair of the conference conveniently forgot to mention the 
government is backtracking on the Liberal Party's red book 
promise to fund a $100 million youth core program to employ 
10,000 youth every year. He also neglected to mention the 
government's plans to privatize Canada's student loan program and 
the $7 billion cuts to provincial social transfer payments.
<P>
	The corporations and the government were so successful at 
pulling off this farce that Canada's second largest bank, the CIBC, 
has generously offered to host the second national conference on 
youth next March. And why not? The government has already 
abandoned middle class and working people for banks and big 
corporations.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
Bloc Quebecois's general council held last Saturday at Lac Delage, 
delegates voted unanimously in favour of an urgent motion calling 
on the federal government to maintain its $7.2 million financial 
participation in the Varennes Tokamak project.
<P>
	The withdrawal of the federal government from this project will 
deal it a fatal blow, as layoff notices will start to go out at the end of 
this month. The talented researchers who work there will inevitably 
have to look for new work beyond our borders. The skills 
developed within this country and the $70 million invested over the 
last 20 years in this project will be lost forever, and Canada will be 
deprived of the spinoffs resulting from the development of new 
technologies related to Tokamak.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative that the federal government rethink its 
decision to end its financial participation, which represents a large 
portion of the federal government's already too small investment in 
research and development in Quebec.
<P>
	I appeal to the common sense of federal government 
representatives and call on them to reassess as quickly as possible 
this decision that may well be bitterly regretted. Time is running

to draw to the attention of the House the September edition of 
<I>Fraser Forum</I>. To cut through the bafflegaff, two years ago the 
Fraser Institute developed a Canadian budget performance index to 
monitor the financial records of the country's 11 senior 
governments.
<P>
	The index is composed of an array of variables dealing with both 
spending and taxation as well as deficits and debt. The best 
performer in 1995 was the province of Alberta, and Saskatchewan 
is forecast to be the best performer in 1996.
<P>
	The worst? Over the two year period it is forecast to be the 
federal government, placing 10th out of 11 in 1995, and forecast to 
be no better than 9th for this year. This is all the more fascinating 
since much of federal budgetary progress in the past two years has 
been in the form of offloading to the provinces.
<P>
	There are two lessons here. First, Canadians should not be 
conned about the federal fiscal situation. The federal Liberals have 
a record of brilliant propaganda and mediocre performance. 
Second, the House should be reminded once again of the invaluable

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Monday when the House was debating a 
motion on federal issues that are adversely affecting the province 
of British Columbia, we witnessed a litany of Liberal members 
inform this House that they are responsible for B.C.'s booming 
economy. Never mind  that B.C. had been doing just fine prior to 
this government's election in 1993, the Liberals actually wanted 
everyone to believe that they were responsible.
<P>
	However, yesterday the provincial Government of British 
Columbia announced that it has slashed the province's economic 
forecast from 2.7 per cent to just 1 per cent.
<P>
	Well, if you want to claim the credit you also have to accept the 
blame. So can we expect the Minister of Transport to admit to 
British Columbians that his government's policies are responsible 
for this significant drop in B.C.'s rate of growth? Of course not, 
because this government's philosophy is accept the glory but put 
the blame on somebody else.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	As he vaunted his government's performance on job creation, the 
Minister of Finance said that Canadians were doing well. However, 
in its latest report, the Conference Board estimates that in 1995, 
two million Canadians were jobless and 500,000 had left the labour 
force. This means, according to the Conference Board, that the real 
unemployment rate in 1995 was not 9.5 per cent but 12.5 per cent.
<P>
	Considering the government's triumphant statement on job 
creation, could the Deputy Prime Minister explain why the real 
unemployment rate in Canada, which includes those who have 
given up looking for a job, is now 12.5 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are certainly not 
triumphant. We are still looking for ways to create new jobs. That 
is why I was somewhat surprised to hear that the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois does not fully support the federal government's plans 
for the infrastructures program, which has created 80,000 jobs 
across the country, many in Quebec.
<P>
	I am surprised he does not endorse the second infrastructures 
program, which could be expected to create more new jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to correct a tendency of the Deputy Prime 
Minister to misquote people. The Leader of the Opposition said 
that he was prepared to support an infrastructures program, 
provided that, unlike the first program, which created temporary 
jobs, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5109"> 5109 </A></B>
<P>
this one  would provide stable and well-paying jobs. That is what 
the leader of the opposition said.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister say, with the Minister of 
Finance, that Canadians are doing very well, when according to the 
Conference Board, two million people are still jobless and the 
figures of Statistics Canada indicate the government has created 
only 153,000 jobs since early 1996? These figures come from 
Statistics Canada, not from the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as long as there is a single 
unemployed person in this country, we have no reason to be 
triumphant. Someone who is unemployed means someone who 
cannot feed his family, and that is why we want to go ahead with 
the infrastructures program.
<P>
	I can assure you that although the Bloc Quebecois did not 
support a program that created 80,000 jobs across this country, we, 
the Government of Canada, trust that we proceeded with a program 
that was supported by the people in their ridings.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought the Deputy Prime Minister had a poor memory, 
but now I wonder whether she hears what is said.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I said that the Bloc supported the infrastructures program, 
provided there were durable, well-paying jobs. Did you hear me, 
Madam?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I may remind hon. members that I am the one who 
is supposed to hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish some day you would make sure she understands what was 
said.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister refuses to face the facts. Not only 
has the labour market not returned to what it was in 1989, the real 
labour force participation rate is in free fall and the job-population 
ratio is stagnating. Even worse, Canadians are 7 per cent poorer 
than they were after the last recession, in 1989. If that is what you 
call doing well in this country, I wonder what the future will be 
like.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the labour market situation is a 
disaster and that the few jobs created by her government have 
failed to add to the wealth of Quebecers and Canadians? It is high 
time the government created stable, well-paying jobs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, according to the Mayor of 
Montreal, one of the current problems is political instability. I 
would urge the hon. member opposite to consider what her own 
leader said yesterday when he referred to the infrastructures 
program as an election goody.
<P>
	I am going to make sure we go ahead with this program, even if 
the Bloc Quebecois is now obstructing a program that created jobs 
in all ridings across the country, including the ridings with the 
highest rate of poverty and unemployment in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
Conference Board is saying is that low productivity is the primary 
reason for the lack of investment in research and development and 
the lack of job training. A distinction must be made.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. If it had wanted to 
bring back the sort of job market the people of Quebec and of 
Canada had in 1989, in terms of the unemployment rate and the 
participation rate, this government would have had to create over 
one and a half million jobs since it came to power. According to its 
own statistics, the government has created only 669,000 jobs. It 
still has over 800,000 to go.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister realize that, at the rate this 
government is going with job creation, it would take at least four 
more years before we see conditions similar to those of seven years 
ago before the last recession?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when we see the rate of 
unemployment among young people, and especially when we see 
that the majority of people who have left the province of Quebec 
this year are young people, it is a terrible loss.
<P>
	What we want to do, through programs like the infrastructure 
program, which has not been supported so far by the Bloc 
Quebecois, by the way, is to restore some semblance of economic 
stability. For this to be possible, the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois must respect the promises of Quebec's premier to set 
aside the quarrels over separation and work flat out on the 
economy.
<P>
	That is what we want, but unfortunately it is not what the Bloc 
Quebecois is doing right now. Right now, it is creating political 
instability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is political 
instability the reason why New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island 
and Newfoundland have an even higher rate of unemployment than 
Quebec? Yet there is no talk of separation in these provinces.
<P>
	After 2 years and 10 months of power, this government is 
crowing about having created 669,000 jobs, while the former 
government created 930,000 jobs in the same length of time. For a 
government that was elected to create jobs, we have seen better.
<P>
	When will this government stop patting itself on the back and 
admit that it has not yet delivered on its main election promise?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what creates political 
instability is what they are now calling the referendum. There was 
one referendum, and Canada won. A second was held, and Canada 
won. Now, they are talking about trying again. As long as they 
keep on wanting to hold referendums, the Parti Quebecois and the 
Bloc Quebecois are adding to the climate of political instability, 
whose results we are now seeing.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Wednesday one person of a group of ten who arrived in Canada 
from Pakistan died as their boat turned over in choppy waters on 
the St. Lawrence River near Cornwall en route to the United States.
<P>
	Yesterday, Akwesasne police and the OPP charged a Canadian 
man with manslaughter in connection with this botched smuggling 
attempt. This incident illustrates a well documented problem, 
namely, the unchecked flow of illegal smuggling through the 
Akwesasne reserve.
<P>
	Why has the solicitor general not clamped down on this activity? 
How many more must die before he takes action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was a tragedy the other evening 
when lives were lost in an illegal attempt to smuggle people across 
the border.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that any such activity is a criminal 
offence under the present laws of Canada, that the RCMP work 
closely with the American immigration and naturalization service. 
Every effort is made to discourage, detect and to prosecute this 
unlawful activity.
<P>
	The reality is that some three years ago, the government created 
the anti-smuggling initiative which represented an increased 
investment of funds and people into the resources of the RCMP and 
related services to deal with smuggling in general, including the 
smuggling of people.
<P>
	Our resolve in that regard continues. We shall do everything we 
can to detect and to prosecute such illegal activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately the reality is that the police are afraid to patrol the 
river at night because the criminal activity is a threat to their safety. 
Organized criminals, drug traffickers and bootleggers are running 
rampant on Akwesasne and Cornwall Island. Obviously the police 
on the reserve have been ineffective in doing their jobs.
<P>
	Canadians are beginning to question if the police there are 
turning a blind eye to the smuggling and drug  running that is going 
on. If the Akwesasne police will not do their jobs, maybe it is time 
to send in the RCMP or even the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Will the solicitor general send in the RCMP to clean up the 
mess? Or will he continue to tolerate organized crime and give it 
free rein on Akwesasne?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that 
the RCMP are very much directly involved in efforts, not only in 
that area but across our border to deal with efforts to smuggle and 
to break Canadian laws.
<P>
	Last weekend the solicitor general and I hosted a forum on 
organized crime in Canada. The forum was attended by 
representatives of police forces, provincial governments, 
prosecutors, defence counsel and working police officers. We 
reviewed not only the present state of the situation but also specific 
measures that can be taken to give police additional tools in their 
efforts to combat organized crime.
<P>
	Arising from that conference, together with the government's 
demonstrated resolve to deal effectively with smuggling, I am 
certain that we will have even more effective steps in the months 
ahead to deal with this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
police in the area and in other areas of this country have been 
seeking desperately the assistance and support of the federal 
government and have not been able to obtain such.
<P>
	This tragic incident demonstrates the government's double 
standards in enforcing the laws in the nation. The government has 
made it a priority to arrest, detain, fine and even harass western 
farmers who want to do nothing more than to sell grain to the 
United States at the best price they can get. The solicitor general 
turns a blind eye year after year, even after people have died, from 
the rampant crime on Akwesasne.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Will the solicitor general commit today to end the double 
standard, enforce the law equally and send in whatever force 
necessary to stop the crime at the borders, in other words, do his 
job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only assure the hon. member 
that the RCMP take their responsibilities very seriously. Their 
resources were supplemented almost three years ago with the 
anti-smuggling initiative.
<P>
	The border is never going to be entirely beyond the commission 
of offences. It is a 3,000 mile border and it is an open border. The 
hon. member knows the level of difficulty in policing it all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5111"> 5111 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe that the RCMP are doing as effective a job as they 
can under difficult circumstances and the government's resolve to 
do everything possible against smuggling is quite clear.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OFFICIALLANGUAGES">OFFICIAL LANGUAGES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the President of Treasury Board alleged that 54 per cent 
of federal public service positions in Quebec needed to be bilingual 
in order to serve anglophones and allophones. By thus linking the 
allophones with the anglophone minority, the President of the 
Treasury Board, a francophone minister who is an elected member 
for Quebec, is openly admitting that he is working to anglicize 
Quebec's allophones.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Why is 
the President of the Treasury Board, a francophone, working to 
anglicize Quebec's allophones, in contradiction of every language 
policy adopted by the governments of Quebec since 1960 for the 
purpose of integrating them into Quebec society through their use 
of the French language?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
allegations the opposition member is making are totally unfounded 
and, what is more, he is attacking my credentials as a francophone. 
Allow me to say that his French name does not entitle him to 
defend all francophone traditions.
<P>
	My family has been here since 1648. My entire family has 
defended the francophone literature, culture, language, institutions, 
and no member of the Bloc Quebecois or of the Parti Quebecois can 
tell me what my family has done from the francophone point of 
view.
<P>
	In my opinion, the Bloc Quebecois are the ones working against 
the interests of Quebec at this time, and the ones whose efforts will 
gradually weaken the influence of the French language and culture 
in Quebec. It is they who are doing a disservice to francophones.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, the truth is hard to take. It is up to the President of the 
Treasury Board to stand up for himself, for it is he who clearly 
spoke yesterday of ``serving the allophones''. So he is incapable of 
standing up for himself.
<P>
	I wish to ask him this: if it is good for Quebec anglophones to 
have five times as many bilingual public servants as their 
demographic weight justifies, would it be logical for the same rule 
to apply to the francophones of New Brunswick, who represent 34 
per cent of the population, or those in Ontario, who form the largest 
francophone minority in Canada? Why do the federal government, 
and the President of the Treasury Board, a  francophone member of 
Parliament from Quebec, continue to systematically disadvantage 
the francophones in English-speaking Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is 
clearly not true that the government, or myself, are disadvantaging 
the francophone minorities in Canada. The opposition does nothing 
but spread rumours which, they know to untrue.
<P>
	What the report by the President of the Treasury Board 
demonstrates, and clearly demonstrates with figures, not with 
untrue allegations, is that the linguistic minorities in Canada have 
received far better service in recent years than in the past.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In fact, from the point of view of service to the public, from the 
point of view of language of work, from the point of view of their 
numerical representation in the public service, francophone 
minorities are better off now than they have ever been in the past, 
than they were 20 years ago. I myself bear witness to that, and the 
allegations being made by the opposition will not change those 
facts.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, things being 
what they are, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	A shocking case of fraud at the Valcartier military base is one 
more reason to question the effectiveness and relevance of the 
court-martial system. Although the same kind of fraud was 
allegedly practised in several other military bases in Canada in the 
past 15 years, very few charges have been laid. Light sentences and 
limited investigations cast some doubt on the credibility of this 
justice system.
<P>
	Since the entire military justice system has been sorely strained 
since the appointment of the Minister of National Defence and the 
current Chief of Staff, General Boyle, will the government appoint 
a parliamentary committee to carry out a full and detailed 
examination in this respect, and do so as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, considering the 
seriousness of the allegations and the fact that an investigation is 
now taking place, we cannot comment on the case here in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
to the minister is entirely relevant and does not concern the current 
investigation.
<P>
	The attempt to silence Corporal Purnelle and deprive him of his 
most fundamental rights, when the army wanted to bring him 
before a career review board instead of a court-martial, is a very 
good example of what is wrong with the military justice system.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	And now for my supplementary. Instead of minimizing the 
problems, will the minister or will she not admit that  the military 
justice system is ailing in more ways than one and that a remedy is 
needed, not six months from now but right away?

investment in new Canadian programming.

is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	We learned, last July, that the Minister of Transport was taking 
the Prague route away from Air Canada and giving it to Canadian, 
the very day that Air Canada announced its new service to Prague, 
in partnership with Lufthansa.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport justify this decision as 
anything other than a shameless bias in favour of Canadian to the 
detriment of Air Canada, which has its head office in Montreal and 
employs 5,500 people in the west and over 14,000 in Ontario and in 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is simple. There is an almost automatic policy 
in place for cities such as Prague. If the first airline does not use the 
route, and Air Canada did not, it goes to the other airline. It is 
almost automatic. I made no decision. That is how it works.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>

minister, sent them a letter last year, when they indicated that the 
Hong Kong routes would also be available for Canadian 
International.

it happened the very day that Air Canada had an agreement with

Canada never had an opportunity to be heard before it was decided

least they could have listened to what Air Canada had to say.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I have just said, it is not a question of reviewing the 
matter or making a decision. It is automatic. If the route is not 
established in 365 days, it goes to the other airline. It is very clear. 
Air Canada is aware of this rule.
<P>
	Yes, they put out a press release saying that they were in the 
process of setting up an office, and it is too bad, but they did not 
clearly indicate that they were selling tickets long before the 
automatic application of the  policy established by my predecessor, 
the former transport minister.

is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Over 15,000 auto workers are now out on strike in Oshawa, 
Durham and Ste-Thérèse. Canadian auto workers feel they are 
being used as pawns in negotiations between General Motors and 
the United Auto Workers in the United States. The cars are made by 
Canadians; they do not want their agreements made in Detroit.
<P>
	Will the minister tell Washington that Canadians demand made 
in Canada solutions to their labour problems?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the labour negotiations between General Motors of 
Canada and the Canadian auto workers fall under provincial law 
and not under the Canada Labour Code. Therefore, I cannot 
intervene in this dispute.
<P>
	However, I am very concerned about the effects such a strike will 
have on Canadians and the Canadian economy. Therefore, I invite 
the parties to continue negotiating and to find a Canadian solution 
as soon as possible.

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite 
the claims of the Deputy Prime Minister, Canadians from coast to 
coast are complaining about the cost of the flags program. They 
typically state that the certificates alone must have cost more than 
$1 million and surely that money could have been put to better use.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Canadian Heritage originally stated that 
this program would be funded by corporations, could she please tell 
the House how much money the corporations have given toward 
the purchase of flags for this program? And while she is at it, could 
she please tell the House how much of her personal money she has 
put into the program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would have to challenge 
the hon. member's claim that complaints are pouring in from 
across the country. In fact, calls are pouring in from across the 
country. In the first eight months of the program we have received 
over three million calls from Canadians who obviously believe this 
program has something to offer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5114"> 5114 </A></B>
<P>
	I will say that we have also received a commitment from a very 
large number of corporate presidents for the corporate flag 
challenge, which I believe will be launched on November 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take it 
then that the corporations have donated nothing. It is interesting 
that out of three million calls, two and a half million have gone 
unanswered because of the busy signal.
<P>
	It has taken the taxes of 1,600 Canadian families to pay for this 
program. In addition, owners and employees of flag shops across 
the country are being put out of work by a government program 
which competes directly with them. Now a Léger and Léger poll 
shows a dramatic increase in support for separatism since the 
program was introduced.
<P>
	Is the minister so blinded with ideology that she cannot see that 
her flags program is playing into the separatists' hands and 
contributing to the break-up of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose I should say 
that as usual the Reform Party has it all wrong. In fact, in the Léger 
and Léger poll which came out today, there has been a significant 
drop in support for the Parti Quebecois and for the Bloc Quebecois. 
As usual, the member's polls are probably way behind.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In early July, Canadian National announced its plans to sell or 
abandon the Matapédia-Gaspé line. So far, the section between 
Chandler and Gaspé has not found a buyer and may disappear 
altogether.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that this railway network in the Gaspé 
is in danger of disappearing altogether and that especially in the 
winter, local communities will be deprived of the only safe means 
of transportation in this region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, railways throughout Quebec are in the same situation as 
those in the rest of Canada. If there are doubts about safety, we 
cannot let passengers continue to use these lines.
<P>
	If the problem is a lack of proper maintenance or if an accident 
creates a hazard, then, as is the case in other parts of the country, 
they will have to resort interrupting service. It is impossible to do 
otherwise and at the same time protect Canadian travellers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not the same everywhere. In the Gaspé, Radio-Canada has 
practically been taken off the airwaves. And now the government 
also wants to make cuts in transportation. It is not the same 
everywhere.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Transport at least give us a guarantee 
today in the House that he will take the necessary action to have the 
passenger train service maintained along the entire 
Matapédia-Gaspé line?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we are now looking into a number of different routes, 
especially fairly short ones. We are considering ways to continue 
the service referred to by the hon. member. The decision cannot be 
made now, because investigations and studies have not yet been

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
continue to ask questions about the flag program because it is very 
symbolic of something the government is doing wrong. It 
symbolizes two things. One is that the government has very poor 
spending priorities. It will shut down the lighthouses, it will shut 
down the coast guard in my province and then it spends far more 
money on the flag program. Also, there is no unity plan coming out 
of the minister's office. There is no plan A and no plan B. There is a 
plan F for flags and that is it.
<P>
	Will the minister ever come out with a comprehensive plan for 
national unity, or do we just have to find it in between the cracks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member was 
absolutely right when he said there is something symbolic. 
Obviously, there is something symbolic in the fact that in the riding 
of Fraser Valley East, one in 13 households have thought this 
program was worthwhile.
<P>
	I think I made the point yesterday that the flag program is only 
part of an overall government approach that seeks to build for 
Canadians a sense of ownership of their country. Flying a flag is 
not going to save the country but it is certainly giving Canadians a 
positive public expression of their belief in the capacity of this 
great country. It has obviously struck a cord with a lot of 
Canadians, including the hon. member who used his own fax lines 
at considerable cost to the taxpayers to fax my office in Ottawa 
from his office in British Columbia to get the flags.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
people the minister needs to talk to about national unity are the 
separatists in Quebec. The rest of  us are already proud Canadians 
and we do not need a flag to prove it. Her flag plan is a failure. Of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5115"> 5115 </A></B>
<P>
all the flags the minister has sent out, only 8 per cent have gone to 
the people of Quebec. When the people in the west want to order a 
flag they have to go to their MP's office or phone in on the French 
only line because it is the only line that is open.
<P>
	How many separatists in Quebec does the minister really think 
she is going to persuade to become federalists with this flag 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an unfortunate 
manifestation of the narrowness of the hon. member if he thinks it 
is only one part of the country that needs to work on the links that 
are going to keep this country together.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	In fact, 2,677 households in the member's riding obviously 
thought the Canadian flag was important enough that they wanted 
to fly one.
<P>
	I would have to say that with the kind of narrow view expressed 
by members of the Reform Party, I think it is unfortunate that 
instead of working with the government to try to build this nation, 
they are only interested in scoring cheap political points.

<P>
	Canada has taken a leading role on the world ban of land mines, 
most recently this week with the announcements by the Minister of 
National Defence of the destruction of two-thirds of Canada's stock 
of land mines, and by the Minister for International Cooperation of 
an additional $2 million to clear land mines around the world.

progress on this issue? Is there reason to hope that the scourge of 
land mines may be removed from this earth?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of 
the conference was to bring together like minded countries from 
around the world to work toward the goal of a global ban on the 
heinous weapons which are anti-personnel mines.
<P>
	The conference has already had a demonstrable effect. The 
number of countries that have committed themselves to such a ban 
increased from some 14 a year ago to over 47 today in time to 
participate in this conference. We hope that more countries will 
join this accelerating  bandwagon in time to have a really strong 
resolution on these weapons at the UN this fall.
<P>

governments but also parliamentarians and NGOs active in this

<P>
	The government is still facing lawsuits on the order of $660 
million following cancellation of the Pearson airport contract. And 
this is all because the Liberals, since coming to power, have refused

	Is the minister not admitting that the federal government is 
sitting back and doing nothing while it waits for the courts to 
decide how much Canadian taxpayers will have to pay for the 
mistakes of this government, which is trying to protect its friends 
involved in the privatization of Pearson?

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order under Beauchesne, which is very 
clear. The President of the Treasury Board said earlier that my 
colleague made false statements, which is tantamount to accusing 
the member for Richmond-Wolfe of lying in the House.
<P>
	The member came at this honestly, referring to remarks made by 
the minister, which can be found on page 5059 of Hansard:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Quebec, the proportion of anglophones and allophones is nearly 20 per cent, 
and consequently we have a proportionate number of bilingual public servants 
which reflects the needs of the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are quoting the minister. So my colleague made no false 
allegation. Mr. Speaker, I ask the President of the Treasury Board 
to withdraw his remarks.

Board is here. If he wishes to add anything to these comments, I

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
false allegations that have been made show clearly through the hon.

my opinion, show disrespect for the dignity of the House and the 
other hon. members.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This is an unfortunate tendency, and one which ought not to exist

false personal allegations, should stop attributing motives which 
are false, should stop claiming that any Quebecer who does not 
follow their way of thinking, for one reason or another, is a traitor 
to his race and his roots.
<P>
	The question from the opposition members needs careful 
rereading, and it will be seen to contain false allegations that are 
not based on fact, that are contrary to reality, that are evidence of a 
type of effrontery and arrogance that ought never to be tolerated in 
this House.

debates which comes very close to crossing the line into 
unparliamentary language.
<P>
	I would like, if I may, to ask all of the hon. members to cease 
using inflammatory language during our debates. We have seen 
today that one side has interpreted the matter one way, and the 
other side, another way. I would simply ask you not to use terms 
like ``false'', because they stir up controversy here in the House.
<P>
	I do find, however, concerning the point of order, that the 
minister has explained what he meant to say with use of the term 
``false''. I believe that he ought to have withdrawn the words in his 
explanation, and I would ask him that directly. I would ask the 
minister, after his explanation, whether he will withdraw the word 
``false'', which he used here in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, now that you have given me the 
opportunity to explain clearly why I responded as I did, I consider 
the allegation withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Very well. If there is another point of order, I will 
listen to it, but I consider this one closed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask you to take this point of order under 
advisement, for his first reply just added insult to injury. If stating 
that the minister is a francophone and an elected member for 
Quebec is false, than I wish he would reveal his true identity.
<P>

will get back to the House.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-55, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (high risk offenders), the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Records 
Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Department of the 
Solicitor General Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with interest to the comments of my colleagues from all 
parties represented in the House on Bill C-55. I would like to 
indicate that there are good portions in this bill. However, we do 
not think it goes far enough and I will be dealing with some of 
those aspects during my speech today.
<P>
	On September 14 of last year an article appeared in the <I>Financial 
Post</I> containing figures from Correctional Services Canada. These 
figures, the author said, and I concur, are worrisome and clearly 
indicate the system does not protect the public from convicted 
murderers and other dangerous predators. These figures 
demonstrate a need for additional Criminal Code changes which go 
far beyond Bill C-55.
<P>
	According to a chart furnished by the solicitor general to Diane 
Francis, editor of the <I>Financial Post</I>, between 1989 and 1994 no 
fewer than 78 people committed murder while they were on 
conditional release. This means 15 innocent people were killed 
each year in this country during that period of time by people who 
were on conditional release.
<P>
	The same figures reveal that some 4,960 persons convicted of a 
lesser violent offence such as child molestation, manslaughter, rape 
or attempted murder repeated their crimes while on conditional 
release. Miss Francis concluded: ``Those figures are awful''. I 
concur.
<P>
	Statistics do not provide an adequate picture of how repeat 
offenders become progressively more violent. Therefore, I would 
like to provide the House with evidence that supports a need not 
only for Bill C-55, but a need for additional Criminal Code 
amendments as well.
<P>
	Since 1975, Allan Wayne Walsh of Mission, B.C. had more than 
60 convictions for kidnapping, confining women, sex crimes, 
robbery and weapons offences. In 1983, he was convicted of 26 
offences, including two counts of rape, and sentenced to 25 years in 
prison. Ten years later he was out on parole. Within months he used 
a knife to try to rape one woman and then raped and robbed 
another. On September 21, 1995 he was convicted of seven new 
offences, including sexual assault, which led the crown to have him 
declared a dangerous offender.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5119"> 5119 </A></B>
<P>
	These seven additional offences never would have occurred if 
Walsh had served his full 25-year sentence. Seven innocent people 
would have remained unharmed if this dangerous offender had 
served out his full sentence of 25 years. I ask the question: Why 
do we continue to release high risk offenders into society to go 
on to reoffend?
<P>
	Reform believes in truth in sentencing for violent criminals in 
the absence of a dangerous offender designation. Truth in 
sentencing means that if a 25-year sentence is imposed a 25-year 
sentence is served. In essence we support no parole for violent 
offenders; no reduction in the term decided by the court on 
consideration of the facts.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Why would government members want a court, a judge, perhaps 
a jury to consider all of the facts and the circumstances and impose 
a penalty based on those facts and circumstances and then have a 
parole board second guess them and reduce the time that a violent 
offender spends in jail? They will not answer that question.
<P>
	Ronald Richard McCauley, another B.C. rapist, was sentenced to 
17 years after two vicious rapes in which the victims were left for 
dead. At the time of sentencing McCauley had a criminal record 
dating back to 1969. When McCauley came up for parole in 1992 
he admitted to the parole board that if he had not been caught he 
would have become a serial killer like Clifford Olson. The board, 
noting that McCauley appeared to benefit only superficially from 
treatment, turned down his request for early parole.
<P>
	In 1994, two years later, McCauley got statutory release. 
According to a September 25, 1995 newspaper article, Mr. 
McCauley is now a suspect in the murder of two Vancouver 
prostitutes.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposes that Bill C-55 be amended by 
eliminating statutory release. Melanie Carpenter would not have 
been murdered if Mr. Auger had not been free on statutory release.
<P>
	In 1983 James Ronald Robinson of Ottawa was convicted of 
manslaughter in the stabbing death of Roxanne Nairn, a 
17-year-old grade 12 student. He was sentenced to three years on a 
manslaughter conviction, but was released early, despite being 
caught trying to smuggle hashish into jail while returning from an 
unescorted temporary release.
<P>
	In 1990 Robinson spent two years in jail for raping and 
threatening to kill a woman he had lived with after his release from 
prison. On March 6, 1995 he was charged with another count of 
sexual assault.
<P>
	Despite having consecutive sentences adding up to 27 years and 
despite having committed crimes while on parole, Claude Forget 
was given an escorted pass to visit  his sister in 1993. He escaped. 
Two months later he shot two police officers.
<P>
	In September of 1995 he was up for parole after serving only a 
fraction of his sentence because the parole loophole required any 
new sentence to be merged with an existing sentence. In Forget's 
case this meant he was eligible to apply for parole almost as soon 
as he was convicted of the attempted murders. Forget was granted a 
full parole hearing in December of 1995.
<P>
	In 1986 Martin Dubuc, a Montreal hockey coach, was convicted 
of molesting team members. After his release from prison he did 
not let a lifetime ban on coaching in Quebec stop him. He changed 
locales, becoming a coach and eventually president of the minor 
hockey association of southwest Montreal. As well, three different 
school boards in the Montreal area hired him as a substitute 
teacher. In September of 1995 he pleaded guilty to using the 
telephone to threaten boys aged 10 to 13.
<P>
	More and more of these types of cases will occur unless 
additional amendments are made to the Criminal Code that go 
beyond the scope of Bill C-55. There will be no discernible impact 
on repeat offender rates unless the government is willing to go the 
extra mile.
<P>
	The Liberal's soft on crime approach to justice is not working. 
What we need to do is implement zero tolerance for violent and sex 
offenders, which means we come down hard on those criminals 
who prey on the weak and vulnerable members of our society.
<P>
	Under Bill C-55 high risk offenders will still be released back 
into society and Canadians will still remain at risk, even though 
there are some minimal forms of supervision in place. The only 
way to truly protect Canadians from high risk offenders is to keep 
them locked up where there is absolutely no risk of them 
reoffending. In the case of any serious personal injury, all of those 
convicted should serve out their full sentences.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Reform proposes that Bill C-55 be amended for greater certainty 
to require courts to automatically place a dangerous offender 
finding on any person who commits on two or more separate 
occasions an offence constituting a serious personal injury offence 
and subject them to an indeterminate period of incarceration.
<P>
	Reform also recommends, in support of our colleague from 
Surrey White Rock-South Langley private member's Bill C-254, 
that Bill C-55 be amended to allow for dangerous offender findings 
to be made at any time after sentencing. The crown must be given 
the right to seek dangerous offender status for persons convicted of 
serious crimes causing serious personal injury at any time during 
that offender's penitentiary sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5120"> 5120 </A></B>
<P>
	Why would we release an offender if it is clear that offender 
has not been rehabilitated and will go on to target innocent 
children or adults on release? That is what Bill C-55 will do.
<P>
	Reform also supports amending Bill C-55 to expand the list of 
criminal offences on which a dangerous offender application may 
be brought to include pedophiles and other sexual predators. There 
is probably no crime short of murder that offends the sensibilities 
and the values of a community more than the sexual assault of 
children. In many ways it is the most unconscionable of criminal 
acts because it victimizes the weakest, most vulnerable and most 
innocent among us.
<P>
	It is not surprising that the public recoils in horror with the news 
that a pedophile is being released into the community after 
completing his jail sentence, particularly when the convicted 
pedophile is considered a high risk to reoffend.
<P>
	In December 1995 Manitobans were warned about the danger of 
a released sexual offender who police claimed was a high risk to 
reoffend. The Winnipeg police were concerned Osborne could 
either attack someone he knew or simply attack a stranger. Douglas 
James Osborne was released from Stony Mountain Institution on 
November 23, 1995 after serving a three-year sentence for sexual 
assault. He was not to be under any supervision on his release.
<P>
	Also in December 1995 the York Regional Police in Ontario 
issued a public alert warning to York and Durham residents of the 
release of Donald John Jones. The police considered there was a 
high risk that this sexual sadist, as termed by the police, would 
attempt to attack other women. Jones refused to take treatment for 
his sexual deviance while incarcerated in Kingston Penitentiary. He 
had a criminal record dating back to 1970 when he was sentenced 
to five years for sexually assaulting a 59-year-old Whitby woman 
in 1981. Jones attacked an 18-year-old convenience store clerk in 
1986 while on a pass from the Kingston pen. He also sexually 
assaulted a 78-year-old woman in 1987 while out on another 
temporary pass. Is it not wonderful that these people are allowed 
passes before there is any assurance they have been rehabilitated? 
They go on and on to commit offence after offence against innocent 
people.
<P>
	Reform proposes Bill C-55 be amended to eliminate any type of 
temporary release for sexual offenders. As stated earlier, we 
propose Bill C-55 be amended to include sex offenders in the 
dangerous offenders designation. We also propose that the review 
of indeterminate sentence of sex offenders include the examination 
and recommendation of at least two psychiatrists.
<P>
	Sex offenders, especially child molesters, have a high repeat 
rate. The only way to keep our children safe, the only way to 
prevent sexual predators from taking victims and destroying the 
life of another innocent child is to  keep them locked up, keep them 
incarcerated, keep them away from those they wish to target, keep 
<P>
them incarcerated indefinitely as dangerous offenders until there is 
absolutely no risk of them reoffending.
<P>
	I do not think there is anyone in Canada, certainly not in this 
House, who would want to see someone after they have served their 
term of imprisonment, on being completely rehabilitated, kept in 
prison. That is not the point. The point is that we must protect 
society by ensuring that those who have a high risk to reoffend are 
not released back into society.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	No one should be released from prison if they exhibit signs or 
evidence they will reoffend. We have the power to protect the 
Melanie Carpenters of this country. We have the power to protect 
all the citizens of this country. Bill C-55 moves in that direction but 
it does not go far enough.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to read for members of this House an 
Edmonton <I>Sun</I> editorial written by Linda Slobodian:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On July 16, a 36-year-old Edmonton man was sentenced to 71<I>2 years in jail for 
repeatedly sexually assaulting two relatives when they were little girls. He was found 
guilty on numerous sexual offences.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yet less than three months later he's back out on the street. Little wonder one of 
his victims, now 26, says she feels ``betrayed'' by the court system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I felt justice had been served'', says the victim who testified the assaults started 
when she was three or four, soon progressed to intercourse, and lasted a number of 
years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Now that he's walking free, I feel it was a waste of time getting up there and 
mutilating ourselves in front of everyone at the trial. It was so difficult, embarrassing 
giving all those details'', she says.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Court heard the convicted man's abuse of the other victim, her sister who is now 
24, started when she was about four and also progressed to intercourse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The convicted man faces more charges, involving other young relatives, for 
which he's scheduled to go on trial in the middle of this month.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How can it be that someone who gets such a heavy sentence for deplorable crimes 
against children gets out so soon?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He put in an application for an appeal. He's not get been granted one but on Sept. 
27 he was released on bail.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That isn't all that unusual in our justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The victims received a call Tuesday from his parole officer advising them he'd 
been released a few days earlier.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I flipped out'' says the victims' mother. ``He was found guilty of rape, among 
other things. We phoned (Justice Minister) Brian Evans. His staff said, `That's the 
justice system'''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the justice system we are presently burdened with in this 
country and that we speak out against and implore the justice 
minister to do something about. It is due to the bleeding heart 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5121"> 5121 </A></B>
<P>
mentality which continues to  exist in this place to place the rights 
of the criminal ahead of the rights of those two innocent rape 
victims. It is due to the fact that we have a federal justice minister 
who, in the words of one grieving father whose daughter was 
murdered, is a friend of the criminal. The justice minister has now 
been labelled by citizens of this country as a friend of the criminal.
<P>
	Reform proposes we drastically overhaul the justice system. Our 
first priority will be to make the protection of society and the rights 
of the victim the guiding principles of justice in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague's speech on this 
important piece of legislation.
<P>
	I wonder if it would be possible for the member to perhaps clear 
up a misunderstanding that arose in this House yesterday when we 
were also debating Bill C-55. The member for Cape Breton-The 
Sydneys was talking about an unfortunate incident in a riding in 
Canada where there was a dangerous offender released in that 
community. It was not until the general public got involved in 
drawing the attention of the authorities to the fact that they did not 
want this individual loose in their community that something was 
done and pressure was brought to bear. Eventually Mr. Oatway 
voluntarily went back to jail in British Columbia.
<P>
	It is my understanding that Bill C-55 cannot retroactively apply 
to dangerous offenders, no matter how bad these people are, no 
matter whether they do not voluntarily undertake treatment while 
they are incarcerated. It is my understanding that it simply will not 
apply.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member from across the way led the House to believe 
yesterday that it would apply to individuals who are currently 
incarcerated.
<P>
	That is a great concern for Canadians at large who understand 
that we have a lot of inherently evil people presently incarcerated 
who are coming up for either parole or the end of their terms in jail. 
They will be released into society.
<P>
	Can the member shed any light as to whether Bill C-55 is really 
going to help society in that regard? It is my understanding, once 
again, that under the present system the crown prosecutor has to 
apply for the dangerous offender designation at the time of trial, 
that Bill C-55 will expand that window to be six months after 
conviction but that it will not apply to anyone who is in the system 
and has been there for longer since their conviction. I want to know 
if he agrees with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for bringing 
this matter to my attention. There is no question in my mind that 
this bill, if it becomes law in its present form, will not allow any 
prosecutor to deal with those who have already been convicted with 
regard to the dangerous offender provision.
<P>
	That provision is provided for the cases that will be brought 
forward after this bill has been passed. It has expanded the window, 
the time that the crown can apply for the dangerous offender status, 
to six months.
<P>
	Of course, what we would like to do is amend the bill in this area 
to have dangerous offender status apply at any time during that 
period of incarceration, particularly at the end of the warrant of a 
violent offender.
<P>
	The reasoning and rationale behind this is simply that if a 
dangerous offender application has not been successful or has not 
even been applied, and an individual who has committed a violent 
offence has served his time and at the end of his warrant period has 
not been rehabilitated, if there is clear evidence that this person 
represents a high risk to reoffend, why are we releasing him?
<P>
	If we would expand the provision that my hon. friend referred to 
so that the prosecutor could apply to the courts for an indeterminant 
sentence application, the dangerous offender application, at the end 
of the sentence we would have a workable tool to determine 
whether the Augers, a prime suspect in the murder of Melanie 
Carpenter, ought to be released.
<P>
	In that case Auger was released on statutory release. The 
officials were concerned that he was a high risk to members of 
society. There was not a thing they could do about it because there 
were no tools within the law for them to do anything about it.
<P>
	We will be making this amendment to this bill at the appropriate 
time to expand that window of time from six months to the full 
warrant period in order to provide the tool that I have just described 
within the justice system.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-55.
<P>
	The efforts of the justice minister, the champion of the social 
engineers on that side of the House, are probably a little better than 
they have been in any bill that I have seen in the last three years.
<P>
	However, as usual there are some things in there that have to be 
fixed, there are flaws and there are some changes that need to be 
made. Hopefully we will be able to see that accomplished at the 
committee meetings.
<P>
	The sad part about it and the fear that I have is that behind closed 
doors in the justice department there are decisions already being 
made as to what can be or what will be allowed with regard to this 
bill. We have seen it happen before to bills coming from the 
committees.
<P>
	If this justice minister says there will be no amendments to this 
bill, and he says it to the members of  his caucus who serve on that 
committee, that is the way it will be regardless of the debate, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5122"> 5122 </A></B>
<P>
regardless of the discussion and regardless of the witnesses. I have 
seen that happen and unfortunately it is going to happen again in 
my view.
<P>
	This bill is need of amendments but the dictatorship of this 
government has already indicated it will not be changed. Decisions 
are made behind closed doors and then all the members of the 
party, the justice minister, the social engineer, will be required to 
rise in their seats and vote according to what he says. That seems to 
be the democratic process, and I use that term loosely. This 
government does not seem to understand the democratic process.
<P>
	What a great thing it would be for Canadian people if democracy 
truly existed when it comes to making decisions on behalf of 
Canadian people. We could back up a few years, during the time of 
Trudeau, when people expressed loud and clear things they wanted 
and things they did not. The voices were being heard. They tried to 
participate.
<P>
	I remember when they brought in the metric system there was 
quite a outcry. People did not want it but it did not matter. The 
people in this place do better. So we got the metric system anyway 
whether you wanted it or not as a Canadian.
<P>
	I remember the language laws coming in and the great debates 
that took place across the country. The debates had no play. It is 
what this government wanted to do.
<P>
	I remember the GST. There could not have been more 
resounding voices in the land by the people saying no to the GST, 
but they got it anyway because the little dictators who sit in this 
place made the decision and that is the way it is going to be.
<P>
	That is just the way it was through the Trudeau years, that is the 
way it was through the Mulroney years and that is the way it has 
been during this session. Decisions are made behind closed doors 
and the government will do that whether you like it or not.
<P>
	I talked to a number of backbenchers who have said that they 
would like to vote against a bill but they do not dare. Or they would 
like to vote against this bill but they do not dare because in the 
Liberal Party you are punished if you do not do as you are told.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That did not stop Silye.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I understand there are some people sitting over 
here, there are a lot of good committee members who used to 
serve-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The Chair will not 
accept members being named either by the person who has the 
floor or people who are waiting to get the floor possibility. I would 
ask you to keep those matters in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point I am trying to make is 
that you have to do as you are told if you belong to a certain party in 
this place. That is too bad because there are a lot of people on that 
side of the House as well as this side who would truly like to 
represent their people even when it comes to Bill C-55. They would 
like to hear their voices with regard to issues and would like to be 
able to express that through a vote in the House, but it does not 
work that way.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Three things bother me about Bill C-55. First is electronic 
monitoring. A provision in the bill states that a person only has to 
be a suspect in order to be monitored. This person does not need to 
have a conviction or a record or even been charged. The provision 
states that if we think you are he kind of a person who might 
commit this or that crime, you would qualify for electronic 
monitoring.
<P>
	Many people would think that is a fairly strange process for a 
country like Canada to engage in. Some people would even go so 
far as to say we are moving toward a police state when we start 
electronically monitoring people who have neither been charged or 
convicted of anything. I find that rather strange.
<P>
	I wonder if that kind of system would even come close to passing 
a charter challenge. Many things I thought should pass a charter 
challenge in this land never did, however, this one is very 
questionable. I imagine there would have to be some changes there. 
How can they go around this country and say that it is okay to put 
an electronic monitoring device on someone because they think 
they might do this or that? That is a serious flaw which needs to be 
addressed.
<P>
	Second, I have a problem with the aboriginal clauses. They will 
go into a community where an aboriginal is released and do special 
things in order to make that release successful. I cannot say that is 
wrong in itself. I see nothing wrong with that. But if it is good for 
that community, then why would it not be good for another 
community?
<P>
	Why is the government always so quick to identify a group in a 
piece of legislation, set them aside and say: ``We're going to do 
something special because they are this or they are that''? If I were 
to suggest something like that in the House I am sure there would 
be screams of racism, prejudice and everything under the sun. That 
would happen if I would dare take a group of people and suggest we 
ought to do something special for them but not for the rest of 
Canadians. I find that rather strange. But if it is a good idea, which I 
think it is, and if it is found to be a good idea, then why stop there? 
Why not do it for community <I>a</I>, community <I>b</I> and community <I>c</I>? 
Why not go through the whole list and do it? I believe that has to be 
addressed and I hope it will be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5123"> 5123 </A></B>
<P>
	The third point, which is probably the worst of all, bothers me. 
It is the provision that a criminal can be declared a dangerous 
offender six months after the time of sentencing. There will be 
six months after application to declare a convicted criminal a 
dangerous offender. At the end of the six months, if he is not 
declared a dangerous offender, then it is my understanding that 
it can never be done again. I find that really silly. I do not know 
any other word I could use.
<P>
	When I was the principal of a school, the students would have 
loved to have a rule that would say: ``In a 10-month year, we'll 
evaluate you in the sixth month, and if you've been good up until 
then, we'll pass you into the next grade''. They would not have to 
worry about the next four months. I am sure that a lot of people in 
prison are thinking the same thing.
<P>
	If government members do not believe for a moment that these 
convicts do not know how to play the game, how to avoid certain 
things, how to get certain favours, then I would suggest they go to 
the prisons and talk to the guards, talk to the caseworkers, talk to 
the frontline workers and find out just how wrong they are.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	What is wrong with leaving the door open and being able to call 
them a dangerous offender at any time? Application can be made to 
do that.
<P>
	I will go back two or three years to the family and friends of 
Melanie Carpenter and how they could have probably today been 
enjoying that young woman if there would have had something in 
place that would have said to her killer: ``Auger, you are not getting 
out because you are a dangerous offender''.
<P>
	All the psychological reports, case reports, the frontline workers, 
the guards, the warden and everybody said: ``This fellow should 
not be let out because he is not ready to go into society. He will hurt 
somebody''. However, our hands were tied. Nobody could do 
anything about it because he had served his time. The result? 
Melanie Carpenter no longer exists.
<P>
	What is wrong with leaving the door open? If they were able to 
discover after seven or eight years that this fellow Auger, who 
killed Melanie Carpenter, was a dangerous offender and would hurt 
people again, then why did they not make it possible to say that he 
was a dangerous offender? Why did they not do it in this bill?
<P>
	The number one priority that I keep hearing from the social 
engineers on that side of the House is the protection of people by 
preventing crime. What better prevention is there than to keep a 
dangerous, violent person behind bars? However, we cannot do it if 
we are going to say we have to declare that within six months.
<P>
	After a six-month period goes by and it has been decided the 
person being evaluated will not be declared a dangerous offender, 
what happens if all of a sudden he  tells us where to put our 
rehabilitation programs and that he will not take treatment, which 
we cannot force him to do? We should be able to re-open the case 
since this guy is not going to take any treatment and never wanted 
to do anything about his problems. He is going to be released some 
day, he thinks. Let us declare him a dangerous offender.
<P>
	I would rather see something at the end after a long period of 
time that might lift that classification, if it was deserving, rather 
than after a long period of time we could not put that classification 
on him because of Bill C-55.
<P>
	If the government is so keen and so interested in prevention and 
protection then why does it not do that? I am sure the Canadian 
people would applaud that decision. As my colleague from Calgary 
Northeast knows after visiting a lot of prisons, the guards, the 
frontline officers, the caseworkers and the psychologists would all 
appreciate being able to have an influence on the decision makers 
who release these individuals. That is why we believe that the 
parole system should be placed in the hands of these people on the 
front line, those who know best.
<P>
	I will go back to the school idea when I was a principal. It would 
been nice for my staff and I to have gone into the community, and 
because they were nice to us or because they did us favours, we 
could have appointed a pass and fail board from the community. At 
the end of the year we could just bring them in and bring the kids 
before them one at a time and they could decide what to do with the 
person. I know what the people would say. They would ask: ``How 
can I know? You have worked with him or her all year. You should 
make that decision''.
<P>
	I believe that if someone is going to work for a number of years 
with a prisoner then he or she should be the one to have the biggest 
influence and say on whether that person qualifies to go back into 
society. It sounds like common sense to me. But no. The good old 
boys and the good old girls have to be appointed to serve on a board 
which I think at this time is doing a better job than in the past. In 
the past it was a dismal failure simply because the people in those 
positions were making decisions and they were not knowledgeable 
enough to know exactly what should be accomplished. Does that 
not make sense?
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Just think, June 30 every year, I could have gone home, all my 
teaching staff could have gone home. We could have brought in 
half a dozen people from the community and they could decide 
whether the kids would pass or fail. We could dump a few papers in 
their laps and let them decide.
<P>
	We have to stop shirking responsibility for our decisions. We 
need some accountability. Who is accountable for Melanie 
Carpenter's death? The killer? Yes. But he should never have been 
out of prison.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5124"> 5124 </A></B>
<P>
	The government knows of many examples. It knows about 
Oatway, Auger and many more. Why will it not stop them? Why 
not fix the bill so that anyone can be declared a dangerous offender 
at any time?
<P>
	Canadians are continually telling pollsters that 70 per cent of 
them want capital punishment. What is wrong with members in this 
place listening to the people and giving them the opportunity to 
express their feelings in a referendum? Give us a chance to find 
out. Let the people speak. But not the Liberals. They say they know 
best.
<P>
	Let the Darlene Boyds, let the Debbie Mahaffys, let the victims 
and survivors of victims across the land know that we support what 
they as taxpayers want from us, that section 745 be abolished.
<P>
	When Bill C-55 was introduced the minister had the police 
chiefs all around him. He was smiling, he had their support and that 
is good. I am glad he had their support. But where were they on Bill 
C-45? We did not see them then. I saw most of those people and 
Scott Newark, executive officer of the Canadian Police Association 
sitting up here waiting for us to vote to put section 745 out of 
business. When they saw the vote on the private member's bill 
which would have done that, they were very pleased and they felt 
that the voice of the people had been heard.
<P>
	All of a sudden the miracle worker, the champion of the social 
engineers came out from behind closed doors and says: ``This is 
better''. The worst part about it is that he convinced all of his 
colleagues who initially wanted to abolish section 745. All of a 
sudden they came out as supporters of Bill C-45. I wonder if they 
really supported it or if they just continue to do what they are told? 
I am sure it is the latter.
<P>
	When this bill goes to committee and the witnesses come before 
the group, I really hope there will be a genuine effort on the part of 
the government to allow those witnesses, most of whom are 
ordinary Canadians, to have their voices heard and be incorporated 
into the decisions that are made. That would be a nice change. I just 
hope that will be done.
<P>
	There are flaws in the bill. It needs to be fixed. Give the 
Canadian people a voice and fix it.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on the 
speech of the hon. member for Wild Rose. I would call to his 
attention that paragraph 753(4) on page 5 of the bill as printed 
states in part: ``If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous 
offender, it shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary 
for an indeterminate period''. I underscore the word 
``indeterminate''. It is a serious sentence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> The member should be civil and respect debate. 
He should be quiet and maintain decorum in the House.
<P>
	I would like to assure the member that the government is 
definitely committed to community safety. This remains a 
government priority. There is no debate about it. Hence, this bill to 
amend the Criminal Code and other acts.
<P>
	The member alluded to electronic monitoring, that it could be 
subject to charter challenges, et cetera. I remind him that in the 
charter itself section 1 indicates that limits to freedom may be 
imposed when a higher goal, to protect society at large, becomes 
paramount. This limitation to freedom is not taken lightly by the 
courts.
<P>
	The member may want to learn a few of the precedents 
established by the Supreme Court of Canada. The goal being 
attained must be laudable. We all agree that we have to protect 
Canadian citizens from dangerous offenders. Also, the electronic 
monitoring approach has a reasonable basis of success and it must 
be made less restrictive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> How is it going to work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> If the member does not know how it will work, 
then how can he say that it will not work? The member should be 
courteous and listen. The member belongs to a party which 
purports to be concerned about high risk offenders, yet the member 
is objecting to a judicial restraint, electronic monitoring, which 
will not likely be visible in its restriction of freedom. The Reform 
Party cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I would suggest that the Reform Party is concerned mainly after 
the fact, after the commission of an offence, after serious injury to 
a Canadian citizen, and is not prepared to support a provision in the 
amendment which may in fact prevent such an offence. Even in the 
field of medicine, prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.
<P>
	I would like the member to kindly reconsider his views for the 
greater safety of Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly glad the member 
was not looking at me when he talked about being heckled and not 
listened to. I was listening intently.
<P>
	It is too bad the hon. member was not here for my entire speech. 
He came storming out here in the last couple of minutes and by 
golly, he has all the bases covered. If he had heard the speech 
properly, he would have heard me say nothing against electronic 
monitoring.
<P>
	I was only wondering if this kind of law, which would make it 
possible to electronically monitor those who have not even been 
convicted or charged but who are only suspects, would pass a 
charter test. I am sure the hon. member believes it might. I am not 
so sure that it will. There should have been a little more care taken 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5125"> 5125 </A></B>
<P>
in  putting the bill together. If it has to be challenged, then it will be 
challenged.
<P>
	Many people I have talked to have said that when we start 
electronically monitoring those who are only suspects, we are 
moving very close to a police state. We do not want that in Canada. 
If indeed that is true, we need to talk about it and get rid of that idea 
if that is what it is leading to.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	There is a six-month limitation. There is a six-month period 
where a person can be declared dangerous. Why only six months? 
That is all I am asking. Why does the bill say six months? Why not 
leave it open ended? Ten months from now they may wish they had, 
but that will be too late. Why do we want to limit ourselves? Leave 
it up to the people who work in the prisons. Leave it up to the 
guards and those who have the expertise to let us know when it is 
time for the person to leave and whether they consider him to be 
dangerous. If they do, then for heavens' sake, do not let him out.
<P>
	If that had been done in the Melanie Carpenter case which the 
member knows well, Melanie Carpenter would be alive. The 
member knows very well that the killer of that girl was declared to 
be a real threat the day he was let out. The member knows that and 
he is willing to allow this bill to go through without addressing the 
Melanie Carpenters of this land. Who are these guys for, the 
criminal? Time after time after time they do what they have to to 
protect the rights of the criminal. What about the rights of the 
victim?
<P>
	When are we going to stop having laws written by the lawyers 
for the lawyers? More court cases, more appeals. Declare him a 
dangerous offender, appeal it. That will be another court case. We 
have to keep these guys working. Keep the legal industry booming. 
Use a little common sense is what we are talking about. That 
six-month thing the member mentioned is ridiculous.
<P>
	The bill is the start of a good thing. This is the best effort yet by 
the justice minister. That is what I believe, but it needs to be fixed.
<P>
	If the member and other members of his party are allowed to do 
their job, which I strongly doubt they are, then maybe we could end 
up with a bill that is worth having. This one, as it stands, is not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to talk a little about Bill C-55 today.
<P>
	When I was on my feet about two days ago speaking on Bill 
C-45, I was talking about the member for Kingston and the Islands 
who was very worried about how he gets hoodwinked by the bills in 
this place. I think he will be hoodwinked again by this one. He has 
said publicly that he does not read all the bills but he really should 
read this one.
<P>
	I think he is about to be hoodwinked not in the way the Canadian 
people are going to be hoodwinked by this, thinking that it is 
actually a good bill. He is going to be hoodwinked because he 
thinks we are getting too tough on criminals. He actually voted 
against Bill C-45 because he was worried we were getting too 
tough. It absolutely amazes me. It may be very disappointing for 
him that the Reform Party is having such an effect on the 
government side of the House that we are beginning to make some 
progress in the area of justice reforms.
<P>
	Getting tough on criminals works. I know the member for 
Kingston and the Islands feels he gets hoodwinked by these things 
but getting tough on criminals really does work.
<P>
	I used some statistics the other day which are worth repeating in 
connection with this bill. It reinforces the idea that if we get tough 
on these people they stop using the system. That is a very good 
argument also why we should not have this six-month window 
which is built into this bill for determining whether or not someone 
is a dangerous offender.
<P>
	They are going to use that. They are going to use the system. 
They study the law books while they are locked up in the clink. 
They are going to look at the law books and say that they only have 
to be good for the six-month period and then all hell breaks loose 
but it is okay, because they got past that dangerous offender 
window.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to present some statistics that support the view that 
getting tough on crime works very well. In 1989 the bureau for 
justice statistics issued some estimates of how many crimes were 
prevented in the United States while criminals were locked up 
rather than walking on the streets. This was studied between 1973 
and 1989, a 16-year period which is an extensive study.
<P>
	Analyst Patrick Langan of the bureau for justice statistics said 
that between 1973 and 1989 locking criminals up instead of 
allowing them to go free cut the number of rapes by 66,000, 
robberies by 323,000, assaults by 380,000, and burglaries by 3.3 
million. The conclusion of the report was that imprisonment 
clearly contributes to major cuts in the number and cost of violent 
crimes. That does not take into account the physical cost in injury 
and the monetary cost that comes from having had these people out 
destroying people's property.
<P>
	In 1995 another study was done at Princeton. Criminologists 
John DiIulio and Anne Morrison Piehl wrote a report. They 
estimated the actual cost savings to society when felons were 
locked in prison as opposed to walking the streets. They studied 
100 convicted felons who offended at the median rate, that is, some 
of them reoffended when they were let out and some of them did 
not. They found that the average cost to society for a felon who was 
released was $4.6 million but the average  cost of keeping them 
locked up was $2.5 million. It was half the cost to society in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5126"> 5126 </A></B>
<P>
monetary terms to keep these people locked up. As I mentioned 
earlier, that does not even take into account all the physical damage 
that is done which really destroys people's lives.
<P>
	There is an additional study which was published on August 29, 
1995 in the <I>Investors' Business Daily</I>. There was a full page of 
justice information headed: ``Does crime pay? Not if criminals do 
hard time''. Mr. Barnes wrote that in 1994, University of Arizona 
economist Michael Block and researcher Steven Twist compared 
crime victimization rates with imprisonment rates from 1960 to 
1992. That is a 32-year study. They found that the 10 states which 
had the highest imprisonment rates experienced an 8 per cent drop 
in violent crime over the period, while the 10 states with the lowest 
imprisonment rates saw their violent crime rates jump by 51 per 
cent over the same period.
<P>
	How much proof do we need to see that keeping these bad guys 
locked up actually saves damage, saves costs and it really helps 
society? Surely those on the other side of the House who are always 
arguing for women's rights, for rights for the less fortunate in 
society, should be interested in those statistics which indicated that 
66,000 rapes and 323,000 assaults were prevented by having 
people locked up.
<P>
	I do not have any statistics for Canada but it stands to reason that 
we could transpose them at least at a 10 per cent level. We would 
see the enormous amount of money, the enormous amount of 
physical damage, the enormous amount of suffering we would be 
saving if we had a get tough approach to crime.
<P>
	As my colleagues have said, there are provisions in this bill that 
are a good step forward. We are very proud in the Reform Party that 
we have been able to push the justice minister this far. I really do 
wish that the bill also dealt with habitual repeat offenders who are 
only using our justice system for their own ends. I will give a 
couple of examples of the sorts of things I mean.
<P>
	The headline of an article in yesterday's Vancouver <I>Sun</I> reads: 
``Drug trafficker allowed to remain in Canada''. The piece reads: 
``The federal court has stayed a deportation order for an Iranian 
convicted of cocaine trafficking and assault. The order for Abdul 
Nasser Taher Azar was put on hold Tuesday pending the outcome 
of further legal proceedings in his case. Taher Azar is fighting 
deportation claiming he could face a death sentence if sent back to 
Iran''.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I probably have the largest Iranian community in the whole of 
Canada in my riding. The first words that come out of the mouths 
of refugee claimants, usually bogus, who call my office for 
assistance are: ``I'll be killed if I get sent back to Iran''. It is the 
very first sentence.
<P>
	So this guy claimed he would be killed if he were sent back to 
Iran. Immigration authorities consider him a risk to Canadian 
society. What happened? The federal court let him stay here.
<P>
	He has a wife and three children who live in Victoria. He said 
that he has changed his habits and will become a productive 
member of Canadian society. I cannot say how many times I have 
heard that nonsense. It is absolute nonsense.
<P>
	I could stand here the whole afternoon and give case after case in 
my riding of these people who use the system because they know 
how it works. They come in as bogus refugees, get married all of a 
sudden and have children. We know what that does. Then they can 
separate and spend years in court tying it up over custody battles 
while we pay them welfare to stay here and they keep saying that 
they are going to be killed if they get shipped out.
<P>
	Then what happens at the end of it? Two people in my riding 
went back to Iran of their own accord after arguing for four years 
that they would be killed. It is the most ridiculous nonsense and it 
goes on and on in cases like this.
<P>
	These are habitual repeat offenders, not dangerous offenders as 
dealt with in this bill. But I wish we had something in the bill to 
deal with the type of person who is really just using our system.
<P>
	I have a case in my riding right now that is typical of this, which 
I have been trying to get the immigration minister to act on. This 
person first came to Canada in the late 1970s, in the days when we 
actually had teeth in some of our laws, when we treated criminals 
like criminals. Very quickly it was discovered that he was a 
criminal. So he was deported.
<P>
	They actually deported people back then, but not today. We have 
1,300 people in Vancouver alone awaiting deportation, 906 of 
whom are from mainland China.
<P>
	So what did he do? The first chance he got after he was deported 
to Iran he raced over to Paris. Tell me how he could afford that 
when he claimed he had no money. A couple of years later he went 
to the Canadian embassy and applied again. Did he tell the officials 
that he had been previously deported from Canada? Not a chance. 
The next minute he was back here.
<P>
	About four years went by and the police were tailing him 
because he was forging passports so that other criminal friends of 
his could come in from Iran. I got a call in my office from a lady in 
the community who said: ``Everybody in Iran knew he was 
criminal. Why did you let him in?''
<P>
	I contacted the police and discovered they were investigating 
him for passport fraud. They picked him up for passport forgery on 
the day he was sworn in as a  Canadian citizen. The interesting part 
of this story is that he had sent someone else to stand in for him at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5127"> 5127 </A></B>
<P>
the swearing in ceremony. So it was not actually him who was 
sworn in. He only went to watch. It is amazing what these people 
do.
<P>
	His case for the passport forgery was dragged out and went on 
for a year and a half before the judge finally sentenced him to three 
months at home on probation. I would think that passport forgery 
goes to the very heart of our being as Canadians. He helps 
criminals come here and what does he get? Three months at home. 
That is where he did his business. It was a home based business. He 
did not pay any taxes or GST and here he was working at home.
<P>
	Then finally he was under another deportation order, so he 
appealed, if members can believe it, under the charter of rights. In 
the 1970s when he was first deported he did not have an interpreter 
present and therefore his human rights were infringed on.
<P>
	Now that case is tied up in the courts. The first hearing is next 
March. I am willing to bet he will be here for another eight years 
before we finally get rid of him. And the time we are paying him 
welfare and he is driving brand new cars. Now how does he buy 
those on welfare? I would like a little investigation into the source 
of his income.
<P>
	These are typical of the sorts of things that happen under our 
weak kneed, bleeding heart government. It will not see the 
problems. It continues on and on about the terrible childhood these 
people have had and that there is really no bad in the world at all. 
The only bad in the world is that we actually lock some people up 
occasionally. We really should not lock them up at all. We should 
just let them walk around, take them to counselling occasionally 
and they will completely mend their ways. And put a bracelet on 
them, as my colleague says.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I have been digressing a little from Bill C-55, but I think 
members get the point. This expands out to being more than just 
Bill C-55. It is an entire rot that goes right through the system.
<P>
	One thing I did today in the House was to introduce during 
routine proceedings a new private member's bill which I hope 
eventually will be drawn from the barrel. We know it is a bit of 
lottery. There is a bit of a move afoot now to actually get some of 
these private members' bills votable. It would be wonderful if they 
all were. My submission to the commission, incidentally, is that all 
of these bills should be votable. I would like my bill to be votable 
because it deals with this very problem. If passed by the House it 
would actually allow provincial judges to deport criminals in lieu 
of sentence so that we could get rid of them right away. As soon as 
these bogus refugees commit a crime, let us get them right out of 
the country.
<P>
	I know the minister of immigration has argued they really should 
serve their time here so it will be in Canada. However, that is just a 
crock. What happens is that they get out on parole and parole is 
considered to be part of the sentence. They are wandering around 
free in society and the immigration people cannot deport them.
<P>
	The first thing they do when they are coming near the end of 
their parole and the immigration people are standing behind them 
with the bracelets ready to go is just grab a brick and toss it through 
the nearest jeweller's window or hit somebody in the mouth and 
that starts the case all over again. They can go back to jail for 
another little while and another probation.
<P>
	I could give literally dozens of examples from my riding alone. 
When we think that there are 1,300 just in the Vancouver area, we 
do not have to work too hard to see how many there are in each 
riding. When we also work out that certain groups tend to use the 
system a little more, it does not take long to work out how bad the 
problem really is.
<P>
	They are probably all asking for a free flag. It would not surprise 
me a bit if the thousand free flags in the Fraser Valley East riding 
were all ordered by these people so they can walk around waving 
them as if they were Canadians.
<P>
	The only thing that bothered me during question period today 
was when the Deputy Prime Minister stood up and said that the 
member for Fraser Valley East had used taxpayer money to fax for 
some free flags. It is a shame he did not take a $10 bill out of his 
pocket and say: ``Mr. Speaker, I will pay for the faxes if she will 
pay for the flags''. That would have been justice.
<P>
	I digress again, but it really is related to this whole problem of 
the justice issues in Canada. I think I will wind up here because I 
would like my colleagues to have an opportunity to also speak to 
this. However, I do want to mention a few kind words to members 
on the other side because I know they do not like to be spoken to 
harshly.
<P>
	There are indeed some good provisions in this bill. They do not 
go quite far enough. I do not think we are going to stall the passage 
of the bill. We will work with the government, hopefully to try to 
improve it a little. I hope the people on the other side of the House, 
who cannot deny the phone calls and letters they have been getting 
from their constituents on a get tougher approach to crime, will get 
behind a few amendments to this bill to tighten it up a little.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to 
say to the hon. member that just because he took the liberty of 
exaggerating, moving information around, picking all over the 
place and slandering communities does not make it the truth.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5128"> 5128 </A></B>
<P>
	For the hon. member to have taken the liberty to slander whole 
immigrant and refugee communities to say they are all into this 
and they all do this is totally irresponsible.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He never said that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> He alluded to that and that is not acceptable to me. I 
you have-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I simply ask that 
in the brief period of time we have left under questions or comment 
we might be able to get the question in and hopefully the response.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> While he was talking about a particular case, 
several members alluded to communities at large. Does the hon. 
member truly believe that refugees and immigrants in this country 
are all, or in the majority, criminals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, in case the hon. 
member has not noticed I do talk funny and that is because I come 
from New Zealand. I am an immigrant myself and so I think I am in 
a very good position to comment about immigration.
<P>
	I know what it is like to work to come to Canada. It took my wife 
and me two years to get permission to come here. We had to apply 
three times. We had good backgrounds, no criminal records, we 
had money to bring here to purchase a house and we had jobs to 
come to as well. So I do not think there is anything wrong with 
setting a high standard.
<P>
	I am also not going to apologize for saying it like it is. I have 
never said in this House, though, that all immigrants or all refugees 
are criminals. They are not, but if we do not recognize there is a 
problem we will reap what we sow.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that three years ago when Reformers 
in the Vancouver area were saying that there was a problem with 
astronaut families who were not paying taxes and were leaving 
their families here, we were called racists. Today the member for 
Richmond admits there is a problem with astronaut families.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to get the Vancouver papers for 
the last week she will see it is a major problem that affects real 
estate agents, accountants and the entire community because we 
did not talk about it and deal with it when it was a problem at the 
beginning.
<P>
	There is a lesson to be learned from all that. We had better start 
talking in this House about the things that they do not want to talk 
about over there or things will get worse and worse. They are afraid 
to talk about them. They hold themselves up behind the flag and 
claim all sorts of compassion and tolerance, but they should stand 
aside a little from that ideology for a moment and just look at what 
is really happening out there.
<P>
	Nobody is opposed to a good immigration policy for Canada but 
let us set some decent standards for God's sake. Let us make it so 
that a person entering this country feels like they want to be 
Canadian instead of feeling like they want to rip off Canadians, 
because that is what some of these people do.
<P>
	The member should go to Pearson airport, as my colleague from 
Wild Rose has done, to see the plane loads arriving everyday where 
bogus refugee claimants come through, 100 a day. The immigration 
people are forced to let them free on their own recognisance if 
someone is there to meet them. Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard of 
a refugee who had someone to meet them at the airport?
<P>
	The trouble is they will not look at the facts. They stand there 
accusing us of all sorts of things, but if they would just look at the 
facts they would see there are major problems to deal with. I 
actually think the move on Bill C-55 is an indication that they are 
finally starting to get the message. They know the Canadian people 
want to get tough on crime.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before going to the1.30 p.m. proceedings I want to give advance notice to the House. 
When this bill is before the House next, the five hours of debate 
which allow for 20 minutes of interventions and 10 minutes of 
comments or questions have expired. The remaining portion of the 
debate will allow members 10 minute interventions.
<P>
	It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-267, an 
act to amend the Competition Act (gasoline pricing), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the fact that the bill comes at this 
particular juncture when the House of Commons seems divided on 
many issues, the issue of gasoline pricing and the concern of our 
constituents is one that unites us all. It unites us all in the common 
recognition that there is something patently wrong with gas 
pricing.
<P>
	The bill seeks to try to provide some very simple answers for 
Canadian consumers and those who have a concern about the high 
price of gasoline. That can be done by way of information.
<P>
	We are fast approaching the 21st century when the information 
age will become even more important. Very few consumers or any 
of us here can say that there is an  alternative choice to gasoline. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5129"> 5129 </A></B>
<P>
We need to know why the increases take place, why they take place 
on weekends and why the only answer by the oil industry is: ``We 
do not have to provide any answers''.
<P>
	Let me say first that the Bill C-267 amends the Competition Act 
by requiring that the oil company in question, before the price of 
oil is raised more than 1 per cent, must give 30 days' notice. From 
the wellhead to the gas pumps where the consumers fuel their 
vehicles, it takes six months for price increases to work through the 
system. As members of Parliament we cannot provide answers why 
these sudden gyrations take place. Consumers are asking above all 
for some predictability.
<P>
	The bill does not regulate any industry. I am very emphatic about 
that point because I think there are some misgivings. Some may 
want to take the point of view of the industry which says that 
somehow it is causing the industry to feel it is being burdened. 
Perhaps this may be an argument that is given by the department.
<P>
	I think a good corporate citizen which wants to make sure it 
keeps customers on line would above all want to make sure that at 
the end of the day the consumers are well informed. This is very 
good PR and it also allows us to have some accountability to our 
constituents.
<P>
	Let me give some points. A year and a half ago when the 
Minister of Finance presented his budget, he included a 1.5 cent 
increase in the excise tax. Politicians from all sides of the House 
may be able to use that as a pro or con, but the money ultimately 
goes into the general revenue fund to pay for things like hospitals, 
pay down the debt and do a number of good things for the economy 
and the general interest and welfare of all Canadians.
<P>
	At the same time that 1.5 cent increase took place the oil 
industry took liberties and tacked on another 4.5 cents. From 
February to March, April, May and June 1995, Canadians were 
paying an extra 6 cents a litre. Is that justified? That is not for me to 
question. If I were to ask the question, I suppose some would say 
that it is matter that would border on regulation. I believe that 
consumers would like an explanation from the oil industry once 
and for all.
<P>
	I have taken it on myself to remove the shroud of mystery that 
surrounds oil pricing in Canada. When we peel back the various 
layers of the oil onion, if I can call it that, we find that there is 
something sinister in the way that gas pricing is headed in this 
country. For the first time in many years people living in the 
Toronto and Montreal regions and some parts of western Canada 
have found that the price of gas rises uniformly and declines 
uniformly. There is no longer the kind of competition from station 
to station that was once available. Why is it that way?
<P>
	It may come as a surprise to members of the House to learn that 
over the past 15 years we have lost a number  of potential refiners 
in this country. The takeover by Petrofina of BP, the demise of 
Texaco and the takeover of Gulf Canada has all meant that the 
question of supply is really relegated to a very few companies.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, the supply of gasoline would not be a matter of 
great controversy if there was not the appearance of a new 
phenomenon known as vertical integration in the market. Crude oil 
refiners are not only the distributors but are now, in many respects, 
the retailers. It is the connection from end to end that has given the 
impression that what we have is an oil monopoly.
<P>
	If a company controls the supply, its distribution and retailing, it 
stands to reason that, at some point, the price will be controlled. 
Therefore, it is not by accident that we are seeing sustained, 
uniform and high prices in this country.
<P>
	The people of Canada begged Parliament for an answer. In the 
absence of any other remedy, it is this Parliament that is the eyes, 
the ears and the conscience of consumers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So I have trouble acknowledging that some of us think we have 
no way of guaranteeing competition in the oil industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have an opportunity with this bill to provide consumers, not 
only with answers but allow them to formulate, in the absence of 
any choice, not being able to use any other mode of transportation. 
They cannot suddenly put lemon juice in their gas tanks. Every 
Canadian has an interest in finding out why the gas prices are what 
they are.
<P>
	In talking about why prices are uniformly high and why we are 
seeing unprecedented levels of high prices, the argument has been 
put forward to look at what happened in the maritimes over the past 
few months. In Quebec, the price has actually gone down.
<P>
	That example should alarm every member of this House of 
Commons because it demonstrates very clearly the real possibility 
of predatory pricing. The wholesalers that had an interest in 
retailing since they wanted to control the supply over this past 
summer, engaged in a process of driving the price down at the retail 
level precisely so that they would knock out the independent 
gasoline owners who have, for the longest time, provided the 
equilibrium for competition in the industry.
<P>
	With all the knowledge that I have received from speaking to 
many of these independent gas owners from Sudbury to Windsor to 
Cape Breton to Quebec de la region du Saguenay, we have a very 
serious situation on our hands which requires at least some 
consideration by members of Parliament here and now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5130"> 5130 </A></B>
<P>
	If we do not believe that a free market ought to apply in the 
oil industry, then where do we stop? Do we now say it is okay 
to have this in the pharmaceutical industry? Do we say that it is 
all right to have no competition and have only a handful of people 
or a cartel drive the price to whatever it deems fit?
<P>
	It is important that we understand the plight of the independent 
gas station owner, the person who gets up in the morning and 
knows that if they do not put in 18 hours a day of sweat equity, they 
are not going to get a paycheque at the end of the week. The 
problem is that that paycheque has been severely and calculatedly 
reduced. How is it possible for a person who buys his products 
from an oil company to be able to make ends meet when the person 
he is competing with happens to be a gas station that is owned by 
the wholesaler.
<P>
	If this does not raise concerns about the abuse of dominant 
position of the oil industry today, I do not know what will. 
Canadians may take some slight comfort in the fact that they may, 
from time to time, get lower priced fuel as they saw in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	I take the example of what happened in Grand Falls where there 
were 11 gas stations. Of those 11 gas stations, 10 were owned by 
the majors. Only one was an independent. The price was 
approximately 48 cents a litre about a year and a half ago. When 
that independent was smothered the price shot up to 68.9 cents. If 
consumers are concerned about competitively priced oil and gas, 
they had better understand that it is because of the existence of the 
independent gas owner, who is prepared to pass on the savings to 
consumers, and who is one of the major reasons why we have had 
decently competitively priced gas in the past.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I was a little surprised to learn that there are some members who 
may still harbour the belief that free competition or open markets 
actually exist in the oil industry. I should point out that from a 
national point of view there are really only three major players: 
Petro-Canada, Imperial Oil and Shell. Regionally there are smaller 
players but who are nevertheless significant: Irving in the 
maritimes, Ultramar in Quebec, Sunoco in Ontario and out west 
Mohawk Oil.
<P>
	There are agreements between the refinery companies to provide 
supply for each other. This idea that there is not any agreement or 
understanding, better known in the industry as product supply 
arrangements, between refiners would be misleading. Yet the 
competition bureau seems incapable of trying to address the reality 
that many of these refiners are actually in a position where they can 
not only agree among themselves what the price will be, but they 
can also above all agree among themselves to how much to supply.
<P>
	When we hear the tired arguments that the industry puts forward, 
and unfortunately some members may fall  victim to the argument 
that the cost of heating oil, for instance, increased because we had a 
long cold winter, the members ought to ask themselves if we have a 
warm winter does that not mean by implication, logically speaking, 
the price should go down.
<P>
	There seems to be a lot of confusion about how much a person 
ought to be paying in Canada for crude oil, for that which they need 
to use almost every day. Because it affects every member in this 
House and it affects every one of their constituents there is no 
mystery here.
<P>
	Today the spot oil price for crude is, at the highest level, about 
$24 a barrel. Of that $24 there are approximately 200 litres of 
gasoline in a barrel of oil. We understand not all of that goes to less 
costly gasoline for cars. Some of it goes into polystyrenes and to 
more expensive products.
<P>
	Let us go with the worst case scenario. It costs the oil industry 12 
cents maximum a litre to bring that product on line. According to 
the Canadian Petroleum Foundation it costs 5.2 cents to refine, to 
market and to distribute. That is all their costs covered. That is up 
to 17.2 cents a litre. Add the federal and provincial sales taxes, and 
we know where they go-even though there is a lot of debate about 
where they ought to go in this House-that is an extra 29 cents a 
litre on top of 17 cents. That is about 45 to 46 cents a litre.
<P>
	Give the independent or the gas owner 2.2 cents and we have 47 
to 48 cents a litre maximum. Today in Ottawa when it is 57 to 58 
cents a litre, or when it is 61 cents in the maritimes or for that 
matter 58 cents in Toronto, who is making the money? Where is the 
accountability?
<P>
	I have no difficulty with people making money. I think it is 
laudable that they do. However they have a responsibility and an 
obligation not to use their position of privilege or their oligopoly or 
their cartel to bamboozle constituents, to take advantage of 
consumers and to perpetuate this rip-off.
<P>
	It is very clear to me that no matter how difficult it may be for 
some people to accept or to swallow, the oil industry is on the verge 
of what it has always tried for-I guess what many companies 
hoped to accomplish in other countries, in particular the United 
States-and that is to give consumers absolutely no choice when it 
comes to the cost of gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	I have received thousands of letters since I brought this bill to the 
House of Commons. It was first introduced as Bill C-361 in the 
previous session and has been reintroduced as Bill C-267. 
Notwithstanding the fact that it was not deemed votable, I would 
nevertheless call upon the House to consider this an important step 
forward.
<P>
	We should resolve today to at least attempt to get some answers 
from the oil industry. Given that many of us in the House assume 
that the big issue is price fixing,  we are missing the point. We are 
missing the boat. For members of Parliament to assume that the 
issue today which should concern consumers is price fixing by the 
oil companies, they are simply missing the boat because the cartel 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5131"> 5131 </A></B>
<P>
at the supply end already exists. There is no need to price fix when 
there are very few players in the game.
<P>
	I would appeal to members of Parliament to revise their 
thinking, to modernize their thinking and to get in step with the 
reality that exists as it relates to the oil industry in Canada today 
and now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also must say to my colleagues, and more particularly to my 
fellow members from the province of Quebec, that I am very 
concerned and even disappointed in the behaviour of the oil 
companies and the way they treated independents.
<P>
	We see young people who try to get a job and offer competitive 
pricing to the consumer. This is something we see, not just in the 
small villages I visited this summer but also in other regions across 
the country, as I explained earlier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the maritime provinces we have heard people saying: ``Great, 
look at the prices. They are coming down to 29 cents a litre''. I was 
just reading in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine an article by its business editor, 
D'Arcy Jenish. He writes that he met several station owners in the 
maritimes and one in Nova Scotia told him that in 28 of the first 38 
weeks of 1996 the retail price was below the wholesale buying 
price. That is predatory pricing. That is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
	It is very clear to me that we need some kind of safeguard over 
and above the rhetoric that we hear under the guise of the 
competition bureau to actually protect the people who are 
protecting the interests of Canadians and who are protecting the 
interests of our consumers.
<P>
	If we do not believe today that 68 cents per litre is going to be a 
reality in years to come, I would suggest that we look at what has 
happened in Gander, Newfoundland. I would suggest that we look 
at what happened in Toronto last year. From Burlington to 
Clarington which covers a population of about 4.5 million people, 
there are so few independents left that they are not able to make any 
impact on the price.
<P>
	Those independents who are out there right now are trying to 
survive. They are in no position to provide competitive pricing for 
consumers. They are unfairly prejudiced by the oil companies 
which are using very blunt instruments such as the removal of 
credit terms. They have taken away the 45-day credit which was 
previously extended to the independents. They have taken away 
temperature compensation. I could go on about the methods by 
which the oil industry has been able to uproot the independent oil 
companies. They have  done it through vapour recovery. They have 
demanded higher thresholds.
<P>
	Imagine if an independent sold 5,000 litres in a day and an oil 
company said that was not enough because the retail outlets which 
it owns sells 10,000. It says to the independent that it had better 
double its sales next week, even though the price has not come 
down, or the supply will be cut off. That is wrong.
<P>
	I appeal to Parliament to review the decision not to make this bill 
votable by seeking the unanimous consent of the House in the 
following motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-267, an act to amend the Competition Act (gasoline pricing), be 
deemed to have been chosen as a votable item.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do so in the interests of every Canadian consumer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion from the hon. member for Ontario. His motion 
was to make this particular bill a votable item.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent of the House to make this a votable 
item?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Unanimous consent is not 
granted.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member opposite who introduced Bill 
C-267, because when Liberal members and the government 
introduce something worthwhile, you may rest assured we intend to 
support them.
<P>
	It is true there is a serious problem, and we must have the ability 
to defend the weakest against the multinationals. The price of gas 
must be regulated. I would have thought that the big oil companies 
would allow fair competition with independent gas retailers. In the 
past few months, especially this summer, I noticed that this 
competition is entirely unfair.
<P>
	What do the big oil companies want? They simply want to get rid 
of the independents, and this is a tragedy for Quebec and the 
Maritimes. In the past few months they have been intent on closing 
down independents and possibly getting rid of them altogether. 
They have already caused many to disappear this way, and they 
would like to get rid of them altogether.
<P>
	Of course the consumer may think this is wonderful. If I go to 
the gas station and I can pay 20 cents less for a litre of gas, I most 
certainly will take advantage of this. However, we know perfectly 
well that in a matter of months or years, the multinationals, since 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5132"> 5132 </A></B>
<P>
they want to  control everything, will strangle the consumer as they 
strangled the independents.
<P>
	Well there must be some kind of control. This attempt to knock 
out the independents is another illustration of the harmonious 
concert of converging interests, practices and prices that unites the 
big oil companies: Ultramar, Shell, Petro-Canada, Esso, and 
Imperial Oil in Quebec. They are refiners, wholesalers and 
retailers. The big oil companies have broken the unspoken rules of 
a market in which the big oil companies were prepared to live with 
competition from the independents.
<P>
	Formerly, the system worked. Independents could, from time to 
time, sell gas a little cheaper and provide better service. When the 
big oil companies saw this happening, they wondered what they 
should do, and they said: ``O.K., let us get rid of them.'' This 
summer, Ultramar was particularly ferocious in the ensuing price 
war.
<P>
	The independents, who were losing enormous amounts of 
money, could not keep up, and some with fairly high mortgages had 
to close their doors. I call that disgusting, unfair, and monstrous 
when they want to get rid of the little guy in order to control the 
market.
<P>
	Over the years, independents, as they are usually referred to, 
gradually increased their market share from 20 or 25 per cent, and 
for us, especially in rural areas, in my riding of 
Matapédia-Matane, it was wonderful. They were not just selling 
gas but provided all the other services you can get at a gas station, 
never mind those people who believe that capitalism and a free 
market are each other's corollary. Personally, I do not think that is 
true at all.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The government must protect those independent retailers. The 
presence of efficient independent companies alone assures Quebec 
consumers a fair and equitable price for petroleum products. If they 
disappear, if the large oil companies take over, then consumers 
must beware. These large corporations will set the prices according 
to their fancy and we will have to pay or walk.
<P>
	The issue is even worse for the independents. There are 300 
distributors in Quebec selling gasoline and heating fuel and 2,423 
retailers established mainly in the regions and serving their 
respective communities. When a community has no more gasoline, 
no more school, it might as well shut down.
<P>
	Moreover, it accounts for 10,000 semi skilled or non skilled jobs. 
This means that many young people with no education or very little 
education can find jobs, and good ones at that. It accounts for $200 
million in salary, 82 per cent of which in the areas around Montreal 
and Quebec City. The commercial spinoffs-convenience stores, 
machine shops, etc-throughout Quebec are on the order of $164 
million.
<P>
	The disappearance of healthy competition and the resultant 
increase in prices are jeopardizing consumers' protection. Again, 
the goal of multinationals is not only to recover the portion of the 
market they have lost over the past decade to more efficient 
independent distributors-and we know they are more efficient 
because of the many services they render-but mostly to eliminate 
them altogether so as to have maximum control over the retail 
market.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have a situation where for more than a decade 
regional development and local entrepreneurship are at the heart of 
economic development. When independents disappear, life 
becomes very difficult in small communities. The performance and 
efficiency of some 2,423 gasoline and heating oil independent 
distributors in Quebec are the living proof of that. The 
independents must be able to earn a decent living without 
necessarily turning into multinationals. I say, ``Good for them'', as 
they can still earn a decent living.
<P>
	In addition to increasing their market share from 15 per cent in 
1984 to 31 per cent in 1993, they saw the average number of litres 
sold per station rise by 31 per cent between 1991 and 1995, thus 
confirming their economic presence in rural communities.
<P>
	Yet, after five years of price wars against the multinationals, 
which unfairly control the profit margins of all gas station 
operators in Quebec, that province's independent businesses find 
themselves economically vulnerable. They are powerless to stop 
the fair market value of their businesses from eroding.
<P>
	Meanwhile, unfortunately, the multinationals more than 
compensate for the losses arising from this planned retail price war 
by increasing their consolidated profit margins through their 
integrated refining and petrochemical operations.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	In their case, they can absorb losses through their refineries, 
since they are not mere retailers. Because they have more options, 
they can do a lot better than others.
<P>
	This situation allows them to fix prices, high prices, knowing 
full well that, even if they incur losses for a year or two, they will 
make up for these during years, even decades, and that, in the end, 
they will be richer.
<P>
	Independent retailers are quite willing to face competition, 
because they know they can provide additional services. They 
know it and they have demonstrated it by cornering a very 
respectable share of the market. In fact, their share of the market 
was increasing and this is what hurt the multinationals, which then 
decided to eliminate independent retailers, who were surviving 
because they could provide more services while still making 
adequate, albeit lower profits.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5133"> 5133 </A></B>
<P>
	The government must indeed introduce a piece of legislation 
that will enable everyone to operate in a free market, where the 
competition is fair, unlike what we have seen for a while now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to 
enter into the debate. But because I believe it is semi-useless 
without being able to actually make a decision on it, I would like to 
ask the House to reconsider and to once again make Bill C-267 a 
votable motion. I would ask for unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request of the hon. member for Elk Island. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to make this item votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is good news. I would like to 
commend the member for Ontario for this initiative. I suppose we 
are all affected by the price of gasoline, not only those who own 
vehicles. There are many people across the country who are 
dependent on fuel in vehicles in order to bring all the goods and 
services to them in order to enjoy their standard of living.
<P>
	All across the country people are dismayed at the cost of 
gasoline. Just the other day I told someone that had the government 
not pushed us into the metric system I sincerely doubt that we 
would be very excited about the cost of gasoline because it would 
be in the neighbourhood of $2.40 a gallon. I believe most of us 
would say that is excessive. We would object to that high price and 
yet that is approximately what the price is. By the way I think it is 
considerably more, probably about 80 per cent more, than the cost 
per gallon in the United States. Then of course, we would have to 
make adjustment for the difference in the dollar and the size of the 
gallon. But there is a tremendous difference in the cost of gasoline.
<P>
	It is a shame that gasoline should be so highly priced. Living in 
the very harsh climate which we have in the north part of the 
northern hemisphere, we are really dependent on fuel and the 
energy it provides. We are also a very sparse country. It is not easy 
for us to get around without a vehicle.
<P>
	I want to share a personal story with the House that I hope 
members will find interesting. Some 26 years ago we moved into 
the country about 20 miles from the nearest town.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	When I lived in the city I used my bicycle to go to work. It was a 
6.8 mile trip every day. I always felt good about using my bicycle. I 
saved pollution from entering the atmosphere and I saved costs. 
Believe it or not, I was able to travel about one-third of the width of 
the city of Edmonton in about the same time as I could if I used  
Edmonton's so-called rapid transit system. I was in very good 
shape in those days. Members think I am probably still in good 
shape, it is just that my shape has changed. It was also very good 
exercise and a great thing to do.
<P>
	When we moved to the country I drove my bicycle but once 
because it took too long. It was a two hour trip each way and I did 
not have four hours a day. I wish now that I would have kept it up 
because I would have been in such fine condition. Unfortunately I 
bought a two wheeler with a motor and it does not take that much 
energy to shift the gears on a Honda motor bike.
<P>
	Getting back to the price of gasoline, one of the reasons I used 
this motor bike to go to work after we moved to the country was the 
cost of fuel. In those days we had vehicles that were not quite as 
energy efficient as they are now. I bought a little motorcycle that 
delivered for me some 100 miles per gallon. I was able to save a 
great deal of money even in the days when fuel was only about 20 
to 25 cents a litre by using my motor bike instead of my large car.
<P>
	Since then gasoline has gone up in price so it is now between 50 
and 65 cents a litre across the country. I was totally appalled in 
Saskatchewan recently to see the prices there were edging close to 
62, 63 cents per litre in some places. That is excessive.
<P>
	We must recognize that is a damper on our economy. We must 
recognize that the high price of fuel makes it less easy for our 
businesses and individuals to be competitive with the rest of the 
world.
<P>
	Although the member for Ontario has fine intents in limiting the 
way fuel companies can cause the price of gasoline to fluctuate, I 
must come back to a theme which is very dear to my heart. What is 
the cost of gasoline? Where does the total cost come from? 
Whether we like it or not, a very large part of the cost of gasoline is 
due to taxation.
<P>
	I made a little chart a little over a year ago, and the prices have 
changed somewhat, but I do not think the percentages will have 
changed that much. The price of fuel by the time it reaches the 
retail level is made up of approximately 30 per cent, crude cost, 
about 25 per cent federal tax, about 25 per cent provincial tax, 
between 20 per cent and 25 per cent refining and marketing costs, 
profits, and then there is retail margin for the retailer.
<P>
	I do not know if members realized that provincial tax is around 
25 per cent, although it varies from province to province. In 
Quebec it is around 36 per cent. Federal tax varies from province to 
province as a percentage of the total price because the total price 
varies from province to province, but it is around 25 per cent 
federal tax.
<P>
	I object that this government, like governments before it, uses 
fuel as a source of revenue. I really do not believe that taxing fuel, 
which is such a necessary commodity in order for us to compete on 
a worldwide scale with our industry, with our agriculture, with our 
tourism, is  justified or valid. We should not be taxing fuel as a 
source of revenue. It should not be singled out from other products 
for additional taxes.
<P>

	Approximately $4 billion per year is taken out of our economy 
and put into government coffers through the federal sales tax on 
gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	I have to add another thing. When it comes to gasoline, the 
federal government has displayed an odd characteristic in that it is 
adding a tax to a tax. After the federal sales tax is added to the 
gasoline which would bring the price in most provinces to around 
50 cents, then it adds the GST. The government actually charges 
GST on the total price, which means the government is charging 
GST on the federal sales tax. It is unconscionable to force 
Canadians to pay taxes on the taxes they pay with money they have 
earned on which they have already paid income tax.
<P>
	In that regard, I did a little computation. Follow this. I earn 
$3.33. My marginal rate of income tax, both when I was an 
instructor at the college before I came here and now, is about 50 per 
cent but overall I used 40 per cent. From the original $3.33, I pay 
40 per cent or $1.33 in combined provincial and federal income 
tax. That leaves me with $2. I go to the pump to buy gasoline. The 
total provincial and federal sales taxes is around 50 per cent of the 
price at the pump, which means if I buy $2 worth of gasoline, I pay 
another $1.
<P>
	What I got was $1 of gasoline in my tank. That is the worth of it, 
with $1 being tax and $1.33 being income tax that I paid in order to 
have the $2 when I went to the pump. In total, I earned $3.33. In 
order to buy $1 of gasoline, I paid $2.33 in tax. That is not 
acceptable. It is too high a rate.
<P>
	While the member's bill is well intentioned, the much more 
important thing for us to do as parliamentarians is to bring 
government spending under control so that we can reduce our 
demands on the taxpayer's purse and reduce taxes. I would begin 
with a reduction in the fuel tax. What a tremendous boost that 
would be to our economy. What a job builder that would be. What a 
relief it would be to Canadian families who find it difficult.
<P>
	I have appreciated the opportunity to comment on this bill.
