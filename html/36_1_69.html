<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 26 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I rise to comment on the government's 
budget.  It is a budget which I see as a missed opportunity, a 
shallow budget and it does not deal with the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us deal with the positives.  In most things there 
are positives and negatives.  The positives will be brief.  This 
is the first balanced budget in 28 years, something we can all 
celebrate and be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question, after a balanced budget, we have to ask 
ourselves is what are we going to do with the surplus, if there 
is any, and how are we going to go in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the House that I did a poll in December and 
received just short of 2,500 responses. 
An overwhelming number of people from Saanich—Gulf Islands 
responded to the poll. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I asked was what we should be doing with 
any future surpluses.  I asked is our spending just right, do we 
need tax relief, do we need debt reduction, what should the 
priorities be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the House that 95% of the 2,500 respondents 
from Saanich—Gulf Islands stated very clearly that the 
priorities have to be lower taxes and debt reduction.  This 
government does not have it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are going to the downside of the budget.  It was actually 
2,491 respondents who replied to the survey.  What we have, and 
it scares me, is a bunch of ministers who are now lined up at the 
Prime Minister's door with their Christmas wish lists, and this 
government has just gone into a spending binge like it has never 
seen money before.  That really scares me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw in this new budget is $11 billion for spending over 
the next three years.  There are a number of my colleagues around 
me from British Columbia.  If anybody can talk about high taxes 
in this country, British Columbians can.  They are crippling the 
economy.  The British Columbia economy will, out of all the 
provinces in this country, have the best economic growth. Why? We 
are one of the highest taxed provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to start out of this House.  This House has to lower 
the taxes.  The government has a priority.  What have we seen? 
Not lower taxes, but this is the very government that has brought 
tax increases which caused the downturn in the recession of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the single largest tax increase, the Canada pension 
plan increase.  This government is proud of it.  It is one tax 
increase after another.  Yet we see the minister stand up, very 
proud of his so-called tax reductions, but they are 
insignificant.  Those members stand up and go on and on.  We have 
the new millennium fund.  They talk about that providing an 
education for students, giving them opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the so-called slush fund of the Prime Minister is dissected 
and if we ask what it will do for students, we will see that it 
will help a handful of them.  A whopping 6% of all the students 
are going to see one dime of that money.  The other 94% will not 
see five cents worth of it.  The government has not addressed any 
of the real problems at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor the government did not address is the debt.  We 
know we need tax relief.  Canadians are telling us loud and clear 
that we still have a massive debt in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government since 1993 has added $75 billion to this debt. 
Every Canadian taxpayer's first $3,200 goes to pay interest on 
the debt.  That does not talk about paying down the debt.  It the 
first $3,200 that people send into this House right here. There 
is something wrong and this government has to make it a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no money allocated to debt reduction.  We have seen the 
Prime Minister say we will put $3 billion into this new fund and 
after three years we will decide if we want to put it on the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no vision.  It has no plan.  It does not know 
which programs and how long the wish lists are of its ministers. 
It wants to make sure it has enough money in this little fund to 
accommodate all the wish lists first. Then, and it is a big if, 
it is a maybe, like everything with this government, it will tell 
us if it will put anything on debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a full 10 minutes since I spoke for a few minutes 
last time, therefore I will go right to the back end.  This is 
what disturbs me the most regarding this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the word discrimination used in this House.  If we 
want to talk about discrimination, here is a budget that is 
discriminatory.  It really troubles me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not only failed to address the importance of 
parents who choose to stay home to raise their children and the 
value they bring into society, but it is discriminating against 
them, which is worse.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has increased the limits for child care expense 
deductions to $7,000 for children under age 7 and to $4,000 for 
children ages 7 to 16. These deductions are only available to 
people if they are working.  When a person chooses to stay home 
and care for their families, it is in my view probably the single 
most important role we have in our society today, and this 
government puts zero importance on that. It is an absolute 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be ashamed of themselves.  They can sit over 
there and hang their heads, which they should.  They not only 
failed to address the important role stay at home parents play in 
society today, but they made it worse for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many areas in our tax act which could allow one 
parent who recognizes the importance, value and contribution this 
makes to our society to stay at home.  I have had many personal 
experiences of these things happening in society.  When these 
people apply for a bank loan they are asked what they do. They 
say, for example, “I am just a housewife”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility in this House to change this and make 
it a priority.  However, there is absolutely nothing in this 
budget which does that.  I think this is an absolute disgrace. 
The government should scrap the refundable child care tax credit 
and make it available to all families' children whether the 
parent is working or not.  Maybe that stay at home parent, who 
has been working a lot more hours than anyone who goes out into 
the workforce, wants a day to themselves and be able to put their 
children in child care.  Maybe they would like one day a week to 
do something.  But they do not get that chance.  If someone is 
working the government will pay for day care but it will not look 
after the child care expenses for the stay at home mom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often talk about crime, which is a serious problem.  My hon. 
colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca introduced a private 
member's motion a few weeks ago concerning crime prevention as 
opposed to crime management.  I suggest that this goes to the 
very root cause of some of our societal problems.  We need to 
have people who place importance on the value of raising children 
in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that not all parents can do that.  It is very 
expensive in our society today and many families are forced to 
have two incomes to survive.  However, they at least should not 
be discriminated against.  They should be able to choose. They 
have enough of a challenge living on one income. We should at 
least give equal benefit to those parents who choose to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues in this budget but I would like to 
remind the government that its number one priority is the 
taxpayers and it is high time it gave them some of the dividend 
that is due to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw many media reports that stated the Minister of Finance has 
finally balanced the budget.  Imagine that, the finance minister 
has balanced the budget. I think he is sadly mistaken. It is the 
Canadian taxpayer who has balanced the budget.  I suggest the 
finance minister was probably clueless about this.  Six months 
ago he was telling us that he had a $17 billion deficit.  That 
was when the election was called.  The minister did not know what 
was going on and that was his best guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the truth be known, this government has raised taxes which 
are, ironically, all sneaky and hidden taxes.  The Liberals stand 
up and say they have no real tax increases.  However, we have 
gone through the list and there are 34 or 35 of these sneaky 
hidden tax increases.  I have just been advised that there are 37 
sneaky and hidden tax increases.  This government should be 
ashamed of itself.  It is time it paid that dividend back to the 
Canadian taxpayers and then put some on the debt, which is what 
is going to kick start this economy.  It is not the minister's 
wish list lined up at the Prime Minister's door waiting to spend 
this great big pot of money that they can hardly wait to get 
their sticky fingers on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take interest in the fact that the members on this side of the 
House are listening.  Hopefully they will take this message back 
to their caucus and rethink this one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have just been advised that I was supposed to 
announce that I was splitting my time.  I did announce it at the 
beginning of my speech, just before the break.  I spoke for three 
minutes and I understood I had seven minutes to complete my 
speech.  There was some confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member had the advantage of 
getting a full 10 minutes on this occasion because he was 
starting up following the vote on the amendment to the amendment 
which took place.  He is now making a new speech on the amendment 
which is now the subject of the debate before the House.  He got 
the benefit of an extra three minute bonanza.  I had assumed that 
he was going to do a 20 minute today and really let the 
government have it.  That is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions and comments on the hon. member's speech.  The hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Island for his 
eloquent remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his remarks he addressed the question of tax fairness for 
stay-at-home families, families that choose to stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my election campaign in Calgary Southeast I debated a 
Liberal candidate from Calgary West, Alderman David Bronconnier, 
who said that by wanting to eliminate the tax disparities that 
exist in the tax system for stay-at-home families, namely by 
wanting to eliminate the child care tax deduction and replace it 
with a refundable credit available to all parents, including 
those who stay at home, Reformers wanted to put women barefoot 
and pregnant back in the kitchen.  I wonder if the hon. member 
could comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that women and men who choose to stay home and 
care for their children, who give up the second income, who make 
the financial sacrifices and who get no tax recognition of that 
effort, does he believe that they are barefoot and pregnant in 
the kitchen?  Does he dismiss their effort in that kind of 
arrogant way or does he believe that they should be treated 
fairly by our tax code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that it was not me 
who heard those comments during the election because I would have 
been absolutely disgusted and appalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give the member a personal experience.  My brother-in-law, 
who has been married to my sister for four years, chose to stay 
home and raise his three daughters while my sister worked as a 
teacher.  I made it very clear that this is not a gender issue. 
We are in the 1990s.  Maybe some of the Liberal people who ran in 
the election were not aware of that.  It is an issue where 
families have chosen to stay at home, especially when children 
are young and it is so important that they get that important 
start and that they get the nurturing, love and caring that they 
need and that they get the values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some families are just not in the financial situation where they 
can.  Some have chosen that the second parent will only work half 
time because they want to be their for their children to give 
them that most important start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government could recognize that there is so much 
unfairness in our tax system to these families, it might be able 
to have more people stay home if it gave them the same 
opportunities that it gives both parents who work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my wife went out and got a job for zero money, I would be 
further ahead because we would both be working and would be given 
different tax incentives which we are not now entitled to.  That 
is the point.  We could deduct $7,000 off our income for child 
care expenses.  It is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in my family is we have two very young children, 
ages 2 and 4.  My wife was a professional and gave up her career. 
She would some day love to go back to work.  Right now she 
believes it is so important for our two children.  They need her 
at home right now.  She is staying at home and gets zero, 
absolutely zero.  What is even worse is that she does need time 
for herself.  She does need a half a day.  She does need a day. 
She would not get the same thing as if somebody takes her 
children off to day care. This is only one example.  There are 
many, many areas in our system today where we do not recognize 
the importance of raising children as an important role in 
society.  This tax unfairness is only one aspect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very important role to ensure that this gets 
recognition.  This is one of the most important occupations in 
the land.  I think it will go a long way to starting to change 
this kind of discrimination and tax fairness for all.  I am going 
to be addressing this in the months ahead and pressing this 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour and a privilege to enter the debate on the budget and what 
has been presented to the House of Commons.  There are three 
words that I use as a focus for my speech this morning. The three 
words are stop, look and listen. These words are addressed to the 
Minister of Finance and to the Prime Minister:  stop, look and 
listen. These are the three words that we often use when we 
prepare young people and children when they are going to cross 
the street: stop, look and listen before you cross to make sure 
that you are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have I chosen these three words in terms of the context of a 
budget? There are a number of reasons. The first one is the 
finance minister should stop increasing the debt to larger than 
it is already. He says we have stopped that, we have balanced the 
budget, there is not a deficit this year. He did that, he says. 
No, he did not do that. He increased taxes and taxpayers balanced 
this budget. Fine, we will grant that the deficit continuation 
has been stopped. That is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go on and ask why it is that it should continue to be 
stopped. We tell our children to stop, look and listen because we 
love them. Because we cherish them, we want to preserve the good 
quality of life that they have. We here in Canada are enjoying a 
quality of life that is the envy of many parts of the world. Many 
organizations, agencies and countries have declared Canada as the 
preferred country in which to live. If we do not stop the 
burgeoning of the debt, we are going to be in trouble and we will 
lose that preferred point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to go now to the next word, which is look. Look where 
the Prime Minister and the finance minister are standing today. 
If we look at this very carefully we will recognize almost 
immediately that Canada is standing at the precipice of fiscal 
disaster. All we need to do is step forward and go into that debt 
creation spiral once more and we will create a problem not only 
for ourselves but for generations to come and reduce Canada's 
position in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say this? I say this because we need to address a 
particular question. What are the social consequences of 
maintaining the position of not preparing and stopping this 
growth of the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we should remember that we have in Canada an 
absolutely inadequate research funding proposal. I want to draw 
attention here to what has happened in terms of our research and 
development funding in Canada. In fact, we rank number six and 
number 14. Let me list the countries that are in a better 
position than we are in terms of spending on R and D. Sweden 
spends 2.9% of its GDP on research and development; Japan, 2.87%; 
Switzerland, 2.8%; United States, 2.75%; Germany, 2.6%; France, 
2.4%; United Kingdom, 2.08%; Finland, 2.2%. Netherlands, Norway, 
Denmark, Belgium, Austria, all of them spend more on R and D than 
we do.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We claim that we are one of the preferred countries of the 
world. We say that we want to be competitive.  We want to compete 
successfully in the international marketplace.  How can we expect 
to do this when these other countries are spending more money on 
research and development than Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible for us to maintain that position.  Why? 
Because Canada is essentially an exporting nation.  We depend 
upon other countries to buy our products.  If they are spending 
more money on research and development of new ideas and new 
discoveries, how can we hope to compete with them?  The time has 
come to look at this very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the gall of the Minister of Finance telling us that 
the research money has been put back into the funding councils 
like MRC and NSERC.  All that happened is that the money that was 
taken away five years ago has been put back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been put back in one amount.  Listen to what the 
Minister of Industry said in his recent publication that he sent 
to all MPs.  New funding he calls this.  New funding for the 
granting councils will be increased over a three year period 
beginning with an additional $120 million in 1998 to 1999, 
continuing with $135 million in 1999 to 2000 and levelling off at 
$150 million in 2000 to 2001. This will restore the councils' 
funding levels to 1994-95.  Now is that not an interesting twist 
of logic.  First of all he starts off with new funding and then 
he says this will restore their funding to where it was in 
1994-95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no new money here.  This is just replacing what they 
took away.  What does this do?  Not only does it threaten our 
competitiveness and our ability to innovate, it demoralizes and 
challenges, in fact it discourages, the brightest and finest of 
our intellectual people.  Why?  Because the material and 
equipment that they need to use to do their research is 
inadequate.  There is a lack of appreciation for the work that 
they are doing, there is decreased motivation to pursue new 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they do?  They leave the country to go elsewhere where 
their efforts are supported and where they can have better 
equipment and where their particular work is encouraged and 
developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to a particular article that was given to me 
from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.  This is a very serious 
development that has taken place.  In this instance, the 
declining of money for R and D, the story chronicled the 
departure of 11 of 17 research scientists.  That is well over 
half. They went to other nations because of the funding cuts in 
Canada. Eight of these went to the United States.  We cannot 
afford to have this brain drain happen in Canada because that 
means our brightest and finest are leaving this country and going 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just research funding that is the problem here.  There 
is also the question of taxes and salaries.  Let us compare a 
person earning $50,000 in the United States.  That person pays, 
in the United States, $4,910 in taxes.  In Canada, that same 
person earning $50,000 pays $10,647. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the money there to provide for the equipment and for 
the research and development but also in the personal taxes that 
these people pay.  Is it any wonder that they leave? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need quality research.  We need to develop it further.  Let 
me point to one particular development at the University of 
Saskatoon and the establishment there of the Synchrotron 
facility.  That needs to be developed and expanded so that it can 
do the kinds of things that need to be done in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medical research has slipped back.  The application of new ideas 
and the development of new technologies is in jeopardy.  That is 
not all.  The other social costs that come out of this is that 
students are unemployed; 16.8%  are unemployed.  That is far too 
high. First of all when they graduate, they carry on their 
shoulders a government debt of $20,000 because of the huge debt 
that is there.  The average student has another $25,000 of 
student loans.  That is a $45,000 debt charge right off the top 
and that poor student has to start paying income taxes the minute 
he reaches a salary of $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of justice, what kind of fairness is that in this 
particular country?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we need to look at the social consequences of not 
stopping the marshalling and the growing of the debt but we have 
to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In four different high school classes last week I was told for 
the first time ever by young people that it was not fair that 
those who graduate from post-secondary institutions have to begin 
to pay for the debt the government was unable to pay for.  The 
government spends money on their behalf so that they live a 
standard of life they are not prepared to pay for.  They think it 
is not fair they should be saddled with a tax bill that is so 
large they are groaning under its burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for the government to stop wasteful spending, 
to stop giving grants and subsidies to business and industry, and 
to look at where it is and where it is going. Government should 
listen to what the people are saying.  It should reduce the debt 
and lower taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
comments of my colleague opposite.  I want to make a couple of 
points regarding the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt is certainly declining.  The debt to GDP ratio will 
decline 63% over the next two years, the largest drop of all G-7 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the stop, look and listen idea put forward by 
the hon. member.  Yes, we have stopped the deficit.  We have 
stopped the rise of the debt.  Certainly we will continue to look 
and listen to Canadians, to reflect Canadian priorities and to 
ensure that those priorities are reflected in budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my comment about this budget.  Essentially it 
is an education budget.  The hon. member says that we are doing 
all these terrible things when in fact we are giving young 
Canadians an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the hon. member to the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> article of this morning.  It says quite clearly that the 
work is going to those who have earned a university degree, a 
college diploma or some other form of post-secondary educational 
certificate.  If young people can do anything to insulate 
themselves from joining the unemployed, the data paints a 
pervasive picture that the answer can be summed up in one phrase: 
stay in school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reinvested in young people, reinvested in the Canadian 
priority and provided some vision with respect to education. That 
is the linkage that provides competitiveness for this great 
country which will bring us into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about restoring funding to the granting councils. 
The member is unequivocally correct that we are restoring funding 
to 1994 levels.  He must realize—and I am sure he does—that 
Canadians have waited 30 years to balance the budget.  We have 
finally done that.  We are reinvesting in Canadian priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member honestly ridicule the budget and say that 
it does not reflect Canadian priorities?  It does.  I draw the 
hon. member's attention to the article in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>.  I could pass a copy on for him to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
parliamentary secretary.  I read the article.  I know the budget 
apparently is balanced.  I think that is wonderful.  That is 
great.   The Prime Minister says that there is a millennium 
scholarship fund.  It is to be a wonderful thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting how Liberal logic works?  First, they cut 
the spending for education penalizing all students.  Then they 
come in with a great big millennium scholarship fund which will 
maybe benefit 6% of students.  Is that not interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They take it away from 100% and give it back to 6% and say this 
is what they have done for the citizens of Canada.  What a bunch 
of misleading logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there some good things in the budget?  Have the Liberals 
listened?  I am glad the hon. parliamentary secretary said that 
the deficit has been stopped and that they are going to listen. 
Notice he said that they were going to.  They have not done it. 
They have not demonstrated that in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for us to get serious about exactly what we 
are going to do. When will government pass a law that says there 
shall be no more deficit spending or that it will be a liability 
for each MP who voted for going into a deficit position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need such a law.  We also need to recognize that the people 
have said that if there is a surplus it should be used to pay 
down the debt and reduce taxes. 
We need to get serious about that.  We do not need new spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not hear people ask the government to spend more money. 
They have asked for taxes to be cut and the debt to be reduced. 
That is what they said absolutely, unequivocally and very clearly 
all across the country.  The CFIB said it.  The Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce said it.  The Chamber of Commerce in Kelowna said it. 
Ordinary citizens on the street say it.  Students in the schools 
say it.  I say it.  The official opposition says it.  The 
government should listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member talked about not spending money.  Then he 
came after the government about spending money on research and 
development.  It just does not jibe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he have to say to the president of NSERC, the 
president of the NRC, the presidents of the universities in my 
riding including the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier and 
Conestoga college, and to students who have praised the budget 
for what it does for the future of the country?  I do not want to 
see him sucking and blowing at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we need to put money 
into NSERC and into research and development by reallocating 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would have listened carefully as he should have, 
he would have heard me say that we need to cut wasteful spending. 
EI premiums should be reduced so that we do not have an $8 
billion surplus there.  We need to do away with grants and 
subsidies to industries that do not need them.  We need to do 
away with the wasteful spending that exists and many duplications 
in various departments.  Then the money will be there for 
reallocation to essential research and development. That is the 
answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of 
Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the fact that, for the 
first time in 20 years, we have a balanced budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to speak to the budget as Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women and as a member of 
parliament from British Columbia. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing the budget was our initial objective, and one we shall 
continue to pursue in the next millennium.  This balance will 
have a profound impact for years to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is not a stand alone budget.  It builds on past 
budgets.  It is a building block for future budgets.  The budget 
is providing a solid infrastructure for Canada for years to come. 
It tries to address the things we need today while it looks for 
the things we will need 20 and 25 years down the road. That is 
one of the reasons I see it as a very important budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget builds a strong and stable infrastructure for Canada 
in the future, a strong and stable infrastructure for Canada in 
terms of its economic growth, its human resource development, and 
its ability to have clear committed social programs to assist 
those who are disadvantaged or who have barriers to achieve the 
opportunities they need to move forward and become contributing 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget therefore builds on youth employment as have past 
budgets.  It builds on money that was put forward to assist with 
child poverty as have past budgets.  It assists with tax 
incentives and with student loan incentives as have past budgets. 
It continues to build on slow changes in tax initiatives.  It is 
a brick by brick budget.  It is a budget by budget budget.  It is 
a balanced budget.  It is a budget of balance because it reflects 
the values of equal opportunity and social justice for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the situation we were in, let us not forget that when we 
first talked about deficit reduction we promised that in three 
years we would bring our deficit down to 3% of GDP.  We are now 
at four years and we have eliminated our deficit entirely.  We 
did not only do what we said we would do.  In the same very 
measured, very controlled, very conservative manner, we managed 
to do more than we said we would do. 
We have even surpassed our own expectations.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we brought the debt down by $13 billion.  We do not 
need to be defensive about the budget because it speaks for 
itself.  We have done something that no other government has done 
in 30 years.  In the next three years we will have done something 
that has not been done in the country for 50 years.  We can stand 
it up against anything anyone chooses to say about the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about how we would slowly move into debt reduction. We 
talked about how we would at the same time not do one thing at 
the expense of another.  We have looked at how we are building an 
economic base and how we are building a social infrastructure. We 
have also looked at tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very measured budget.  It cannot do everything for 
everyone.  That is how we have managed to get to a point we can 
be proud of today and to speak about the changes that have been 
made in the country over 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a one fell swoop budget.  Some people across the 
floor would like us to say “Let us target one thing only and let 
the others go by the wayside; let them take care of themselves”. 
That is not the Liberal way.  The Liberal way is to look at how 
we balance things and at how we ensure that we set priorities. We 
look at all our communities and the things that are needed across 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided as well in the budget that since we could not do 
everything all at once we would set our priorities and our 
targets so that low income Canadians and moderate income 
Canadians are our first priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Secretary of State for Status of Women, I want members to 
know this is a budget that has listened to the collective voices 
of women across the country.  It addresses the diversity of 
women's needs and priorities at every stage of their lives. Given 
that women make up 51% of Canadians, it is completely 
unacceptable to decide that we would build a strong country, 
build a competitive nation and not make sure 51% contribute to 
the social economic growth of the country.  No business people 
would ever do that.  No business people would take 49% of their 
resources, stretch them and then ignore the other 51%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is one way of building human resource potential. 
According to the Bank of Montreal study last year women are not 
victims.  Women are employers.  Women are able to form 
businesses.  Women are able to contribute to the economic growth 
of the country.  In so doing they take the power for themselves 
so that they can deal with their lives, move forward and 
contribute fully.  We have looked at women not only in one phase 
of their lives.  We have looked at women from students to 
entrepreneurs, from single mothers to caregivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most significant elements in the budget for women is 
the recognition for the first time of unpaid work in the home. 
Unpaid work is part of the foundation of our economy.  Even by 
conservative estimates we know that women do two-thirds of the 
unpaid work, community work and volunteer work.  When women do 
this work it means that the government does not have to pay for 
that work to be done by other sectors.  It also means that women 
are contributing without any reimbursement whatsoever to the 
gross domestic product of the country.  This was recognized in 
the budget. Only one other country in the world has such a 
recognition, and that is Norway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely proud of the budget.  There are those who will 
say that value for unpaid work by women is too little or not 
enough.  We recognize that the budget will be a building block 
for future budgets.  We have done something extremely historic 
and important this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget proposes that a new caregiver credit will reduce 
federal tax for up to $400 for Canadians providing care and 
support for elderly or disabled family members.  That tax 
exemption will also apply to GST and harmonized sales taxes for 
any expenses incurred from providing care for a person with 
limited means of self-care. It targets people who need help the 
most right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we looked at low income families.  That was one 
place we felt we would start first.  We needed to help low income 
families, especially low income families with children.  Some 85% 
of low income families with children are headed by single women 
and 65% of those women are living in poverty.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has built on the last budget when we committed $850 
million to the child tax benefit.  This budget commits another 
$850 million over two years.  This brings it to a total of $1.7 
billion to help low income families with children, which consist 
of very many single women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also look at how we help women to get an education so they 
can become independent workers and can move on if they choose. 
It is about choice.  This budget is about the most important 
thing to Canadians, the ability to choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women with dependants can now go to school and can extend the 
education tax credit for part time work.  Women with children 
tend to go to school part time.  This is very important for them. 
It also increases the child care expense deduction for part time 
schooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunities strategy is going to give up to $3,000 a year 
in a grant, not a loan, to persons with dependants who are in 
financial need.  This goes straight to the heart of all of those 
women with children or those women who care for someone in the 
home and cannot afford to go to school.  They are going to be 
given money that they will not have to pay back.  This is about 
building the human resource potential of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student loan repayment initiative is going to be based on 
helping those who are in financial need.  This again touches very 
many women who are in this particular class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the millennium student fund being bandied about across 
the way.  Obviously members do not seem to understand that when 
we give money directly to people as we are doing, and if we focus 
on people who are in need and who have talent and ability, it 
strikes at the heart of what we have all believed as Canadians, 
that one day our children will be able to do better than we have 
done.  This means that children or young people who have ability 
and talent but who do not have money will be able to get money so 
they can have a post-secondary education, a college education or 
skills training in any kind of school.  Then they can find work 
and put their talent to work for the benefit of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many things in this budget that assist women and 
which I am extremely proud of.  There are also some things which 
as a member of Parliament for British Columbia I am extremely 
proud of.  I just talked about all of the student initiatives. I 
have one of the largest student populations in my riding.  All of 
the things that are going to happen today, the students who need 
loan repayment assistance, the ones who will need to go to school 
in the future, the single women students in the riding are going 
to be assisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three universities in my riding and there are many 
hospitals which are doing valuable research.  The money that has 
been given back to the research councils is going to be very 
important for many of these universities and hospitals in my 
riding.  I have already heard from them.  They have called me up 
to say well done, that they needed this and that it is very 
important.  It is something that says we believe in the ability 
of the creativity of Canadians to continue to lead in the 
technological age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax measures are an important tool.  We know having done some 
very important gender economic indicators with the provinces over 
the last two years and in which every province participated, that 
income tax assists women.  It is one of the most important tools 
to equalize women's income. Women do better after taxes than 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax relief for low and middle income Canadians this budget 
provides is good news for millions of men and women across this 
country.  In fact over the next three years some $7 billion in 
tax relief will be provided to low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of July 1 the government will raise the amount of income that 
can be earned tax free by low income single Canadians by $500. 
Most of them are women.  It will go to $1,000 for a family.  I 
can assure this House that the women who are partners in those 
families will welcome the relief, even if that relief helps to go 
to what is putting down money so that their children when they 
reach 18 can go to go to university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear those across the way talk about how we have done nothing 
about tax relief, that we have done nothing on income tax.  It 
depends on who you think are your constituents.  We think our 
constituents happen to be the low and middle income Canadians who 
need our assistance right now, not the very well-heeled friends 
of my friends across the way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective July 1 some 83% of taxpayers who are earning under 
$50,000 will see the 3% general surtax eliminated entirely. For 
middle class Canadians and middle class women this is an 
extremely important piece of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Montreal recently said that small and micro 
businesses run by women entrepreneurs are increasing at three 
times the rate of male entrepreneurs.  This budget introduces 
changes for self-employed Canadians who cannot incorporate.  We 
know that these Canadians run very small micro businesses.  Many 
of them are run by women and nearly always from their homes. 
These women cannot incorporate.  They will now be able to deduct 
health and dental benefits which they would not have been able to 
deduct before. That is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that women entrepreneurs earn far less than their male 
counterparts.  However, last year they created more jobs than the 
top 100 Canadian companies.  We are talking about job creation. 
At the same time we are talking about empowering the people who 
are proving to be the best entrepreneurs in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has been talking about health care.  I think I know a 
little about health care.  It is an issue of vital concern to 
many women, to me, as well as to the many women in my 
constituency.  Not only are women the major consumers of health 
care, they make up the bulk of the health care workforce.  They 
are the health care providers.  They have taken responsibility 
for many of the health care services which communities can no 
longer afford to provide.  When the hospitals close down their 
acute care units and send people out into the communities, the 
people who pick up the slack are women.  That is why the tax 
credit for caregivers is a very important move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important research is being done in my riding.  There are also 
important things being done elsewhere in British Columbia and 
right across the country.  Today I heard an hon. member say that 
we should not be subsidizing or lending money to businesses in 
Canada that do not need it.  The initiative taken by Industry 
Canada has assisted business innovation in this country. 
Businesses have been able to move forward.  It has put us at the 
forefront of world technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in my riding the government lent $305 million to 
RADARSAT II which is based in Richmond.  This will provide 
leading edge technology for mapping the whole world.  Canada is 
the only country in the world which has been able to achieve this 
kind of technology.  Just think of the spin-offs which will come 
from that kind of loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bombardier just received $2 billion in international business as 
a result of a very small loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia Ballard industries has moved into leading 
edge technology with respect to environmental pollution and new 
energy sources for cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty million dollars of loan assistance has brought billions of 
dollars from the rest of the world which is looking for Canadian 
technology.  That provides jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are thinking in a very holistic way.  We are not thinking in 
a linear way with blinkers on.  It is a little difficult for my 
friends across the way to take their blinkers off and look in a 
broader and more long term way at what we need to do in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget's reaffirmation to address aboriginal issues and 
youth unemployment will have an impact on many young people 
across the country.  We know that Canada's youth are looking for 
something which will give them hope for the future. We cannot 
simply look at youth as one set of people between the ages of 17 
and 25.  If we look at the unemployment rates of young people in 
this country we will know that aboriginal youth have an 
unemployment rate of almost 40% and that visible minority youth 
have an unemployment rate of 27%.

best because it is the people who jump the highest who will 
always catch it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to talk about how we marshal for ourselves in the 21st 
century a country that is going to build its human resource 
potential.  It is a country where our young people will take the 
talents they have, where our businesses will take the technology 
they have, where the 51% of our human resources who are women 
will prove to be the employers and will move forward and 
contribute to Canada's growth in the way we know they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a remarkable budget.  I am proud to be a member of the 
government that has brought this budget down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I can see there are a lot of 
questions.  We have 10 minutes of questions and comments so what 
we will do is five one-minute comments and one-minute responses. 
That should take up the full 10 minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that does not leave us much time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply must point out that some of the assertions the minister 
made were perhaps a little bit misleading.  First, the minister 
suggested that the federal government is the first government to 
balance a budget in 30 years.  I would point out that just the 
other day Manitoba announced its fourth balanced budget in a row. 
I would point out that Alberta and Saskatchewan have done the 
same.  I would point out that municipal governments balance their 
budgets as a matter of course every year.  The government should 
not be patting itself on the back so heartily for something that 
is regularly done by most governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that taxpayers are the ones who have 
balanced the budget.  The member asserted that it was her 
government that balanced the budget.  However it was taxpayers 
overwhelmingly who balanced the budget through higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has stated that taxes are going down.  In fact when 
one includes the hike in CPP premiums and bracket creep, taxes 
have been going up each and every year of the government's 
mandate.  I do not know how the minister can make her assertion. 
How can the minister assert that taxes in fact are going down? 
When one includes CPP premiums and bracket creep, the effect is 
that taxes are actually going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 3% surtax was put on by 
the Conservative government ostensibly to bring down the deficit. 
What it in fact did was it kept the deficit going up and up and 
up.  We had promised to take that surtax off and it has now been 
taken off.   That is going to affect 83% of taxpayers. The 3% may 
not be a lot of money to some people in this House but for some 
of my constituents it represents a great deal of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about bracket creep and taxes going up, the member 
is not taking into consideration the middle income Canadians who 
are going to be helped by this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very fine to talk about other people who have balanced 
their budgets, but we are speaking here about the federal 
government.  We are the ones who inherited a $42 billion deficit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suspect the 
minister does not read the same newspapers we do.  This budget 
cannot be described as taking a number of realities into 
consideration, particularly with the manoeuvrability left to the 
government after the many cuts that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is responsible for the status of women.  The $850 
million in child tax benefits are far too little.  Moreover, a 
number of groups, Campaign 2000 for one, are calling for $2 
billion to be invested immediately, not two years from now.  What 
this budget indicates is that a step in this direction will be 
taken next year or in two years. 
There is therefore no short term strategy in place to help 
children, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this budget does not take into consideration the 
overlaps in Quebec. As we saw in this morning's newspapers, 
students are calling for compensation to adapt a program to the 
reality of Quebec.  The true problems of students are not being 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the pickings were pretty slim where the status 
of women was concerned— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. secretary of state. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first and foremost we 
probably do not read the same newspapers.  The newspapers I read 
have an overwhelming number of students saying that this is a 
very important budget for them.  They have applauded this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we talk about children.  If we look at this budget and 
take it in isolation, one will recognize that it builds on past 
budgets and it is a building block for future budgets.  In three 
years we would have spent $1.7 billion on the child tax benefit. 
That is not in isolation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member and and heard her say that the budget 
is remarkable.  What is remarkable is that this budget has 
absolutely failed poor kids in this country, it has failed the 
unemployed, it has failed women and it has failed students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister, if this is such a remarkable 
budget, why is it that only 7% of students will be covered 
through the millennium fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is such a remarkable budget why is there nothing in this 
budget that addresses women's equality and pay equity?  If this 
is such a remarkable budget, why is it that poor kids in this 
country will have to wait until next year to get a measly 80 
cents a day through the national child benefit when we have heard 
repeatedly that what is needed is about $2 billion to ensure that 
those kids are helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is remarkable is that this budget has failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again, I think there must be 
some sort of collective mental block across the hall because when 
we talk about this budget building on the last budget and being 
the building block for future budgets, we are talking right now 
about what was promised in the last budget—the $850 million that 
will be starting in July and the other $850 million that will 
come over the next two years—together with the provinces which 
are anteing up money to put into services to help those same 
children who live in poverty, there will be a total of $3 billion 
over the next three years between the two levels of government. 
It's pretty simple math. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the secretary of state talked quite a bit about the 
millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this is only going to put about $300 million in 
to replace the money lost to the provinces which were the 
recipients of a $7 billion cut a year.  So it is a small drop in 
the bucket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said specifically she has a lot of students in her riding, 
and to quote her words “who need to be able to go to school 
tomorrow”.  How does she think that she can stand and talk 
positively about a Liberal budget that puts in a small portion of 
what was taken away in transfer payments?  It is not going to 
help people until the year 2000 so it can build a monument for 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are the up to $3,000 a 
year grants for students in financial need with dependents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to be happening now.  Perhaps the hon. member 
might like to listen to my answer so that maybe in future he will 
understand the realities of the budget and not continue to find 
some very strange interpretations of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, only Liberal arithmetic could talk about this budget 
as being a benefit to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, if you look at the budget very 
carefully—which we have done and they obviously have not—you 
will see that because of the budget there is no net gain for 
Canadians.  In fact, there is a net detriment to Canadians to the 
effect of $4.8 billion in increased taxes by the year 2000 since 
the Liberals came to poewr. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to specifically go back to the health care issue of which 
the member is so proud. The fact is that the Liberals have cut 
$7.5 billion out of health care and education since 1993.  They 
are putting $1.5 billion back into it.  That is a net loss of $6 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the NDP party can figure out that is a net loss.  Why can 
the Liberal Party not figure that out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I might want to point out 
that it is Liberal arithmetic that got rid of a $42 billion 
deficit in under four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is real arithmetic.  That is not imaginary.  But you know, 
it is interesting to say that there is a sort of tunnel vision 
when we talk about the budget.  Probably why the arithmetic is 
mixed up and our arithmetic managed to do positive stuff is that 
when you look at the fact that you are talking about taxes, let 
us look at the assistance for the deduction of health and dental 
benefits for unincorporated small businesses. 
These may mean nothing to hon. members across the way, but it 
sure means a lot to a lot of the women in this country who are 
trying to make ends meet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the holiday from payroll taxes for people who 
hire young people between the ages of 20 and 24 who do not have a 
high school education, until the year 2000 there is a holiday 
from those taxes. These are real taxes. People pay them. It is a 
way of assisting business to be able to help employ young people. 
This is real money that is being offered up.  I think hon. 
members might want to look at some Liberal arithmetic for a 
change and learn something. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for 
Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the member across the way just finished 
talking about this tax relief for business in regard to the EI 
premiums. I can tell the hon. member that I was in business for 
over 25 years as a small businessman and I never hired one single 
person because there was some money available from the 
government. I hired additional people because I thought that my 
business could improve and make money by having more staff. So 
these government programs that the hon. member is talking about 
really are not a big incentive for businesses to expand. I want 
her to know that, particularly in the small business sector where 
the small businessman has to be very cautious in his approach to 
expanding, and I have that experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the budget today. I have done a 
reasonable amount of travelling in my life in Canada, in the U.S. 
and in some other countries of the world. What struck me when I 
was travelling outside of Canada was how people from some other 
parts of the world believe that Canada is a caring country, a 
country that looks after its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, across the House, is a government that claims to have the 
best interests of Canadians at heart. In the last few months I 
have talked to Canadians from all parts of Canada, all walks of 
life, all sectors of employment and I have noticed one thing, and 
that is that they simply do not buy this line about a caring 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After decades of massive overspending, helped on by their 
brothers and sisters in the Tory party, massive debt, the highest 
tax rate among industrialized countries in the world, after 
seeing education costs skyrocket, after massive tax hikes that 
the Canadian people have endured, after watching our health care 
system crumble like ancient ruins, after all this there is no way 
that this government can sell this idea that they care about the 
citizens of this country. This budget will simply harden and 
strengthen this opinion that they are not the caring government 
that they claim to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start at an obvious point: our children. A caring party 
would see children as the key to Canada's future. It would want 
to make sure that they get the very best start in life possible. 
A caring party would make the families of these children the 
highest priority in a budget, but the Liberal budget does not do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the increase in the child tax benefit will not 
replace the billions of dollars in cuts to health care and 
education that families are having to face now. It will not even 
begin to lift our poor families out of poverty because the 
increase in benefits, as small as they are, will be taken back 
through increased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the 15% in income for a $21,000 income a year two child 
family is taken back by their income tax burden, up 15% since 
1992. The increases in the child care expense deduction will not 
help families much either, especially—and these were 
overlooked—single income families where one parent chooses to 
stay home to look after the children. This government treats 
single income stay at home parents as second class families in 
this country. 
The official opposition, the Reform Party, would end this 
discrimination by extending the child care deduction to all 
parents, including stay at home parents. In short, Reformers 
would make staying at home to raise children a choice, not a 
sacrifice. That is what Canadians want more. 
They want to have choices and they want the freedom and the tools 
to do it.  Reformers would also increase the spousal amount from 
$5,380 to $7,900, levelling the playing field for all parents, 
all families.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policies in the Reform Party put families first because they 
deserve to be first, and certainly they should be first in a 
budget by this so-called caring Liberal government.  But these 
things are not in this government's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children grow up fast.  The first thing you know, they are off 
to college and university.  Does the Liberal budget help a young 
Canadian currently with a $25,000 student loan debt? If the 
student is maybe one of the lucky 6% to get the maximum each year 
from the Prime Minister's personal trophy, the millennium fund, 
their outstanding debt would go down to $10,000. At first glance 
that looks good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine until they go out and get a job and they are 
finished university.  If they happen to be making the average 
industrial wage of $36,900, then whatever help they may have got 
through the millennium fund is quickly eaten up by the tax burden 
they are going to have to endure as soon as they start working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students do get a little tax relief on the debt, but it is 
quickly eaten up because over the next 12 years they would pay a 
73% CPP tax increase, they would pay every cent and more back to 
the government that they ever got from the millennium fund and 
they would still have the leftover portion of the student loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is sleight of hand budgeting by 
the Liberal Party.  On one hand the government gives to students 
and on the other hand it takes it back.  That is what this budget 
represents.  What we have here when you do all the math is a zero 
net benefit to our Canadian students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looked at this way, the millennium fund is sleight of hand 
funding for students.  It helps only about 6% and it leaves the 
current students with heavy debt loads simply out in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has a lot more compassion for the 
younger generation than this so-called caring Liberal government. 
As a start, we would restore health care and education funding by 
putting $4 billion back into it, not the $1.5 billion that the 
Liberals have so generously said they were going to.  We would 
put $4 billion back into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will do a lot more for the students and the Canadians 
worrying about their health care than the millennium fund or the 
small amount of the $7 billion that the Liberals have cut from 
health care and education in the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted a budget that has some compassion for the 
seniors in our country.  When it comes to overspending, patronage 
or pork-barrelling, these Liberal governments can never be 
accused of dragging their feet, but somehow they missed the 
seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget offers no benefits for Canada's seniors.  Two years 
ago the Liberals announced the new seniors benefit proposals. Two 
years later, now, seniors are still waiting to find out what it 
is all about.  Two years later, seniors are still wondering how 
it is going to affect their retirement plans.  When the seniors 
benefit kicks in, if it does, seniors will be looking at it, 
wondering what it has been all about because there has been 
precious little released on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not know how to plan for their retirement appropriately 
to work into the new seniors benefits because they do not know 
what is in store for them.  They are angry and afraid.  For 
instance, this great benefit will not even begin to help the 
poorest seniors.  It will provide them with a scant 17 cents a 
day in increased benefits and that is not enough to buy a cup of 
coffee in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, this being zero help to the poor seniors, the 
benefit discriminates against the middle income and upper income 
seniors by taxing back up to 75% of their personal retirement 
savings that they have sacrificed and put away so they can be 
secure in their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means is that the poorest seniors will not benefit and 
the seniors who make sacrifices in their working career will be 
penalized for doing so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is the heart of the matter.  Canadians expected a budget 
that would respect the challenges and the sacrifices they have 
made in their lives.  They wanted a budget that tells them that 
the government appreciates the challenges they face and thanks 
them for the sacrifices they make; for the young boy up on his 
father's shoulders looking around believing every dream was 
possible; for the students up late at night studying, trying to 
make their dreams possible; for the mid-career Canadians hoping 
for their dream of a secure retirement; for the seniors who have 
had their dream of retirement with dignity shattered.  Where in 
the budget are the dreams of Canadians?  There are no dreams, 
only nightmares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are high taxation levels, promises of debt reduction that 
have been broken and increased spending programs that give ample 
evidence that the tax and spend days of the Liberals are back 
again.  The only thing that happened was that Canadians woke up 
to the reality that this Liberal government is not the caring 
government it claims to be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a couple of points. I 
find it somewhat amusing to actually have a member of the Reform 
Party talk about the fact that this is not a caring government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only want to remind the hon. member that some of the documents 
that the Reform Party has put out talk about reduction in program 
spending to 10.5% of GDP, which equates to $10 billion, another 
$10 billion to be found somewhere.  The Reform Party talks about 
spending more on education and health care and reinvesting in 
Canadians when in fact it does not talk about where it is going 
to get that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party offers up a bunch of one time savings that even 
the auditor general says are only one time savings. It talks 
about ongoing expenditures. It talks about cutting equalization 
which will affect the majority of provinces. That is what the 
Reform Party is talking about.  At the same time it talks about 
caring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about student loans and that this budget does nothing 
for students.  We spent the last week talking to a number of 
university students and college students who talked about the 
investment that this government has finally made in education so 
that students do have access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to stand up and say that this 
budget was wrong when it now allows a student to write off the 
interest cost they incur for their education, just like a 
business writes off the costs that it would incur to run its 
business.  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member focuses on the millennium scholarship.  It is a seven 
point program.  The hon. member should take the time to read what 
the education package is all about so that he can go out and 
speak intelligently with the students in his own riding and not 
just focus on one particular part of the strategy that he does 
not like.  I would submit that Canadian do support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, the old Liberal 
arithmetic is going full force over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member absolutely knows that the millennium fund is a trophy 
for the outgoing prime minister.  It is going to benefit only 6% 
of the students in this country.  What about the other 94% who 
will not be able to take part in it?  For those 6% it does 
benefit, the tax increases this government has put in have 
ensured it will get back every single penny and more from those 
6% once they start their jobs.  That is the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also look at the economy.  The one thing the Liberals do 
not get as far as building a healthy economy is that there is a 
undeniable direct link between lower tax regimes and lower 
unemployment and an economic growth.  There is a direct link. 
Countries with low or even reasonable tax regimes have much lower 
unemployment than we have in Canada and they have a healthier 
economy that is growing at a better rate than Canada's.  These 
Liberals do not get that because it is not in their philosophy to 
give a reasonable tax regime to Canada.  They do not get it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have been listening very intensely all morning to the 
so-called sharing and caring Liberal government and now I have a 
question for the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard about the money flowing back into education and the 
health care system from this government.  My understanding is 
that it has ripped billions out of this system and is now 
basically giving us back pennies in return.  I would appreciate 
if the hon. member could address this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, the fact is, to use the 
words of the finance minister, that since 1993 the Liberal 
government has ripped seven and a half billion dollars out of the 
health care and education systems.  Now it is looking for the 
crown of heroes for putting a billion and a half back.  That is a 
net loss of six billion dollars.  The government is putting the 
money back by specifically targeting it for pure political means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to voice our 
views on the budget.  Six provinces already have balanced budget 
legislation in place but this government does not. Balanced 
budgets should be mandatory for every government by legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the pen of the finance minister filled with the black 
ink given to him by the Prime Minister but the Canadian 
taxpayers who have made the balanced budget.   Seventy per cent 
of the deficit was eliminated by the increase in tax revenues. 
Canadians now pay 56% more tax than the average of the G-7 
countries and 23% more tax than the average of the OECD 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it took office, this government has increased taxes 37 
times and has squeezed every dollar from the taxpayers.  It has 
squeezed $48 billion worth of revenue from taxpayers and has 
added $83 billion to the huge debt that now stands at $583 
billion.  This has been accumulated by the mismanagement and lack 
of vision of this Liberal government and previous Tory 
governments one after the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average Canadian families pay $6,000 per year just to pay the 
interest payment of $45 billion on the debt.  A third of each 
dollar goes to service the debt.  A newborn baby is not assured 
of good health care, education, a job or a pension.  That newborn 
baby is assured of one thing, a $20,000 debt.  That is shameful 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made no real effort to give tax relief to 
taxpayers or to lay out a plan to pay the huge debt.  It is this 
debt and the high tax rate that discourage domestic and foreign 
investment in Canada.  The debt and the high tax rate stagnate 
job creation in Canada.  The debt and tax rate hinder economic 
growth in Canada.  The debt and the high tax rate cause the brain 
drain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget day was a martyrdom day for this country.  The Liberal 
finance minister has sacrificed the future prosperity of Canadian 
taxpayers.  He has made martyrs out of Canadian taxpayers.  If a 
budget is balanced by increasing tax revenue alone, it could have 
been done 25 years ago.  Where was this Prime Minister who was 
then finance minister in the Liberal government?  Where was that 
bottle of black ink 25 years ago if he wanted to balance the 
budget? 
It has not reduced federal spending at all.  It has not pursued 
the elimination of waste in the government.  This government has 
all kinds of credit cards and cheque books even for future 
generations and is issuing one cheque after the other.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget the government has already announced 17 new 
spending initiatives worth $11 billion.  This shows that the 
government completely lacks vision and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day the Leader of the Opposition and other colleagues 
gave many examples of irresponsible spending by this government. 
Let me turn for a minute to my critic role.  This budget adds $90 
million to foreign aid this year and $50 million to it next year, 
while foreign aid donated by other countries around the world has 
decreased.  The private sector investment is increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By throwing out more money, this government is rewarding the 
CIDA minister for her failures, inefficiencies and mismanagement. 
The CIDA minister has said before the committee on foreign 
affairs and international trade “the cuts in the budget have 
made us work smarter”.  What a funny quote.  Why could her 
ministry not work smarter before the cuts were made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, on page 29 of red book II it promised that 
50% of a surplus would be used to reduce the debt and the other 
50% would be used to address social and economic needs through 
program expenditures.  But this government, like its GST promise, 
its jobs, jobs, jobs promise, and like 136 other promises, has 
again betrayed the trust of Canadians.  We know that Canadians 
will not forget this great betrayal by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two economists from the major banks are saying that the 
government is understating its surplus by $5 billion to $6 
billion this year and $9 billion to $10 billion next year.  This 
government should not play political football with the future of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. 
We have been very disappointed with what we have learned about 
the political mismanagement by the Liberals of federal government 
affairs which were brought, one after the other, before the 
committee.  According to the Auditor General of Canada, the 
Liberals have overstated the 1996-97 federal deficit by $800 
million.  How?  It has paid the $800 million to a dummy 
organization which did not even exist in that fiscal year.  What 
a shame.  That $800 million was paid to a company that did not 
even exist in that fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example.  The auditor general insists that the 
Liberals eliminate their $20 billion gap between their estimates 
and the actual liabilities of the federal government's employee 
pensions.  The auditor general made it very clear that the $20 
billion figure was based on a political decision and not on an 
accounting decision.  The Liberals are using creative accounting 
practices, something no small or medium size business could ever 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has scolded the Liberals for not following 
the generally accepted accounting principles or the public sector 
accounting auditing board guidelines.  If it is not a cooking of 
the books what is it?  They should not follow the laws of the 
cooks but the laws of the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be credible, honest, clear, 
straightforward and accountable to Canadians.  It must maintain 
transparent accounts.  This is not leadership by example.  How 
can Canadians trust this finance minister regarding what he calls 
a balanced budget?  Why does this minister use a surplus to play 
politics with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than caring about the future of Canadians, I think this 
budget looks like a shell game.  Canadians cannot be fooled by 
this shell game.

the other parent took care of the children and the family at 
home.  Nowadays and for some time both parents work and the 
average family makes less money.  Parents get less time to spend 
with their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those children go to school they have to struggle to get 
quality education with the competition and it being so expensive. 
They go to schools which are famous for drugs, gangs and crime. 
When they graduate they have to struggle to get jobs.  There is 
18% unemployment rate for youth.  When they get jobs they go on 
the same vicious cycle of paying taxes and in the end when the 
time comes for retirement the situation is terrible.  There may 
be no money left for their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is unfair and the government lacks accountability. 
The government lacks vision.  Every corner of our lives is 
mismanaged by big government.  It may be the Young Offenders Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I just listened to a maze of questions that led nowhere. 
The member never got out of the maze.  The facts and figures he 
laid on the table were typical after the fact set-up by Reform 
Party.  If there was any intelligence I could not find it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know the basis of the facts he presented.  This 
is the number one country in the world for the third year in a 
row.  It is leading the G-7 in its fiscal responsibilities.  It 
is looked up to all around the world.  However people across the 
way are so close to the problem they are blinded by the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to give us some facts to support his 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, the question by the 
hon. member suggests that he is out of touch with the books.  He 
is out of touch with Canadians.  He is out of touch with his 
constituents who will tell him that Canada is paying 56% more tax 
than the average of the G-7 countries.  The average Canadian is 
paying 23% more tax than the average of all OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member on the other side should spend some time looking 
at the auditor general's report.  He will find the same facts and 
figures I am speaking about in that report.  They will show that 
the member is out of touch.  He should read those books and tell 
the finance minister what the auditor general is saying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, when I listen to the member for Surrey Central it sounds 
like he is speaking about a third world country.  We have the 
best country in the world and there is an historical reason why 
that is so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to the member talk about credibility I have to ask 
him for which party he ran for nomination in the last election. 
He lost that nomination and then went over to the Reform.  That 
is credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a comment regarding the auditor general's finding on 
$800 million which relate to the infrastructure fund for renewal 
of research infrastructure.  That $800 million commitment was 
made in the last budget.  The liability occurred in the last 
budget.  All the member can criticize is the fact that we were up 
front with taxpayers. 
We said that we incurred an $800 million liability in the last 
budget and that we would experience a debt in that fiscal year. 
If that is not honesty in accounting, I do not know what is. 
There was a genuine disagreement with the auditor general.  Most 
members of the public accounts committee disagreed with the 
auditor general.

up for Canada instead of running it down continually? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I ask the member to 
withdraw the false statement he made in the House that I ran for 
nomination for another political party.  I ran only for one party

Reform Party.  I ask the member to withdraw the false statement 
he just made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to answer his question.  His facts are not right 
because he never bothers to read the facts.  The Canada 
Foundation for Innovation was formed in April 1997.  The payment 
was made to the foundation on July 31, 1997.  The books of the 
government closed on March 31.  The $800 million is a commitment, 
not a liability.  The government cannot put commitments on the 
books.  Liabilities have to be put on the books.  If the people 
who run private businesses did that they would be thrown into 
jail.

all ages is giving way to confidence and optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to the Minister of Finance whose leadership in the 
past five years in making this extraordinary feat possible— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member during this 
debate, but a false statement has been made in the House which 
damages my personal character and personality.  I ask the hon. 
member to withdraw the statement.  He alleged that I sought the 
nomination for another party, which I did not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I advise the hon. 
member that I will be checking the blues and I will get back to 
him as soon as we check the statements made by the other hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to pay 
tribute to the Minister of Finance whose leadership over the last 
five years has resulted in making this extraordinary feat 
possible.  Prospects for Canadians have not been as good in a 
very long time.  It is through the responsible stewardship of the 
nation's finances that we have reached the enviable position we 
find ourselves in today.  One need not go much beyond the various 
countries of the world that are glowing in their praise of what 
we have been able to accomplish in Canada in very short order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This remarkable turn of events required discipline in terms of 
the leadership of the country but, most important, it required a 
considerable sacrifice from rank and file Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did to balance the budget under the 
leadership of the finance minister was not based on ideology. 
Rather it was based on sheer necessity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 we inherited a $42 billion plus debt.  The recovery 
process was hard on Canadians, was hard on Atlantic Canadians. As 
a progressive Liberal myself, I am reminded of the challenges 
faced by the government to secure the long term sustainability of 
our social safety net.  It has certainly not been easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it had to be done.  Re-engineering, restructuring, 
downsizing, reorganization and ultimately the reining in of 
government spending were necessary.  Now that the fiscal house is 
in order, the far-sightedness of government allows us to begin 
the process of recovery and building a secure future for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget speaks to two principal objectives in that regard, 
the first being prosperity.  Job creation is recognized as the 
basis upon which Canadians will share in a more prosperous 
economy.  Illustrative of the prosperity strategy in the budget 
of 1998 is the Canadian millennium scholarship foundation.  By 
putting aside $2.5 billion this year, by the year 2000 funding 
will be solidly in place to provide 100,000 scholarships both 
full and part time for each of the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other important prosperity initiatives in the budget: 
the Canada study grants, tax relief for students to retire their 
debt, encouraging educational savings, more R and D, and helping 
Canadians upgrade their skills in the area of life long learning. 
Prosperity for this generation and the next is based on 
knowledge, skills and education infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a generous country, more especially so when Canada is 
prosperous.  If we take away prosperity, equity is no doubt 
affected.  If we take away equity, prosperity is tainted. Both 
equity and prosperity are what Canada therefore must stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second objective in the budget is equity.  The Canadian 
millennium scholarship foundation, for example, makes it possible 
for Canadians, regardless of their ability to pay, to access 
educational opportunities.  This is equal opportunity at its 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing the scholarship fund this week the Prime Minister 
has helped raise the bar for thousands of Canadians who will now 
be able to attend our universities and colleges.  If there is any 
doubt as to what I have just said, hon. members should ask the 
president of the University of New Brunswick student association, 
the student association president at St. Thomas University in 
Fredericton and students anywhere in Canada, what equal access to 
post-secondary education really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should ask Cynthia Hilliard, Ontario community 
college student, parliamentary association president who said of 
the budget that at long last we were seeing a government make a 
commitment to life long learning instead of giving it lip 
service.  They should ask Lucie Bohac Konrad, executive director 
of the Canadian Youth Foundation, who said that overall it was a 
good day for Canadians and with the budget young people could 
look forward to some relief from the crushing burden of almost a 
decade of youth joblessness and increasing shares of education 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget contains several other equity pieces as well: 
tax relief for interest on student loans, education credit for 
part time students, child care deduction for part time students, 
tax free RRSP withdrawals for life long learning, increased child 
care expense deductions, enriching the Canadian child tax 
benefit, helping those caring for families, eliminating EI 
premiums for students under the age of 24, deducting health 
premiums for self-employed Canadians, and tax relief for 
volunteer emergency service workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an important feature in the budget in terms of its 
regional impact.  All initiatives in the budget assist Atlantic 
Canada significantly but none of them marginalizes Atlantic 
Canada.  Atlantic Canada benefits by the improved educational 
infrastructure.  It ultimately will benefit by stemming the brain 
drain.  This then is the prosperity and equity agenda at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago I announced through ACOA a $7 million technology 
initiative at UNB, putting it at the cutting edge in Canada.

that will allow young Canadians with disabilities access to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are national programs that make sense in Atlantic Canada. 
I want to emphasize how important ACOA is to our region.  I say 
so because Canada has such diversity that regional development 
instruments are required and regional agencies are a way for us 
to make national programs tailor made for regional needs.  ACOA 
is critically important to Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address briefly my own ministry, a ministry with 
an annual budget of over $2.6 billion.  To our office, to our 
ministry, public safety is overarching.  That is the business of 
the Ministry of the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we have two major priorities, dealing with organized 
crime and effective corrections.  On the organized crime front, 
it seems to me that only an organization as large and as national 
as the ministry, in particular in this case the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, with that kind of breadth in Canada can take on a 
leadership role to deal with what is a significant issue in 
Canada, organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone to great lengths in the last Parliament and in this 
Parliament to revive law enforcement agencies and the tools they 
need in terms of anti-gang legislation, proceeds of crime, the 
new DNA legislation.  We have gone to great lengths to provide 
tools in law enforcement but we also have to recognize a huge 
obligation on the co-ordination side, given that we have access 
to all corners of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of effective corrections, we want to provide 
alternatives for low risk offenders so that those people who 
would be more appropriately dealt with in the community will be 
there, reserving of course the opportunity in the institutions 
available to the correctional service to deal with offenders 
whose crimes are more dangerous and more violent and who pose a 
greater risk to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making that delineation more effectively, and great efforts 
have been made in the last Parliament to do so, we are going to 
get better and more efficient results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to build up the infrastructure in communities to allow 
us to do that.  That is a principal part of what we are going to 
be doing this year in the area of effective corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Linked to these priorities of course is the all important matter 
of crime prevention.  To break the cycle that leads to an 
overloaded justice system and overcrowded prisons, it is very 
important that we recognize the root causes for crime, be they 
poverty, economic circumstances or regional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is at the end of the day the country is going to be all 
the safer if we get to those root causes and not deal only with 
these issues after the damage has been done.  The result of 
course will always be a safer, healthier community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, inside the ministry there will be responsibility for 
aboriginal policing in corrections, national security and the 
integrated justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line for the Solicitor General of Canada is the 
safety of Canadians.  I am proud to say that Canada's law 
enforcement and corrections systems are among the very best in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the 1998 budget symbolized by the Prime 
Minister's millennium scholarship fund is a perfect example of a 
national policy that pursues both prosperity and equity. This is 
the hallmark of the great Liberal Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the remarks made by my hon. 
colleague in praise of the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he acknowledge the fact that, in Quebec alone, the cuts made 
in transfer payments to the provinces and in employment insurance 
have resulted in the number of welfare recipients increasing by 
200,000? According to a recent study by Montreal economist 
Fortin, there are now 730,000 more Canadians on welfare. This is 
not necessarily good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague also talked about how great the millennium 
scholarships were, saying “Ask any student in Canada; they'll 
tell you how great the Prime Minister's scholarships are”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my hon. colleague could ask Nicholas Ducharme, the 
president of the Quebec students' association, who views these 
millennium scholarships as an ego trip on the part of the Prime 
Minister, in the sense that they constitute a monument to his 
political career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the cuts made in health and education, if it really 
cared about the student debt load, this government might have 
given this money directly to the students and right away, not two 
or three years down the road and without creating yet another 
administrative structure, as suggested by Mr. Ducharme, this 
student who is the president of the Quebec student's association. 
Indeed, he suggested that the federal government should give the 
money immediately to the students through the existing grants and 
loans system, which is excellent in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if my hon. colleague thinks that the 
increase in the number of people living on welfare in Canada is a 
good thing and that introducing these millennium scholarships is 
really an ego trip on the part of the Prime Minister. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the questions.  I can answer them relatively easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the exercise is an ego trip on the part of the 
Prime Minister.  Quite the contrary.  What this speaks to very 
specifically is that the future prosperity of Canada is 
inextricably linked to our ability to provide a well educated and 
to the largest extent possible publicly financed well educated 
students.  It is not only a matter of economic priority, although 
I can see that is a significant piece of it. It is also a matter 
of fundamental fairness.  I believe people who have the capacity 
and ability to go to university should have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the Canada student loans program was designed to 
offer that access.  Because of the economic circumstances 
following graduation and because tuitions were increasing, Canada 
student loans could no longer serve that purpose.  It was very 
important to deal with that.  I am glad that the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Finance did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this morning we heard one of the government members describe the 
budget as remarkable.  Just now we have heard another hon. member 
from the government describe this budget as an equity budget.  I 
find this astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to explain to the people of 
Canada that if this is an equity budget where in the budget is 
there a guarantee that pay equity will be provided for the women 
who work for the federal civil service.  If this is an equity 
budget, why is it that only 7% of students will have access to 
the millennium fund?  Why is it that there will be no increase in 
transfers for education to the provinces to ensure that tuition 
fees will not continue to skyrocket? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an equity budget.  I would ask the minister to 
explain to the people of Canada what he means by an equity 
budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to do just that.  There are many elements and I have 
recited a large number of those in speaking to the budget. 
Access to university has significantly improved.  The student 
associations in my constituency of the universities of New 
Brunswick and St. Thomas have said so glowingly and publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not been able to deal with all the things that fair 
minded Canadians would like to see us deal with.  Ultimately we 
would find ourselves in five years going through the exercise 
which we have just gone through if we thought we could accomplish 
everything that we would like to without regard for how much 
resources are available to accomplish those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to those things in the budget that speak to questions of 
equity and I applaud them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is to be congratulated on leading this 
nation from a state of economic stagnation and a deficit of $42 
billion to a balanced budget, the first in almost 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Neysmith, president of the Canadian Bond Rating Service, 
stated: “The Minister of Finance and the Liberals have 
accomplished what they actually set out to accomplish.  They 
achieved a balanced budget.  They achieved it ahead of schedule, 
and from that point of view, you have to give them full marks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been disappointed to see the members of the opposition 
take such partisan approaches to this accomplishment.  Canadians 
clearly support this approach and the determination of the 
government to get our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members harangued the government about the deficit. 
Now that the books have been balanced and now that we have a 
balanced budget for the next two years, we hear cries of 
“shame” because it was not balanced the way they would have 
done it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harry Houdini is alive and well and living on the opposition 
benches.  They would provide deep tax cuts, eliminate the debt 
and provide social programs, it seems, through various magic 
vanishing acts.  The government, however, has to deal with 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end results prove that the government made the tough 
decisions and with the support and understanding of Canadians it 
made Canada the first G-7 nation to balance its books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is about choices, it is about leadership and providing 
a clear vision for the future.  This budget has mapped out a 
vision of economic and fiscal planning that will secure a bright 
road ahead for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to host a post-budget breakfast in my 
riding last week.  I had representatives from the chamber of 
commerce, community organizations, social agencies, young people 
and municipal councils.  A common theme was heard during the 
discussions. We have our priorities straight. Debt reduction is 
front and centre, followed by new expenditures for skills 
development and health and selective tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three key elements were welcomed by the participants at my 
meeting, namely a two year fiscal plan based on prudent economic 
planning assumptions, as the current plan commits to balanced 
budgets over the next two years; the inclusion in the fiscal plan 
of a contingency reserve of $3 billion in each year; and the use 
of a contingency reserve when it is not needed to pay down the 
public debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could mean that if the contingency reserve is not needed, 
up to $9 billion could be used to pay down the public debt.  The 
minister has been cautious and prudent in his calculations.  The 
debt to GDP ratio is the most relevant measure of a country's 
ability to manage its debt.  It represents a true measure of debt 
burden.  The government has already paid down almost $13 billion 
in market debt so far this year.  More important, however, the 
debt to GDP ratio will be put on a permanent downward track 
through sustained economic growth and debt repayment plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to bringing down the debt quickly 
and it has a strategy in place to do so.  Given the effectiveness 
of the government in dealing with the deficit, I believe 
Canadians support this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. John's <I>Evening Telegram</I> stated on February 25 that 
while the $13 billion payment will not cure everything overnight, 
it is a promise that the country will not be plunged into the 
debt more deeply in the future, that it will no longer mortgage 
our children's futures, and with the economic returns on the 
fiscal year yet to come in, even more may yet be applied to the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget speaks to youth.  As Lucie Konrad, executive director 
of the Canadian Youth Foundation stated, overall this is a good 
day for young Canadians.  With this budget, young people can look 
forward to some relief from the crushing burden of almost a 
decade of a youth jobless recovery and increasing share of rising 
education costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy provides a co-ordinated set 
of measures building on the 1996 and 1997 budgets to create 
opportunity by expanding access to knowledge and skills needed 
for better jobs and higher standards of living in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former educator I applaud the minister on placing a very 
high priority on providing greater opportunities for young people 
to prosper in the new knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget demonstrates leadership by announcing the Canadian 
millennium scholarships and Canada study grants, tax relief on 
student loan interest and improvements to the Canada Student 
Loans Act, supporting youth employment through education, 
insurance premium holidays for employers for the young Canadians 
they hire in 1999 and 2000. 
These are investments in our future.  Young people must be 
encouraged to dream and to seek opportunity in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has listened to the concerns of our youth. 
Heather Taylor of the University of Alberta student union stated 
that these educational measures in this budget are things for 
which we have been fighting for the past eight months.  It shows 
the government is listening to students.  It will have a huge 
impact on students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget provides for the first time tax relief for 
interest on student loans.  Beginning in 1998 all students will 
be eligible for a 17% federal tax credit on their student loan 
interest.  Interest relief extensions will help about 100,000 
graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editorial in the Toronto <I>Sun</I> on February 26 stated: 
“We applaud the finance minister.  We think he has made the 
right choice in the first post deficit budget.  The nation has a 
responsibility to help the 600,000 young Canadians who fear they 
will never have a good job or a decent career”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has talked about a need for tax relief.  The 
government will deliver $7 billion of tax relief over the next 
three years, tax relief for low and middle income Canadians 
through an increase in the basic personal exemption and the 
elimination of the 3% general surtax on Canadians with income up 
to $50,000. Those are two measures that will take 400,000 
Canadians off the tax rolls and reduce taxes for 14 million 
Canadians by the year 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not just talk tax reductions. It has taken 
clear and firm actions in this area.  The government is 
continuing to provide targeted tax relief.  I believe Canadians 
have examined the budget and have strongly indicated it is a 
balanced approach to the economic well-being of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the opposition that we have a four to five 
year mandate.  Obviously during that time we will be able to take 
other measures which I am sure Canadians will be supportive of. 
The next few years will continue to see tax relief and continued 
social spending in the area of health care. The impact of the 
1998 budget over three years is clear.  Forty per cent of new 
government spending focuses on investments in social and economic 
priorities and sixty per cent is targeted toward debt reduction 
and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated solid economic leadership that 
bodes well for the economic well-being of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last Friday the Manitoba government brought down its 
budget which indicated that $150 million would go to pay down the 
debt.  That figure is related to a timetable that brings down the 
debt to GDP ratio by the year 2028.  It is a hard and fast 
timetable to get the province of Manitoba at a manageable level 
of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member advise this House of the government's timetable 
for reducing Canada's overall debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  When the government was able to bring down the 
deficit, it was because we were controlling our own spending. 
The government has indicated three, three and three in relation 
to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that these figures are conservative. 
There is no question that if the performance of the economy 
continues to be bright, which I believe it will, we will be able 
to put more money toward debt reduction.  I indicated in my 
comments that $13 billion was earmarked for the debt and it has 
already brought down the debt measurably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident in the strategy the government has put in place. 
Let us be clear that the finance minister has put a clear debt 
reduction strategy in place.  The opposition wanted to know where 
we stood on it.  We have placed it front and centre.

like to return to the issue of education my colleague raised in 
his potpourri speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, education is a provincial matter.  I would ask my 
colleague whether he thinks the federal government could improve 
on what the provinces are doing currently with loans and grants 
by setting up the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to know whether, given the existing student 
debt load, he thinks it would not be better to give students 
money now rather than wait three or four years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that education is a provincial 
responsibility, although we know that the federal government 
provides significant dollars to the provinces for post-secondary 
education.  There is nothing in this budget which would suggest 
in any way that the federal government is interfering with 
provincial jurisdiction as far as educational curricula is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is providing needed assistance to students in 
this country.  The government is showing leadership. I cannot 
believe that anyone would be opposed to providing financial 
assistance, whether it is through tax credits or tax points, to 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the response of students, both inside and outside of 
Quebec, has been very positive.  Finally they are seeing true 
leadership in education.  The government is providing the 
necessary financial assistance to students.  That bodes well for 
students in the future.  We do not want them graduating from 
university with significant debt, and the figure often quoted is 
$25,000 per student. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to congratulate the hon. member for his 
involvement in the past budget.  He played a very integral role, 
as we saw in caucus, and he should be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if he would respond to some of the accusations 
which have been made by members opposite that perhaps the 
government was not in a position to invest in youth and 
education.  Would he care to respond to that and tell us if we 
actually were in a position to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question and his kind remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that in fact the government is targeting very 
clearly skills development.  The government clearly has looked at 
the role which youth will play in the next century and is 
providing the necessary dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canadian opportunities strategy.  Whether it is 
increased funding for advanced research, tax relief on student 
loans or assistance to employers through tax relief in terms of 
hiring in future years, the fact is that this government has made 
these things a high priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources development committee met with 
representatives of student associations from right across the

My congratulations go primarily to the provincial governments, 
which have had to manage cuts to their social, health care and

in order to balance its budget.  That is scandalous.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on now to my comments on the budget.  Like most 
Canadian politicians, the experts and journalists, I find 
nothing or next to nothing in this budget.  The proof is in the 
press reviews the following day, which said “That's it, that's 
all”.  Journalists and experts were describing it as lacking 
substance and vision.  The economists were calling it weak and 
insipid.  I will leave it at that, otherwise I will be spending 
my ten minutes commenting on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so nebulous that those opposite have started a promotional 
campaign and are asking their ministers, their big guns, to visit 
the ridings and sell the budget. 
The President of the Treasury Board was in my riding last week 
to sell the finance minister's budget.  What he finally said was 
that he was there to hear people's views on what the government 
should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some advice for the President of the Treasury Board.  Quit 
wasting your time.  This same finance minister started the 
practice of having the finance committee travel across Canada to 
take the public's pulse.  I even held a prebudget meeting in my 
riding.  All this work by the experts did not reach the finance 
minister's ears.  He was deaf to it, or perhaps too busy 
worrying about Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cross-Canada committee, as well as people from my riding, had 
some good suggestions for the finance minister. 
They suggested he stop cutting provincial transfer payments, put 
an end to the disgraceful waste of this government, clean up 
existing programs, index taxes and tax credits, reform taxation, 
lower the premiums paid by employers and employees to the EI fund 
by a significant amount, not a measly 20 cents, implement job 
creation programs, introduce an anti-deficit bill, and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Finance do?  He ignored these experts. 
He did absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there was the Millennium Fund, and I would like to talk 
about that.  What do we know about it?  Not a great deal, except 
that it will perhaps be based on need, or merit, it has not yet 
been decided, and that its president will be Mr. Landry, the 
president of Chrysler Canada.  This is a good opportunity for 
him to advertise his automobiles. 
That is all that we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one more thing that we know, and that is that this 
government has cut between $2.3 and $2.7 billion in education 
since 1993.  Now it is preening itself over a $2.5 billion fund. 
This government is going to continue to make cuts of over $10 
billion in education between now and 2003.  But still it creates 
a fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the stated and unstated purposes of this fund?  Is it a 
way of boosting the Prime Minister's image before he leaves 
active politics?  Is it a springboard for the finance minister 
in the race for leadership of his party?  The Prime Minister 
himself has admitted that one of the goals is to distribute or 
promote the Canadian flag. 
On February 26, the Liberals and the Reformers showed us in this 
House how good they are when it comes to promoting the Canadian 
flag.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that is condemned by everyone and 
confirmed by the following media report: “It is the government's 
stated goal to provoke and to get directly involved in the 
affairs of provincial governments, under the pretext of helping 
our students, starting in the year 2000. But students need help 
now. The government should be ashamed of playing politics at the 
expense of our students”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide some background on Quebec's loans and grants 
program. 
It was in 1964 that a true Prime Minister, a true Liberal, 
Lester B. Pearson, a Nobel Prize winner, set up the Canadian 
student loans program to help students continue their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of the Quebec premier of the day, the Hon. Jean 
Lesage, who wanted to manage and implement a program that would 
meet Quebec's needs, Mr. Pearson decided, after giving the idea 
some thought and finding nothing wrong with it, to give Quebec 
the right, or rather the privilege, because it did not confer any 
special status, to establish and manage its own program. The 
other Canadian provinces could have availed themselves of the 
same privilege, but they chose not to do so, preferring to manage 
an already established program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that Quebec now has a unique student loans and 
grants program that is superior to anything that exists elsewhere 
in Canada. Quebec spends $600 million on a program designed to 
provide loans and scholarships to 170,000 students. 
Our province also invested $18 million in a scholarship program 
based on merit. The net result of this is that education costs in 
Quebec are lower than in the rest of Canada, and the average debt 
of Quebec students is $11,000, compared to $25,000 in the rest of 
the country. Ottawa must grant Quebec the privilege to opt out 
with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by referring to an article which said that in 
1995, the federal Parliament adopted a motion recognizing 
Quebec's distinct character and formally guaranteeing Quebeckers 
that the departments, institutions and agencies of the Government 
of Canada would take that into account when making their 
decisions. The Liberals must live up to their commitments.

on the subject of the position adopted by the Quebec university 
students' association “millennium scholarships rejected”.  I am

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just a couple of points 
of clarification.  I think the hon. member in his speech 
indicated that the transfers to the provinces were going to 
continue to go down.  I would caution the hon. member that he 
should read the numbers again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in fact seen a reinvestment in the Canada health and 
social transfer of $1.5 billion a year.  He will also see because 
of the system of transfers being made up of cash and tax points 
that transfers to the provinces will continue to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak directly to the comments made on the millennium 
fund.  What does the hon. member say to the Fédération étudiante 
universitaire du Québec and the Fédération étudiante collégiale 
du Québec when they say they would like to see both governments 
co-operate, to set aside political squabbles and find a formula 
so they can have access to these funds because they need them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the students in Quebec and students right across the 
country are saying not to get into political squabbles, but to 
deal with the issues.  That is what we have attempted to do with 
the millennium scholarship fund.  There is a vast amount of 
support for this program by the students.  If the hon. member 
wants to help students he should stand in his place and support 
this scholarship fund which will ensure that students get the 
money they need to access education. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague opposite is hard 
of hearing or he did not listen to my speech, perhaps because it 
was in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying duplication must end, that the $82 million should 
come back to Quebec, that it must be sent, transferred to Quebec, 
and that Quebec is capable of looking after this $82 million.  We 
have proven it.  By managing the program established by Mr. 
Pearson, Quebec has a less expensive system of education, and its 
students have the smallest debt load.  Instead of spending money 
and treading on toes, the government should send the $82 million 
to Quebec and let it look after it.  Students would be better 
off. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank my hon. colleague from Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse for 
sharing her time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am pleased to take part in the discussion on this 
universally criticized budget.  Even if we agree with the 
results, we can have some very serious reservations on the means 
used to accomplish them, because we know that this zero deficit 
plus surpluses has been reached at the expense of the provinces, 
middle-income families, the unemployed, the sick, students and 
welfare recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where does this surplus come from?  In 1993, the Liberal red 
book said it was unrealistic to wish to eliminate the federal 
deficit in five years.  The Prime Minister stated that such an 
objective could not be attained without pillaging social 
programs, and no Liberal government would agree to do such a 
thing. 
Four budgets later, the federal deficit is now eliminated, but 
at the price they refused to pay in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main accomplishment of the Liberal government as far as 
beating the deficit is concerned can be summarized as follows: 
$42 billion in cuts to hospitals, universities and welfare, an 
employment insurance reform which impoverishes the unemployed, 
coupled with an economic upturn combined with non-indexed tax 
tables.  That is what the zero deficit is all about.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, let us face it, this approach of getting other people to do 
what one is incapable of doing oneself has put the federal 
government in a position where, for the first time in a long 
while, there was the possibility of somewhat lightening the tax 
burden of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, the working and the 
unemployed, in short those who are responsible for the situation 
we are now in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-four per cent, or more than half, of the cuts in 
expenditures made by the federal government between 1994 and 
1998, moreover, were dumped onto the governments of Quebec and 
the provinces, to the tune of $6.3 billion annually.  An annual 
amount of $6.3 billion is no trifle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in 1993, the Prime Minister stated “In our program, we have 
no intention of cutting payments to individuals or to the 
provinces. That is clear and it is in writing”. I refer those who 
may want to know where this quote is from to the September 25, 
1993 edition of <I>La Presse</I>. Of course, no one believed at the time 
that this promise would be kept any more than the others, the GST 
for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the current fiscal situation, which was achieved thanks 
to the efforts of provincial governments, permitted at the very 
least that the provinces be compensated for the losses caused by 
this offloading. To this end, the government could have given 
them as tax points 25% of the next two years' surpluses, thereby 
cancelling out the cuts imposed during the first Liberal mandate 
in the transfers for health, education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would have enabled the provincial governments to regain the 
flexibility lost in previous budgets while not affecting the 
federal government's finances. Indeed, it would still record a 
surplus of approximately $30.8 billion in 2001-02, even if 25% of 
the next two years' surpluses were paid back to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There they go creating new programs. It has been known for 
months that the finance minister's latest budget would be a 
surplus budget, or at least a balanced budget. All the 
stakeholders, be it the Bloc Quebecois or the other opposition 
parties, the premiers and finance ministers of Quebec or the 
provinces, asked, begged the Liberal government not to start 
spending again before having made up for the losses resulting 
from the cuts made these past few years in health, education and 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing was done.  The government has gone right back to wasting 
taxpayers' money, introducing a myriad of new measures that will 
duplicate or overlap what is already being done in the provinces, 
and running the risk of again losing control of its spending and 
plunging us into a deficit spiral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example of this renewed interference is the creation of 
millennium scholarships.  This fund is a pointless affront to the 
governments of Quebec and of the other provinces and makes no 
provision for withdrawal with compensation.  The Prime Minister 
is bent on sending out cheques with the maple leaf on them and 
was certainly not going to be stopped by considerations of 
jurisdiction, as defined in his own Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in an article about a new home care program, a 
health department official told us why the federal government 
was introducing this new program:  “We want to see the maple leaf 
on the cheque”.  As one of my constituents said to me, if the 
Prime Minister is so interested in visibility, all he has to do 
is put his picture on the twenty-dollar bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec already has a student assistance program that is a vast 
improvement on all similar programs in Canadian provinces.  Not 
only is it the only program with loans that are advantageous for 
students, but it is the only one where they do not have to pay 
back scholarships when they graduate.  The result is that the 
average indebtedness of Quebec students is half that of students 
in other provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in Quebec wants to see that money wasted on some program 
that would duplicate what is already being done and done well. 
Even the education sector condemns this “operation visibility” 
which, in the end, will be conducted at the expense of the 
students themselves. Hopefully, the appeals to common sense made 
by Quebec stakeholders will be heard by the Prime Minister, 
before the upcoming meeting with Quebec government officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about health, since I am the critic on this 
issue. In Quebec, and everywhere in Canada, health is probably 
the sector where the federal government has done the most damage. 
Disconnected as it is from the medical realities in the 
provinces, the federal government offloaded its deficit onto 
provincial health programs, at a time when the provinces 
themselves were in the middle of a restructuring process. After 
blaming the provinces for its cuts, the federal government should 
have redistributed the surplus of the last budget to alleviate 
the negative impact that it helped create in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the new budget does confirm that federal cuts totalling $42 
billion will be made between now and the year 2002. However, it 
is silent on how the government will use the additional $70 
million that will be generated by the increase on tobacco taxes. 
The budget includes no new measures to deter young people from 
smoking, and it does not provide any compensation for sports and 
cultural events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the biggest disappointment is the lack of any reference to 
the financial compensation the victims of Hepatitis C 
contamination have been awaiting for years, which the government 
can now afford to pay immediately.  Unfortunately, a measure of 
this type did not fit in with the Liberal's objective of keeping 
a high profile. Yet the federal government could implement this 
immediately, without waiting for the provinces, which are already 
saddled with the costs of services provided to these victims 
through the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest surprise where health is concerned came, not in the 
budget speech, but from the mouth of the Minister of Health, when 
he brought into the open the federal government's true intentions 
as far as encroachments on health are concerned.  This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since you are indicating I have only a minute left, Mr. Speaker, 
I will move on immediately to my conclusion, which is that the 
latest budget by the Minister of Finance has once again confirmed 
what the Bloc Quebecois has been saying for a number of years, 
that the federal government's plan is to put the provinces in a 
shaky situation budget-wise, and then to come along to rescue them 
with new initiatives in areas that fall within provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best illustration of this approach is provided by the 
President of Treasury Board himself, with his statement that 
“When Bouchard has to make cuts, we in Ottawa will then be able 
to demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of 
social programs”.  Here we have both overlap and duplication.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened as the hon. member 
went on and on about how the government was hell bent on creating 
duplication, overlap and all the rest of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I made a point about what the students of Quebec were 
saying.  They want provincial governments and the federal 
government to work together to ensure that this program works, to 
ensure that students have access to post-secondary education and 
skills training so they can compete for the jobs, and to ensure 
they have the quality of life we all want them to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again the hon. member made reference to the 
millennium scholarship fund.  It is not about creating a 
bureaucracy.  It is not about overlap.  It is essentially about 
putting money directly into the pockets of students.  It is 
bypassing politicians.  It is bypassing institutions.  It is 
bypassing bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the sole motivation of the government 
was to ensure there was a flag on every cheque.  The sole 
motivation of the government is to allow young Canadians 
opportunity and access to skills training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today that the difference 
between those that have opportunity and those who do not is 
education. 
That is the great equalizer.  We want to ensure that every 
student has opportunity and access to that information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member keeps talking about how the government wants to 
get in the way of the provinces.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  I 
believe that young Canadians who want to see access and want to 
see the millennium scholarship work support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member will say that her motivation is to say 
that they want Quebeckers, young Canadians and Canadians in all 
other provinces, to have improved access to education and 
improved access to opportunity.  I hope they will work with us to 
ensure that in fact will occur. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can understand the secretary 
of state defending the budget.  What I do not understand and what 
I reject is the extent of his lack of knowledge of the Quebec 
system of loans and grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund simply duplicates things.  He cannot deny 
that.  If he understands the Quebec system, if he has examined 
it or if he is interested in it he will see that this fund 
duplicates what already exists.  Why not give this $80 million to 
the provinces in compensation and to help them improve a system 
they all approve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the provincial ministers of finance and education acknowledge 
that in Quebec we have the best system of student loans and 
grants. 
I do not know where he gets the idea that students do not agree 
with us and are in favour of the millennium fund, because it is 
not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He only need contact the various representatives of certain 
federations, such as the Fédération des universités et des 
cégeps and the Fédération des étudiants du postsecondaire to 
discover their total disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, students receive an average of $3,800 annually in 
grants open to all students, according to need.  The millennium 
fund promises $3,000 on the basis of need and merit, to be 
determined by a board of directors.  This is a waste.  Where is 
the system that will really ensure justice or determine a 
student's merit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think a student in debt, who is poor and has to work part 
time to pay for his studies, is going to do as well as a student 
whose parents are well off and can look after his needs?  This is 
where the unfairness lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless, what is being proposed at the moment is the 
duplication, in Quebec, of one of the best systems, a system 
praised across Canada.  So why not give Quebec the right to opt 
out with compensation so it can help more students who are in 
debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the government go back to the drawing board on this 
and, if it is really so open, allow Quebec to opt out of the 
millennium fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
the outset I would like to indicate that I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Durham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my address today by extending my personal 
congratulations to the Minister of Finance.  The minister has in 
this fiscal year achieved something that no other finance 
minister has been able to do since 1969.  He has brought order to 
the country's finances.  Not only are the books balanced this 
year but it is projected that they will balance for the next two 
consecutive fiscal years, a feat that has not been matched by any 
Canadian federal administration for half a century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a small and traditional farming community that was 
built firmly upon the premise of hard work.  Over the years I 
remember several instances when, after completing a very long 
tiring and productive day in the fields or in the barn, all that 
I desired in the world was a few hours of rest. 
In short, often the most welcome reward for an honest day's work 
is a good night's sleep.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be among the first to say that the minister has now 
completed the proverbial hard day's work and is to be 
congratulated for that.  When the aforementioned theories are 
applied to the completion of the task of bringing order to our 
financial house, one would think an accomplishment of this 
magnitude would be a feat sufficient enough to warrant at least a 
momentary time of reflection; a break in what has been a constant 
four year crusade to eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what one might think.  However, as a lifelong farmer 
turned politician I would have to say that national fiscal 
management is certainly not comparable to hard work on the farm. 
If it were, I am afraid that the cattle would long be gone and it 
would perhaps be too late to close the gate to the corral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess what I am trying to say is that we have now balanced the 
books but we must not become too complacent.  If we let down our 
guard we run the risk of permitting last year's crop of problems 
to once again take root.  We must never forget it was only four 
short years ago that our annual deficit stood at over $42 
billion.  Inflation was soaring.  The only thing lower than 
consumer spending was consumer confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 there were fierce storm clouds collecting on the 
horizon.  This bleak economic outlook which was perpetrated by a 
blatant mismanagement of the public purse forced us into a 
position where we had to borrow over $30 billion annually on 
foreign money markets just to service the accumulated public 
debt.  In the most basic of terms we were paying our Visa card's 
minimum monthly balance with our American Express in the hope 
that we would one day get a pay raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear to anyone with even the most rudimentary of 
mathematical skills that this trend was neither practical nor 
sustainable.  I cannot fathom that even one single Canadian or 
businessman would have attempted to justify this or to apply the 
practice to his or her own fiscal life without expecting dire 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that to an outsider it must have seemed like we 
were building the social fabric of Canada in a manner which could 
only be compared to the construction techniques of a house of 
cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, with financial chaos looming over our heads, Canadians 
demanded that their government immediately move to rectify the 
problem of the treasury being in constant overdraft.  Canadians 
called upon the Liberals to tackle the nation's financial crisis. 
Prior to 1993 the Department of Finance routinely set and missed 
its own targets, which caused international investors to become 
apprehensive at the mere mention of investing in Canada.  In a 
nutshell, the confidence that our citizens and business leaders 
once enjoyed was rapidly and needlessly eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately after assuming office the government took firm 
control of the financial reins of the country.  In his 1995 
budget the Minister of Finance declared “We have broken the back 
of the deficit”.  This was the first in a series of 
announcements which signalled the beginning of a long and overdue 
journey along the road to financial recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 24 of this year the Minister of Finance announced 
that the goal had at long last been realized.  For the first time 
in 50 years there seemed to be a genuine light at the end of the 
tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt that the 1998 federal budget represents a 
turning point on the national course.  Our path both socially and 
economically has been dramatically altered for the better, 
hopefully forever.  No longer are we financing our current 
lifestyle by committing to a second and third mortgage on our 
children's future.  In the words of the finance minister “the 
government has cut up its credit cards”, an announcement that I 
am all too happy to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just prior to the budget I held a public forum to consult with 
my constituents on this issue.  As always, I was impressed with 
the high quality of input I received from the residents of my 
riding of Huron—Bruce.  Although the group was made up of people 
from several different political stripes, we checked our politics 
at the door and proceeded to have a productive discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was unanimity in the belief that our massive federal debt 
had placed Canada in an ever weakening position with respect to 
global economic credibility.  Our capacity to effectively 
negotiate trade deals, direct the internal inflation rate, 
control domestic employment levels, and to set and to execute 
national priorities were all being seriously hindered.  In short, 
the government's ability to effectively govern was in danger of 
falling victim to total erosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was agreed that if we were to truly overcome our money 
problems we must adopt a two pronged approach.  First, we must 
begin to pay down our massive federal debt.  Second, we must 
reinvest in the areas hardest hit by cost cutting:  health, 
education and skills development.  In the report presented to the 
Standing Committee on Finance this notion was summarized by 
saying that we must not sell the house to pay the mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since first assuming office in 1993 our government has 
maintained that after we managed to remove the red ink from the 
national balance sheet we would begin to tackle the problem of 
the debt and that we would expand upon our commitment to reinvest 
in valuable social programs, youth and skills development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, this year the budget theme is building Canada for 
the 21st century a strong economy and a secure society. 
Financially speaking we are now in a position to begin to reap at 
least some of the benefits accumulated as a dividend of over four 
years of belt tightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with balancing the books this government has once again 
resisted the urge to increase personal income taxes.  Quite to 
the contrary, we have provided at least some form of tax relief 
to nearly 14 million low and middle income Canadians.  This was 
done by reducing or eliminating entirely the 3% federal surtax 
for individuals who have income levels of less than $65,000 per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also increased the basic personal tax exemption by $500 
and we have earmarked another $850 million to enhance the child 
tax benefit.  This is in addition to the various other tax 
credits and new exemptions that were announced on budget day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that many of our colleagues claim we did not go far 
enough with our tax reduction strategy.  To those people I would 
say that if reducing or eliminating federal income tax for 90% of 
the current taxpayers does not constitute real tax relief, then 
what does? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 election the Liberals committed that it was our goal 
to, after a zero deficit had been achieved, put the debt to GDP 
ratio on a permanent downward track. Without question we have 
done just that.  It should be noted that in 1995 the 
aforementioned ratio was hovering at almost 72%.  By the turn of 
the century, it will sit at approximately 63%, nearly a 10% 
decrease in five short years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we have managed to broker a new three year 
agreement with the Bank of Canada that will see a continuation of 
the inflation control targets.  This agreement promises to keep 
the national rate of inflation inside the range of 1% to 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of this monetary policy are simple:  to 
contribute to sustainable expansion, to support high levels of 
employment and a rising standard of living.  These I believe are 
goals that every Canadian can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to tax breaks for those who need them the most, in 
addition to balancing the books into the next millennium and in 
addition to cutting the cost of running the government, we have 
also begun to reinvest in education and health. Time and time 
again these have been clearly identified as national priority 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget announced measures designed to address the mounting 
problem of student debt and unemployment.  To this end I believe 
that the $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund, the 17% of 
student tax credit, the EI premium holiday for small businesses 
that hire students and the increase to the RESP levels will go a 
long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree there are still unsolved problems facing us, however 
this budget represents a positive first step.  Rome was not built 
in a day.  And who are we to think that a country as great as 
this one can be repaired with one budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be proud today.  Together we have achieved what 
seemed impossible only four years ago.  Fundamental problems have 
caused a fundamental change in the way that government operates. 
The days of wasteful overspending and foolish megaprojects are 
gone forever.  They have been replaced by an era of strategic 
investment and co-operative partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can argue the pros and cons of this budget until the cows 
come home but the facts are obvious.  The business community has 
begun to once again regain its lost faith in the state of 
Canada's finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 interest rates have dropped to record lows, consumer 
confidence has increased and our economy has begun to grow in 
leaps and bounds.  In fact the latest projections place Canada in 
the best financial shape of all the G-7 nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House is divided into five officially recognized political 
parties each applying a somewhat different philosophy and 
different agenda.  As Liberals we have a very long history of 
fostering a strong sense of community responsibility. Canadians 
view many of our social programs as defining national 
characteristics.  I am happy to hear that the 1998 budget 
reaffirms our continuing commitment to many of these core 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget clearly recognizes the need to stay the course with 
respect to fiscal prudence.  Indeed this budget does many 
positive things.  However its real strength comes from what it 
does not do.  What it does not do is lose sight of the values 
that we as a country hold in the highest regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the policy changes announced in this budget was an 
increase in the child care tax deduction from $5,000 to $7,000. 
The minister has claimed that this is an indication of the 
government's commitment to children.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increase in the child care tax deduction merely increases 
the unfairness and inequity faced by single income families who 
choose to care for their children at home.  They have access to 
no tax deduction for their at home child care even though they 
are forgoing a second income. They also do not have the 
opportunity to split their incomes and take advantage of all of 
the deductions and exemptions in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on whether or not he 
supports this increase in the inequity with respect to single 
income families proposed in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for that question.  It allows me the opportunity to expand 
on what I believe is an inequity in terms of how we deal with the 
families that have a spouse who remains within the home to take 
care of their own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier this budget has not addressed every inequity 
in the country. To me, families are the highest priority we have. 
If children could find support in their mothers and fathers as we 
believe they should, we would probably find that we would have 
fewer social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly my wish that in future budgets we address this 
whole issue of accommodating a tax credit for those spouses who 
stay home to look after their children. It hardly seems fair that 
someone can take care of my children and I can take care of 
someone else's children and we are given a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have begun the process. The process has a long way to go. It 
will be my commitment to this House to ensure that members on 
this side of the House at least understand the inequities. I will 
ensure that the minister responsible will be told of this. 
Hopefully we can address this in next year's budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, coming 
back to the matter of education, more specifically the 
millennium scholarships, the member for Huron—Bruce touted this 
fund as one of the obvious pluses of the budget.  But not 
everyone, even in English Canada, agrees with this initiative.  I 
quote from an article by John Trent, a professor of political 
science at the University of Ottawa, who says: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The $2.5 billion Canadian millennium scholarship foundation 
announced in Tuesday's budget amounts to a rape of federalism. It 
is also politically egocentric, administratively inept and 
strategically stupid.  Moreover it is unnecessary”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Trent points out what many have said about the millennium 
scholarships.  Basically, the government's strategy is once 
again to boost its visibility, but it is also determined to 
impose another administrative system on Quebec, and to do so in a 
clearly provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree or not that introducing a federal system of 
scholarships and loans adds an additional layer of administration 
to the existing provincial system?  Does he, or does he not, 
agree that this amounts to interference in provincial 
jurisdiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the simple answer is no, I 
do not agree with the hon. member's assumptions that we have 
interfered in provincial areas of educational responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kind of rhetoric I heard just a moment ago even if it came 
from a man as he has just mentioned does not surprise me. We hear 
that kind of rhetoric in this House. I am surprised that people 
in the position this gentleman is referring to would allude to 
such rhetoric, because I believe what we have attempted to do is 
to assist those who are being educated in our society. We are 
creating an incentive for them to go on to further education. We 
are doing this aside from the programs that are already in place 
through normal scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the students of today are the ones who are 
using this kind of rhetoric. I am rather appalled that we would 
find people in this House saying this, because we have not. We 
have made this fund available to Canadians everywhere in Canada, 
including the province of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the member for Huron—Bruce has heard from 
constituents and knows that for many Canadians there is deep 
disappointment about the absence in this budget of any new funds 
for health care transfers. 
He knows undoubtedly that we have a critical situation in every 
part of this country with overcrowded emergency wards. People are 
suffering because they cannot get the service they need. 
Hospitals are under so much stress.

may have for starting to reinvest in health care and starting to 
put some money into the health care transfer payment system? 
Would he have any idea when we can expect to see the government's 
millennium budget for health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
would understand if she had read her budget that we have already 
applied $1.5 billion in further transfers to the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in the province of Ontario I am quite aware of the kinds 
of arguments that are being made.  I sympathize with those who 
are finding health services at a premium these days.  The 
province of Ontario says the reason we are short is because the 
federal government has made cuts.  What the people are not being 
told, and I can only speak for the province of Ontario as that is 
where I come from, is that the 30% the province is giving back in 
tax reductions only apply to those who are paying tax.  The ones 
who are getting the most back are the ones who pay the most taxes 
and who need it the least.  If the province had applied that, the 
province would have four times the amount of money related to the 
amount of money that we have withdrawn from health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if Ontario and other provinces want to 
complain, they had better look at how they are doing their own 
books and be more insightful in those areas.

rise to pay tribute to women's hockey in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of us fans, the debut of women's hockey at the Nagano 
olympics showed that hockey is not only a man's sport.  The world

Jayna Hefford of Mississauga proved that by bringing home an 
olympic silver medal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the credit for the success of women's hockey must go to 
the Mississauga based Ontario Women's Hockey Association.  As the 
only organization of its kind in the world, it was the driving 
force behind the establishment of the World Women's Hockey 
Championship and can take a great deal of credit for the 
inclusion of women's hockey in Nagano.

of Mayor Hazel McCallion who earned $5 a game playing 
professional women's hockey in the forties. As an active member

Quebec women have made significant progress toward gender 
equality. In particular, they have gained notional rights to 
equality, wage equity and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a world of difference between theory and daily 
reality. Wage equity has yet to be achieved in the public 
service. Women are still afraid at night. Their salaries are 
still lower than those of men. They are still, along with their 
children, the most vulnerable members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last federal budget is an insult to their intelligence. 
Women were asking $2 per woman and girl child to continue their 
progress toward equality. 
They got nothing, absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois reminds the government that our society's 
progress toward equality is everyone's business, and that the 
federal government has a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois demands that the government review 
and increase the budget for the advancement of women. To invest 
in gender equality is a public responsibility the federal 
government must assume.

<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last week Environics released the results of one of the 
largest polls on Senate reform ever taken in Alberta.  Ninety-one 
per cent of Albertans, including Premier Klein, want the right to 
elect their next senator.  Only seven per cent want senators 
appointed by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has now called for a Senate election in the fall and it 
will elect two standby senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister respect the wishes of 91% of Albertans 
and appoint these standby senators to fill the next vacancies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. leader of the Reform Party should have listened 
to Albertans when he rejected an elected, equal Senate that was 
proposed in the Charlottetown agreement.  The people on this side 
of the House voted for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Reform wants to have a scheme that will perpetuate our 
current Senate system.  There are more people in Alberta today, 
with six senators, than there are in the four Atlantic provinces 
with 30 senators.  I am not against elections for senators.  I 
voted for it and he voted against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, he knows as well as I do that Albertans wanted a triple 
E Senate and that is why they rejected the half baked Senate 
reform proposals in Meech Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago we asked the Prime Minister about Senate 
elections.  He said we would like to reform the Senate and the 
best way is to try to convince the provinces to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has been convinced.  It will have a Senate election this 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Prime Minister's excuse this time?  In this 
democratic age why should patronage appointments to the upper 
house continue instead of respecting democratic elections? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, he talks about a half baked Senate reform but he is 
proposing a one-third baked Senate reform because this has 
nothing to do with the equality of senators and an effective 
Senate.  Why should we go with a one-third proposition?  We had a 
proposition for an equal, effective and elected Senate and they 
voted against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last month the Prime Minister said:  “Senator Thompson 
should do the honourable thing and resign.  The Canadian people 
are asking him to do so”.  Ninety-one per cent of Albertans are 
asking their unelected and unaccountable senators to do the 
honourable thing and resign to make way for elected senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister told Andrew Thompson to resign. Will he now 
tell the unelected, unaccountable senators from Alberta to resign 
their seats? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the father of the leader of the Reform Party was 
appointed to the Senate and he was a very respectable person. 
Nobody asked him to resign because he had lost something in 
accepting to serve in the upper chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system that was established in 1867.  We did propose a 
change to it and he said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am for the reform of the Senate.  I want real reform of the 
Senate and I want to make sure the representation of the regions 
will be better balanced.  If we were to take the advice of the

Senator Manning was always in favour of Senate reform and he 
still would be if he were alive today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past Friday the Prime Minister appointed a new senator from 
B.C. to fill a recent vacancy; another patronage appointment, his 
friend Ross Fitzpatrick.  It just so happens that the Prime 
Minister was a director on the board of Fitzpatrick's company, 
Viceroy Resource Corporation, and the Prime Minister was offered 
up to 50,000 stock options.

potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars?

was not in politics at all.  I never realized the options that 
were offered to me for my services to the company and I received 
no remuneration when I was there.  I am happy to quote the

the people's republic of B.C. probably does not have a whole lot

Canadians who seem to be happy with the Senate the way it is are 
the Prime Minister and of course the current senators who love 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of an elected, accountable senator for B.C., British 
Columbians now have to live under a man whose chief qualification 
for that job is that he is a Liberal business pal of the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the Prime Minister, if a Senate seat in B.C. is worth 
50,000 stock options, just how much would it cost for an Alberta 
seat in the Senate?

talking about a senator we appointed, Archibald Johnstone, who is 
a very respectable 73 year old man.  She should apologize to him

<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

the lowest it has been in four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Absolutely.  Members can check the 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also tell the House that the preliminary figures 
available to us show a decrease in the number of new 
applications from women, and in the total number of new 
applications.  But I do not think it very likely that this 
decrease can be chalked up to the reform.  There has also been an 
improvement in the economic context, with the creation of one 
million additional jobs.  This means fewer people needing EI.

is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women who work part time, and have to work twice as long to get 
half the benefits, and mothers who are no longer entitled to 
maternity benefits—these are the victims of the unemployment 
insurance reforms, one of the most devastating offensives for 
impoverishing women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister claim that the reform is good for women when 
10,000 fewer women were entitled to maternity leave in 1997? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our reform was also for the 
benefit of women, because it modified the system, which had been 
based on the number of weeks worked. We brought in one based on 
the number of hours worked, which benefits part-timers, who are 
very often women.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

country whose work is now insured has risen by 450,000.  In 
other words, 450,000 more women are covered by employment 
insurance, because access to the system is now hours-based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new system, if they have been in the work force during

for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its last budget, the federal government announced that 
deductions for child care expenses would be increased. However, 
the Quebec government has already begun implementing its $5 child 
care services. This means that, from now on, Quebec parents will 
have to pay hardly any money for child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that, once again, a so-called national

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this

tax measure is going against what Quebeckers want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government program to provide child care services for

Quebec for the savings that his government will achieve?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

Quebeckers in an appropriate manner, as we always do. Indeed, we 
also make sure the Quebec government and Quebeckers get their

we will treat part time farmers exactly the same as we treated 
part time farmers in the Saguenay and in the Red River region.  I 
would encourage the Government of Quebec to come on side with a 
subsidiary agreement so it too will treat part time farmers the 
same as it treated part time farmers in the Saguenay.

following the crash of a passenger plane in Manitoba on December

the Hercules itself and the town in jeopardy, yet the only one to 
be punished for this was the junior officer.

We must bear in mind that lives needed to be saved here.  The 
aircraft sent in by the military went in under some very bad 
weather conditions.  The pilot had to make a judgment to disperse 
the fuel so he could get in and out with the passengers at a 
lower level than would normally be the case.  He did it in as 
safe a way as possible in a remote area north of the airfield. He 
got in and was able to rescue people who were then able to get to 
hospital.

the point where we can now get rid of a $42 billion deficit.  We 
are now talking about what we gave to women in this budget. We 
had a choice, we made a priority.  We gave money to women so they 
can live every day of their lives with the reality of extra money 
and extra help.  This budget did that.  In future budgets we will

answer that offer.  We have gone from about $300 million to $1.3

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege that arises from a 
circumstance surrounding a newspaper article which appeared in 
the March 8 edition of the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>.  Within that article 
there were quotations attributed to members of this House which, 
in my view, constitute an overt and outrageous attempt to 
intimidate you, the Speaker of this House, and collectively the 
House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the members involved will rise in their place 
and tell the House that they have been misquoted and that the 
remarks that were attributed to them are in fact untrue.  Perhaps 
we should all recall what Samuel Johnson said when he said that 
patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have sent you the article and have tabled it with 
the Table.  This article, which appeared on page 7 of the March 8 
edition, was headlined “Standing on guard for flag—MPs 
threaten Speaker's job in flap over Maple Leaf, anthem”.  I am 
not going to go through all of the quotations from within that 
article, but I would suggest that they were inappropriate and 
intended to intimidate or, at the very least, affect you in your 
ruling on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do in this House certainly is watched by the nation.  I 
would suggest that this article, which appears in public, affects 
the integrity of this entire House.  Members of this House are 
certainly entitled to agree or disagree with the wisdom of your 
rulings, Mr. Speaker.  If they do not like the way the Speaker 
rules or they do not like the way you are acting in your office, 
they have every right to voice objections.  However, they should 
do so by way of a substantive motion in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What members do not have the right to do, I suggest, is to make 
statements on these matters which are before the Chair for 
adjudication and, through these statements, attempt to influence 
the judgment before it has been rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, influencing your rulings through the media is 
totally wrong.  It really will not matter, I suggest, what your 
judgment is for these statements have now prejudiced whatever you 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary authorities are clear and 
unqualified on this point.  Erskine May states on page 150 of the 
19th Edition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To attempt to influence Members in their conduct by threats is 
also a breach of privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, Mr. Speaker, are a member of this House.  It also states on 
page 230: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reflections upon the character or actions of the Speaker may be 
punished as breaches of privilege.  His action cannot be 
criticized incidentally in debate or upon any form of proceeding 
except a substantive motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also quote from citation 168 at page 49 of Beauchesne's: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an 
indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, 
and many conventions exist which have as their object, not only 
to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also, to ensure 
that there is a general recognition of the Speaker's 
impartiality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The material that is before you in this article touches upon 
your high office.  It is not fair for you yourself to resolve 
this matter.  I would suggest it is a matter that is best left 
for the judgment of the House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it might be argued that these statements were made outside 
the House and therefore should not fall under the purview or 
rubric of the question of privilege, I would suggest that it is 
clear from the precedents that this House has addressed such 
matters of contempt in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 78, page 21 of Beauchesne's again clearly speaks to 
this issue and it states the Speaker should be protected against 
reflections on his or her actions.   Citations 71.2, 71.3 and 
71.4 also provide direction on this point, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest it is therefore evident that this House has in the 
past considered media reports to be within the ambit of its 
jurisdiction.  The statements attributed to the members of this 
House serve to undermine your authority by their very utterance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They give the impression that the Speaker will give a judgment 
based on partisan consideration or that he will act out of fear 
or censorship from some members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partisanship should not affect your rulings whatsoever.  The 
speakership of the House is not to be brought into these partisan 
battles.  In Beauchesne's again, as a point of reference, the 
essential ingredient of the speakership is to be found in the 
status of the speaker as a servant of the House.  The presiding 
officer, while but a servant of the House, is entitled on all 
occasions to be treated with the greatest attention and respect 
by the individual members because the office embodies the power, 
dignity and honour of the House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that duty upon this matter should be placed before the 
House.  The reference for that, the Speaker should be protected 
against reflections on his or her actions at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your integrity has been brought into question and compromised by 
these statements.  In matters such as this, I suggest it is up to 
the House to act.  It would be inappropriate for you, Mr. 
Speaker, now to be put in the position of having to try to 
explain this situation or scold its members.  This is not a 
matter for the Speaker.  It is a matter for the House and it is 
incumbent upon us to defend you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until there is a denial of these statements or until there is an 
apology tendered to this House, to the Speaker, there is a cloud 
over your chair in this House.  Therefore, I would ask that you 
find that there is a prima facie case of privilege before this 
House requiring immediate consideration and in that event, I am 
prepared to move the following motion: 
<A NAME="LINK180">&nbsp;</A>

full confidence in your work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote—and this may seem strange to you—what I 
said myself on February 26, 1998. At the time, I proposed the 
following to the House, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a spirit of calm, the House leaders of the parties will 
carry 
on their tradition, as the member for Roberval said himself, of 
finding some common ground on a number of thorny issues. Our 
behaviour this afternoon in this matter indicates just how 
thorny it is and perhaps for obvious reasons, without going into 
all the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone like myself who believes strongly in the unity of his 
country, flag waving is not provocation, but an act of pride. 
Someone of a different persuasion may see it differently, and I 
accept that. I find it regrettable, but I accept it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A little further, you said yourself, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a suggestion from the hon. government House leader 
that the House leaders of the different parties come together to 
discuss how these things should be handled— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you yourself offered to speak on behalf of the hon. 
member for York South—Weston since, as an independent member, he 
does not have a House leader.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is that, at the time, we agreed to discuss 
the issue amongst ourselves and then make a recommendation to the 
Speaker, on behalf of the House leaders. The Speaker himself 
would have consulted the independent member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I found the article rather unusual because in 
fact the article suggested that Mr. Speaker is going to rule on 
this today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this would be surprising to me because in fact the 
House leaders have not met.  Therefore, we have not had the 
opportunity of making our recommendations to Mr. Speaker and 
presumably Mr. Speaker would not be ruling until having heard 
that recommendation, given what Your Honour said the last day we 
sat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there will be a meeting of House leaders as 
early as tomorrow.  While I cannot predict a conclusion of any 
discussions we will or might have tomorrow, I can surely say to 
Mr. Speaker that we will not be making a recommendation until at 
least late in the day tomorrow and possibly later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, someone speculating on what the ruling of the Speaker 
might be today is very hypothetical, particularly given that the 
Speaker will not be making, I believe, a ruling on this issue 
today for the reasons I have just outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should all take another deep breath—as we did on 
Thursday, February 26—for a couple of days and let the events 
unfold as they should.  In other words, the House leaders would 
meet, make a recommendation to Your Honour, then we can discuss 
it and a ruling can come down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime perhaps we can all contribute by ensuring that 
our discussions are held through our various House leaders rather 
than by using other means.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment briefly on the question of privilege raised 
by the House leader of the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two or three comments.  First of all, we of course are 
kind of half way through the due process to be followed on this. 
As the government House leader has already mentioned, this has 
already been referred to not only yourself but also to the House 
leaders for discussion and hopeful resolution before it comes to 
a prima facie case of privilege and a full-blown debate here in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already in the midst of dealing with this in whatever 
fashion is deemed appropriate and the due process I would say 
would be improperly interrupted at this time, to start a debate 
when that process has not had a chance to come to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I kind of agree with the hon. House leader of the 
government that this speculation that today you were going to 
make a ruling again is, was, is, was, still is speculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see in the other reports today that you are going to make 
another ruling tomorrow on this and you may not have even known 
that yet.  The facts of the matter are not as printed in the

of the arguments and the soundness of the arguments.  I do not 
think a newspaper article by anyone is going to particularly sway 
you.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
recognizing the efforts made by the government leader and by the 
Reform whip, I would like to come back to the substance of the 
point raised by the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
in this House, which is an extremely serious one, in fact the 
most serious matter that has been raised in this Parliament since 
I, and many others I am sure, have been sitting in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what this is about. You have very clearly stated, to the 
satisfaction of all members of this House, that you would be 
ruling on the disturbance at question period the other day, which 
was brought to your attention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is serious about this matter is that members were named in 
the item and their remarks were quoted. They have threatened the 
Chair. Never in any Parliament—I do not know if this will get 
through—does anyone, even the Reformers, have the right to 
threaten the Speaker. To threaten the President is to threaten 
the Chair. And the Chair in any Parliament is the institution 
that ensures that all democratically elected parliamentarians can 
speak. To threaten the person in charge of protecting the right 
of parliamentarians to speak is to threaten Parliament itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament, including the Reform members for Edmonton 
East, Yorkton—Melville and Elk Island, clearly said the Speaker 
better watch himself because they would replace him. 
Such a threat cannot be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Reformers had better listen up. At this 
rate, their beloved Parliament is threatened to disappear. There 
are also Liberal members involved, who, like the members for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane and Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, simply said 
“We will challenge the Speaker”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never will the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Speaker of 
a Parliament accept that members of Parliament, whose right to 
speak he is in charge of protecting, tell him through the papers 
to do as they please or face the consequences. That is a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> That is unacceptable. That is appalling. 
That is intimidation, and those Reformers who are laughing 
probably do not understand what they are doing, because the best 
way to  destroy a country is to destroy its Parliament. By 
destroying the Chair— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> —they are destroying Parliament and their 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like to hear what hon. members have 
to say on this matter.  This is our parliament.  It deals with 
our parliament.  I hope we will extend to each other the courtesy 
of listening when one of us has to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to return to the hon. member for Roberval. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, surprisingly, this is the 
second time in two weeks that I am obliged to rise in this House 
to explain to the great saviours of Canada, to those who want to 
preserve it at all costs, that they themselves are destroying 
their own country.  It is totally ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are advocating a political option that threatens the existence 
of Canada in its current form.  However, the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois could never be criticized for failing to respect this 
country's institutions and the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the right, you do not have the right and no one 
here has the right to threaten the Chair, whoever may occupy it. 
You, Mr. Speaker, have always had the confidence of this House. 
We elected you.  You the full respect of the government, of the 
Bloc—as we have said—of the Conservative Party, which is 
rightly concerned by events here, and of the New Democratic 
Party, most certainly.

do not want to destroy Canada, we want to rework it and to make a 
Canada that functions well in partnership with a Quebec that

institutions.  They do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that your role, Mr. Speaker, is to protect the

partisanship, which is what these people want you to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to submit that this is certainly not a case 
of contempt of parliament because the comments and questions 
attack individuals and not parliament as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happens we in the House are always subject to criticisms 
and attacks.  The Prime Minister is subject to it on a daily 
basis in question period.  I submit, Mr. Speaker, that you should 
be subject to it from time to time as well, if MPs so choose to 
make these comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very essence of free speech in a democracy is that every 
member of Parliament has the opportunity and the right to express 
his views no matter how unpalatable they are to the rest of us. 
It is the very essence of a democracy that the newspapers have a 
right to seek and report those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there was no threat.  There was merely speculation 
that you, Mr. Speaker, would be subject to extreme criticism from 
within this parliament because of whatever decision you might 
bring down in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you, Mr. Speaker, you are an elected person.  I can 
remember at the end of the last parliament there was a great deal 
of newspaper speculation about whether you would be re-elected in 
the next parliament as a result of some of the decisions that you 
made.  This is normal.  This is the kind of fair comment that 
should exist in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot stop MPs from expressing themselves even though the 
majority of us may disagree with what they say.  It is a threat 
to free speech if in any way, Mr. Speaker, you rule that this is 
a case of contempt.

have for you, for the role you perform in the House and for this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Ottawa Sun</I> has attributed comments to me.  You know that

the same respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments I made to the journalists amounted to one thing: 
the position I took was that, as a Canadian citizen, elected by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I 
was going to say is that, as a Canadian citizen elected by 
Canadians to sit in the Parliament of Canada, it is not only my 
right but my duty to promote the Canadian flag and all it 
represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my comments are perceived by anyone as an attack against or a 
lack of respect to the Chair, I withdraw them and apologize. 
The point I wanted to make, is that I, as the member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane, have taken the position that I have a right 
and a duty to show the Canadian flag in the House, in the 
Canadian Parliament, and that, regardless of the Speaker's 
decision  on this, I am prepared to carry the flag and to face up 
to the consequences of the Speaker's ruling like a man.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
participate in this question of privilege on behalf of my party 
with a great deal of reluctance.  However, having listened to 
what has been said, this is not a debate about the 
appropriateness of the flag or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we made the arguments in the House of Commons in 
the usual thoughtful and eloquent way before we recessed.  We 
asked that you make a decision on the appropriateness of what 
happened.  That is the issue and you are weighing that decision 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while you were making that decision and presumably 
looking at the <I>Debates</I> and contemplating the comments that 
were made, some members of this House—I do not want to identify 
them—made comments such as “he will demand the Speaker's 
removal if he rules in favour of the BQ”.  Another person said 
“if he rules any other way I am most offended and I think we 
will have to call for the election of a new Speaker”.  Somebody 
else went on to say “there will be grave consequences if he does 
not rule in favour of our position”.  Another warned that the 
Speaker would face demands for his resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, those are threats to you.  People are going to 
demand your resignation.  They are going to call for a vote if 
your decision does not go in their favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us have listened to your decisions time and time 
again and the automatic reaction, whether or not we agree 
personally, is to accept those decisions and move on.  We have to 
accept whatever decision you take as our representative elected 
by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He hasn't made a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is the point.  As the Reform whip 
has indicated, you have not made a decision but while you are 
considering the arguments, as the House leader for the 
Conservative Party put so eloquently, we ought not to be issuing 
comments that could be considered by yourself as a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this ends it would be appropriate for those people who 
are quoted at least to indicate the point they were making if it 
was not a threat to the Speaker's decision.  I put a simple 
question to bring this to an end.  If it is not a problem, what 
were those comments intended to produce?

point of order, which, unfortunately, seems fruitless to me at

arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I respectfully remind you that, last week, the Chair ruled 
that members with a flag on their desk would not be recognized 
so long as you had not made your ruling.  You recognized our 
colleagues from Timiskaming—Cochrane and Elk Island, who, 
however, had a Canadian flag on their desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make myself quite clear here.  We have no objection to 
the presence of Canadian flags in this House. 
That is not the issue.  The fact is that the Canadian flag, like 
the national anthem two weeks ago, was used knowingly not in an 
expression of pride in the flag or the anthem, but simply to 
interrupt, deride and intimidate one of our colleagues.  What is 
unacceptable is the partisan use of a symbol that should be an 
object of respect.  They lowered themselves in using it, as my 
colleague for Roberval put it, as a mere tool of protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore remind you of the ruling by the Chair not to 
recognize members with a Canadian flag on their desk until the

a privilege that affects all of us in this House. Because it

very respectfully, while I am hearing this point of privilege 
please remove the flags or leave them on your desks for a minute. 
I go to the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the issue we are discussing here now, and I know we all 
want to get back to the work we have come here to do this 
afternoon, is not what we are calling the flag issue. That matter 
has been taken under advisement by Mr. Speaker and by the House 
leaders. I am fairly sure we will end up with a resolution on 
that. For those members who want to push the flag issue or 
whatever, perhaps while our leadership in the House is dealing 
with this, this is not the most appropriate time to push the 
envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really want to talk about the flag here in the way it 
has been spoken of by some members. What I want to address is the 
point of privilege that has been raised by the House leader for 
the Progressive Conservative Party and it is a very important 
point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point it is important for us all to realize that what 
has happened by this particular publication is that the office of 
the Speaker in which we place our trust, all of us as members, 
has been taken out of this place and taken out into the street. 
The office of the Speaker has been dealt with in a manner and in 
a way that the Speaker is unable by himself to deal with because 
of the nature of his office and the impartiality which he is 
called on to use and to exhibit as he works in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our colleagues have caused this to happen. Maybe they 
have been induced by aggressive journalists to make it happen. I 
will leave to colleagues the decision as to whether or not it 
should have happened, whether it was good or bad or right or 
wrong. But right now the member raising this matter of privilege 
has asked the Speaker to find that it is a matter of the 
privileges of this House, prima facie, and that he should take it 
under consideration and have the matter disposed of at the 
committee designated for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although all of us here will not be fully familiar with all the 
bits and pieces of the parliamentary privilege that goes in to 
making up the rules and the regime that I have tried to 
articulate here, I know that Mr. Speaker will have the full 
benefit of that in looking at this issue.

sufficiently egregious vis-à-vis the privileges of the House to 
cause you to find that it is a prima facie breach of the 
privileges and to ask members to dispose of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not able to add my voice to whether it is or is not because 
the evidence is contained in a newspaper report and some of 
comments of members here.

not be dealing with the broader matter of the so-called flag

been offended.

far.  At this point I would ask hon. members on both sides of the

get on with the business that we are supposed to be doing for the 
people who elected us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, it is a dead issue.  I would ask all 
members, on both sides of the House, to adopt the same attitude.

Mr. Speaker, in light of your ruling that a prima facie case 
exists, I move:

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That certain statements attributed to members of the House of 
Commons which may bring into question the integrity of the House

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I rise to speak on 
this issue.  It is unfortunate we have found ourselves in this 
position.  It is obvious that what occurred here in the House of 
Commons invoked a visceral and emotional response from many of 
its members.  That is not the issue or the point I wish to bring 
to the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main issue here is the integrity of this place and of you as 
our Speaker.  What we have seen happen here is tantamount to an 
effort, deliberate or otherwise, to undermine your integrity. To 
make an analogy, I would suggest it would be totally 
inappropriate for litigators in a court case to step outside the 
court room to comment on a decision of a judge in the wake of 
that decision.  What has happened in this case before the House 
is very similar to that.  We have members of this House choosing 
to comment.  I choose my words cautiously when I suggest that it 
may be for the purpose of threatening you, to make you decide in 
one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is very unfortunate.  It is with regret that 
we have to go through this.  If those members choose in their 
wisdom to withdraw or to clarify what they intended by making 
these statements in such a way, that may cause the issue to 
settle down.  All members of this House must be very cautious not 
only in what they say on the floor of the House of Commons but 
also in what they say outside these doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this matter must be dealt with by the entire House 
because you have found yourself in a compromised position as a 
result of what I would suggest is a personal slight to you as the 
Speaker.  Again, it is with some regret that I move this motion 
but it is a very important matter which we must deal with. We 
should deal with it as quickly as possible so we can move on to 
deal with the very important business of the nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to ensure 
all colleagues have knowledge of the exact content of the motion. 
I know earlier today there was at least the possibility of 
something somewhat different being moved.  If I understand 
correctly, these are the precise words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That certain statements attributed to members of this House of 
Commons may bring into question the integrity of the House of 
Commons and its servant the Speaker appearing at page 7 of the 
March 8, 1998 Ottawa <I>Sun</I> be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak for very long.  I wish we would return to 
the budget debate.  It is the reason many MPs are here today and 
their constituents expect them to speak on the budget.  I want to 
return to that as quickly as possible but I will make a few brief 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your Honour has ruled in his judgment which I respect that this 
is a prima facie case of privilege.  We should support the motion 
now that you have ruled that way.  In so doing that would 
indicate our support for Mr. Speaker which I look forward to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who are accused—and I use that word loosely—or whose 
reputations are being taken into question with this motion will 
have the opportunity to defend themselves.  I hope they will be 
vindicated as I hope they meant no harm.  I trust they meant no 
harm. I have been here a long time and I know many of the members 
personally. In my heart I believe they meant no harm.  I hope in 
the end that will be the conclusion of the procedure and House 
affairs committee.  It is for that committee to make a 
recommendation which will then be brought to the floor of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, meanwhile we respect the decision you have made, a 
decision whereby there is a prima facie case of privilege.  That 
is what you have ruled.  Having said that, it is our duty to 
support the decision you have made by referring the issue to the 
committee as quickly as possible.  I hope we will not have a 
prolonged debate on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this issue goes to the issue of freedom of speech in Canada.  If 
we or any other member of the population of Canada are not free 
to speak our mind, if we are going to be shut down and censored, 
that is absolutely and totally unconscionable in the democracy of 
Canada.  This cannot stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is referred to the procedure and House affairs 
committee, the matter will be dragged out which might be to the 
benefit of certain people who have ulterior political motives. 
More importantly these people who have very simply spoken their 
minds will then be dragged through a very long, arduous 
procedure, and for what effect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unconscionable that we could possibly be voting 
in favour of a motion to turn this over to procedure and House 
affairs.  We must at all cost stand up for the principle of 
freedom of speech and democracy.

<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is most 
unfortunate that we find ourselves in this kind of situation. 
There is a motion before this House to debate remarks, extremely 
offensive remarks made by some members, which go far beyond 
anything said in the past about the Chair as an institution and 
hopefully not about the person in the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to summarize the facts for the benefit of everyone. We 
will recall that some members disrupted oral question period. 
These are objective facts can anyone can verify. 
All members of this House are welcome to check the video 
recording of the proceedings if they want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members disrupted oral question period by preventing one of our 
members, namely the member for Rimouski—Mitis, from putting her 
question to the government and preventing the government from 
answering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, they used the flag. Everyone respects the flag. 
Everyone respects the national anthem. Everyone respects 
Parliament. Or so they say. In fact, however, what the Liberal 
members, who now seem repentant, and members of the Reform Party, 
who are not repentant, did— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, when we talk about freedom of 
speech, surely we should be listening to what each other has to 
say.  I would encourage all hon. members to listen to each other 
out of courtesy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for enforcing my 
right to speak. I am grateful to you for protecting my privileges 
as a parliamentarian in this House. Were it not for you, I would 
not be able to speak in this place as the parliamentary leader of 
44 members. That is incredible, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. I 
appreciate this parliamentary protection you are giving me. I 
appreciate the fact that your role allows democracy to have a 
voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will anyone stand up to say that the people of Quebec who 
elected members of the Bloc Quebecois should not have a voice in 
this House? Is this what it has come to in this country: to think 
that the people of Quebec who voted for the Bloc do not have a 
say in the matters being debated? That is incredible. We must 
make them see reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also make them see reason about using the flag and the 
national anthem to disrupt oral question period. They would have 
used any pretence. However they would have expressed their 
disapproval, you would have called them to order.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bloc Quebecois members prevented Reformers from asking 
questions or the government from replying by making a lot of 
noise, by using the Quebec or the Canadian flag, or by doing 
anything else, Reformers and Liberals would be the first ones to 
say it is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, some members inopportunely and outrageously used 
their own flag—which they claim to revere and to have the 
utmost respect for—as a means to stop oral question period. This 
is no minor incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You must make a ruling. 
To be sure, no one questions your respect for the flag. You have 
one on either side of the Chair. This is a precedent, but it is 
not what is at issue here. What you must rule on is whether or 
not members of this House can stop oral question period at any 
time by using the Canadian flag or the national anthem, and 
whether or not they should be allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision that will be made—and I say this for the benefit 
of members, because the Speaker is, in a way, facing a 
dilemma—will not concern the flag, but the fact that oral 
question period was disrupted, in violation of the Standing 
Orders and, worse still, by using a flag that some feel should be 
revered. But this is not the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House must not make the Speaker feel that, 
should he rule in favour of the separatists and against the flag, 
he would have to resign or be replaced. This is unacceptable. It 
is not the flag versus the separatists. When will they understand 
this? It is not the flag versus the separatists, it is respect 
versus contempt for the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers say Canada is a democracy that enjoys freedom of 
speech. In what kind of country can parliamentarians, in the name 
of freedom of speech, rise and wave the flag, or start singing O 
Canada, at any time, during oral question period, during debates, 
to interrupt proceedings and reconsider all parliamentary 
activities under the pretence of using the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat to the members of this House that they should be very 
careful, because if a decision were made, with respect for the 
flag as a pretext, that the business of the House could be 
disrupted anytime, they might have some surprises the day Quebec 
decided to disrupt the business of this House. They would be very 
happy and would also need the rules of the House to be respected. 
We have always done so and we need them to respect those rules. 
This is not democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Reform Party invoke respect for democracy? It is not 
democracy to be able to interrupt question period whenever one 
feels like it, to play around with the flag. Is this democracy, 
Canadian style? It is not freedom of speech to be able to stand 
up in this House for any reason with flags and have fun while 
singing O Canada. Is this the freedom of speech of this country? 
Come on, this is not the way it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with my colleagues. The fact is we do not have the right 
to do so, as parliamentarians, whatever our political opinions. I 
repeat that you are not here to protect political opinions, but 
to protect the right to speak of all parliamentarians, Mr. 
Speaker. You cannot be asked to enter into a partisan debate. 
Members should understand that. We understood that a long time 
ago in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this should be understood in some areas of Canada. This 
is not your problem. We have no right to ask you that. We ask you 
to protect our right to speak and to protect the choice of 
Quebeckers and of people from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British 
Columbia. Your duty is to ensure that, within the rules, these 
people can speak and express their opinions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no right to threaten the Speaker when he is making a 
decision as to whether we can disrupt question period or not. 
Come on. It is common sense that no member in this House, with or 
without a flag, has the right to prevent question period from 
being held; no member ever had that right. The exercise of 
democracy means that the opposition can question the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform members, the official opposition, plead for this, 
have they not understood anything about their role? They should 
be the ones to want to protect oral question period. They are at 
the centre of oral question period. Have they not yet understood 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> No, they do not understand anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> This is not the way Parliament works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will only say how sad it is to see that those 
who claim they want to save Canada can think of nothing better 
than waving— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> They had better listen, they might 
understand better what Quebec is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who think they can save the country by waving pictures and 
flags, singing the national anthem, and making such a racket in 
the House of Commons that they disrupt the debates, those who 
think this is the way to save Canada, are a thousand miles away 
from the understanding needed to nurture a constructive dialogue 
which might lead them to where they want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the way to go forward. This is not the way to make 
progress, and they should know that. Everybody in Quebec thinks 
the flag war started in this Parliament by the people opposite 
and now waged by the official opposition is ridiculous. 
Everybody thinks it is absolutely unconscionable that in Canada 
the only way to counter sovereignists' arguments is to wave the 
flag and sing <I>O Canada</I> at inopportune moments. But this is the 
sad truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How weak they are those Canadians who, instead of arguing, find 
nothing better to do than waving colours and symbols! Are all 
the champions of the country cheerleaders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> In conclusion, I will say that we support 
the motion. We want these issues out in the open. I believe every 
member mentioned in the article should withdraw his comments and 
realize that this has gone way too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going beyond the struggle between pseudo-federalists and 
sovereignists. 
This is going much further than it should. This is turning into 
infighting among federalists, who are self-destructing, because 
they do not even respect the bare minimum, namely Parliament, the 
Parliament of Canada, the very Parliament we separatists have 
always respected and will keep on respecting, whether they like 
it or not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not 
a great day for Parliament.  Perhaps we are being put to the 
test. There are a number of issues that are being mentioned, some 
of them, I think, indirectly, but there are only two issues that 
we are being asked to debate at this particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being asked to debate the appropriateness of the 
so-called flag issue.  That is still awaiting your decision, Mr. 
Speaker, although some of my friends think this might be the 
point and place for that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that people got caught up in an 
emotional demonstration in the House of Commons, motivated for 
the very best of reasons.  Others felt it was inappropriate.  But 
that is not what we are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all of us also appreciate the fact that our constituents 
watch this House operate on their television sets and by and 
large are not impressed often with what they see.  Today is a 
good example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are supposed to be debating the budget, Mr. Speaker. We 
are not debating the budget. 
We are debating some alleged comments that some people made about 
the procedure before the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not necessarily a question about freedom of speech. 
Freedom of speech does not mean you have the right to say 
anything you want about anybody or anything.  It is within 
certain accepted rules.  How we behave in here in also based on a 
long established set of traditions and rules.  We make a point of 
memorizing those rules.  As members of Parliament we have books 
presented so that we know what the rules of order are.  We know 
what is expected of us in the House.  What is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are being asked, Mr. Speaker, to decide whether or not a few 
days ago the proper procedures were followed.  We are awaiting 
that decision.  That is not what is before us at the moment. 
Brought to us by the House leader for the Progressive 
Conservatives was the alleged comments made by a number of 
members from various political parties that may bring into 
question your integrity when bringing down a decision about the 
appropriateness of behaviour in this House.  That is the question 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the spokesperson for the Liberal 
Party who said now they have no choice.  You have ruled that this 
is a prima facie case of privilege that now must go on to the 
appropriate committee—the procedure and House affairs 
committee—where it will be dealt with appropriately. The 
so-called alleged comments will be addressed.  That is where it 
will be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if we are going to do the right thing for this 
Parliament, we do not challenge your rule now.  We do the right 
thing and vote to send this to the appropriate committee which is 
a standing committee of this House represented by all political 
parties to finalize and deal with this unfortunate issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge my colleagues, let us make this a unanimous vote. 
You have asked us to support your decision.  That is what this 
vote is all about.  For goodness sake, colleagues, let us not 
separate at this point on this critical issue.  Let us send it 
off to committee where it will be dealt with appropriately in a 
dispassionate way where everyone will have the chance to have 
their say.  This will then be brought to a satisfactory 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am urging, not only on behalf of my party, that we all support 
this motion unanimously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the motion by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  Again, as the last speaker 
said, this has nothing to do with flag waving or singing songs; 
it has everything to do with an attempt to influence your 
decision and intimidate, as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you consider that members from the government party and the 
official opposition both took a position that said if you did not 
as Speaker make a decision that they wanted that they would make 
every effort they could to remove you as Speaker, I think that 
has to be intimidation and a deliberate attempt to influence your 
decision. If you consider the timing, this is what is critical 
here.  Had they made these comments after your decision, that 
would be one thing, that they should question your decision, but 
to do it just before your making a decision is a deliberate 
attempt to try to influence your decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the newspaper article in question none of the members talked 
about their position.  They did not try to support their 
position.  All they did was try to intimidate the Speaker by the 
threats, as it says here in the newspaper article: “we'll demand 
Parent's removal as Speaker if he rules in favour”.  As another 
member said:  “There will be grave consequences if he doesn't 
rule in favour”.  Two other members warned “that Parent will 
face demands for his resignation if he does not rule it the way 
we want him to rule”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, there is no question about this being a deliberate 
attempt to influence your decision.  As the previous speaker 
said, I urge all members to make this a unanimous decision to 
have this go to committee and have it resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 
to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Banks; the hon. member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands, Fisheries; the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton, Highway System.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in this debate I want to address an aspect of the 
procedure that we are dealing with here. Some members have 
referred to this as being a matter where we should be voting in 
favour of the motion to support the ruling of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to members' attention my understanding of the rules 
here, that we are not voting to support or not support the 
Speaker.  What we are doing is voting on a motion moved by our 
colleague, and that motion is on the floor because the Speaker 
has ruled that there is a prima facie breach of that privilege of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that there has been with certainty—agreed to 
by all members—a breach of those privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling of the Speaker allows this motion to come to the 
floor and to be debated on and adopted or not, as we see fit.  So 
the whole issue of whether or not there has been a breach of 
privilege still remains in the hands of members and the Speaker 
did not, and I say this respectfully, wish to become one of the 
voters or movers of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we vote for or against in this particular instance, we 
are not voting for or against the Speaker.  We are already here 
in the House with the Speaker who has our support.  That is not 
at issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the issues surrounding whether or not there has been a 
breach of the privileges of the House will be taken up by a 
committee of this House which we set up for that purpose and that 
committee will report back to the House with the report.  At that 
point in time every member of this House will have an 
opportunity, dependent on the rules of the House. to debate the 
report and the House may or may not adopt the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report may make recommendations as to how we should deal 
with this issue if all the facts are shown to be correct, how we 
should deal with it among ourselves as members of Parliament 
given the issues involved.  It involves a number of our 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make that point in the hope that the debate this 
afternoon would not get too much into the flag issue and too much 
into support or non-support of the Speaker—we always support the 
Speaker—but whether or not the matter should be taken up by all 
members through the committee we have designated for that 
purpose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have just a few points on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with others who have said that it is an unfortunate 
detour from the regularly scheduled business of the House that we 
are even engaged in this debate.  We are because the House leader 
of the fifth party decided he wanted to bring it. That is 
unfortunate in and of itself.  Besides that, it is interesting to 
me and the rotation here has allowed me a minute or two to calm 
down, which is probably just as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty engaging in debate someone who I cannot exceed 
in decibels, which would have been the case had I followed the 
House leader of the Bloc Quebecois who seems intent that he 
believes in that old adage that when your argument is a little 
weak, yell louder and perhaps someone will believe you.  That is 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should engage in the debate and the merits of this motion 
before the House.  I would argue with people who would say we 
must be unanimous, with those in the House who say it is not 
appropriate that we would even dispute the motion before the 
House, to debate it, the pros and cons.  Would it be because we 
are a flock of sheep? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say not, Mr. Speaker.  I say that you have brought this to the 
House for the House to make the decision and that is why you have 
brought it to this place, so that all of us could bring our 
collective wisdom on this decision to see whether it will be 
referred to the procedure and House affairs committee or whether 
it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, Mr. Speaker, the standing orders gave you the power to just 
by fiat declare it to be so, that is what the standing orders 
would say, but they do not say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have come to the House and have asked for a decision and for 
people wherever in this House to say that now we should not 
debate it, now we should give it unanimous consent or we somehow 
are flying in the face of our Speaker, that is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the Speaker in his decisions but we also support the 
decision of the House of Commons as a collectivity.  It is our 
right to speak on this motion and others and vote as we see fit, 
not to be coerced by people who somehow think it is wrong to 
speak our minds, and to vote the will of our constituents or our 
own minds in this case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I want to say a couple of things on this matter. 
The silly season has struck early with this motion by the House 
leader of the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the last parliament when we dealt with a case of 
contempt of Parliament or privilege.  I think it was contempt. It 
was the case of Mr. Jacob which was brought forward as a contempt 
of Parliament because he had urged members of the armed forces to 
consider joining the Quebec army the moment after the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a very serious issue that pro or con needed to be 
examined.  For goodness' sake, the defence critic of the official 
opposition at that time urged people to leave the Canadian Armed 
Forces the moment after a referendum and join the Quebec army, 
which does not even exist.  It was quite a statement and it was 
referred to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in committee?  That is why I am worried about this 
motion.  It went to committee and what happened was that the 
majority in that committee took control of the agenda, took 
control of the committee, and did not listen to the debate. What 
they did was ramrod through a decision, in that case saying that 
Mr. Jacob was not in contempt according to the majority, 
supported by the official opposition at that time.  In fact many 
speakers thought they should actually condemn the Reform Party 
for even bringing up the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine being concerned when someone says that someone should 
desert the Canadian army and join the non-existent Quebec army 
and we are the ones who are chastised.  It is ridiculous.  It is 
just silly, sick and perverse that people who bring up things as 
a bona fide contentious point of privilege and contempt of 
parliament instead are chastised in the public House of Commons 
for even bringing up the case.  It is ridiculous in the extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what will happen to this motion too if it gets sent to 
committee.  The silly season sets in.  That is what happens when 
they do this sort of thing.  The House leader of the fifth party 
should know that.  It goes off to committee and there it sits and 
waits for days and weeks and months while it festers away instead 
of being dealt with it as it should have been dealt with quickly 
and put aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not vote in favour of the motion as it stands because 
this thing should have never gone the route it has gone today. It 
is unfortunate Progressive Conservatives have chosen to tie up 
the House in this way.  It is unfortunate that we will have to 
deal with it.  We will have to push it through to a vote. Then 
perhaps it will be sent to committee where it will languish away, 
festering and burbling away in the back rooms of this place 
instead of being dealt with quickly and succinctly as it should 
have been all along.  Therefore I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
words “Ottawa <I>Sun</I>”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way we can say that if people believe this is harsh on 
the Speaker or harsh on the House, let them say so.  This should 
not be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.  This should be treated as any newspaper article should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can envision the PC Party bringing its <I>Frank</I> magazines 
in here next week and saying “Oh, my goodness, look, another 
article that somehow brings things into disrepute.  We had best 
haul everybody out in front of everybody again and shut down the 
procedure of the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous.  It should not be happening.  We should be on 
to the business of the budget.  That is why this motion in effect 
should say that hon. members can say what they want about the 
newspaper article, but we are not going to waste our time here 
and we are not going to waste our time in committee on a motion 
that should have never been brought to the House to begin with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will take the amendment under advisement. 
We will have a look at it.  I will continue with the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since you 
are about to make a ruling, I would like to tell you that if this 
amendment completely alters, as I think it does, the nature of 
the motion moved by the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, it should obviously be ruled out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening with a mixture of amusement and sadness 
the arguments of the official opposition chief whip to the effect 
that a newspaper report should not be given so much significance. 
He said we should not give too much importance to comments 
reported in the media. Maybe the official opposition chief whip 
has just realized now that he is a public figure, that his 
comments can indeed be reported in the media, and that his 
comments as a member of this House are of some import. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he finds it distressing that this issue has been raised 
in the House. On the basis of remarks made outside the House 
concerning a deputy speaker, our former colleague for Rosemont 
was urged to withdraw his statement, despite the fact it had not 
been made in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, there are precedents, whether the official 
opposition chief whip likes it or not. Just two weeks ago, he 
condescendingly likened the members of the Bloc Quebecois to deer 
dazed by oncoming headlights. Listening to him a moment ago, he 
made me think of a child who has just broken a window pane, and 
closes his eyes pretending it did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is quite serious. Rather that letting the 
issue rest, as you asked, and wait for your ruling, a few members 
have decided deliberately to add fuel to the fire and inflame the 
situation, so that the debate has not been made more civilized, 
but uglier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the chief whip of the official opposition saying “My, it 
is so sad we have to talk about this, that we have to refer the 
matter to the Standing Committee on Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, that we have to drag members' 
reputations through the mud for months on end”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief whip of the official opposition was far less scrupulous 
when what was involved was dragging the reputation of the former 
member for Charlesbourg through the mud, as he did outrageously a 
while ago by totally misrepresenting the words of that hon. 
member.  The former member for Charlesbourg, I would remind you, 
had not invited the members of the Canadian Armed Forces to join 
the armed forces of an independent Quebec, but had merely raised 
that possibility. This matter was thoroughly examined by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, and it was 
decided at that time that there was no contempt of Parliament, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the chief whip for the official opposition, being 
disappointed and somewhat frustrated with that decision, is 
referring to it today in order to indicate just how unfortunate 
and regrettable it would be if his colleagues were to have to 
appear before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to answer for something they said which was reported 
publicly in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I speak for my colleagues in stating that we are 
going to support this motion because it makes sense.  We are 
going to support this motion because it is normal, if MPs 
challenge the authority of the Chair when it is required to make 
a ruling and attempt to influence that ruling with intimidation 
and threats, that they must face up to what they have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore going to support this motion, because it is 
obvious that we should, and also because, as some of our 
colleagues have pointed out, you have asked us to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have looked at the amendment to the 
motion.  I refer hon. members to Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 568, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant 
to the question on which the amendment is proposed.  Every 
amendment proposed to be made, either to a question or to a 
proposed amendment, should be so framed that, if agreed to by the 
House, the question or amendment as amended would be intelligible 
and consistent with itself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis I find the amendment out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would not for one instance disagree with any ruling 
that you make with respect to this issue being a prima facie case 
of breach of privilege.  I realize that you have carefully 
considered the issue and you have consulted with the experts you 
have around you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is with the motion itself.  I have to say to my 
House leader and to my colleagues on all sides of the House 
that I believe the motion is of sufficient importance that we 
should treat it as an issue of conscience and as a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason.  If my colleagues speak out in criticism 
of you, Mr. Speaker, which is what this is all about, and they 
are then as a consequence brought before a committee of the House 
and required to defend what they have said, I feel that their 
punishment has been meted out, that they have been called to 
account, that there have been sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I spoke earlier, I believe in our parliamentary system and 
our democracy that every MP should have a right to criticize 
anyone as long as the criticism falls into the realm of fair 
comment.  In this instance the criticisms fell into the realm of 
fair comment.  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you would have found ample 
precedents on other occasions where MPs have suggested because of 
a Speaker's ruling that the Speaker's election may be in jeopardy 
at some future time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this issue strikes at the very heart of the 
freedom of MPs to speak out both within and without the Chamber. 
If they do not feel free to speak out, if they hesitate to speak 
out because of some perceived sanction that may be imposed upon 
them at a later time by their colleagues in committee, I do not 
think we will get the debates, either in the Chamber or in 
public, that we need in order to proceed to consider the issues 
carefully in a democratic fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to say this because I always want to support my side 
in the House.  I considered very carefully the comments of the 
government House leader.  However, on an issue as close to the 
heart as the freedom of every one of us in the House to speak 
out, both within and without the House, I have to say I cannot 
support the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to make a few points.  I want to respond to the NDP 
member for Kamloops who suggested that you really want this to go 
to committee.  I believe that is not accurate at all.  Your 
reason is that we are debating it before the House because you 
want the House to decide without question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to the member who brought the motion forward, 
the Progressive Conservative member who has drawn an analogy to a 
civil case.  I do not see this analogy and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true before the courts, or the general public for that 
matter, that litigants are not permitted to lobby the judge, the 
arbitrator or a juror when making a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that is not the issue here at all.  When the 
original motion was brought forward, or the point of order, I was 
also standing along with the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
As is your role, Mr. Speaker, you recognized him.  I respected 
that and I sat down.  I did not have a chance to voice my 
concerns, but I had twice gone looking for you and was 
unsuccessful in finding you.  This was an important enough issue 
for me that I wanted to talk to you and say that I at least have to 
voice my concerns to you on this point of order. 
I was absolutely going to try to influence your vote, without 
question.  I believe that is perfectly appropriate in these 
circumstances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe it is perfectly appropriate if the public 
telephones you or faxes you or lobbies you to put their comments 
on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue about your integrity. I believe that is why you 
are sitting in the chair.  That is why we elected you.  We are 
confident that you will make a decision which we will respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had every intention of lobbying you, Mr. Speaker, because I 
did not have an opportunity to speak on the original motion and I 
felt it was very important that I do so.  I disagree with the 
analogy which was made by the member of the Progressive 
Conservative Party that if this were a civil court case it would 
be improper to lobby you outside the House concerning your 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure you have received faxes from the public, Mr. Speaker, 
on a matter of this importance.  I am sure you have received 
phone calls from the general public.  I would respectfully submit 
that the general public is not in contempt.  They have every 
right to send information to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of voicing our opinions.  It is very important to 
me that you hear my concerns.  I will not do that now.  I want 
to, but I have not been able to do it.  I will respect your 
decision, but again I think I have the right to let you know how 
I feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have chosen to do that through the newspaper.  We 
deal with it all the time.  Every single day we see things in the 
newspaper about members of the House, their staff and other 
government officials.  We have to filter through them to know 
what they mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have the highest respect for your office and for 
that matter for yourself.  I will put that on the record. 
However, had I walked out of here and somebody had stuck a camera 
in my face and had asked me for my comments, I would have stated 
them quite openly, quite honestly and quite appropriately I may 
add with no disregard for your office whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I will say that I respect your decision to let the House 
decide the issue.  The other point of order is a separate issue 
entirely.  We must respect your decision.  We must respect your 
office.  You are sitting in that chair because we put you there 
and because we believe in your integrity.  Otherwise you would 
not be there.  I am convinced of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not support the motion.  Although I may not have chosen 
to lobby this way, other members have.  They feel quite strongly 
about the issue and want to have their comments on the record. 
You are sitting there waiting to make a decision, which you can 
do with total impartiality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I feel privileged to have the opportunity to participate 
in this debate.  I did not realize until I arrived here this 
afternoon that this tempest in a teapot had taken on a new 
proportion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by going back to my first year in this city, 
1980.  I and my good friend, the late Norman Wood who was a 
senior bureaucrat for many years, were given the job by the then 
prime minister of Canada to do an analysis of the Government of 
Canada presence right across the country. The purpose of doing 
this study about the presence of the Government of Canada at that 
time was to try to figure out why there was such a deep-seated 
feeling of western alienation when the Government of Canada had 
done all kinds of things especially in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travelled from coast to coast and placed special emphasis on 
western Canada.  My very dear friend Norman Wood and myself took 
slides.  We took thousands of pictures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discovered that there were literally thousands of Government 
of Canada services right across the country but especially in 
western Canada where the Government of Canada presence did not 
exist. 
There were agricultural buildings, there were youth services in 
colleges and universities.  The Government of Canada was 
providing all of these services but with no Government of Canada 
presence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly thereafter we got the Canada word mark with the flag on 
top. We put these signs and flags not just in western Canada but 
right across the country.  The whole purpose of that was to make 
sure the Government of Canada presence was recognized.  It was 
not hidden in some back office.  It was out there for the public 
to realize that this Chamber actually did useful things in every 
region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because I do not want anybody in this Chamber to 
think for a second that my commitment to the flag, my commitment 
to the Government of Canada have diminished in any way, shape or 
form since 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to this incident, last week the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis came into our committee.  I have had a very good 
relationship with her over the last two terms.  I asked her quite 
openly what the big fuss was over the flags at the Olympic games 
celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member responded in what I thought was quite a constructive 
way.  She put a bunch of pictures on the table which I wish we 
could display to Canadians.  She was not objecting to the 
Canadian flag per se.  When the initial comments were made she 
was referring specifically to that avenue where representatives 
of all countries were in the Olympic village and the Canadian 
presence, which we celebrate, outnumbered the presence of any 
other country by about 20:1. My colleague from Scarborough Centre 
was there and he concurs with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a sense that the member asked whether it was 
distasteful to have this many flags.  Those remarks were blown 
right out of proportion. I know some people will stand up and say 
that I am in bed with the separatists.  If members choose to take 
that line of thinking, then that is their privilege in this 
House.  It is very important that we understand the origin of 
this member's remark.   I believe quite frankly that the member 
was not spitting on the flag, she was not jumping on the flag. 
She was merely making a comment about whether this was 
artistically the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  That is fine, the member can say it 
is nonsense, but I have my privilege to stand in this House and 
say what I think just as that member does and I happen to 
disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in bed with the separatists.  Anybody who has been in 
this Chamber for the last 10 years knows that I find dealing with 
the separatists to be a very tough situation.  I also believe we 
should understand.  If a member makes a remark that suddenly 
becomes coast to coast front cover headlines when it was a musing 
thing, not a statement of hurt nor a statement to diminish Canada 
but a comment, then it is important to take it in the whole 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In emotional moments in this Chamber, whether we sing O Canada, 
show the flag five times or a hundred times when our athletes or 
astronauts come home, it is the privilege in my own view although 
I defer to your judgment, Mr. Speaker, of all of us to 
emotionally show excitement and gratitude. 
On that score, I separate again from the separatists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to you, and I am 
totally loyal to your judgment in this, that it is very important 
that a person not be condemned, hung out to dry, when it was a 
simple musing comment. In no way, shape or form in my judgment 
was she stomping on the flag.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this afternoon 
we are talking about a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we are talking about something that concerns us 
all, that concerns you personally as well, Mr. Speaker.  We are 
talking about respect for democracy in the House. We are talking 
about your ability to lead the House to conclusions.  And we are 
talking about respect for this ability as it relates to the 
institution of the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, our Liberal Party colleague referred to 
remarks made by the member for Rimouski—Mitis with respect to the 
large number of Canadian flags she saw in Nagano. 
The remarks made at the time were respectful of the institution 
and the flag and all they evoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw on Thursday, two weeks ago, and I was in the House, 
profoundly shocked me.  I feel that a country's flag is something 
sacred.  It is more than just a piece of fabric, more than just 
colours.  It is something that represents a people.  I respect 
the flag of Quebec, I respect the flag of Canada, and I respect 
national flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National anthems also have a sacred character and, in my view, 
may not be used whenever and however people wish.  It would be 
ill viewed, as I think everyone here would agree, if a student 
were to stand up in the middle of a class and begin singing the 
national anthem or waving flags in the name of freedom of 
expression. 
There is a time and a place for everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened here, two weeks ago, upset me precisely because we 
used a flag, the Canadian flag, and a national anthem, O Canada, 
at an inappropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During oral question period, the time allocated to hon. members 
for putting their questions and to ministers for answering them 
is quite limited, and you see to it, Mr. Speaker, that we keep 
things rolling. The disruption that occurred during our 
proceedings meant that some hon. members who could have asked 
questions did not have time to do so, and that the ministers did 
not have time to answer them. I know as you do, Mr. Speaker, that 
the House cannot operate properly under such circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the incident, Mr. Speaker, you said—I was there—that you 
would take the matter under advisement and that you would get 
back to the House. In the meantime, some hon. members have 
questioned your eventual decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, once you have made the decision, anyone who 
disagrees with it will be free to say so. But until you make a 
decision, it is our duty to give you the time you need to ponder 
the issue and make the necessary consultations, and to put our 
trust in you.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You have my confidence and I think you also have the confidence 
of the vast majority of the members of this House. However, some 
have allowed themselves, publicly and openly, not in private 
conversations but in front of the media, to question the decision 
that you will make. Worse still, they indicated that they would 
withdraw their confidence in you should your ruling not be what 
they think it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable. Such behaviour jeopardizes the 
democratic institutions that are Parliament and the House of

If I speak freely here this afternoon, it is because I know that 
hon. members, whether or not they agree with my comments, will 
listen and let me exercise the right to speak that is mine since 
I was elected through a democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members also know that I do the same when you recognize 
them, Mr. Speaker. They enjoy the same freedom of speech, because 
they were also elected through a democratic process. I respect 
your authority because we collectively decided that you, our 
fellow member of Parliament, would ensure that the debates take 
place in a climate of respect that is conducive, hopefully, to 
the best possible outcome, and, more importantly, that is 
consistent with democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to some members, and sometimes I just cannot believe 
my ears. 
Whatever happened to respect for democracy among those of our 
colleagues who are trying to influence your decision, to kill 
debate, and to put a lid on the issues, instead of allowing a 
debate that would lead to a solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what your decision will be. I will anxiously wait 
for it, like many of us here. However, I do know that if your 
decision is made within the rules of our parliamentary system, it 
will get the support of a majority of members of this House, as 
are all decisions made in this fashion. We are bound by a 
democratic pact and this is why I will accept your decision, 
whatever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had the authority to do so, I would apologize to you on 
behalf of the members of other parties who more or less 
threatened you. I do not have this authority, but it makes me 
very sad to see certain members show such disrespect for you.

Port Corporation in accordance with Canada's national marine 
policy. In support of that transfer, Transport Canada is 
providing a total of $14.45 million under its port divestiture 
fund for health and safety upgrades to the port facility. These 
upgrades include improved dust control, a new hopper car unloader 
and concrete restoration measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional funding of $19.6 million is being provided for 
capacity enhancements at the port including a new tug and 
trackmobile, wharf face repairs and dredging of the port. This 
funding consists of $9 million from western economic 
diversification, $4.6 million under the western grain 
transportation adjustment fund and $6 million from the province 
of Manitoba. This funding will be provided to Hudson Bay Port 
Corporation under a contribution agreement with western economic 
diversification with funds to be provided on a reimbursement 
basis after eligible costs have been incurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total federal support of $28.05 million along with provincial 
funding of $6 million are key elements in ensuring that the port 
of Churchill will be internationally competitive and economically 
viable and independent over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) In a separate transaction, CN rail has sold the bay line to 
Churchill to Hudson Bay Rail Company. Western economic 
diversification will provide $16 million to CN in recognition of 
its losses on the bay line and to allow it to proceed with the 
sale rather than abandon the line and recover the salvage value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rail line transaction involves 1,300 km of track connecting 
the communities of Flin Flon, Lynn Lake, Churchill and other 
smaller centers. This rail link is critical to the economy of 
northern Manitoba and under its new ownership it will provide the 
opportunity for new growth and development in the area.

The Treasury Board is responsible for establishing the required

the management and security of computer systems and networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments are responsible for protecting sensitive information 
and assets, such as computer and related systems, in accordance 
with Treasury Board policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the government security policy, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, RCMP, is identified as a lead agency in physical and 
information technology security.  The RCMP has been providing 
basic security advice to departments for many years which no 
doubt has reduced the number and impact of the occurrences of the 
theft of entire computer systems and components.  In addition to 
the ongoing advice and guidance to departments in the areas of 
physical security and information technology security, the 
following specific measures have been taken: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments are encouraged to consult with the Treasury Board 
Secretariat, TBS, on matters of computer security and meetings are 
held with departments following the theft of computers or 
components.  While TBS can work with departments to help 
establish additional methods of securing government assets and 
information, a theft should be reported to the RCMP in order for 
an investigation to be conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Deputy Comptroller General Branch at TBS is responsible for 
the policy of security for government assets.  A document 
entitled “Guide to the Review of Material Management” is posted 
on the department's web site located at <I>www.tbs-sct.gc.ca</I> under 
Contract, Material and Risk Management.  The main objectives of 
this policy are focused on the reduction of physical losses, 
optimizing the utilization of resources and ensuring value for 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A guidance document entitled a “Guide to minimizing computer 
theft” was issued in June 1997 and is available at the RCMP's 
Internet site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A RCMP investigator was seconded to the Ottawa-Carleton regional 
computer component theft team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each federal government department has a departmental security 
officer to deal with the RCMP.  This individual is responsible 
for security issues particularly with respect to personnel and 
information technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental security officers are members of an association 
that allows them to consult and share information on security 
issues.  Each officer also reports to their respective deputy 
minister to keep him or her updated on matters of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of physical security devices were tested in government 
to lock down systems and prevent systems from being opened.  For 
instance, computers can be bolted down to desktops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred per cent security is unattainable in any setting, 
nor would it be desirable because of prohibitive cost.  We feel 
that with departments implementing the advice provided, component 
theft will be kept under control.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE BUDGET 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK267">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; and of 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter this debate on the budget.  In some 
real ways, this is the culmination of how I ended up here. 
Indeed, I spent many years wondering how it was possible that 
Canada can continue to go so close to the abyss of financial 
ruin.  It was clear to me that we needed a new way to do 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the week before last it was my great pleasure to 
listen to the Minister of Finance bring in the first balanced 
budget that this country has seen in over 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is very noticeable about this budget is that it 
talks about education.  One thing I have always believed, and it 
is very important, is that a country educate its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about Canada being a resource based country and, indeed, 
we are but our best resources are the resources between our ears. 
Finding better ways to use those resources is what is going to 
make Canada a better country in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about productivity.  Some people think this 
is an economic concept.  What it basically means is the ability 
of people to use their surroundings, to use their resources in an 
effective way to produce products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been changing our economy so that we are moving away 
from the resource based industries of the past and we are moving 
towards a service sector orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, it is very difficult sometimes to measure 
productivity.  Why am I talking about productivity?  The problem 
of Canada and Canada's economy is that we have been lagging many 
of our competitors in the area of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of productivity, Canada lags our chief competitor, 
the United States, by something like 30%.  Why is that?  What is 
it going to mean for our economy? It means that our competitors 
are able to use technological advances quicker, more rapidly in 
their production capabilities as well as in their service sector 
than are Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people suggested that the decline in the value of the 
Canadian dollar is directly related to our decline in 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada has made a tremendous number of 
reports basically stating that while Canada has one of the 
highest per capita spending in the western world on education, we 
are still very much scorned in the mid-term in the areas of 
science and math. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, our illiteracy rate in Canada is mid-term.  It is really 
quite a disgrace for a modern nation like ours to have illiteracy 
rates as high as we do.  That is why I was very proud to be part 
of a government that brought in an accentuation that, while we 
have been able to manage our debt and deficit so that we have a 
balanced budget, we have been able to accentuate those things 
that are going to empower ourselves to be a better and more 
competitive nation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those things, exclude that we look at the education area.  I 
was very happy to see a restoration of funding for NSERC and the 
Medical Research Council.  These are ways that governments can 
support our institutions and create more opportunities for 
technological advancements in our universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention I was very proud when the Minister of Finance 
mentioned a college in my riding, Durham College.  Indeed at the 
same time, the president for Durham College was in the gallery 
listening to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next morning, I gave a post-budget breakfast in my riding 
for basically all the business community. 
I can tell this House that those people were all very happy and 
supportive of the budget we presented.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember back in 1994 it not being that way, that there 
were very ugly meetings sometimes when people wanted us to move 
fast on this or that envelope. It has been very much that the 
Canadian people have come to the realization that this government 
brings sound, good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the areas that this budget talked about were registered 
education savings plan.  My background has been one of an 
investment adviser and accountant. When I used to practise, these 
registered educational savings plan we basically shunned. The 
reason was that they were very much a gamble on behalf of parents 
who wanted to save money for the support of their children going 
for post-secondary education, because the mean factor was that if 
one's kid did not go one lost the money. The benefits were great 
because 50% of the people did not actually go so the people who 
stayed in the plan of course got good rewards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people are not into gambling, they are into saving for some 
positive returns.  What has happened with these plans is that we 
have now made them so that if a child does not go on for 
post-secondary education, parents can roll them back into their 
registered retirement savings plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone one step further by providing a 20% 
grant. The federal government is going to put that money directly 
in that plan as well. There is a partnership arrangement going on 
between parents, their children and the federal government. I 
think that is a very healthy attitude. The only comment I heard 
from people I talked to was why did we wait so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the baby boomers—me with three children 
in post-secondary education—are not going to be able to get the 
benefit of that, but the reality is that it allows people to put 
money aside. It is a great trepidation for a lot of parents to 
have young children who are going to go to university which will 
possibly cost as much as $10,000 a year to place them there. This 
gives them a way in which to see that their children do get 
adequate education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that I found very interesting was the ability of 
people to withdraw up to $10,000 in any one year and a cumulative 
of $20,000 from their registered retirement savings plans for 
their own education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that we are living in a society of continuous 
learning. We have to try to find ways to encourage people to go 
back and learn in new and better productive facilities in which 
to upgrade their skills. These all come back to my original 
theory of increasing Canada's productivity and making us a very 
competitive nation as we go out to fight it out with our 
neighbours and other countries in the world for our share of 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once suggested that we should use the employment insurance 
this way. In other words, we should provide certain funding 
through the employment insurance system to allow people the 
discretion to go out and re-educate themselves. This is another 
way to get at the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the radio the other day and I heard a 
financial planner criticizing this plan. His criticism was that 
the government was scheming to reduce people's RRSP savings so it 
could get them out and tax them. In other words, if people took 
out those moneys that were in their plans and went back to 
school, of course they would not be appreciating and therefore 
the government would be able to tax that money sooner. I do not 
think anything could be more ludicrous. The way to solve that 
problem is simply by reducing the benefits of RRSPs or the 
premium contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that the government's prime 
purpose is to make a down payment on the whole concept of 
continuous learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, there is one other little thing here that is not 
about productivity that I thought I would mention, the home 
givers tax credit.  I was in a seniors home the other day and I 
mentioned this credit. Everybody's eyes lit up because the 
government was now recognizing how we are going to have to do 
health care differently in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot continue this process of institutionalizing people at 
great cost when in fact many people are at home taking care 
of their loved ones.  They are often women who need that little 
extra break, the $400 care giver tax credit, a down payment on a 
different way and a better way to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am very happy to be part of a government that 
has brought in such a sensible budget.  Unfortunately it has 
taken us a number of years but we are going to continue on that 
track of reducing our deficit and debts in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member talks about a sensible budget.  I 
would like to give him an example of what this sensible budget 
does to some ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hometown a young single mother named Kathy McGuire. 
She works for the town.  She tosses garbage cans.  She looks 
after the water supply maintenance, whatever is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This woman by any definition is not wealthy.  She has been hit 
with an income tax bill of $800.  This is how this government 
repays people who work hard, who try their best to get along in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Kathy had been a wealthy Toronto lawyer she would have got a 
$3,000 child care expense deduction from her income tax. 
Actually, under the new budget it will be $4,000.  But this woman 
cannot afford child care.  So there is a catch-22.  She is not 
eligible to receive that wonderful deduction.  She is caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kathy has contributed to the balancing of the budget.  I am sure 
this makes her feel really great.  She has also, if one wants to 
be a little more cynical about this, contributed to about 1% or 
2% of the cost of sending four freeloading members of Parliament 
to Nagano to attend the Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member feels that this is 
appropriate, that people at the bottom end of the pay scale have 
to be hit with taxes.  I hear some yapping over there.  To some 
of these people $800 is not a lot of money.  I will tell you, it 
is a heck of a lot of money to people who are out there doing 
their best trying to make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of everyone in this place I would like to extend my 
sincere thanks to Kathy McGuire for forking out to help keep this 
zoo going and for helping to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure that if I 
knew Kathy McGuire's income perspective I could find something 
that was very positive about this budget, but of course this is 
the way the members ask their questions, just give you half of 
the information so you cannot possibly do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is I am very proud of that budget because in fact we 
removed thousands and thousands of people, low income families 
and low income people, from bracket creep by increasing personal 
exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many constituents, senior citizens, who were paying taxes 
before who are not paying them today.  That is a major commitment 
from the lower income people of this country.

budget, $850 million was given to the area of child tax credit 
which his constituent would have benefited from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest.  Let us be serious.  The reality is that woman 
is better off today than she would have been under a Reform 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak in response to the budget and 
provide the views of the New Democratic Party.  I will be sharing 
my time with the member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot today and in other responses to the budget 
that this budget is an education budget.  It is a budget for 
youth. We heard today in debate that it is a budget for equity, a 
budget for women.  More recently we heard it is a remarkable 
budget and a sensible budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the members of this House that having been in my 
riding, like many other members, for the past week and speaking 
with many of my constituents, this budget has been a huge 
disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Vancouver East people are asking a very key and 
a very legitimate question.  How will this budget improve the 
lives of people in east Vancouver?  The response I got was that 
this budget is a failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a failure because if we look behind the fine lines and 
fancy words it is a failure because it does not address the 
issues of people who are unemployed.  We have heard today in the 
House in question period of the number of people who are 
unemployed and because of the drastic changes to our EI program 
the number of people who are now ending up on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget failed those people.  It is a failure for people who 
are living at and below the poverty line and who are working at 
minimum wage jobs or in part time work and found nothing in this 
budget to improve their standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has failed women and we have heard a lot of 
discussion today about international women's day and 
international women's week but there is nothing in this budget 
about pay equity or child care, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also fails people who are sick and who look to our 
health care system and find there are enormous waiting lists or 
lack of service and accessibility.  This budget has also failed 
aboriginal people who live in the urban environment.  In my 
riding I have a very large number of urban aboriginal people who 
saw nothing in this budget that will address their very real 
concerns of unemployment, poverty, lack of access to services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also failed children who live in poor families and 
it fails students who are still facing massive cuts and 
skyrocketing tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plain reality is the total program spending delivered in 
this budget will decline to $104.5 billion in 1998-1999 from $106 
billion in 1997-1998.  That is a real decline in program spending 
despite the promises made by the finance minister that 50% of the 
surplus would go toward programs spending. The Liberals failed to 
meet even their own promise and the other reality is that not a 
single dollar of the cash transfers to provinces eliminated over 
the past three years will be restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on two issues that involve my critic 
areas.  One is education and one deals with the child tax 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is education.  We have heard so much hype about the 
$2.5 billion going into the millennium fund.  First of all, we 
have to understand that this fund will not even begin until the 
year 2000.  Students need help today, not in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time we get to the year 2000 and this millennium fund 
begins with its $250 million a year, we will have seen $3.1 
billion taken out of post-secondary education. 
That is devastating to our institutions, our universities, our 
community colleges and our places of higher learning. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister had a choice to restore the funding to the 
provinces so we could strengthen post-secondary educational 
facilities and ensure tuition fees would not continue to go up 
and up.  The government did not make that choice.  The choice it 
made was to set up a private foundation so it could hand out 
little cheques every now and again to 7% of students, which means 
that 93% of students will not be assisted by the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a most cynical ploy the finance minister in all of his 
background papers told us there were plans to change the 
bankruptcy laws to ensure students are not able to declare 
bankruptcy until 10 years after they complete their studies, 
which is a change from the current two years.  If the government 
believes so strongly that it is helping students, why has it so 
cynically changed the bankruptcy laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia, Premier Clark announced a few days ago that 
for the third year in a row tuition fees would be frozen.  That 
is the kind of leadership we wanted to see from the Liberal 
government.  It would say to students that we understand their 
debt loads are too high, that tuition fees must be frozen and 
that we are willing to support provincial transfers to increase 
post-secondary educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit is another issue.  Every time the question 
of unemployment and poverty comes up in the House we hear the 
minister crow about the child tax benefit and what a glorious 
program it is.  I heard the minister say that it is the most 
significant social policy since the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain what the reality is.  This is not an anti-poverty 
measure.  We are talking about a program where the additional 
$425 million will not even begin until July 1999.  So much for 
helping poor kids who live in poor families.  What will that help 
be?  It will be a measly 80 cents a day.  That is what we are 
saying to kids.  The child tax benefit is not indexed and does 
not apply to people on welfare.  There is not one mention in the 
budget about a national child care program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly cares about poverty, about helping 
unemployed people and about equality as we heard today in glowing 
terms, why does the budget fail to address any of these measures? 
The reality is that the budget that was announced and debated 
will not close the gap between the wealthy and five million 
Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet and who are living 
below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says that it wants tax cuts.  I will read from 
an article by Seth Klein of the Canadian Centre for Policy 
Alternatives published in the <I>Canadian Review of Social 
Policy</I>.  The key goal is job creation.  That should be the 
government's priority.  The paper points out very eloquently that 
tax cuts are an inefficient way to create jobs.  The tax cut 
theory rests on the unsubstantiated hope that consumers will 
spend more, that this in turn will translate into companies 
hiring more people, and that the evidence suggests direct 
government hiring and spending would create substantially more 
jobs than tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we pursue this information further we see from the latest 
information from Informetrica that directing $1 billion toward 
new government hiring would create 25,000 jobs in the first year. 
In contrast $1 billion toward personal income tax would create 
only 9,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very real issue about what course the government has 
chosen.  After four years of a slash and burn approach, of 
cutting the transfers to the provinces, not one new dollar was 
included in the budget in terms of restoring and reinvesting in 
education and social programs.  It is the height of cynicism and 
hypocrisy that even the measures around the child tax benefit 
will do nothing to seriously alleviate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the budget speak to a progressive taxation system? 
Absolutely not. 
There was silence on that measure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the budget deal with the $7.5 billion that the banks are 
racking up in profits?   Did it speak to reinvesting that money 
so that ordinary Canadians could benefit?  There was not a word 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, according to my constituents and other people across 
Canada the budget failed miserably to address the growing 
inequality in Canada.  It lacked the leadership, the vision and 
the courage to tackle head on the crisis of unemployment and the 
lack of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that this was a banker's budget, not a people's 
budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member talks about the budget being so 
terrible.  I represent Guelph which has a university.  Its 
president has written to say that this is a good budget.  He is 
very pleased because of all the things for students, for the 
university, and for research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the hon. member yelling and hollering about how 
terrible everything is, it brings to mind the fact that we had an 
NDP government in Ontario which spent way more than it could 
afford.  It lasted four years and was kicked severely out of 
office because it never ever balanced a budget.  It never spent 
within its means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid the member across the way is dreaming in Technicolor 
to think everyone can afford everything.  We have balanced the 
deficit.  We have a zero deficit after many years.  The member 
should recognize that there is a balancing act.  We have put huge 
amounts of money into health care and education.  Eighty per cent 
of the budget represents a spending in health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the member is aghast, she need only look at the $1.5 
billion in transfers and the megadollars put into many projects 
for students that will benefit my community and others all across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency office I have had very positive reviews on 
the budget.  I wish the hon. member could somehow talk about the 
fact that even in the NDP's election campaign it overspent and 
had to issue another book because it had spent so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member needs a little dose of reality.  Does she not think 
that it is important to spend on education as we have in these 
projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I see reality every day 
in my riding of Vancouver East.  I understand what it is about 
for people who live in poor housing, who are without work or who 
do not have adequate health care resources and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to check the facts.  The budget did not 
increase spending for health care.  If the member checks the 
facts, program spending is actually decreasing from $106 billion 
in 1997-98 to $104.5 billion in 1998-99.  If we just want to look 
at education, there is not one increase in dollars for the 
transfers to the provinces in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced a shell game, a $2.5 billion 
millennium fund over a 10 year period or $250 million a year.  By 
the time that program starts we will have lost $3.1 billion from 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts and that is the reality.  That is why 
tuition fees and student debt will continue to go up despite the 
bits of window dressing the government has brought in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on the weekend I happened to be in the hon. member's 
constituency of Vancouver East.  I understand the difficult 
social and economic conditions of which she speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The east end of Vancouver in many respects is a tragic scene of 
economic devastation and social problems.  For six years now 
British Columbia has been governed by a New Democratic government 
which has raised taxes and in so doing increased unemployment, 
reducing opportunities for the people who now find themselves on 
skid row in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened in Ontario.  Bob Rae raised taxes and 
unemployment skyrocketed.  If we look at Ontario we see that the 
Mike Harris government has cut taxes, revenues have gone up, with 
them health care spending has gone up and so too has employment. 
Unemployment has gone down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to compare her constituency to the city of 
Calgary, for instance, which is in the province that has the 
lowest provincial taxes in the country and an unemployment rate 
of approximately 5%, nearly a third of what it is in the east end 
of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she comment on the regional disparities with respect to 
taxes and economic growth which exist in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question and his comment.  I would be happy to show him 
what life is like in Vancouver East.  He said that he visited 
there recently.  I would be happy to provide more detail about 
the impact of federal cuts over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be said that the situation in British Columbia and 
in other provinces has worsened because of the incredible 
devastation caused by the lack of transfer payments and the 
diminishing transfer payments from the federal government.  If 
the Reform Party and the member cannot acknowledge that, they are 
only telling part of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. we are very fortunate that we still have a provincial 
government which, for example, is committed to the provision, the 
development and the financing of social housing.  When he talks 
about the people of my riding who are in very dire circumstances, 
I would think he should be the first one to recognize the fact 
that the Government of B.C. has continued to provide housing for 
very low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no mention of housing in the budget.  If we want to 
talk about jobs, what better program to generate jobs than a good 
housing program?  That is something the B.C. government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to education, despite the cuts from the federal 
government the province of British Columbia has maintained and in 
fact has increased funding for education above that of any other 
province, as well as funding for health care.  It has also 
maintained a tuition freeze for three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something we should be proud of.  That is something the 
federal government should be following and working to implement 
with other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 6.15 p.m., 
it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith 
every question necessary to dispose of the amendment now before

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“the House of Commons reject the budget statement by the Minister 
of Finance because it denies Canadians debt and tax relief by 
spending away the federal budget surplus, thus killing 
opportunities for job creation and economic growth; it leaves 
Canadians saddled with the highest personal income tax rates in 
the G-7 countries resulting in a systematic brain drain to 
jurisdictions with lower taxation levels; it allows interest 
charges on the national debt to consume one-third of every tax 
dollar collected by the federal government and to exceed 
spending on health care, education and old age security combined; 
it continues the steady decrease in real disposable income for 
the average Canadian through tax hikes; and it does not keep the 
government's promise of committing 50% of the surplus to new 
spending and the remaining 50% to some combination of debt 
reduction and tax relief”.

<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in question period on February 2 I asked the 
finance minister what proof he could give the House that the 
monster merger between the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal 
would be better for small businesses, farmers and Canadian 
communities.  I asked at the very least if he could promise it 
would not make things worse.  The minister replied that the 
government had asked the task force on financial services to 
address service to small business in its deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His answer offers little reassurance to small business owners or 
farmers in my riding and in other parts of Canada.  No one 
believes the task force should be allowed by the Liberal 
government to consider anything other than the interests of Bay 
Street and the agenda of the big banks.  That is why the NDP has 
been calling for a parliamentary inquiry with full cross-Canada 
public hearings so the people of Canada can speak to elected MPs 
about their concerns regarding the bank merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty clear from the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business study entitled “Credit Where Credit is Due” that small 
business is pretty close to fed up with the treatment it is 
getting from the big six.  CFIB president Catherine Swift told 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that “the proposed merger between the 
Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal is worrisome to 
small businesses because they want more, not fewer financial 
institutions to choose from.  The prospect of reducing the 
already few players to even fewer is not a happy one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eleven per cent of small business loan applications were 
rejected by banks last year.  This is up from 9% ten years ago, a 
full 2% increase.  Other studies show that only 3% of bank loans 
granted by the big six are under $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the CFIB found that small business loans are priced 
well above loans to their larger counterparts and the gap is 
widening.  Big loans to big business equal small service charges 
to big business, whereas small loans to small business equal big 
service charges to small business.  Is this fair?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest problems for small businesses occur when they have 
to deal with the very high turnover in account managers at the 
big six banks.  Many firms deal with three or more managers in as 
many years.  This situation is unlikely to improve if the monster 
merger and others like it are approved.  The banks seem to be 
more interested in chasing risky international commercial loans 
than in servicing their small business customers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no reason to believe that foreign banks will provide any 
more than minimal staff in our country.  Meanwhile the bank 
merger could cost up to 30,000 Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister made the bizarre and quite desperate 
accusation that somehow the NDP has found new friends in the 
banks.  As my leader said, he should look in the mirror.  His 
party accepted a quarter of a million dollars in donations from 
the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal last year, and he himself 
received a tidy $1,000 from Royal Bank chief executive officer 
John Cleghorn for his own campaign in addition to another $1,000 
from Nesbitt Burns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can make some choices.  It can choose to approve 
the monster merger and reduce competition still further or it can 
pass a community reinvestment act and require the Canadian banks 
to do their job and service the credit needs of small businesses, 
farmers and communities in our country.  If these minimum 
requirements are not met, perhaps issuing a bank charter to 
Canadians who want to meet these national objectives should be 
looked at.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this government has supported 
and will continue to support increasing small business access to 
financing. However the CRA approach is not the only vehicle under 
which this can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to assess the impact this legislation has 
had in the United States. Overall the legislation has been useful 
in raising U.S. lenders' awareness of their lending patterns by 
requiring data reporting and record keeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not clear whether a CRA regime would be well suited 
to Canada. Unlike the regional and highly fragmented banking 
system in the U.S., we already have a national banking system 
that transfers resources from savers to borrowers in all regions 
of this country. My concern is that any policy that requires 
balancing of lending and deposits within communities could in 
fact serve to restrict rather than propel economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to mention that the House industry 
committee represented by members of Parliament from across this 
country has successfully convinced the banks to provide 
information, without the CRA legislation, on business loans by 
size, region and industrial grouping. We will continue to monitor 
this reporting to ensure that the banks continue to do their 
share in financing of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of mergers which the member brought up as well, he 
talks about little reassurance being given by the finance 
minister and the fact that he calls for cross-country hearings. I 
would say and we have said time and again that this deal is on 
hold. It is going nowhere until we have had the opportunity to 
hear from the task force and Canadians have had their say on its 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bottom line is that in fact until the big questions are 
answered and unless this deal works for Canadians, it will not 
work at all. I cannot be any clearer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I thank the hon. member for his interest. I invite 
him to join the finance committee when in fact we go across the 
country to hear from Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on February 6 I asked the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans a question with respect to Yves Fortier who had just quit 
as Canada's chief Pacific salmon negotiator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which I have been deeply concerned about. This 
government has had four years to deal with it.  As I stand here 
in my place and speak today, we are worse off than we were on 
June 2 when I was elected. I will not say that it seemed to be 
the height of the crisis because I think it could get even worse, 
but it was a very tough and difficult time for us, as has been 
the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are worse off today than we were before. At the present time 
we have no negotiators acting on Canada's behalf. We have heard 
the minister make statements in recent weeks that they are 
waiting for the United States to contact Canada to resume 
negotiations. I would suggest that we have had over four years 
now, a time of waiting, and we have to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I asked the question about Yves Fortier is that he 
was the one person whom British Columbia fishermen had confidence 
in and he was acting on their behalf. He has now left and it is 
arguable why he left. I would suggest he left because the 
government did not give him the backing he needed. He saw no way 
out of the dispute without a commitment from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell British Columbia fishermen how they can 
expect to have any confidence in this government when our 
negotiator had none? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue. At present we are only a few 
months away from the beginning of the next fishing season and we 
do not have anybody representing our issues. We are not even in 
discussions. We are not in negotiations. Nothing is happening. 
Zero. Four years of nothing and it is going downward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has to get on with it. This is a very important 
issue. Again I ask the parliamentary secretary what his 
government's plans are. When is the government going to act? 
When can we expect negotiations to resume?  Does the government 
anticipate having this matter resolved prior to the next fishing 
season?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I wonder where 
this member has been for the last while.  On February 23 I 
answered this very same question for the member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event the resignation of Mr. Yves Fortier as Canada's 
chief negotiator in Pacific salmon is a matter that we on this 
side admit is of great regret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 he has worked tirelessly to achieve an agreement with 
the United States to implement fully the provisions of the 
Pacific salmon treaty.  His negotiating skills, as the member has 
mentioned and I agree with him on this point, and his dedication 
to the task have earned him admiration and the respect of 
ministers, government officials and, most important, Canadian 
fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the high regard in which Mr. Fortier is held, he is being 
done a disservice by those who have attempted to use out of 
context excerpts from his letter of resignation and put a 
negative spin on his views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier's letter to Ministers Axworthy and Anderson 
describes his experience as chief negotiator over the past five 
years.  He assesses the current situation and he provides advice 
on the direction we should go.  All Canadians share his 
frustrations on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier explains why an agreement was not attainable. 
Primarily it was the reluctance of the United States federal 
administration to insist that the United States regional 
interests honour obligations toward Canada under the treaty. 
This point comes as no surprise to anyone who has followed this 
file over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier's letter cautions that meaningful change in the 
United States negotiating position is unlikely.  This remains to 
be seen, but no Canadian is under the illusion that we cannot 
achieve a negotiated—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HIGHWAY SYSTEM 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on November 25, 1997 I asked the question what are we 
doing as a government to prepare for the coming NAFTA 
superhighway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often have a habit in this place of saying “well, if it is 
highway it is not a federal responsibility, it is a provincial 
responsibility and don't talk to us about it”.  I must say I 
was very pleased to hear the minister's response that there is an 
interparliamentary group working to ensure that we do monitor 
activities in the United States and that we are paying attention 
to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are not familiar with this concept, the NAFTA 
superhighway is an American idea whereby they are going to build 
a trade corridor.  This is not simply a transportation issue, 
this is an issue of trade between two countries.  This is an 
issue which is of great concern in a number of border crossings 
in Ontario because highways are not just places where people 
drive trucks and cars these days, but they are trade routes. 
They are, by way of analogy, the railroad passage way of another 
era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we as a country, particularly when in 
southern Ontario at one crossing there are exports of more than 
$200 million worth of goods per year, ensure that there is an 
adequate highway system.  It is going to be more than a highway 
system, it is going to be a communications system.  When these 
goods are exported or when goods are imported, it will be done in 
a timely fashion and there will not be interference.  For 
Canadians this is a massive project for trade. Jobs and trade go 
hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to know that the government is monitoring this and 
that in the future the Department of Transport will be ready to 
move in concert with out American neighbours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, given the hon. member's 
intervention, I guess there really is no need for an answer of 
any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hard working member for Sarnia—Lambton raised an important 
question concerning trade corridors in the national highway 
system.  The member's question demonstrates his keen awareness 
that transportation is a strategic asset that can drive a 
country's economy.  To capitalize on continental trade links we 
need not only the right rules and regulations, but we also need 
to have the right infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada certainly recognizes the importance of 
north-south trade corridors, but also the critical importance of 
their productivity with east-west highways. 
In this regard the department is currently working, as the member 
is obviously aware because it was stated in the House moments 
ago, with the provinces to update a national highway system 
study.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highways in Canada are under provincial jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, the federal government has assisted the provinces 
with highway construction since 1919.  Future cost shared 
programs must consider highways important to our trade, whether 
north-south or east-west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal departments are also actively promoting trade and 
traffic through co-operative efforts with counterparts in the 
U.S. to enhance the efficiency and operation of border crossing 
facilities.  In this regard the federal government is well aware 
of and closely monitoring proposals being considered in the U.S. 
for funding in areas such as trade corridors and border gateways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, there are a number of cross-cutting issues which 
affect trade and transportation corridors.  We must recognize 
that while there has been strong growth in north-south trade the 
east-west dimension remains critically important and we must 
co-operate in and co-ordinate the deployment of intelligent 
transportation systems in order to enhance trade and reduce 
congestion.  We must pursue standards harmonizing under the 
NAFTA.  Finally, we must explore the trade benefits which may be 
possible through the maximization of modal efficiencies and 
inter-modal linkages.  There may also be important environmental 
benefits inherent in this total approach.
