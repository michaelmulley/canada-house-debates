<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 161-<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the Young Offenders act, (<I>a</I>) what are the objectives of the 
Act, (<I>b</I>) by what criteria is the attainment of these objectives measured, (<I>c</I>) 
what efforts has the Department of Justice made to evaluate the success of the 
act in terms of these criteria, and (<I>d</I>) to what extent have the objectives of the 
act been met?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
One of the primary objectives of the Young Offenders Act is to 
fashion dispositions which provide adequate public protection 
while maximizing the opportunities for the rehabilitation of 
young offenders. While Canadians may have different views on 
how this objective can be met, it seems clear that our 
fundamental goal is to ensure that as many youth as possible 
become fully participating and contributing members of our 
society as adults, in accordance with the values of our society.
<P>
	The changes which the government has introduced to the 
act in Bill C-37, which is currently before the Senate, attempt 
to clarify the distinction between appropriate responses for 
non-violent versus violent offences. The bill further states 
that young persons who are not convicted of crimes involving 
serious offences can be held accountable for their actions 
through non-custodial dispositions. There is an opportunity, 
in our view, for greater use of more constructive dispositions 
such as  compensation, restitution, and community service in 
situations where public safety is not at issue.
<P>
	With regard to offences of violence, Bill C-37 is clear that 
public protection must be given priority in assessing the nature 
and length of dispositions appropriate for these offences. The 
maximum sentences for youth charged with murder who remain 
within the youth justice system have been lengthened to ensure 
that public confidence in the system is not undermined by 
responses which seem disproportionate to the gravity of the 
crime. Bill C-37 provides that 16 and 17-year old offenders 
charged with very serious offences, such as murder, 
manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault, will be presumed 
to be dealt with in adult court unless they can satisfy the court 
that the competing interests of public protection and their 
rehabilitation can be reconciled within the youth justice system.
<P>
	A review of actual sentencing practices and the rate of 
recidivism is one criterion by which attainment of the objectives 
of the act can be measured. Are offenders charged with serious 
crimes of violence receiving sentences which provide adequate 
protection to the public while affording them opportunities for 
rehabilitation? We know that only 19 per cent of crime 
committed by young persons involves violence, Youth Court 
Statistics 1993-94, in <I>Juristat</I>, January 1995, Vol. 15, No. 3, p. 
7. Some suggest, in fact, that young offenders are more likely to 
receive dispositions which are more onerous than adults.
<P>
	Another criterion for assessing whether the objectives of the 
act have been realized is the degree of public confidence in the 
youth justice system. In part, this is also a public information 
issue as there appears to be some misconceptions about the 
nature and length of sentences given in respect of crimes 
involving youth. There are statistics which indicate that there 
appears to be a gradual increase in the use of custody in respect 
of young offender dispositions and that much of this custody is 
used in respect of property offenders. Not many Canadians 
appear to know how the youth system actually operates and how 
successful it has been. Public legal education is an important 
initiative with which the Department of Justice is involved in 
conjunction with other government departments.
<P>
	In terms of the efforts the Department of Justice has made 
to evaluate the success of the act, this work is already under 
way. The Department of Justice, in collaboration with the 
provinces, set up a Federal-Provincial-Territorial Youth 
Justice Task Force to prepare a report by the fall for ministers 
and deputy ministers respecting various pertinent issues 
relevant to youth justice. Some of the issues being canvassed 
are appropriate mechanisms to deal with serious offenders, a 
determination of the interrelationship between the justice 
system and other services, such as health and child welfare, 
and the role of diversion in responding to criminal behaviour. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12447"> 12447 </A></B>
<P>
Informing all of this work is  recognition of the need to 
formulate a scheme which is responsive to public conerns 
about the youth justice system, while at the same time 
maximizing opportunities for constructive responses to youth 
crime. That process will give us a very comprehensive 
assessment about the ability of the Young Offenders Act to 
meet its objectives.
<P>
	The Department of Justice is also in constant contact with 
legal experts and practitioners in the youth justice system during 
the formulation of policy which affects young offenders. These 
inter-actions provide the department with ongoing feedback 
about the effectiveness of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Current public discussion about the Young Offenders Act has 
also alerted law makers to the limitations of legislation. We are 
quite convinced that legislation alone will not eliminate youth 
crime. Poverty, unemployment, family violence, racism, 
illiteracy, alcoholism and drug abuse and many other factors 
may contribute to criminal acts by young people and adults 
alike. In this regard, Bill C-37 expressly recognizes that crime 
prevention is essential to the long term protection of society and 
requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young 
persons. In turn, this mandates the need to develop 
multi-disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively 
responding to children and young persons at risk of committing 
offending behaviour in the future.
<P>
Question No. 169-<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Concerning old age pensions to how many recipients are benefits paid 
outside Canada and how do we ascertain that these recipients are still living?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> In 1994 old age security, OAS, pensions 
were paid to 66,531 individuals outside Canada.
<P>
	Notification of the death of a recipient may come from a 
variety of sources, such as: family members, a trustee, a local 
authority, a returned benefit cheque, or an application for a 
Canada pension plan death or survivor benefit. As well, controls 
program unit within income security programs conducts 
verification checks on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	There are currently no specific procedures which apply to 
pensioners outside Canada as compared to pensioners inside 
Canada. However, the February 1995 budget stated: ``Effective 
July 1, 1996 OAS recipients who are no longer resident in 
Canada will have to file a statement of their worldwide income 
in order to continue to receive OAS benefits.'' This requirement 
effectively provides a specific verification process.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMENTSMADEBYTHEMINISTEROFTRANSPORT-SPEAKER'SRULING">COMMENTS MADE BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT-SPEAKER'S 
RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I would like to make a brief 
statement about the point of order raised on Monday, May 8, 
1995, by the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The member stated that the Minister of Transport had 
challenged his integrity during Question Period on May 5. 
Specifically, the member objected to the minister's remarks that 
he had betrayed a confidence of the House by revealing 
information learned in a lock-up.
<P>
	Lock-ups are information sessions which operate 
independently from the House. Disagreements about lock-ups 
therefore are political matters best dealt with at the political 
level. Further, the member indicated that he had in fact obtained 
the information in question from press reports.
<P>
	When the matter was brought to my attention in the House on 
Monday, I stated that the interpretation of what was said was a 
matter for debate, but nonetheless promised to take it under 
advisement, I am still of the view that the words used were not 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	That said, let me turn to a related matter which is of great 
concern to me. When opinions are strongly held, the cut and 
thrust of debate can go beyond the realm of what may be 
considered acceptable. It is true that the Speaker must look at 
the context in which a word is uttered, and the tone used when a 
word is said, when considering whether a particular word or 
remark is unparliamentary. As I noted on Monday, members 
have every right to request that language, when ruled to be 
unparliamentary by the Chair, be withdrawn.
<P>
	Standing Order 18 requires members to refrain from using 
offensive words.
<P>
	There exist certain words, which, regardless of the tone 
used or the intention of the user, have, by their very 
connotation, a tendency to elicit negative reactions from other 
members. We saw an example of this yesterday when the word 
``traître'' was used in the House. Objections are raised each 
time this or similar words are uttered. These serve no 
constructive purpose and, more often than not, deflect the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12448"> 12448 </A></B>
<P>
House's attention away from the serious matters before it. I 
strongly urge all members to ponder the potential impact of 
such words before using them.
<P>
	I hope that members will seriously consider what I have said 
today and I thank all members for their attention.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its failure to keep its red book 
promise to make the government more open and permitting members of 
Parliament to be more accountable to their constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the House that pursuant 
to Standing Order 43(2), I and following Reform speakers will 
be splitting our time.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to debate the Reform motion that 
condemns the government for its failure to keep its red book 
promise to make the government more open and permitting MPs 
to be more accountable to their constituents.
<P>
	I thumbed through the red book the other day for the first time 
in a long while. I read the chapter on parliamentary reform and 
integrity in government. The rhetoric was wonderful. However 
looking at the history of this Parliament to date, the promises 
have not been kept and the government needs to be held 
accountable for that breach of trust with the Canadian public.
<P>
	The government has failed so miserably in the area of open 
and honest government that it is starting to make Brian 
Mulroney's Tories look like saints. Believe me, the Tories 
certainly are not saints.
<P>
	The government has been secretive, hierarchical and top 
down. It has hidden behind every excuse to avoid changing the 
structure and practices of this place and to avoid divulging 
information that the public has a right to know.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	My reform colleagues and I will demonstrate through debate 
in the House today that the government has failed the Canadian 
people through not delivering on the following promises. They 
failed on their commitment to not use time allocation and 
closure. They failed on the issue of an independent ethics 
counsellor. They punish their own backbenchers for putting 
their constituents first.
<P>
	The process of sending bills to committee prior to second 
reading is becoming a sham and the government has reneged on 
its commitment for more free votes in the House. This 
government has overused the order in council mechanism to 
slide through its own agenda. Its members have continued the 
proud Tory tradition of patronage, both in appointments and in 
the rewarding of party friends with government contracts 
without open tender. And the committee structure has made a 
mockery of democracy because of the overly zealous whipping 
of Liberal members.
<P>
	The government has gone out of its way to block and refuse 
requests for access to information. Interestingly enough, in 
yesterday's <I>Financial Post</I> there was an article on the gag law, 
Bill C-114-``the infamous law that would send Canadians to 
jail for up to five years if they individually or as a group spend 
more than $1,000 to support or oppose political parties or 
candidates during a federal election''. The Liberals are 
supporting this. The article indicates that they may even appeal 
to the Supreme Court to continue to gag Canadians. They are 
breaking their promise of not being an open, responsible, and 
accountable government.
<P>
	This government has made a number of promises in the red 
book about openness, democracy, parliamentary reform, and the 
freedom of members of Parliament to represent their 
constituents. I along with my Reform colleagues will go page by 
page through the red book and show how their promises were 
broken.
<P>
	We are starting to rip pages out of the red book because they 
are irrelevant. All we will have left pretty soon is the cover, a 
hollow shell of what was a grandiose scheme that they presented 
to the electorate in the last election campaign.
<P>
	We would all agree that the House of Commons is supposed to 
be a place of free and open debate, a place where every member 
should have the opportunity to give the pros and cons to each 
piece of legislation, particularly to explain to other members 
how any bill or motion will affect their own constituents. There 
is a procedural device that puts all that at risk, and the procedure 
is time allocation, used so many times by this government. Time 
allocation, or closure, is the most undemocratic of 
parliamentary procedures. Its only purpose is to stifle debate, 
robbing members of an opportunity to speak so that the 
government can ram through its agenda without scrutiny by all 
members of this House and without every member having an 
opportunity to place their position on the record if they so 
choose.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition they agreed that time 
allocation was undemocratic and unfair. They howled at the 
Conservative government whenever time allocation was used. 
They cried foul, they whined to the media, and they vowed never 
to use such an evil procedure if they ever got into government.
<P>
	The previous member for Ottawa-Vanier, now 
undemocratically ushered into the Senate, said that closure 
was far from democratic. The member for Winnipeg St. James 
called it draconian. The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12449"> 12449 </A></B>
<P>
experienced parliamentarian who is also the chair of the 
justice committee, said that it was a hijacking of democracy. 
The member for Kingston and the Islands, whose opinion I 
respect, said it was morally wicked. Those are strong words.
<P>
	The Conservative government used closure fifteen times 
during the last Parliament-fifteen times in five years. It sounds 
pretty bad, and it is. The government has already used closure 
and time allocation ten times in only two years. This is despite a 
promise by the Liberal government House leader to use this 
blunt instrument far less than the Tories did. At this rate, they 
will pass their old record of 25 uses of time allocation set by the 
Liberal government in 1980 to 1984.
<P>
	Despite all the damage the Liberals did to Canada during the 
1970s and 1980s, they are in government again today and they 
are making frequent use of the time allocation measure. They 
have used time allocation ten times in this Parliament, so they 
have already made it into double digits, ten times in the short 
time we have been here since the election. The most 
undemocratic of parliamentary procedures has never been used 
so much and so shamelessly.
<P>
	They brought in time allocation on Bill C-18, an act to 
interrupt the redistribution of electoral boundaries, at second 
reading. They brought it in on Bill C-32, the Excise Tax Act, at 
third reading. They time allocated third reading of Bill C-35, 
the Department of Citizenship Act. It sounds like a real national 
crisis.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	This was done at both report stage and third reading of Bill 
C-33 and C-34, dealing with self-government in Yukon. On Bill 
C-68, currently being debated in committee, they implemented 
time allocation at second reading. The government time 
allocated the second reading debate on Bill C-76, the Budget 
Implementation Act.
<P>
	Only in one case was the use of time allocation justified. That 
was in the case of a national emergency, an act to end the 
national rail strike. In this justifiable case, Reformers 
cooperated fully with the government.
<P>
	It is well worth looking at the nature of the bills the 
government pushed through the House without full debate. The 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act is itself an 
undemocratic measure and was rushed through. Obviously the 
government was showing little shame in what it was doing. It 
was trying to limit the amount of public discussion on the bill. 
Other bills show a similar pattern: the Excise Act, 
self-government acts, gun control acts, budget implementation, 
all bills that try to pull a fast one on the taxpayers or on Canadian 
citizens.
<P>
	It is clear the Liberals feel that if they do not like the nature of 
a debate, if they get uncomfortable over on the other side about 
the attention the opposition is focusing on some of their 
initiatives, they simply want to cut off the debate; they will not 
talk about it. This is unacceptable. This is undemocratic, and the 
government went out of its way to profess it would never do such 
a thing.
<P>
	The Liberals have gone back on their word ten times already 
on this issue of closure alone. When they break their word so 
often and so easily, how can they expect anyone to believe them 
at all? It is no wonder the Canadian public is beginning to tire of 
the unethical and politics as usual actions of the government.
<P>
	Another great promise of the government was that it was to 
open up the legislative process and allow more MPs the 
opportunity to have input into the creation of bills. The 
government announced it would allow certain bills to go to 
committee before second reading so members could have some 
input before the bill was written in stone. We have seen with Bill 
C-45, an inadequate correction of the Parole Act, and with Bill 
C-64, an act dealing with employment equity regarding the 
public service, which is currently before committee, that the 
government has kept and is keeping a short leash on its members 
in committee to ensure that no significant changes will be made 
to these bills while they are in committee.
<P>
	It is a done deal. The government knew these bills were out of 
touch with common sense Canadians, so it was vigilant not to let 
public opinion or reasoned debate from the opposition sway 
their members. All the talk and bluster from the government 
benches has been a sham. There has never been any intent to 
accept any advice or input from their own backbenchers, let 
alone someone from the opposition side.
<P>
	I wonder how my friends on the government back benches feel 
about the amount of input they do not have in the legislative 
process. On Bill C-68 and Bill C-41 we have heard that the 
members on the other side are very concerned about these 
measures. These and the budget are all good examples of how 
the cabinet views the opinions of rank and file Liberal members. 
They are told to toe the line; they must be team players and back 
the party on this one. The trouble is that every single vote comes 
up as another ``this one''. Get in line, folks.
<P>
	I want to bring up the issue of the position of the Speaker. This 
is a very interesting promise made by the Liberals while they 
were in opposition. They produced a document entitled 
``Reviewing Parliamentary Democracy''. It sounds really good. 
They always pick such nice words. It sounds really nice. What 
are the actions involved?
<P>
	I quote from that document from the section dealing with the 
Chair:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12450"> 12450 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the 
level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the Government party, two of the 
junior Chair Officers should be from the opposition, so that the four presiding 
officer positions are shared equally by Government and Opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was Liberal policy. That is what they took into the 
election. They broke that promise. It is just one of many 
promises they have blatantly broken, with no intention to keep 
them whatsoever. That is wrong. Canadians need to know about 
it. Whenever we start talking about these issues we are cut off in 
debate. That is brutally unfair and brutally undemocratic.
<P>
	The document was authorized by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Government House Leader, the member for Kingston and 
the Islands. It was authored by the current government whip, by 
the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs, who I see 
sitting in his seat across the way, and the minister of public 
works. These people signed their names to this promise and they 
did not keep it.
<P>
	I wonder why it was not done. Is the government trying to set a 
record for the number of promises it can break, for the number of 
times it can go back on its word in one Parliament? What a sad 
case this is.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has failed completely on the issue of ethics, 
accountability to constituents, parliamentary reform, 
commitment to fairness, and equality of all members of the 
House.
<P>
	I appreciate the chance to explain to the House why we are so 
concerned about our rights and freedoms as members of 
Parliament to function in an atmosphere where we can be 
effective, truly represent our constituents, and truly add to the 
dignity of this place in a manner Canadians deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is a very important debate for Canadian people because it 
goes right to the root of our democratic rights. It is very 
important in this country that we recognize that democracy is 
something that has to be looked after. It has to be protected. We 
have to be vigilant in the protection of our democratic rights.
<P>
	Democracy means rule by the people. It is not an exaggeration 
to say that in this country we have far from rule by the people. 
We have rule by the party. That is an abuse of democracy, which 
must be fought vigorously. Every single citizen is responsible to 
make sure that our country remains a democracy. The people 
whose money is being spent, whose future is being decided, and 
whose country is at stake must take a responsibility to be 
vigilant in this area.
<P>
	We have 295 members of Parliament who represent the 
people. The people have put us in this place on their behalf to 
examine the laws that are being proposed, to look after their 
money that is being spent, to make sure that their long term 
interests are protected in advance.
<P>
	What do we have? The government has never lost a single 
vote on a government bill. Why? Because the government has 
the most members in the Chamber. Is it really the wishes of all 
the government members that carry the day in this place? The 
answer is clearly no. If government members dare to listen to 
their constituents who have concerns about the effect of certain 
legislation they are punished as severely as possible. If they are 
punished publicly, can you imagine what goes on behind closed 
doors, the threats? They are told to get into line or they will be 
sorry. That is a sad way to run a country, and it must be attacked. 
It must be corrected.
<P>
	I read the document my hon. friend referred to that was put out 
by the Liberals before the last election, and I thought this is 
good, this is what I have been thinking should be done: more 
freedom for bills in committees, more free votes, more 
independence for the Speaker of the House. All those things that 
were talked about are so badly needed in Parliament. Yet as soon 
as they were elected the Liberals turned their backs on their own 
document, on their own promises.
<P>
	This cannot be tolerated by the Canadian people. They have a 
right to expect that when people put their name to a document, 
when they stand and campaign on promises that real reforms and 
real democracy will come into the House, there will be a real 
commitment to follow through, not a cynical abrogation of those 
promises as quickly as possible.
<P>
	We have to look facts in the face in this country. The people 
who really call the shots are the Prime Minister, his advisers, 
and some members of the cabinet. The country is run by a very 
small group of people. That cannot be tolerated.
<P>
	Our own mother government of Britain, which our Canadian 
Parliament is modelled after, has had free votes where members 
are free to vote the wishes of their constituents and the members 
are not whipped into line by their parties. They have had that for 
over 20 years in Great Britain. Yet in this country we tolerate a 
small group of people who force their will, their agenda, their 
viewpoint on a whole country without proper and open debate.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	In a year and a half on critical bills, on bills that have long 
term consequences for the country, we have had debate stifled 
and cut off 10 times with many more to come. Why do we 
stand still as citizens for this sort of thing? Why do we not 
send a message to the Liberals who are governing the country 
that we simply will not tolerate this any more, that we will 
have open debate, that our elected representatives will have a 
chance to address the issues and get them out before the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12451"> 12451 </A></B>
<P>
public and will be free to then vote the way they know their 
constituents' interests are best fulfilled, best responded to and 
best served?
<P>
	It is absolutely critical we get serious about this whole area of 
how our democracy works. We all know the saying, and 
sometimes these sayings are so profound they have simply 
become trivial and commonplace to us, the price of freedom is 
constant vigilance.
<P>
	It is absolutely critical that in the rules of the House, the way 
we conduct ourselves and interact as parliamentarians upholds 
those high standards of democracy and representation are so 
much at the heart of what we hold dear.
<P>
	It is very important that Canadians listen to the debate today, 
recognize what we are trying to say, need to move toward more 
democratic measures. Many of my colleagues will be outlining 
exactly how these democratic measures will work in practice 
and in reality.
<P>
	Other stable mature democracies have many of the measures 
we have proposed for several years. Those democracies give so 
much more scope and respect to the real wishes of the people 
being served. It is important to recognize we do not want to be 
governed by a small group of people. We do not want to be 
governed by people who then force, coerce and impose their will 
on the rest of the country. Their viewpoint is often not anywhere 
close to what common sense people in the real world think and 
feel about issues.
<P>
	The foundations of the values and ethics that underlie much of 
what we have done in the country are being questioned, attacked 
and changed in ways we have to look at and debate.
<P>
	In Bill C-68 individual liberties we have held dear in the 
country for decades, since the founding of our country, are being 
abrogated. In debate this does not come out. This is not 
something we should take lightly.
<P>
	There are many things in the bills that come before Parliament 
that Canadians have a right to have brought out by the 
parliamentarians they have elected to represent their interests. 
They have a right to have those views endorsed in the votes in 
the House.
<P>
	When Canadians see a party or a government telling its 
members to vote the way they are told to by the top people in the 
organization or they will be sorry, punished and deprived of 
their right to have input into the proceedings of the House, it is 
time for Canadians to stand up and say: ``I don't think so. We 
will not have our country run that way. We will not vote for a 
party that will do these things. We will not support this way of 
running our affairs''.
<P>
	I appeal to Canadians today to watch this debate, listen to this 
debate, to do what has to be done to put their will forward so our 
country is run in a fair, open and democratic way, a way that 
serves our best interests both now and in the long term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems 
members at this end of the Chamber have very short memories.
<P>
	I have been very impressed with the concept of private 
members' bills. I have noticed even one of our members has 
been able to proceed with a private member's bill from its 
inception all the way through to legislation. I do not think that 
has happened for a long time in the House.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Once again, our memory is a little short. The member for 
Mission-Coquitlan recently had her own private members' bill 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	I have spoken to some of our legislative counsel and I have 
discovered that in Britain, the model of our Parliament, this 
system is very much undemocratic. The members do not have a 
lottery system like we have in the House. The individual 
member is picked and then formulates a bill.
<P>
	In that country the government uses its members to introduce 
government legislation rather than reaffirming the rights and 
independence of individual members.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on the relationship of 
introducing their own private members' bills and referring them 
to committee as part of our democratic and legislative process 
which is very real in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the country is not run on private 
members' bills. It is run by governments by their own 
legislation, by their own programs. Private members' bills have 
a minuscule impact on what happens in the country. It is good 
that we have the freedom to bring forward private members' 
bills. It is also to the credit of the House that sometimes common 
sense, workable proposals get through the House.
<P>
	Nobody ever said the system had no good things to it. Clearly 
it has many good things. However, it is important to remember 
there are critical areas in which this place is very undemocratic.
<P>
	I know the Liberals will point to the small things they see as 
being workable in the House, and well they should. What we 
really need to address are the big, gaping holes in the democratic 
workings which have to be fixed. I urge the member to look at 
what can be fixed, made better and what could be more 
democratic, rather than clinging to the very small pieces of 
wood in the ocean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. The member for Calgary 
North serves on the human resources development committee. 
It travelled extensively across Canada to look at reforms to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12452"> 12452 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's social programs and safety nets. This was with the 
support of the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	My understanding is that while there may have been some 
flaws in the process, the committee worked very hard travelling 
across Canada. Its work was totally ignored by the government.
<P>
	I would like to find out whether whether the member for 
Calgary North could confirm my suspicions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the process of consulting with 
Canadians whose interests are being served in these exercises is 
very important. Not only were ordinary Canadians virtually 
closed out of the consultation process, but even the 
recommendations from parliamentarians on the committee have 
yet to do anything but occupy a dusty shelf somewhere.
<P>
	It is a disgrace to pretend we are really seeking the best 
solutions when even recommendations from the government 
side and our own dissenting opinion on that report simply went 
nowhere.
<P>
	There is a long way to go before committees of the House 
really act like committees and deal with substantive issues and 
the recommendations are vigorously respected and put into 
place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud and honoured to 
participate in this debate, since our government's achievements 
in the last 18 months in terms of parliamentary reform, integrity, 
openness and fulfilment of our election promises are 
unprecedented in Canadian history.
<P>
	I think that the motion put forward by the Reform Party is 
rather contradictory with regard to our red book commitments to 
Canadians, which the Reform Party has been doing its utmost to 
oppose and derail without success day after day.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	In fact, there is nothing surprising about this, as the Reform 
Party is not afraid of contradictions. It has even become a kind 
of expert in this area. In the next few minutes, I will be pleased 
to list some of our achievements that have been instrumental in 
restoring Canadians' confidence in their national government.
<P>
	Since the motion refers to our red book, you will not be 
surprised, Mr. Speaker, to hear me refer to it throughout my 
speech in order to evaluate our government's performance. 
What did the red book say about parliamentary reform? Allow 
me to quote from page 92 of the red book: ``In the House of 
Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in 
drafting legislation, through House of Commons committees. 
These committees will also be given greater influence over 
government expenditures. More free votes will be allowed in the 
House of Commons, and individual members of Parliament will 
be involved in an effective pre-budget consultation process''.
<P>
	What did we do in this regard? We introduced two new 
processes in addition to the one already in place allowing MPs to 
consider bills, so that members can become directly involved in 
drafting legislation and enjoy greater autonomy in amending 
government bills through the committee system.
<P>
	The first process consists in the government tabling a bill at 
first reading and then, after a maximum three hour debate 
followed by a vote if necessary, referring it to a committee 
before second reading instead of after, and before agreement in 
principle. This allows the committees to hold extensive hearings 
and to amend bills without being restricted by the need for an 
agreement in principle following debate at second reading.
<P>
	As a result, the committees can propose major amendments to 
the bills. Our government used this new process four times, 
including for the lobbyists registration bill. The second process 
consists in allowing a minister or a member of Parliament to 
table a motion directing a committee to draft a bill on an issue 
concerning private members' business. That process was used in 
the case of Bill C-69, the legislation dealing with the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The government, through the Standing Committee on 
Finance, also conducted the largest prebudget consultation ever 
held in Canada, something which will be done before every 
budget. Thanks to this consultation exercise, the government 
was able to not only involve MPs, but all Canadians in the 
federal budgetary process. Members of Parliament, through the 
standing committees, now review, on a yearly basis, the 
government's future spending priorities, in addition to 
examining the main estimates for the current year.
<P>
	A number of debates also take place in the House of 
Commons, during which MPs can freely express their views on 
major issues, before the government makes a final decision. For 
example, I can mention the debates on Canada's peacekeepers in 
the former Yugoslavia, sustainable development, the social 
program reform, small and medium size businesses, fiscal 
policy, violence against women, and many other upcoming 
topics.
<P>
	Through our committees, we also reviewed the major reforms 
to Canada's foreign and defence policies, immigration and 
social programs.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	What was the Reform Party's position regarding these 
parliamentary reforms? The hon. member for Lethbridge 
actually thanked the government, on behalf of his party, for 
providing such a wide scale program.
<P>
	He went even farther. Indeed, he added that the Reform 
Party was also pleased that the proposals to be submitted to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12453"> 12453 </A></B>
<P>
deal with a large number of issues which his party feels are 
important to ensure a reform of the parliamentary process. 
These comments are not from me; they were made by the 
Reform member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	To fully understand the position adopted by the Reform Party 
during the debate on parliamentary reform, let us take a look at 
what the leader of that party, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest had to say about our proposals. He said that, 
generally speaking, these changes seek to allow MPs to play a 
major role in the development of private members' public bills 
and the government's fiscal policy, adding that this was a 
definite improvement. Again, these comments were made by the 
Reform Party leader.
<P>
	Members of the Liberal caucus vote freely as regards private 
members' business. For example, last night, a private member's 
bill was referred to a committee, after going through second 
reading in the House.
<P>
	As for government business, the Reform Party would like to 
see more free votes. Yet, as the NDP member for Winnipeg 
Transcona said, in the final analysis, there is not one single 
member in this House who cannot vote freely and differently 
than his or her party or leader, any time he or she chooses to do 
so.
<P>
	It is therefore surprising to hear the Reform Party-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> If they do not want to lose their positions in 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> The Reform Party came to this place to restore 
decorum and when its members do not like what they hear they 
heckle. That is the decorum they bring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You had better read that to the three 
members you kicked off the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am listening to the House 
leader of the Reform Party. He does not seem to want to listen to 
my speech. That is what he calls decorum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is astonishing that the Reform Party, where block voting by 
members is the rule in most votes in the House, should demand 
more free votes and at the same time, as we see in the motion 
before the House today, demand that we honour our 
commitments to the electorate as set out in the red book.
<P>
	If Reform Party members were consistent, they would support 
our proposals to reform the pension plan for members of 
Parliament, since they go much further than what we promised 
in the red book.
<P>
	What was promised in the red book? We promised to set a 
minimum age at which pensions will begin to be paid, and I will 
quote what it says in the red book: ``A Liberal government will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end 
``double dipping''. That is what it says in the red book.
<P>
	So what did we do? The President of the Treasury Board 
tabled a bill in the House that would not only set the minimum 
eligible age at 55 but would also stop double dipping and, on top 
of that, cut the government's contribution by 33 per cent, which 
means a saving of $3.3 million.
<P>
	We went well beyond our commitments, so what was the 
Reform Party's contribution? Yesterday, it used the very same 
strategy it condemned this morning, and did so every five 
minutes. Every five minutes, Reform Party members asked for a 
quorum. They stayed behind the curtains before prayers to 
prevent the House from sitting, since there were not enough 
members to start the debate. Is that what they want to talk about? 
In any case, that is their strategy.
<P>
	They have repeatedly wasted the time of the House by moving 
an adjournment motion that was unnecessary. If they want to 
speak, if they want to have a debate, let them use the time of the 
House by speaking to the subject at hand instead of moving 
dilatory motions.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	That is the new decorum Reform Party members have brought 
to the House of Commons. They criticized and are still 
criticizing our position on pension reform for parliamentarians. 
And what did the whip suggest? Or should I say caucus 
coordinator, as we used to call them. A 130 per cent increase in 
members' salaries. This is embarrassing, and it certainly takes a 
lot of nerve. Trust the Reform Party to make that kind of 
proposal! Now that is poor judgment, although not surprising, 
coming from a party that speaks for organizations like the 
National Citizens' Coalition.
<P>
	Since we are on the subject of cutting costs, I may recall, 
through you, Mr. Speaker, that in the red book we promised, and 
I quote; ``A Liberal government will reduce the size and budgets 
of ministers' offices and the Prime Minister's office by at least 
$10 million a year''. This was done, and it was the first thing the 
Prime Minister did when he was elected.
<P>
	We went even further. We proposed cuts in spending by 
members. In the process, we saved another $6 million annually. 
This was not even in the red book. Everyone remembers the plan 
to cut members' expense allowances and benefits. We tightened 
up the way parliamentary associations operate and the rules for 
domestic travel by parliamentarians. We also have a plan for 
reducing the deficit of parliamentary restaurant services, and 
there are several more examples of cost cutting.
<P>
	In the red book, we also discussed integrity and openness in 
government. That is why last June, the Prime Minister 
proceeded with the appointment of an ethics counsellor. This 
was accompanied by further clarification and stricter 
implemen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12454"> 12454 </A></B>
<P>
tation of the conflict of interest code for public office holders, 
which for the first time will extend to activities by family 
members.
<P>
	We tabled a bill to reinforce the Lobbyists Registration Act, 
which would include the authority to order disclosure of fees 
paid to lobbyists to obtain government contracts and banning the 
inclusion of conditional fees in contracts with the government.
<P>
	Last week, my colleague, the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons, moved to create a joint committee to work 
on establishing a code of conduct. After one day of debate, this 
motion could have been adopted and, today, the committee 
could already be at work examining the issue. But what 
prevented his motion from being adopted after that debate? 
Once again, the Reform Party, and, this morning, it is they who 
are trying to preach to us about public ethics.
<P>
	What did the red book say on this issue? I quote: ``To enshrine 
these principles and commitments, we will develop a Code of 
Conduct for Public Officials to guide Cabinet ministers, 
members of Parliament, senators, political staff, and public 
servants in their dealings with lobbyists. We will also take 
measures to better regulate the activities of lobbyists, 
particularly in the awarding of government contracts''. Once 
again, to the detriment of the Reformers, we kept our promise.
<P>
	These days, the Reformers are raising a ruckus regarding two 
bills: the bill on gun control and Bill C-41, regarding 
sentencing, especially for hate crimes.
<P>
	Since the Reformers demand that we meet our red book 
commitments, why are they against these two bills? This is what 
their logic boils down to: They accuse us of not meeting our 
commitments, yet, when we draft bills in order to meet them, 
they oppose them. Furthermore, they use all of the 
parliamentary antics in the book to obstruct their passage. These 
are red book promises.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	On page 84 of the red book, it says: ``To strengthen gun 
control, a Liberal government will, among other measures, 
counter the illegal importation of banned and restricted firearms 
into Canada and prohibit anyone convicted of an indictable 
drug-related offence, a stalking offence, or any violent offence 
from owning or possessing a gun''. Once again, we, ourselves, 
have respected our commitments.
<P>
	What about what is said in the red book, and I quote: ``Every 
person has a right to personal security, and a Liberal government 
will move to protect that right. Particular attention must be paid 
to those who today, by virtue of gender, race, religion, age, or 
sexual orientation, are more likely to be targets of violent 
crime''. Yet again, they are opposed.
<P>
	Of course, I could go on for hours listing all the 
commitments we have already fulfilled after only 18 months 
in government, but I think we have hit at the heart of the 
matter right now. Why have Canadians regained confidence in 
themselves, in the country and in their government? It is very 
simple. We got down to work, we honoured our commitments 
and we showed  Canadians how things were, without trying to 
hide the truth for short term political gains.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party, we believe in democratic 
institutions and in the devotion of members elected to serve 
their constituents and their country. Although we feel that our 
institutions must change and improve at some point, we have 
faith in our democratic institutions, unlike the Reform Party, 
which never stops denigrating and mocking the work of 
members.
<P>
	Furthermore, when the members of the Reform Party arrived 
in Ottawa, they thought all they had to do was sweet talk 
Canadians, who would simply allow themselves to be lulled to 
sleep. Who can forget the dramatic moment staged by the leader 
of the Reform Party, with great pomp, when he called a news 
conference in front of the doors of Parliament and handed the car 
keys to the driver telling him to return them to wherever he got 
them, as he himself had no need for them. The cynicism, does 
not stop here, however, because, following this public 
demonstration of disdain, we discover that the leader of the 
Reform Party has a car and a driver paid for by the Reform Party 
through a funding campaign, which, with tax reductions, is still 
paid for by taxpayers' money, once again by the back door.
<P>
	I will never forget that the word, during the election 
campaign, was that practices here had to be changed. The hon. 
members were going to come and show us how to do things. 
They were coming here to establish order. Yet, the first thing the 
leader of the Reform Party did when they got here was complain 
about the size of his office, he wanted an office bigger than the 
one allotted to the leader of a third party. He felt that members 
got a lot for nothing. Suddenly they discovered that the 
sandwiches in the parliamentary cafeteria cost more than in 
their ridings. That was the bottom line. Those who want to 
lecture us today have got it all backwards-it is total hypocrisy.
<P>
	I could go on, but I see, Mr. Speaker, that my time is running 
out. In closing, what can I say about the motion by the hon. 
member of the Reform Party for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
today?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the minister's time is 
up. The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, on questions or 
comments.
<P>
	I beg your pardon. I must now give the floor to a member of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were several errors in the member's 
speech. In fact most of it was a total inaccuracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12455"> 12455 </A></B>
<P>
	I will very quickly respond to the fact that the leader of the 
Reform Party refused the car and the chauffeur and still refuses 
them. His party allowance is not paid by taxpayers. It is the 
same allowance he received prior to the election. Nothing has 
changed. It was much more responsible than the fat allowances 
the Prime Minister receives from his party outside of caucus 
funds.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The member has been around here a long time and should be 
more responsible than to make such foolish, ridiculous 
statements in the House. Some of the comments he made with 
regard to our leader are degrading to this House.
<P>
	The hon. member commented on the dilatory motions made 
yesterday. Yesterday we were debating our own compensation 
package in the way of MPs pensions. On many occasions there 
were only two Liberals sitting in the Chamber while Reformers 
were debating the issue on legislation the Liberals had put 
forward. I believe it is beneath the dignity of members of 
Parliament to come to this House to debate and challenge the 
government on its own legislation and the Liberals do not even 
have their people here to respond to the debate. They do not care. 
I think they were embarrassed about the legislation. They were 
not here to defend it.
<P>
	We thought it was beneath the dignity of this House to speak 
to an empty Chamber. We called quorum to try get the members 
from the government side to come in and hear what we were 
saying. They continually refused. Eventually we asked that the 
debate be adjourned on the government orders of the day 
because they simply were not interested in defending their 
blatant fat MP pension plan.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister would deal directly with the facts on 
this issue rather than these meaningless platitudes that have no 
relation to what is actually happening in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, it shows that the truth hurts when 
it is brought forth.
<P>
	Let me address the question about yesterday. I am surprised. 
The member is the Reform House leader. He should know 
exactly where the members are when they are not in the 
Chamber. There are a number of committees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They were hiding back there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> He is heckling. That is the new decorum. That 
is what they came here for. They came here for the decorum. 
Again, the member impugns that I am not telling the truth. That 
is the new decorum they have brought to the House.
<P>
	Members who are not in the House are in committee and doing 
other work. The House leader for Reform should say that when 
that motion was moved to adjourn the debate yesterday Reform 
had no more speakers. It was just half an hour before the time 
allocated for government orders of the day would have ended.
<P>
	Instead of allowing the normal process for passage of 
legislation, Reform moved a dilatory motion which took a 
30-minute bell. When the vote was finished we moved to other 
business. It was not to pass the bill. It was to send the bill to 
committee. They did not want witnesses to come before the 
committee and express their views. That is how they see 
parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	There is something that I did not have time to say in my 
speech and this gives me the opportunity. It concerns time 
allocation. Reformers forget that the last time the government 
moved time allocation it was during the labour strike and it was 
supported by the Reform Party. They cannot have it both ways. 
They want to have their cake and eat it too.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue that was raised is a very serious one, but I will 
expand on it later on. However, the Secretary of State for 
Parliamentary Affairs mentioned a number of things the 
government is supposed to have done.
<P>
	I think you really have to be as bold as brass to make certain 
statements. I will not consider each and everyone because I 
would not have enough time, but I must say I was struck by a 
reference to the so-called new procedure for expanding the role 
played by members in this House and in committee, and my 
comments will be based on my own experience.
<P>
	You referred to Bill C-43, to amend the Lobbyists 
Registration Act. I was a diligent representative of the Bloc on 
this committee, so I think I can speak from experience.
<P>
	It is all very well to introduce new procedures in the House, 
give the impression that the government is more open and refer 
the bill, after first reading, to committee so that it can be 
amended on the basis of information obtained by members in 
committee, but in practice it does not work out that way. In 
practice, the minister responsible for this question or the bill 
comes and tell the committee what to do. In this committee on 
Bill C-43, the opposition presented 20 amendments to provide 
more transparency. All 20 were rejected. So what is the 
difference? The difference is that the minister told us what to do 
before the hearings began.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Is that the new procedure? Is that what the Liberals are 
bragging about? I think it takes a lot of nerve to come and say 
that this morning, and what is worse, say it with a straight face.
<P>
	I think that if the hon. member bothered to look at what is 
really happening he would realize that basically nothing has 
changed. And that is why people are so upset. He said 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12456"> 12456 </A></B>
<P>
something very significant to the Reform Party. He said that 
you cannot change people's impressions with window 
dressing. And as member of the Bloc Quebecois, I am 
certainly not the one to tell the  hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard and Secretary of State how to do this. They are 
past masters at the art of giving the impression they are doing 
something.
<P>
	That was only about this particular question, but I could 
repeat all the examples he gave and prove that he was not talking 
about the real situation. I wish that in other cases he would 
reconcile what was done with what they promised in the red 
book, which said that as part of parliamentary reform, they 
would expand the role of members in developing legislation, 
through-
<P>
	Yes, that is what they did, that is what they gave the 
impression of doing, but basically, nothing has changed. The 
minister controls government members in committee, although 
the membership keeps changing, but in any case, this is an insult 
to the public's intelligence. I would appreciate the hon. 
member's comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will let this pass because I 
realize that in the past few weeks the Bloc and its head office in 
Quebec City have changed course so abruptly that people say 
they are suffering from whiplash, but enough.
<P>
	My comments will only concern Bill C-43, and I want to 
thank the hon. member for bringing it up. Obviously, he could 
not present 20 amendments and expect the government to accept 
every single opposition amendment. If the hon. member would 
listen, he would get an answer to his question. We approved two 
opposition amendments in this bill, the first time this ever 
happened in the 11 years I have been here. And he tells me it is 
just window dressing, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	As for the rest of what it says in the red book, if he listened 
carefully to my speech, I explained exactly how we improved 
and changed the members' role and gave it particular 
significance since the 1983 election. And I think that as for 
changing one's position and being able to say something with a 
straight face, we have a lot to learn from the Bloc because they 
do it every day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Considering the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs is 
the only member of the cabinet here, could we extend the time 
for questions and comments for another five minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. House leader will know that 
he is not to make comments about the presence or absence of 
members. All members are bound by that rule.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to permit this period of questions 
and comments to continue for five minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The whip should know that whenever it 
is possible, the Chair will recognize members from other parties 
in questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment simply on this debate. I am very much in 
agreement with what my colleague for Berthier-Montcalm had 
to say about the role of members.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	When we are told that members have been given more 
responsibilities on committees, we must not lose sight of the 
fact that committees are led by the majority and are simply 
advisory. On the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs, of which I am a member, we made motions at 
one point for the very purpose of transparency. We simply 
proposed that, in the future, the provinces be consulted about 
appointments to the board. The motion was defeated by 
government members.
<P>
	There was talk earlier of free votes. However, recently again, 
during the debate on gun control at second reading, the two or 
three Liberals who dared to vote against were expelled from 
their committee. So, I would like to know what will happen to 
these members if they vote against their government again, at 
third reading?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, as regards the hon. member's 
first question, his complaint that the committee comprises a 
majority of government members, he should know, after 18 
months, that the committees reflect the make-up of the House. 
Accordingly, since the government has a majority of seats in the 
House, it has a majority on the committees.
<P>
	The member said that committees have an advisory role. On 
the contrary, committees almost always have amendments to the 
bills the House sends them. After consideration, these bills 
return to the House with a number of amendments. I have just 
answered his colleague on the particular matter of a bill he spoke 
to me about, and which we even accepted. Not only did we agree 
to amendments by government members, but we agreed to 
amendments by opposition members.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that parliamentary reform is not only on 
paper, but in the day to day work we do. There are members' 
bills that have received royal assent and become law. So I think 
we are clearly making an effort. We have been in government for 
only 18 months and we have implemented many of our 
parliamentary reforms. Other reforms are required and a 
committee of the House is looking into procedure and House 
affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12457"> 12457 </A></B>
<P>
	All of the parties are represented on it, and if the hon. member 
has some suggestions to make, let him make them instead of 
simply criticizing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
we are supposed to be debating the government's promise to be 
more open, to have more open government, and to allow MPs to 
be more accountable to their constituents. Is it not sad that we 
have to use the word allow?
<P>
	What we have from the hon. minister are simply diversionary 
tactics. We have a real attempt to divert attention from the real 
issue which Canadians are concerned about. The biggest 
diversionary tactic is to attack the messenger, to say things 
about the Reform Party which dared to bring the subject up. 
They are the most pejorative and outright fabrications to distort 
our position on a number of issues and suggest that we have no 
reason to even bring up the issue in the House.
<P>
	I appeal to the minister to at least stick to the facts when he is 
talking about these kinds of issues. Some of the things which he 
said about our party and about our positions are just not true. 
Canadians are going to find out one of these days that this is a 
tactic of this government and it will lose its credibility 
altogether.
<P>
	We heard from the minister a highly edited version of the 
Liberal record. We disagreed with a lot of the promises which 
the Liberals made. If we agreed with them we would not be here, 
we would all be on the other side. During the election these 
people took certain positions and promised to do certain things. 
They have totally reversed themselves. They are totally 
untrustworthy in a whole number of areas.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the member about the document he authored and 
signed reviving parliamentary democracy. This document was 
so good, it would put in so many measures that would have been 
to the benefit of Canadians, to the democratic system that we are 
trying to operate under.
<P>
	The member holds a senior position in the government. He is 
one of the decision makers. He said that in order to enhance the 
independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the level of 
partisanship when the speakers are from the government party, 
two of the junior chair officers should be from the opposition so 
that the four presiding officer positions are shared equally by 
government and opposition. I would like to ask the minister to 
explain why he has not implemented his own recommendation 
in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised with the 
member's statement.
<P>
	Reform Party members come to the House and accuse the 
government of not keeping its promises, of turning face and 
everything.
<P>
	When we try to respond and if they do not like the response, it 
is a question of debate. Naturally as members of the Reform or 
any other members in the House, they can point to the 
government for what they do not like. We also we have a right as 
government members to point out what they said during the 
election.
<P>
	In case there are any specific things that I said that are not 
true, that the Reform Party did not do, whatever I said is on the 
public record. Those she can point out to me in specific terms.
<P>
	Concerning the document that I co-authored with the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands and two other members, if 
she had listened to my speech, she would have heard me say that 
most of the reforms we made came from that document.
<P>
	In only 18 months, 90 per cent of the commitments in that 
document have been kept. A term of government is four or five 
years. Maybe the member should place some hope in this 
institution. Maybe she could wait and in due time see the other 
10 per cent of that document.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am certain that my colleagues opposite are very 
happy to see me rise to speak on this motion. But, to understand 
the turn of events today, I think that we have to clearly define 
what we mean by all this, so I am going to refer to the motion of 
the third party in this House.
<P>
	The motion is the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its failure to keep its Red 
Book promise to make the government more open and permitting Members of 
Parliament to be more accountable to their constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, there are two parts to this motion. The second is to permit 
Members of Parliament to be more accountable to their 
constituents. I will now say a few words on the subject.
<P>
	Accountability depends on each Member of Parliament. We 
have enough means these days to write to our constituents, to let 
them know the government's positions and to transmit 
information. We all have the necessary tools. I think that, as the 
representatives of a riding, we could do a better job of informing 
our electorate of the work we are doing.
<P>
	I can say, for my part anyway, that I write to my constituents 
regularly to keep them up to date on the decisions made by the 
Bloc Quebecois or to comment on, among other things, 
decisions made by the government. We already have the means 
to do this. There is no need, regarding this point, to heap more 
blame on the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12458"> 12458 </A></B>
<P>
	However, regarding the first point, which condemns the 
government for not having kept its famous red book promise to 
make the administration more transparent, we would like to say 
the following: The Liberals are crafty. They saw, during their 
nine years in opposition, that integrity struck a chord with the 
public. Therefore, they brought certain campaign promises 
contained in the red book to the public's attention. Fortunately 
they are written down, because words fade away but written 
statements endure-we can still read them today.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, the famous red book did contain a nice, little chapter, 
entitled ``Governing with Integrity''. I would like to say that I 
am fortunate to be speaking after the secretary of state. I can see 
what he thinks was done to restore integrity in government, 
because, otherwise, I would not have known what to say on that 
topic in my speech. What the government just said is 
incomplete, almost exaggerated. They did not tell the whole 
truth.
<P>
	As I was saying, they greatly stressed integrity during the 
election campaign. I think that they put their finger on the 
problem, they saw that people want their parliamentarians to be 
more accountable, that they want Parliament to be more 
transparent, so that they can know what is going on here.
<P>
	After 19 months-because they have already been in office 
that long-I would like to summarize their administration's 
actions. And you will see that there is a clear difference between 
what they think they have achieved and what we think they have 
achieved. It is funny how outlooks change, depending on 
whether one is seated to the left or the right of the Chair. That is 
the truth, sad, but true.
<P>
	The secretary of state for parliamentary affairs stressed one 
point because, it would seem that it is a revelation of the 
government, the discovery of the century: the famous ethics 
counsellor. That is just peachy. How much more open can you 
get? An ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime Minister, an 
ethics counsellor who will investigate matters involving 
ministers behind closed doors, which directly contradicts what 
the red book said about ensuring openness. An ethics counsellor 
who will only comment on the conclusions of his investigation. 
This is openness? This is how this government plans to restore 
confidence and ensure openness? What a crock!
<P>
	They also wanted people to think more highly of the role of 
MPs. As I commented on this earlier, I will not spend any more 
time on this but the fact remains that it is an utter failure. 
Nothing has changed. The minister is still the boss, telling 
Liberal committee chairs what to do. The more things change, 
the more they stay the same.
<P>
	They also say that there will eventually be a code of conduct 
for MPs, ministers, senior officials, etc. If one can tell the future 
by looking at the past, we can expect more of the same. We will 
continue to hear nice promises, wishful thinking and 
rose-coloured rhetoric. In the end, the objective of openness 
will not be achieved.
<P>
	Another even more subtle approach of this government is to 
table bills in which the powers are increasingly centralized at 
the minister's level. More and more, the minister must be the 
absolute master in his department. More and more-but quietly 
so that the public is kept in the dark-, they are changing the 
rules of the game through complicated laws and regulations, but 
it is the minister who will have the final say. It is the minister 
who will make the appointments and allocate the funds. What 
openness! In my opinion, this opens the door to patronage, to 
political appointments.
<P>
	Speaking of political appointments, what has this Liberal 
government done in the last 18 months to change the situation 
that existed under the Tories? Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I remember that, in 1984, the Tories defeated the Liberals 
because of a rash of appointments. During the famous leaders' 
debate, John Turner looked rather foolish indeed. Yet, the Tories 
did exactly the same thing for nine years. Today, after the 1993 
election, what are the Liberals doing? Exactly the same thing as 
the Tories did and the Liberals had done before them. The more 
things change, the more they stay the same. ``Partisan 
appointments, partisan appointments, partisan appointments'' 
has replaced ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. This contradicts the red book 
but do the Liberals care?
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	As we have seen, the news is full of similar situations in which 
members of the Liberal ``family'' have received preferential 
treatment. That is Liberal openness for you. Let me give you a 
few examples of political appointments. I am not saying that 
none of these people is qualified, but when we see that everyone 
appointed by this openness-seeking government is a Liberal, we 
may well ask ourselves if only Liberals are considered as 
qualified. Perhaps according to the hon. members across the 
way, but I do not think so.
<P>
	Here are a few examples: Jean-Robert Gauthier, a former 
Liberal MP, was appointed to the Senate; John Bryden was 
also appointed to the Senate, and what did this gentleman use 
to do? He was one of Mr. Chrétien's campaign organizers in 
the leadership race, another good Liberal. Robert Nixon, 
Liberal Party president also on the Chrétien campaign team. 
He was appointed to a department. Here is another one: 
Michel Robert, past president of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
We know he was acting president of the SIRC, dealing with 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. As we all know, 
as a sideline he was involved in negotiations with aboriginal 
people. He has apparently billed the government 
approximately $300,000 for his services so far and, today, we 
learn that he was appointed appellate judge. He is no doubt 
qualified, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12459"> 12459 </A></B>
<P>
he has one quality in common with the others: he is a Liberal. 
Another well-known Liberal according to the press, Pierre 
Dalphond, was also appointed judge.
<P>
	There is a whole list of individuals who ran in the 1993 
campaign who were appointed to various positions. Is that the 
way to ensure transparency? Is that it, when, every time we dig 
somewhere, we find party ties? When a government claims to 
seek openness and to enhance politicians' credibility, should its 
ultimate goal be to appoint ``chums''?
<P>
	Just in case we do not get reelected, we better treat our friends 
now, while we are riding the gravy train. Is that the way to 
restore the confidence of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers? I 
think not. We are aware of very recent cases. Liberals, 
Conservatives, it is all the same damn thing. Oops, my 
apologies, that word is unparliamentary. It is all one and the 
same. The Liberals are doing the exact same thing as the 
Conservatives did.
<P>
	Take the Pearson deal. I can understand that the Liberals who 
are listening would be embarrassed. In the Pearson deal, as we 
found out, there were as many Liberal lobbyists as Conservative 
lobbyists. No wonder that the Liberals do not want to raise too 
much dust around this issue. Then there was the Dupuy matter. It 
had several stages, but I will focus on the first two. The first one 
was the minister's interference in CRTC business, and the 
second, his little trip on the sly to Los Angeles. Upon looking 
into it more closely, one realizes that this may be a family thing, 
that the Prime Minister's son-in-law may be involved, that 
subsidiaries were involved, and so on.
<P>
	In the Power Direct TV deal, direct ties can be made to the 
Liberal clique. One could even say the Liberal ``famiglia'' in 
this case, where an order was made specifically to benefit a 
company run by the Prime Minister's son-in-law. It takes some 
doing. Billions of dollars are involved. Is that what this 
government means by openness?
<P>
	Here is another example: the bovine somatotropin issue. The 
Minister of Health is implicated in this and she never knows 
what is going on in her own department. Mr. Ritter, an official of 
this department took a leave of absence to lobby his colleagues 
and have the BST approved.
<P>
	This does not strike the minister as odd. She sees nothing 
wrong with this. This must be what Liberals call openness. She 
must be right, so there is no problem. No problem.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	We can never get the facts about the tainted blood scandal. We 
have been asking questions for months regarding this issue. 
Canadians and Quebecers are dying because blood supplies were 
not properly handled. These are very important issues. We ask 
questions, but we do not get answers. We are told: ``Do not 
worry; a commissioner will make a decision and then we will 
take action''. In the meantime, people are dying. Is this what we 
call transparency, Mr. Speaker? Is that what this government 
had to offer to Canadians and Quebecers? I do not think so.
<P>
	Earlier, the secretary of state alluded to the CN strike. We 
spent a whole weekend saying that the minister was using 
strong-arm tactics on workers to eventually be able to privatize 
CN. We were told: ``No, no. You are wrong. The government is 
not trying to break the union''. Fine. But then, what do we learn 
a few weeks later? We learn that the government wants to 
privatize CN. We learn that it wants to sell part of Canada's 
heritage, because CN is truly a part of our heritage. Yet, we were 
told that we were mistaken. This is probably what the 
government calls transparency.
<P>
	I will give one last example, but there are many more. The 
Charles R. Bronfman Foundation. We just learned, thanks to the 
Access to Information Act, that this great foundation, which 
extols the virtues of Canada by promoting Canadian heritage in 
its ``heritage minutes'' on TV, and which received a $200,000 
government subsidy for the year 1992-93, will get $2 million 
this year. If you look a little more closely, you discover that one 
party involved is a person by the name of Tom Axworthy. That 
person must be a good lobbyist to get a tenfold, or 1,000 per 
cent, increase in the government subsidy. This is either a good 
lobbyist, or else the brother of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. We checked and discovered that it is the latter.
<P>
	When people look at all this, they realize that things have not 
changed. This is why we want transparency. We want to improve 
the credibility of MPs and their work. All the parties should set 
aside their political differences and work together to come up 
with a good bill. This is what the Bloc tried to do on several 
occasions. However, the amendments we proposed were always 
rejected by the government. Are we always in the wrong? I think 
not. We too hear from our constituents. Then, why is that 
happening? Simply because this government is no better than 
the previous one. It is only somewhat more discreet. It uses a 
thicker smoke screen than the Conservatives did. However, if 
you dig a little, you see exactly the same things.
<P>
	I will close by saying that I think the Liberal Party should take 
a hard look at the transparency of its administration. It should 
really reread its elections promises and its famous red book and 
look at what it has actually done. I think it will draw useful 
conclusions that will enable it to take better aim, because it 
needs to take better aim.
<P>
	In conclusion, therefore, if I had to decide or vote on this 
motion, I would be for the first part and against the second.
<P>
	Finally, with a message for government perhaps as well-I 
almost forgot this point-I wanted to say that we in the Bloc 
Quebecois, the official opposition, wanted to introduce a bill 
here to increase transparency with regard to the funding of 
political parties, and it would have been given the same 
unanimous support across Canada it is now being given in 
Quebec. I think Parliament must acquire such a tool to 
provide for transparency in its  administration. You know, 
each year, when we look at the list of individuals contributing 
to one or other political party, we realize that there are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12460"> 12460 </A></B>
<P>
individuals and companies-at the federal level, companies 
may make contributions-making contributions of $15,000 or 
$25,000. Immediately, the question comes to mind: ``What do 
they want in return?''
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I think that, if we had legislation governing party funding, a 
law on the public funding of parties, we would avoid 
governments having their hands and feet tied once they are 
elected. We would thus limit contributions, as in Quebec, to 
$5,000 and we would limit contributions only to voters, 
constituents. We would avoid having companies taking power 
and control, as is the case currently with the Liberal Party, 
whose head office is Power Corporation. We just have to look at 
the legislation being passed here to see that everything is done in 
terms of this company. This would really prevent the kind of 
business currently going on.
<P>
	This is what we introduced. The government often tells us that 
the opposition is always criticizing, but never comes up with 
anything. We presented a bill from the Bloc Quebecois, from the 
member for Richelieu. What did the Liberals do? They voted 
against it-go figure-even though it was directly related to a 
very large part of the red book on the subject of integrity. We 
were giving them the opportunity to achieve something they 
were not achieving, something they were sidestepping. But, no, 
they voted against it.
<P>
	All this is to say that nothing has changed since the 
Conservatives left. The same thing is going on. I think the 
secretary of state is deceiving us when he says that voters' 
confidence has increased. Quite sincerely, I think that the 
Liberal Party and each of its members here in this House have 
broken a large number of their election promises. Quite 
sincerely, I think that these Liberals have betrayed the 
confidence of this House in this regard and I find it most 
regrettable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened with strong interest to the 
debate of the official opposition and the third party. A number of 
good points were brought forward by them. A lot of them were 
idealistic in nature.
<P>
	I will deal first with the last speaker. Certainly the party that 
wins on a platform and presents to the public a platform which is 
general in nature sets a direction. Like everything else in the 
world directions are not always achieved. Some are beyond the 
capability of government. Some reassess and set other priorities 
in their place. The world is always changing; that is the only 
constant we know.
<P>
	It is disappointing when some things are not done which we 
want to see done. Governments of all types are not perfect. At 
the same time there is an intrinsic nature on the part of the 
government to try to do the best it can for the country. It is 
difficult. I have wrestled with it myself as a member. When do 
we represent our constituents and when do we really know that 
we are representing our constituents?
<P>
	I held six town hall meetings every six months in my riding. I 
get turnouts of 70 to 500 people. However I do not get a 
consistent message at each one of the meetings. I believe the 
only time we would ever get some reality is if we had a little 
buzzer in every home to vote for or against. Then we would truly 
know how the constituents felt.
<P>
	We can understand at some stage the reality of the situation. 
We can understand at some stage the reality that there are large 
lobby groups and there are small lobby groups. This is the 
reality we face. Those of us who are new come in with a tabula 
rasa. We feel we can make great changes. It is like trying to turn 
the <I>Queen Mary</I> with a 10-horsepower motor boat. It is very 
difficult to change the inertia because the country is so complex 
and the machinery of government is so massive.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	We try to bring back what we hear through our caucuses. The 
reality is we are not always hearing the same thing in every 
riding across Canada. It disturbs me to hear the senior member 
of the Bloc Quebecois lecture the government on appointments. 
We have just seen perhaps the most wholesale changing, kicking 
out, firing and replacement of people in the history of 
government in Quebec when the Parti Quebecois took over.
<P>
	We can speak with credibility if we have an example, but if we 
do not have an example we have to apologize in some cases for 
errors made in government. There will be many errors in years 
to come, but we cannot stop trying to make it better. We cannot 
stop trying to pick up on the good ideas presented in the House 
and putting them into action.
<P>
	I believe sincerely that we should try our best. Adjustments 
are always made to a platform. There has never been a 
government elected that could live by every nail in its platform. 
Sometimes some of the planks have to be taken out of the 
platform and be repriorized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, first off, I would like to 
say to my colleague that we are members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, not the Parti Quebecois as he incorrectly said. 
There is a difference. Second, just because other parties make 
mistakes does not mean that the government should repeat 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12461"> 12461 </A></B>
<P>
them. I think that goes without saying. We must improve the 
situation, and sometimes that requires drawing up a balance 
sheet.
<P>
	I do not want to compare one government to another. I am a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, a federal party, and my role is to 
criticize what the federal government, the Liberal government 
does. I can understand, however, certain points made by the 
Liberal member. It is true that promises can be made in the heat 
of an election campaign which a government will realize, once it 
gets into office, that it cannot fulfil because certain things have 
changed in the meanwhile.
<P>
	Therefore, why not simply say, in all honesty: ``We are sorry, 
we cannot attain the goal we set regarding parliamentary reform, 
for x number of reasons''? And not do what the Liberals are 
currently doing: Clinging desperately to the goal they set in the 
red book, inventing a story to give people the impression that 
they have done something. This lacks integrity and perpetuates 
the lack of transparency in this House.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, the Liberals reign supreme in the art 
of making it look like they are doing something, while, in 
reality, they are doing absolutely nothing. I have said it once and 
will say it again, there is room for improvement in the area of 
transparency and also in the area of listening to the opposition, 
because we are right on several issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous 
consent to delete Standing Order 78 from the Standing Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am only hesitating because I am not 
sure we can do that. I am told we can do anything by unanimous 
consent but let me consult.
<P>
	The member is correct that by unanimous consent the House 
can do anything. The House can delete a standing order. Is there 
unanimous consent to delete the standing order mentioned by 
the hon. member for Red Deer?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the point has 
been made regarding this issue. We are hearing today the 
involvement in the House, the frustration of being in this place 
and trying to present an honest point of view from constituents; 
the total frustration I am sure the backbench on the government 
side and the opposition side have with representing what people 
stand for and what they tell us when no one is listening. That is 
what the electorate feels as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, virtue is undeniably a great 
thing. I agree with my hon. colleague to some extent. I agree that 
the government should listen more carefully to the 
representations made by members of this House on major issues, 
such as the ones the secretary of state listed as part of the 
so-called positive record of the government for the first 18 or 19 
months of its mandate.
<P>
	We agreed in principle with certain bills introduced by the 
Liberals. It is just that we wanted to improve them. It is most 
unfortunate that the government did not listen more closely to 
the representations and remarks made by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a former member of the House of Commons, Dr. Lorne 
Greenaway, had great respect in his constituency of 
Cariboo-Chilcotin. He ran into some difficulties with his party 
and out of conscience resigned his seat.
<P>
	Subsequently he was appointed to the B.C. treaty 
commission. With his understanding of aboriginal issues and his 
concern for just settlements for all, he performed outstanding 
service in that capacity as one of the original commissioners of 
the B.C. treaty commission.
<P>
	I am sorry to say Dr. Greenaway was fired. This is the darker 
side of patronage appointments. Dr. Greenaway was fired so 
there would be room for someone else. I make no comment 
about the person who took his place. However, a valuable 
member who had great respect in the community has been set 
aside so patronage appointments can be made in his place.
<P>
	I regret this has happened. This is an indication to me and to 
many of my constituents and the people of British Columbia of 
the tone of government the Liberals are setting. We are deeply 
dismayed by this.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he can recall incidents such as this, 
the darker side of patronage, from his experience in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that this was more a 
comment than a question. The hon. member stated facts of 
which I had no knowledge. I am therefore unable to reply to his 
comment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on our Reform motion.
<P>
	Today we are speaking about the failure of the government 
to keep its red book promises. When we were elected in 
October 1993 the much touted red book was supposed to be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12462"> 12462 </A></B>
<P>
new tone for the people of the country, a new tone for the 
people in Parliament to work with. It was supposed to be a 
tone full of honesty that would engender public trust, that 
would bring more effectiveness to the House. What we have 
seen is a book  not of hope, not of promises kept, but a book 
of promises that have been broken.
<P>
	That is an insult to the House. It is an insult to democratic 
principles. Most of all it is an insult to the people of the country.
<P>
	I will give some examples and then move on to constructive 
solutions. When I and many of my colleagues in the House were 
elected a year and a half ago there was great hope. With 205 new 
members there was great hope there would be a different 
mindset of doing things in the House. As individuals we would 
be more effective in representing the wishes of our constituents 
and bringing our expertise to the House, more effective in 
presenting our ideas and more effective in bringing members of 
the public who have expertise to the House to present the most 
constructive solutions for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately we have fallen back into the same quagmire of 
business as usual-what a shame.
<P>
	In the House there is great hope and potential. Many members 
of the House possess great skills, particularly the backbenchers. 
In the backbenches of the Liberal caucus there are great skills 
which are not being tapped deliberately because of business as 
usual.
<P>
	When we came to the House the Prime Minister said he would 
give greater power to the members of the House to better 
represent the people of the country. Again, we see business as 
usual.
<P>
	Instead of committees acting independently and having more 
power, in many cases they are merely an arm of the government, 
an arm of the insidious movement of order in council.
<P>
	We in the House know but the people may not recognize the 
power structures in the country are extremely pyramidal, with 
power centred in the hands of perhaps a dozen individuals in the 
House while the rest, by and large, are under the control of the 
government.
<P>
	We in opposition try to act in a different way to bring forth 
constructive solutions. However, time and again we are merely 
shut down, not on the basis of merit, but on the basis of politics. 
This does a great deal of disservice to members of the House.
<P>
	I will raise one specific example which is close to my heart 
and one which I feel is a great shame. It is the example of the 
health committee, which deals with one of the most important 
aspects in the country, the health and welfare of Canadians. 
There are good people from all parties on the committee. 
Unfortunately the committee is merely a functioning arm under 
the policies of the government, rather than dealing with the big 
problems that affect the health of Canadians or being able to 
have the power to function and manoeuvre to address the 
problems in a construction fashion.
<P>
	All one needs to do is look at the nature of what the committee 
is studying to find out it is not addressing the big problems. That 
not only applies to the health committee but to other committees 
also.
<P>
	I implore the government to give members of the committee 
the power to use their expertise, to mine the talents in the 
country and use them to bring forth the most constructive 
solutions and address the biggest problems of the country today. 
Unfortunately that is not happening because we are dealing with 
politics and not with problems.
<P>
	Another example is order in council decisions by very few. 
People are advanced to positions not on the basis of merit but on 
the basis of who they know in many cases; not in all cases, but in 
many cases. This does a great disservice to the people of the 
country who could do great things.
<P>
	I go back to one aspect of the function of the government. 
When there is a problem in the House, what do we do? We do not 
deal with the problem. We deal with what I call studyitis, a 
disease pervasive not only in Parliament but also in other 
parliaments and governments of the world. It is an infectious 
disease that has infected most members of Parliament. That is 
very sad.
<P>
	When there is a big problem affecting us, do we bring forth the 
most relevant studies and the most relevant and effective 
solutions to the problem to show a real life example? No, of 
course not. We study it. Why do we study it? It creates the 
illusion we as elected members of Parliament are working on it. 
We give the illusion we are actually trying to address a problem. 
In effect, we are telling the Canadian people we are trying to 
offset the problem and decision making processes.
<P>
	As a qualifier, I am not saying we do not have to study things. 
Please, when things have been studied eight, nine and ten times, 
and when we literally have rooms full of studies on the same 
subject, why are we studying it again?
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	This was most graphically illustrated in the health committee 
when an individual from the Inuit Tapirisat society came before 
us when we were deciding whether to study aboriginal health. 
She was a very eloquent lady who was representing Inuit people. 
She came before us with a handful of documents, put them on the 
table and said: ``If you want to study aboriginal health and you 
want to come and see us, don't bother. Go home. This is but a 
small example of studies that have been done on us. We don't 
want studies. We want action''.
<P>
	That brought to mind something we do over and over again 
not only in health care but in so many other committees. What 
a waste of the taxpayers' money and what a disservice to the 
health problems that affect Canadians and that Canadians 
want action on, not two years from now, but now. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12463"> 12463 </A></B>
<P>
solutions are out there. Let us enact them, work toward them 
and see how they  work. If they do not work properly we 
should modify them to ensure they do work properly.
<P>
	Trying to represent our constituents' wishes is something we 
were supposed to do as a democratic society and something the 
Prime Minister said he would enable us to do to a greater extent.
<P>
	On Bill C-68 three courageous individuals from the 
government stood by what their constituents said. Their 
constituents overwhelmingly told them to oppose the bill, which 
we as party oppose for very good reasons. Those individuals 
stood up and opposed it on second reading and within 24 hours 
were removed from their committees. Why? It was a penalty for 
not kowtowing to what the party wanted to do. Is that 
democracy? Is that representing our constituents? I think not.
<P>
	Another aspect that affects my riding in particular is the west 
coast fisheries disaster. The government was supposed to do 
something for fisheries all over the country, from the east coast 
to the west coast. Unfortunately the west coast fishery is being 
ignored.
<P>
	As a precautionary measure I take this opportunity to tell the 
minister of fisheries that the poachers who poached last year, the 
poachers who almost caused the collapse of the west coast 
fishery, we came within 12 hours of collapse, are already to go 
ahead and do the same thing again. I know from the people in the 
trenches the west coast fishery poachers are getting prepared 
now to trash our west coast fishery. Please pay heed to that and 
deal with it now. The DFO office in Sooke, which represents a 
huge area, is being closed. The hatchery that releases 750,000 
fry and is staffed with one person and numerous volunteers is 
also being closed.
<P>
	DFO officers with west coast expertise in undercover 
operations are being moved to the middle of British Columbia. 
Why? I warn the government to pay heed to this because this is 
not very professional.
<P>
	Another aspect is the ethics counsellor. This is an excellent 
idea but we cannot have an ethics counsellor appointed by the 
Prime Minister, answerable to an MP from the government and 
again answerable to the Prime Minister. The ethics counsellor 
must have the ability to operate independently, answer to an 
independent group and also to have independent powers to enact 
what their mandate is supposed to be.
<P>
	Closure is another aspect which defies democracy. We should 
not have that in the House whatsoever.
<P>
	We cannot continue what we are doing in Parliament. We must 
ensure Canadians have confidence in Parliament. We must allow 
members of Parliament to do what they were meant to, to 
represent their constituents' wishes in an effective fashion. I ask 
the Prime Minister to allow us to do this. He must stop the top 
down control and bring the expertise of his party to bear down on 
the huge problems that affect society and the Canadian people so 
we can have effective, fiscally sustainable, sound and 
responsible policies for the people of the country which they so 
dearly need.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, opposition 
days such as this give us an opportunity to list some of the 
promises that have been broken from the now dead book.
<P>
	The foundation of this book was set up because canadians 
demanded a change. They demanded that the status quo must 
change. Therefore the principles of parliamentary reform, open 
government and accountability of MPs were something that all 
of us knew about prior to the election.
<P>
	As a platform for a political party, all of these principles 
seemed extremely noble and certainly worthy of public support. 
As a result, a great many Canadians voted for the Liberals in the 
last election. As much as anything, it was a revolt against the PC 
party. Canadians thought they were to get a fresh new 
government built on the principles stated in this dead book.
<P>
	A year and a half later, they are discovering that the many fine 
words are not being carried out. Instead they hear old line 
rhetoric, controlled by spin doctors and pumped out to react to 
everything.
<P>
	How does the House work? A lot of people ask that as we tour 
around our constituencies. Unfortunately I have to tell them it 
does not work very democratically. Decisions are made 
primarily by cabinet and that cabinet has a whole set of criteria 
that it uses. For the most part cabinet members do not listen to 
the people.
<P>
	I am often asked what backbenchers do. I tell them that 
backbenchers are kept in line by the party whip. They are also 
kept in line by travel, by perks, by keeping busy on committees, 
by doing reports which no one looks at.
<P>
	What about the opposition? What does the opposition do? The 
opposition speaks in the House. Its members try to put forward 
the concerns of Canadians. However a lot of frustration is 
associated with that because no one is here to listen. The 
government is not concerned. Therefore I question the very 
democracy of this place.
<P>
	Canadians demand a change. They demand free votes. They 
demand that members be here and listen, respond and carry their 
wishes to the government. They are sick and tired of spin 
doctors, of party hacks that control everything that happens in 
this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12464"> 12464 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal red book has been exposed for what it really is. 
The hypocrisy of its broken promises are becoming clearer and 
clearer to all Canadians. As just one example, whatever 
happened to the GST?
<P>
	Nothing happened to the GST, a clear broken promise from 
the red book. Even worse, the Deputy Prime Minister put her 
own good word on the line and said that she would resign if the 
GST was not gone by 1995. It never happened. Why did it not 
happen? Because the Deputy Prime Minister was unwilling to 
live up to her word and her stated principles, a perfect example 
of the Liberal dead book.
<P>
	Let us move on to some other broken promises. How about the 
one that a Liberal government would not be like the Mulroney 
Tories? We know what Canadians thought of the PCs. Canadians 
were promised that invoking closure on bills and enforcing strict 
discipline on their MPs were the characteristics of the hated 
Mulroney regime but now the truth is clear.
<P>
	The Liberal Party is not really opposed to these tactics. Its 
members were only playing the game. They have embraced 
these tactics and use them with random abuse, with no 
consideration at all for the Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Even though a large number of its backbenchers could not 
agree with Bill C-68, the Liberal Party used closure to force it 
through second reading. It mercilessly imposed party discipline 
on those members of the Liberal caucus who dared to vote the 
will of their constituents. They listened to their constituents and 
were handled just the way the PCs would have handled it. The 
truth is out. The promises in the red book can be looked on as a 
fraud. I will present to the House even more evidence of that.
<P>
	I had a private member's motion on which I worked very hard. 
It was to allow Parliament to be scrutinized by the Access to 
Information Act. When I first began my efforts I was convinced 
that I could get all party support for it. After all, greater open 
government was the official policy of all parties. The red book 
boldly stated that a Liberal government would take a series of 
initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of 
government. Open government would be the watchword of the 
Liberal program.
<P>
	My Motion No. 304 was the perfect opportunity for Liberals 
to put their money where their mouths were. If they did not vote 
for the motion to extend the Access to Information Act to 
Parliament then all Canadians would know that the Liberal 
commitment to open and transparent government was a sham.
<P>
	To allay any concerns which Liberal members might have, I 
sent each and every one of them a notice that addressed the 
specific objections they raised during the hours of debate. The 
information commissioner, Mr. John Grace, was perfectly 
willing to reassure any member of Parliament who wondered 
about the impact of the motion.
<P>
	In the days leading up to the vote I spoke to many Liberals 
who indicated they supported my motion. They said it was just 
what Parliament needed. However, on the day of the vote not one 
single solitary Liberal, clinging by his or her fingernails to the 
shattered promises of the red book, voted in favour of open 
government. The order had come down from on high: ``You can 
talk about open government all you want, but you will never 
vote for it. You will be in big trouble if you do''. It was a sad 
betrayal of the Canadian people. Everyone should remember 
that it happened. They will at the next election.
<P>
	What happened the day the Liberal majority voted down 
M-304 prevented more open government. It is an example of 
how this place does not work and how it is not democratic. What 
speaks volumes is the voting record of that day. The motion was 
supported by all Reform members and by all BQ members. The 
BQ members were being harassed by government members to 
try to change their minds. The NDP and the Tories voted for it. 
Even the one Liberal independent member voted for it. 
However, absolutely no one on the government side voted for 
open government.
<P>
	What is happening back home? Back home a lot of 
communication is going on in all 295 of the ridings across the 
country. Town hall meetings and all kinds of get togethers are 
being held. All citizens who are concerned about taxes, gun 
control and all the other problems are getting together.
<P>
	The reports are filtering back to those members who are 
listening. The message is as clear as it was before the last 
election: ``You take our message to Ottawa. Don't bring the 
message from Ottawa back to us and tell us how good it is for us. 
Don't tell us that the party tells you is good for us. We will tell 
you what is good for the party''. That is the message but it is not 
getting across in this place.
<P>
	I have a perfect example in my constituency. Six thousand 
people got together one day and said: ``Do not dare vote for the 
GST. Do not dare pass that kind of legislation. We are telling 
that it is bad. You are telling us that the party says it is good, but 
we are telling you it is bad''. I would take the results of the last 
election as a pretty good example of that message. The message 
was loud and clear. The message will be loud and clear again if 
the government fails to listen to the people.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	We have other examples such as the Charlottetown accord. 
Members from all parties in the House said: ``We support it''. 
But the people said: ``No, it is bad for us''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12465"> 12465 </A></B>
<P>
	Consider gun control. Throughout the whole country people 
are talking to their members of Parliament about gun control but 
this place has put a finger down, telling them not to represent 
their constituents.
<P>
	What about MP pensions, about which 85 per cent of 
Canadians say: ``Get rid of the gold plated pension''. What are 
the people in the House doing? They are saying: ``They really 
don't know what's good for them. We know what's good for 
them. We know the compensation package must include this 
gold plated pension''.
<P>
	The people of Canada will speak. They will make it loud and 
clear. That is what is wrong with the red book. The red book 
speaks of all of these things but does not mean any of them. It is 
a total hoax perpetrated on the people of Canada. The message is 
clear and getting clearer.
<P>
	It is obvious Canadians are demanding an openness, a 
transparency, an accountability for government. They are being 
ignored. The Liberal members of the House have no excuse. 
They ran on the promises of the red book and those promises are 
being systematically broken. The red book is truly a dead book.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are a few comments I would like to make, and I 
would also like to say, as did the hon. member for the Reform 
Party, that I too was disappointed in the so-called transparency 
of the Liberals.
<P>
	Elected in the riding of Beauharnois-Salaberry, when I came 
to Ottawa I innocently asked to be a member of the Standing 
Committee on National Defence. Why? Because when the 
Liberals were the official opposition, the present Prime Minister 
said, among other things, that defence conversion was the way 
of the future and that, once he was in power, he would make 
every effort to provide additional funding for defence 
conversion.
<P>
	I asked to be a member of the defence committee, because the 
committee was responsible for dealing with this matter and 
exploring new approaches to defence conversion. In my own 
riding I have Expro, a company that is still waiting for federal 
assistance for defence conversion, but none is forthcoming.
<P>
	The first thing that happened is that one morning, we arrived 
in the House and the government tabled an emergency motion 
proposing that the defence committee consist not only of 
members of the House of Commons but also of senators. This 
took us by surprise. We discussed it in the House, a vote was 
taken and subsequently, both elected members and senators 
were appointed to the committee.
<P>
	During the first few committee sessions with elected 
members and senators, I realized that the senators wanted to 
be on this committee because they wanted to travel. During 
the first few days the committee was in session, each senator 
suggested we go to Oslo because  this year the NATO 
conference would be held in Oslo. Canada being a member of 
NATO, they felt they should attend this conference in Oslo.
<P>
	Someone else said we had to go to Brussels. Why Brussels? 
Because NATO headquarters is in Brussels. Canada being a 
member of NATO, we had to go and visit NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. Someone else said we had to go to New York because 
the UN headquarters is in New York and Canada is a member of 
the UN. Someone else claimed we had to go to Zagreb in 
Yugoslavia, because Canada has peacekeepers in Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I was flabbergasted to see every single senator rise with 
suggestions for a trip. I wondered what I was doing there with 
my plans to talk about defence conversion for Expro in 
Beauharnois-Salaberry.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I realized that basically, these people wanted to travel. The 
budget for all these trips would be more than one million dollars. 
There was a complaint in committee that this was truly 
excessive. Finally, they agreed to a budget for $800,000. They 
left, these worthy senators, accompanied by physicians, nurses 
and secretaries to take notes for the marvellous report they 
would make on these trips, a report that was probably shelved as 
soon as they got back. Now that is transparency-I think the 
public should know-that is today's Liberal government.
<P>
	They tell us they work on these committees but, basically, 
they go off on some lovely trips at taxpayers expense. I refused 
to go on any of these trips because I thought it was outrageous. 
That is part of what today's motion is all about. When we talk 
about transparency, I think the public ought to know that. I am 
very much disappointed because of all this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to agree totally 
with the member's comments. He brought out two key points. 
The key points are that when these joint committees are set up 
that is a major problem. We did exactly the same thing in foreign 
affairs. We put forward a motion to keep people from that other 
place out. It was supported by the Bloc and of course it was 
defeated by the Liberals.
<P>
	We must remember, as the member pointed out, that the 
biggest carrot in this place to keep the backbenchers of the 
Liberal Party happy is travel. That is the biggest carrot there is. 
They would rise up against that dictatorial control if in fact they 
could not be given something. Often that travel is given as a 
reward.
<P>
	I agree totally with the member. He is right on the money. The 
Canadian people should realize that.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate 
in this opposition day motion on ethics in government.
<P>
	One has to wonder about the timing of this motion. This 
motion on ethics comes from a party that yesterday spent the 
whole time of the House with delaying tactics in a most 
unethical manner. Surely something must be said about that.
<P>
	How about the political party that ran out of speakers and then 
proposed the adjournment of the debate in order to cause a 
half-hour bell in order not to have a vote? Could it be that those 
ethical people were afraid of not winning that vote at that 
particular time and they did not want to proceed with the vote? 
What about the ethics of that?
<P>
	We are speaking of ethics. Earlier today we had an hon. 
member state in this House that the government had fired Dr. 
Lorne Greenaway of Williams Lake, British Columbia, who was 
sitting on the British Columbia Treaty Commission. I tried to 
obtain from the hon. member more details about this particular 
person. When I did not get more details I sent for a copy of the 
order in council appointments. I found out that Dr. Lorne 
Greenaway's appointment-a former Conservative MP, and a 
fine gentleman, by the way-expired on April 13. He was not 
fired. It expired. I have it on page 131.01 of the order in council 
book, which I have in my hand.
<P>
	What about the ethics of members making statements like 
that, which are diametrically opposed to the facts? Can I put it 
kindly? What kinds of ethics are those? That is playing fast and 
loose with things that should be true.
<P>
	This is on a day on which we are supposed to be debating 
ethics. Are we going to get an apology later for having made that 
kind of a statement in the House? Fat chance. Fat chance from 
those ethical people across the way.
<P>
	Those are the same ethical people who were elected 
pretending to the people of Canada that MPs were overpaid and 
they were going to come here to Ottawa and straighten it out. 
They were going to eat in the cafeteria because they did not want 
to eat in the parliamentary restaurant. Then of course it became 
obvious to most of us that the cafeteria lost more money than the 
restaurant, which kind of destroyed that argument for the hon. 
members in question.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Then they said that they wanted to get rid of the limousine. 
They spent government time, taxpayers' dollars, having their 
limousine prepared. It was all made shiny, brought here in the 
front, and a driver was hired to do it. They came here, and do you 
know what they did? They put a little sign in the window 
pretending they wanted the thing sold. They spent hundreds if 
not thousands of taxpayers' dollars for a cheap publicity stunt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Then what did they do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Then they had someone drive in the back 
laneway with another limousine, this time subsidized by the 
taxpayers of Canada by way of electoral contribution to the 
Reform Party. Shameful behaviour.
<P>
	What about political reform à la Reform? Let us look at what 
they had to say about that. During the election campaign they 
produced a cheap imitation of the Liberal red book. It was a 
cheap imitation, because we all know how popular the Liberal 
red book was. I am sure members remember it well.
<P>
	We of course are delivering on many of the promises in the red 
book. We will deliver on all of them, of course, during our 
mandate.
<P>
	Anyway, let us get to the Reform book of promises now. Here 
is what they said. It is called ``Better Representation in 
Parliament''. This is a reading from the blue book of the Reform 
Party. At that time, the Reform members said: ``Until 
parliamentary reform is enacted, the Reform Party pledges that 
having had a full opportunity to express their views and vote 
freely in caucus, such caucus votes always will be made 
public''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I remember that promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I remember that promise well. I ask the hon. 
members across, will they table those votes that they have made 
in caucus? Why have they not made them public?
<P>
	I think it is a silly idea to start with, but of course I am not the 
one who promised it. They did. We had much more meaningful 
promises in the red book.
<P>
	Anyway, those are their promises. Those are the things they 
saw as being important. Why are they not delivering on those 
promises to the people of Canada? What stopped them from 
tabling the minutes from their caucus meeting? They said that 
they would do it. It is a pretty corny thing to do, but it does not 
matter. I mean, they are the ones who said they would do it. Why 
are they not doing it?
<P>
	Listen to this as I read on, because it gets better. Pay attention, 
because we are going to read more. It says: ``Reform MPs shall 
vote with the Reform Party majority in the House unless a 
member is instructed to abstain or vote otherwise by his or her 
constituents. The Reform Party of Canada shall provide criteria 
for proper processes to elicit the will of the constituency''. Let 
us stop at that point.
<P>
	Let us talk about gun control in all of this. We know that the 
vast majority of Canadians are in favour of gun control. How 
many Reform MPs are going to vote in favour of gun control? 
We think two Reform MPs will vote in favour of gun control. 
Only one did last time around.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12467"> 12467 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the province of Ontario. Insight Canada did 
an extensive poll in the province of Ontario. There is not one 
constituency in Ontario where people who are against gun 
control would have a majority, not one. We did an extensive 
poll, and that is proven.
<P>
	I ask the hon. members across, what about the Reform Party 
MP from Ontario? Did he not, according to this test that the 
Reform members have for themselves, fail the test? Did he fail 
to deliver on the little blue book of the Reform Party? Is that not 
somewhat unethical?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> What about Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> What about Alberta, as the hon. parliamentary 
secretary said so eloquently. He is quite right again, as he 
usually is. Again the Reform members have missed the boat.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What did the justice minister say?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not know. It is so unusual here that the 
Reform Party members are buttressing their own argument by 
quoting Tories. They are the ones who said that Tories were 
these bad dudes when they came here to Parliament. Now that 
they are here, I see a little coalition developing. They are 
quoting Tories.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	They are hanging around with those Tories too much. Yes, 
yes, yes. They are way too close to those Tories. We can see them 
being way too close to each other. It is rubbing off. We can tell 
that it is only a question of time before we have the great 
coalition of Reformers and Tories. We know it. Those are really 
friends of Brian Mulroney across the way. We can recognize 
those kinds of people when we see them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> You are right. The similarities are very 
apparent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Your nose is growing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member for Kingston and the Islands 
agrees with me. My colleague has just indicated that the 
similarities are very apparent.
<P>
	Let us talk about parliamentary reform. We Liberals have 
promised parliamentary reform, and we have delivered. Yes, we 
have delivered to the people of Canada. We suggested greater 
influence of MPs on committees, and we delivered on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> No way.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I hear some people disagreeing across the way. 
Perhaps they were not paying close enough attention to what 
goes on in committee.
<P>
	Let us see what we have done here. The government has 
agreed that bills could be sent to committee before second 
reading. Well, we have done that in the case of the lobbyists 
bill. As a matter of fact, we accepted amendments from the 
opposition side. They were Reform Party amendments. They 
are in the bill. When was the last time someone else did that? 
Did the Tories do this when they were in government? Surely 
not. Those  are Liberal examples of opening up the process, 
and we have done that. Perhaps the members across disagree 
with the amendments proposed by their colleagues at the 
committee. If so, I am almost tempted to ask why they voted 
for them.
<P>
	The bill on lobbyists is an excellent example. It was produced 
in the House, sent to committee, the committee improved upon 
it, and then at report stage we improved upon it more with the 
contribution of hon. members across.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this government is totally open to 
giving parliamentarians a greater role.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at this. A bill was drafted from A to Z 
by a parliamentary committee during this Parliament and was 
even passed by this House. I am referring to Bill C-69, and this 
committee was chaired by a very clever chairman, in the person 
of the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We promised more free votes and we delivered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You have not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> When?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I will give a few examples. For the first time in 
the history of Parliament, a bill involving government spending 
and royal recommendation was proposed by a private member, 
the first time since 1867.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Government business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur 
proposed that bill.
<P>
	What about the bill with regard to parole proposed by the hon. 
member for York South-Weston? The bill received support of 
members from all sides of the House. There were Liberal MPs 
who were for the bill and some Liberal MPs against. Liberal 
MPs had a truly free vote on that. One cabinet minister voted for 
the bill and other cabinet ministers voted against. Even though 
the majority of cabinet voted against the bill, as the whip I voted 
for it. What is a better example of a free vote than that?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I cannot imagine one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> There is no better example than that. Did the 
Reform Party have people voting for or against any of those 
measures? No.
<P>
	We have had some 170 division bells in this Parliament. Does 
anyone know how many times we had Reform Party MPs 
dissenting from one another? Twice. They voted unanimously 
168 times. And they are preaching parliamentary reform to us?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12468"> 12468 </A></B>
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is a disgrace. The members opposite should 
be- I cannot understand why they would even want to stay in 
this House. They should go and hide after saying the things they 
said earlier.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Another free vote promised by the government is on the 
euthanasia issue; it has not been held yet. We had debates, we 
consulted the House on the role of our troops serving abroad in 
Bosnia. We had parliamentary debates to provide advice and 
guidance to the government on the cruise missiles issue. We 
have this kind of debate in this House, totally open debates for 
all parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We promised effective prebudget consultation. We delivered 
on that as well. Never before has this country had that kind of 
prebudget debate.
<P>
	The members across the way who voted altogether 168 times 
out of 170 are preaching parliamentary reform? I say to the 
members across the way, Reform, reform thyself. They sure 
need it badly. I think it comes from sitting too close to the 
Tories. I come back to my original point. That is what is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We, in our party, made promises to the Canadian people 
during the last election campaign. Those promises are in the red 
book. We presented the Canadian people with a comprehensive 
programme, a manifesto, describing what we intended to do for 
our country. Having made these promises, we now intend to 
keep them.
<P>
	The red book, and I happen to have a copy of it right here, is 
full of great ideas. Those are the proposals we have put to the 
people of Canada. The people elected us to deliver and that is 
what we intend to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now let me give a couple of examples. Primarily we promised 
two things in the area of ethics. First was to have a lobbyist bill. 
Members across the way tried their best to delay it. Second, we 
promised to have a joint parliamentary committee to change the 
rules regarding the code of conduct for MPs and senators. And 
who is trying to stop that process? The Reform Party. The 
strange thing is that Reformers are trying to delete the senators 
from that process. They do not want members of the other place 
to have conflict of interest rules.
<P>
	Today a member of the Reform Party stood in the House and 
asked to delete by unanimous consent a section of the rule book 
that applies to MPs. I wonder if my colleague from Kingston and 
the Islands knows that. Reformers wanted the rule book to be 
thrown out. What does that tell you about Reformers? I do not 
think they like rules. I think they like a state of unruliness a lot 
better.
<P>
	We introduced a bill to reduce MPs pensions. What did the 
Reformers do? They do not want to reduce MPs pensions. As an 
alternative they propose increasing MPs salaries. They want to 
increase MPs salaries.
<P>
	They were elected on the pretence they wanted to have a 
reduction in salaries. Some of them even took a pay cut. A little 
while later they noticed there was insufficient appreciation for 
that kind of nonsense and they withdrew what they were doing 
and not because it was wrong.
<P>
	One of them admitted publicly to the press that he had ceased 
to do it because his constituents were not appreciating it enough. 
In other words, he was not getting enough publicity out of it so 
that particular member decided to pull out of the scheme, or 
should I say, out of the scam that had originally been 
perpetrated. That is not what I would call parliamentary reform.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, the hon. members opposite may think they have the 
monopoly of virtue, but reality is altogether different. We all 
know, in this House, that this government has every intention of 
delivering on its program, the red book, for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	We know that that is what we intend to do, are doing, will 
continue to do and will succeed in doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know on the other hand that some people were elected 
having made some promises to the people of Canada. They have 
failed miserably in terms of delivering on those promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> They are going to get you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I see a fresh heckler across the way. No doubt 
he is getting ready to deliver an impassioned speech about 
government ethics. I say to him that he should read the material 
of his own party, that little blue pamphlet which it produced to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> To dupe the electors of Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not think I would say to dupe the electors. 
In any case, they made promises to the people of Canada and 
they were in a position to deliver on some of them and they did 
nothing.
<P>
	The Reform members across the way who are asking for more 
free votes voted unanimously 168 times out of 170 votes. Shame 
on the Reform members. Shame on what they have to say.
<P>
	Those people across have nothing to say about ethics and it 
is obvious. If they had something to say they could prove it by 
their actions, by assisting us in proceeding with the agenda on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12469"> 12469 </A></B>
<P>
which we were elected, by producing the legislation which we 
all promised to the people of Canada, instead of delaying and 
using obstructionist tactics such as we saw yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You were not here yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A member opposite has said that for us to 
deliver on the promises we made to the people of Canada is a 
sign of arrogance. That is the view of one member. He has just 
said it in the House. If doing that which the electorate expects of 
us is arrogance, I plead guilty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a joy and a delight to listen to the sophistry of that 
particular member. He is a piece of work.
<P>
	I cannot comprehend a person who has come to the House and 
of all things has spoken specifically against the actions of the 
former Tory government under Standing Order 78, and then 
stood to say: ``Oh, my, was that not terrible?'' If we had said why 
do we not do away with Standing Order 78 when he was in 
opposition, he would have stood and applauded and said: ``Do 
away with it''. This is really a piece of work.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hypo-grits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Hypo-grits is right.
<P>
	Talking about free votes, every time he spoke about free votes 
he would talk about free votes in the context of private 
members' bills. What about government voting?
<P>
	I noticed when voting on Bill C-68 that there were three 
members who stood up to be counted. However, there were 45 
members in the hon. member's caucus who did not have the 
intestinal fortitude to come to the House to stand and be counted 
for their constituents. When those three members stood to be 
counted, they were turfed from their committees. How in the 
world as the party whip can he possibly say that he is for free 
votes when he is prepared to turf these people from their 
committees?
<P>
	What about Bill C-41? Is he going to allow free votes on Bill 
C-41?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been in office now for 
some time-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Are you lost for words?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, I am not lost 
for words. That is not something that happens to me very often.
<P>
	The hon. member across just asked me a question about Bill 
C-41.
<P>
[<I>Translat</I><I>ion</I>] 
<P>
	I know that our colleague has now acquired a great deal of 
experience. He has been sitting in this place for a good while 
and, of course, this House has matured, it is getting on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member knows that the whip does not 
invent discipline. What kind of nonsense is that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> He just enforces it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is exactly the point. The whip is an official 
of the caucus of which he is a member and that is what I am. I am 
responsible for anything that has to do with administration, 
discipline and so on.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The member is asking me the position of the caucus on that 
issue or on any other issue and I am not in a position to do that. If 
and when that issue does come up, it will be discussed in the 
caucus to which I belong and not with the hon. member.
<P>
	Furthermore, the member raised the issue of Standing Order 
78. The hon. member said that when I was in opposition I would 
have wanted Standing Order 78 to be revoked. Before the 
member makes an allegation like that, it might be prudent to 
check the facts. I have no knowledge not only of myself but of 
any Liberal MP in the last Parliament nor the Parliament before 
who has ever asked to revoke Standing Order 78, or whatever the 
equivalent number was. If he can prove that I have ever asked for 
that, I will gladly rise in this House and apologize. However, I 
do not think he will ever find that. If he does not find it, which he 
will not, I hope he will stand and apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple 
of questions for the member.
<P>
	The first question is with regard to pensions. I do not really 
think we need to debate it. I do not think there is anybody on this 
side of the House who could accept that gold plated disgrace that 
is called a pension plan. I believe the Canadian people also agree 
with that.
<P>
	Let us get to committees. The member says we will prove him 
by his actions. Let me tell this House a little story about my first 
meeting with the hon. member. It was in the case of our foreign 
affairs standing committee: nine Liberals, three Bloc, three 
Reform. We were having a democratic election of the chairman 
and the two deputy chairmen. We had talked and got to know 
each other. About a week later we were to have this democratic 
election.
<P>
	I was fairly certain at that time I would be one of the 
vice-chairs because I had talked to a number of Liberals about 
our backgrounds. However, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell came into the room, tapped the 
Liberals on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12470"> 12470 </A></B>
<P>
shoulder and told them how to vote and that is how they voted. 
That is the democracy of this place. It is a sham that the member 
stands up and sounds like he is some kind of wonderful 
democrat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will gladly respond to that. Who 
sits as vice-chair of committees is something that is negotiated 
between the two opposition parties in the House and not the 
government.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It should be democratic. It should not be 
negotiated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I did not make the constitutional conventions 
under which we are governed. I have been in Parliament a long 
time but not quite that long.
<P>
	We have an interesting proposition here. At the time there 
were negotiations between the two opposition parties. It is not 
for me to bring this up but the member has opened up the can of 
worms so he will have to live with the result. At that time a 
number of vice-chairs were offered to the third party by the 
official opposition and they were turned down.
<P>
	The third party turned down the vice-chair positions that were 
offered. The then whip, and at that time the hon. member called 
herself a caucus co-ordinator, did not want the particular 
vice-chairs that were offered. She wanted better ones. She did 
not like those particular vice-chairmanships and decided to do 
that for whatever reason she had in mind, which should have 
been discussed inside the Reform Party caucus room. It was 
supposed to have minutes in public later but it never has. 
However, Reformers can decide that in their caucus room and 
then make whatever decision they want. Those were decisions 
made by the two opposition parties.
<P>
	While we are on that topic, there were also negotiations like 
that with regard to office space. I remember how they got 
bogged down too. The leader of a certain political party, not the 
number one or number two party, not to be too specific, decided 
he wanted the better part of the whole floor in a building. He 
wanted sweeter suites, if I can refer to it that way.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Members across the way should watch how they speak on 
some of these issues. They know perfectly well that it was a 
representative of the hon. member's own caucus who refused to 
take a number of vice-chairmanships. She decided that she 
would rather have none than the ones that had been offered by 
the official opposition.
<P>
	That is a disagreement between the opposition parties. It has 
nothing to do with the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every day that goes by in the House I see more and more of the 
arrogance of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I have listened to the Liberal Party whip twice in the last two 
days. It is becoming clearer and clearer. It is the same arrogance 
that ousted the Conservatives from office. As it continues it will 
get worse. Blatantly, in the face of Canadians, we see today 
patronage appointments across the land of every one of their 
friends, Liberal Party hacks, failed Liberal candidates, and on 
and on it goes.
<P>
	The red book was produced during the last election. The 
Liberals realized that Canadians wanted to see something about 
what they were running on.
<P>
	The member said that the blue book of the Reform Party was a 
cheap imitation of the Liberal red book. I believe that is a quote. 
The blue book was produced in 1988. From 1988 to today 52 
members of the Reform Party came to the House because they 
had principles. They documented them. They modified them by 
their assembly. They do not produce cheap red book documents 
during an election campaign and then subsequently ignore them.
<P>
	If we can get away from arrogance for just a moment, I would 
like to ask the member where and when the red book was 
developed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also think the member across the 
way is a very fine person.
<P>
	The Liberal Party red book is a compilation of a number of 
documents. First there were a number of meetings across the 
country in 1992. That was followed by a document in January 
1993 called ``Reviving Parliamentary Democracy''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They were back door Liberal hack 
meetings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am trying to answer the hon. 
member's question. He is interrupting himself.
<P>
	Then it was followed by another document entitled ``The 
Liberal Blueprint for Defence Conversion'' in March 1993; ``A 
Liberal Perspective on Crime and Justice'' in April 1993; ``Food 
Security for Canadians and a Fair Return for Canadian Farmers'' 
on May 10, 1993; foreign policy handbook in May 1993; and the 
Liberal Party program for small business. On August 16, 1993 
all these documents were made public. They were combined to 
produce the red book later that summer which was released 
during the election campaign. That is a rough scenario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have a note in my hand to 
which I would like to respond. There were personal allegations 
made about me. I would like to respond to them and to the note. I 
seek unanimous consent of the House to do that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the 
House for the member to speak?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will read the full text of the 
note. It states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Mayfield, who is this Dr. Greenaway? Is he the former MP? What board did 
he sit on?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is signed ``Don''. The note was delivered to me less than 
half an hour after the chief government whip made the 
allegations. I did not have an opportunity to respond to him and 
he knows it. He took advantage of it.
<P>
	Dr. Greenaway by his own admission was fired. If he was not 
fired, why was he not reappointed? Why was this trusted 
member of the B.C. Treaty Commission not allowed to continue 
the valuable work he was doing? Why did the government shove 
him aside to replace him with someone else who did not have the 
experience, who did not have the same trust, who did not have 
the ongoing confidence of both sides? I reject the allegations.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	It is another example of the kinds of tactics the rat pack used. I 
have no idea why rat pack tactics are necessary in a government 
that has the majority.
<P>
	Rat pack tactics continue not only in the House but in the 
committees. We see them every day. Why is there no courtesy? 
Why are members not listened to? We do not ask them to agree 
with everything we propose. We only ask that they listen. Many 
if not most of our proposals, ideas and suggestions are not even 
given the courtesy of casual consideration.
<P>
	The government deserves this lack of confidence.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unanimous consent given to the 
member to speak with regard to some allegations made earlier 
by the government whip.
<P>
	We are now out of time for questions or comments but 
presumably it makes sense to give the whip a chance to reply, if 
he wishes, to the comments just made. Then I will go briefly to 
the hon. member for an extended question or comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I reiterate what I said. I have page 
131.01 of the orders in council which I will gladly table. It was 
said in the House earlier this morning that Dr. Lorne Greenaway 
had been fired. I have proof in front of me in this document. 
Lorne E. Greenaway, commissioner for Canada of the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission, is from Williams Lake, British 
Columbia. He was appointed on April 14, 1993. Contrary to 
what we were told his term expired-he was not fired-on April 
13, 1995.
<P>
	If it is the wish of the House I will gladly table a copy of the 
page of the book in question. I stand by what I said. It is factually 
correct. The person was not fired. There was an allegation made 
by an hon. member that he was fired. That is not true. I sent a 
note to the member opposite giving him a chance to correct 
himself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that all this talk about openness, democratic government 
and the committees' influence is hilarious. Everyone is a 
comedian. Earlier, I put a question to the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard but I failed to get an answer. Perhaps my 
preamble on government openness was much too long, so I will 
ask a very, very simple and very short question.
<P>
	I repeat my question. At the second reading stage of the gun 
control bill, two or three Liberal members voted against the bill 
and were then expelled from their committees. I would like the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to tell me what 
will happen to them if they vote against the bill at third reading?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite asks 
how the whip of a particular political party does his or her job. I 
am sure his whip in the House would not want me to question 
him in that manner.
<P>
	As whips we work together for hours in a day administering 
everything from the Board of Internal Economy to the 
unanimous consent sought by political parties.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite surely does not expect me to 
divulge caucus information. Nor would I expect him to do that. 
Only one party advocated making public the results of its caucus 
meetings. That was the Reform Party and even it did not do so.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to address the following 
Reform opposition day motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its failure to keep its red book 
promise to make the government more open and permitting members of 
Parliament to be more accountable to their constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
West.
<P>
	I will not spend much of my 10 minutes replying or trying to 
rebut the nonsense we just heard from the hon. government 
whip. However I should like to reply to a point that was not 
adequately addressed by him. He called the blue book of the 
Reform Party a cheap imitation of the red book. Then he stood in 
his place and said that the first date he could recall the red book 
being formulated was 1992. The blue book was originally 
formulated in 1987 and published in 1988 for the election. He 
should stand to retract the statement as an outright breach of 
trust.
<P>
	In my limited time I would like to discuss why I became 
involved in politics because it has a bearing on the subject of 
accountability of MPs to their constituents that we are 
discussing today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12472"> 12472 </A></B>
<P>
	The majority of western Canadians and the majority of the 
constituents of the riding of Prince George-Peace River that I 
am proud and pleased to represent predominantly supported the 
Progressive Conservative Party for years. I was one of its 
supporters although I never belonged to the party. I voted for the 
Conservatives hoping to see an end to the reign of terror thrust 
on Canada by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The incumbent at that time 
was Mr. Oberle. He was very well supported. At one time he was 
known as landslide Oberle. That is the level of support and 
loyalty the Progressive Conservatives and Mr. Oberle had in the 
riding of Prince George-Peace River.
<P>
	Gradually, after the Conservative sweep of 1984, the people 
of my riding and of much of Canada, certainly western Canada, 
began to feel a sense of betrayal. The first Mulroney government 
was plagued by scandal, almost from the time it took the reins of 
power in 1984 in the most massive mandate a governing party 
has ever had in the country.
<P>
	I could go on and on about the scandals but I will just refer to a 
few: the Oerlikon land flip, the tainted tuna or what was 
described in the press as Tunagate, the Sinclair Stevens affair, 
and the infamous CF-18 decision when the reigning 
Conservatives took the contract for the maintenance of the 
CF-18 fighter aircraft away from Bristol Aerospace in 
Winnipeg that should have had the successful bid and awarded it 
to Canadair in Montreal. That created a sense of betrayal 
certainly all across western Canada.
<P>
	That was the flashpoint, the trigger point, when I became so 
disenchanted and disillusioned with the political system and 
with the Conservatives that I said something had to be done to 
change the system.
<P>
	I became involved in the fledgling Reform Party. When I first 
heard about it, it was not even a party. It was just a reform 
association, a group of Canadians from across western Canada 
who had decided that enough was enough.
<P>
	I was attracted by its policies on those dreaded double <I>d</I> 
words: the deficit and the debt. It believed in the government 
living within its means and justice reforms, that criminals 
should be held responsible for their actions and real punishment 
was needed to provide deterrents for criminal activities. A 
cornerstone of the Reform Party was the democratic reforms we 
advocate. We have advocated them all along as was shown today 
in our blue book.
<P>
	Because of the sense of betrayal we realized the fault did not 
really lie with individual politicians but with the system of 
government in Canada. We advocated a number of democratic 
reforms, referenda and citizens initiatives. The Charlottetown 
accord is a shining example of what can happen when the people 
become involved in the democratic process.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the Liberal Party did not get the 
message from the Charlottetown accord. The Reform Party was 
the only federal political party to come out against it.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Everyone said we were crazy, we had committed political 
suicide. We saw that as people became more informed they 
started to see the flaws in the accord and ultimately the polls 
reversed themselves and it was defeated in the referendum.
<P>
	Another reform advocated was recall whereby constituents 
could actually hold their elected officials accountable. We fixed 
election dates so the reigning party could not play with the 
election date according to the polls and the support it was 
getting.
<P>
	On a true triple E Senate which we have never given up on and 
never will give up on, we want to see a true, elected, efficient 
and equal Senate rather than the patronage heaven it has become 
under the reigning old parties.
<P>
	Above all else, what attracted me to the Reform Party was its 
stand on MP accountability. MPs should truly represent the 
wishes of the majority of their constituents, not once in a while 
when it happens to coincide with their party's position or 
perhaps their own deeply held views, but all the time, where the 
majority of opinion of constituents is readily evident and can be 
determined.
<P>
	I ran in the 1988 election and I never had any desire to become 
a politician. There are still some days when I debate with myself 
the decision of becoming a politician. I decided to run for 
Reform because I realized something had to happen to change 
the way government operated.
<P>
	I was attacked back then by the old line parties. At that time 
the Conservative incumbent in open candidate forums said: 
``Mr. Hill said he would run government by polling. MPs would 
simply become polling machines''.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that on Bill C-68 that is exactly what 
the Liberals are doing after the old line parties have accused us 
and criticized us for wanting MP accountability. They are ruling 
by polls.
<P>
	I contend and I have always maintained those polls are 
erroneous if the majority of Canadians became better informed 
about the gun issue and how difficult it already is to own a 
firearm in Canada.
<P>
	As some of my colleagues have already said, I cannot believe 
the arrogance starting to show through with the government. 
That is one of the big reasons Mulroney was turfed out and why 
the Conservatives were reduced to only two seats in the House.
<P>
	One of the worst possible examples-it is seared into my 
mind, that is how upset I was when I watched it on television one 
night-was when Mulroney kicked two of his caucus colleagues 
out of caucus because they dared to vote their constituents' 
wishes on the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12473"> 12473 </A></B>
<P>
	One of those members currently sitting, interestingly enough, 
is the Liberal member from Edmonton-Southeast; you, Mr. 
Speaker. I commend your stand that day and I am sure your 
constituents do and that is why you were re-elected. You 
represented the people. That is the type of leadership we want to 
see in the House from all MPs from all parties.
<P>
	I will read some red book promises in the short time I have 
left, from the section ``Governing with Integrity''. It says: ``The 
most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys 
of the citizens to whom it is accountable. This erosion of 
confidence seems to have many causes. Some have to do with 
the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an 
arrogant style of political leadership. In the House of Commons 
a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in drafting 
legislation through House of Commons committees. More free 
votes will be allowed in the House of Commons''.
<P>
	Yet we see on Bill C-68, as has been revealed today already, a 
total disregard for the right of MPs to currently accurately 
represent their people when the three Liberal members from 
Kent, Timiskaming-French River and Huron-Bruce were 
removed from committees.
<P>
	Rumours always abound on Parliament Hill. We have heard 
rumours the Liberal Party and the whip will adopt three strikes 
and you are out. If a member votes three times against their 
party, they are out of there.
<P>
	That is a very real threat for members from old parties. We 
have seen where the leaders will not sign their nomination 
papers. The threat is they will lose their job and that is 
deplorable.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am a little disappointed at times by Reform members because 
they promised more courtesy and sometimes they do not show 
that. They also said they would bring to the House much better 
behaviour and from this corner I do not see it. I am one of those 
who try to be mindful of others. I also came into politics without 
really wanting to, but I am here now and I respect everyone but I 
do not seem to receive respect from everyone.
<P>
	Democracy is a very strange animal. At times it is extremely 
uncomfortable and at times it is not very acceptable. However, it 
is the only system we know. As we know, democracy means the 
majority rules. Every time we have a discussion among party 
members it is held in caucus. In caucus at times we argue quite 
passionately because we do not always agree. There are 177 of 
us and we all have a different opinion and a different 
constituency to serve. However, in the end the majority rules. As 
I said, at times it is not easy.
<P>
	If we did not have a party behind us I do not know how many 
of us would have made it. There is only one person in the House 
elected as an independent. We have to remember that.
<P>
	When my three colleagues were punished I was not happy 
with it. I read it in the newspaper and I did not agree with it. 
However, after I thought about democracy and how the majority 
rules and how it is important to understand each other, I started 
to agree with it. I also realized some people in our caucus were 
hurt by the action of our colleagues.
<P>
	We owe much more respect to each other and I would also like 
to see the better behaviour which was offered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate her comments. They allow me to address something I 
have been very concerned about all along, as have all of my 
Reform colleagues.
<P>
	What she says is quite accurate. When we came here we 
wanted to institute a new sense of decorum in the House. We 
tried quite valiantly for a number of months. I explained this to 
my constituents at home on open line shows and in public 
meetings. This is the only place in Canada where it is part of an 
individual's job to sit here and take the nonsense we take every 
day, all year round when the House is sitting. I have turned out to 
be one of the worst when it comes to heckling. I am not proud of 
that but it is a self-defence mechanism. We sit here day after day 
and we take that from across the way.
<P>
	When I was raised back home one of two things would 
happen. If we were insulted the way we have been insulted in the 
House we would either get up and smack someone or we would 
get up and leave. Unfortunately as an elected MP trying to 
represent the people of my riding I have to remain in the House. 
That is why decorum has deteriorated in the House. I am not 
proud of it but we are getting down to the same level as her 
colleagues.
<P>
	She mentioned how passionately they argue in caucus. That is 
exactly what the Conservative incumbent used to say to us time 
after time. The GST is a classic example. Eighty per cent of the 
people were opposed to it and he would say: ``I defend your 
rights. I passionately defend what the people want me to say in 
caucus but when it comes to the House I am muzzled and I 
cannot get up and say the things you want me to say''. The 
Reform Party will be different. When the people of Prince 
George-Peace River want me to say something in this House, 
by golly I will say it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say it is a pleasure to stand in the House to talk 
about broken promises but it is not.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	It is somewhat despairing to address issues to Liberal 
members of the government in the House. Sometimes we 
think they are not listening. Look at them all here. If anyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12474"> 12474 </A></B>
<P>
thinks they are not listening just turn the cameras. It is almost 
a national disgrace that we have yet  another majority 
government in place not listening to the people.
<P>
	It came out with a document called the red book designed 
explicitly for the election campaign. The government whip 
stood up a short while ago and said our blue book was a cheap 
imitation of the Liberal red book. He went on to say the Liberal 
red book was developed in late 1992 and 1993, and the Reform 
Party's blue book was developed in 1987 for the 1988 election. I 
guess those are the principles and the differences.
<P>
	There is a facade hanging over the government. It tells us one 
thing but does a little of what it tells us to say it has completed it. 
I will go through some examples of it. I cannot call that lying in 
the House but I can call it about the closest thing to a facade as 
anything I have seen.
<P>
	When the Conservatives were in government and the Liberals 
stood on this side of the House, the Liberals sanctimoniously 
stood up and berated the Conservative government for all its 
faults. The Liberals get elected and they do the same darn thing. 
No wonder people are sick and tired of politicians.
<P>
	Let me talk a bit about a promise made in the red book: ``A 
Liberal government will review the appointment process to 
ensure that necessary appointments are made on the basis of 
competence and will move quickly and decisively in several 
ways to address these concerns about conflict of interest, 
influence peddling and selling access''.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Ablonczy:</B> They moved fast all right, right toward it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> A good point. My hon. 
colleague says they did move fast on it, they moved right toward 
it.
<P>
	Let us discuss the Senate. In the face of the majority of 
Canadians they start taking their members and friends and move 
them into the Senate, even a currently elected MP. Talk about 
disrupting the democratic process, this individual was elected 
and all of a sudden the Prime Minister wants to put one of his 
buddies in so he says: ``I will haul you out, give you a Senate job 
until age 75 and I will put in one of my buddies and run him in 
the race''. I think that is about as disheartening as we can get.
<P>
	Let us look at a few patronage appointments. The government 
stated it would review the appointment process to ensure that 
necessary appointments are made on the basis of competence. 
Please tell me if this is a truism after I am finished. A Liberal 
candidate in Dunvegan, Alberta in 1993 was appointed assistant 
commissioner to the Canadian Grains Commission. He must 
have been competent, he was a Liberal candidate, right?
<P>
	I wonder how many Canadians had the opportunity to get that 
job. I wonder how many executives out of senior corporations 
who are now out of jobs had an opportunity to get that job. None. 
There were no opportunities at all. However, the Liberal Party 
hacks had opportunities.
<P>
	Another one started with the Prime Minister as executive 
assistant at Indian affairs in 1970. He was the Prime Minister's 
aide in the Quebec Liberal Party in 1992 and now a member of 
the St. Lawrence seaway authority. There were lots of 
qualifications there. They say they will clean it up by ensuring 
necessary appointments are based on competence.
<P>
	I have another one. A B.C. Liberal Party executive director in 
1994 was appointed director of CMHC. We are certainly looking 
after the affairs of the red book.
<P>
	Let us take a couple of others. A long time supporter and 
personal friend of John Savage, worked on his campaign since 
1979, was made director of the Halifax Port Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Anther one under Pierre Trudeau was Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Minister of Public Works, 
President of the Treasury Board, appointed chairperson of the 
Canadian Tourism Commission. What is going on in this 
country?
<P>
	These Liberals stood over here when the Conservatives were 
appointing all of their friends, and now they are doing the same 
thing, which they promised they would not do.
<P>
	What do Canadians think about this whole process? They say: 
``They are just politicians. While we are out here trying to earn a 
living, we are overtaxed, overburdened with bureaucracy, 
politicians are appointing their friends, giving themselves great 
pension plans, appointing senators until age 75.''
<P>
	Here is an interesting one I ran across. A failed Liberal 
candidate in the 1993 federal election was appointed director of 
the Canadian Commercial Corporation. Why should I be so 
dismayed about that? It is just another political appointment. I 
ran against this guy and defeated him in my riding. I wonder how 
many other people in my riding who are out of work and who are 
better qualified than that fellow get an opportunity to get that 
job. Not one. The ones who get the jobs are Liberal Party friends 
and hacks.
<P>
	The list goes on and on, but there is no sense talking to a dead 
tree over there. It does not work. It has been chopped down. 
There is a stump there. It does not work.
<P>
	There was talk about cleaning up crime by the Liberals. Many 
of them probably do not live in areas where there is crime, 
because I do not think they understand it all that well. Some of 
their policies absolutely escape me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12475"> 12475 </A></B>
<P>
	I have to get this on record today. I was reviewing one of the 
prisons in my riding. They are so concerned about the criminals. 
They are getting tougher and tougher on criminals. I must admit 
that the Liberals are trying to do a job. They instituted ``Project 
Bleach'' in my riding. Matsqui Prison is a medium security 
prison with zero tolerance for drugs, which is commendable. 
That is the Liberal policy, zero tolerance for drugs. However, 
``Project Bleach'' gives one-ounce bottles of bleach to the 
criminals so they can sterilize their needles for cocaine drug 
intake.
<P>
	This is a tough Liberal government. I think that was one of the 
tougher promises in the red book. Alcohol is also tolerated in 
prisons. I wonder when they are going to come out with a policy 
of putting one-litre bottles of coke on the tables and a little ice 
in case they sneak it through the cells.
<P>
	I do not understand what is wrong with this group. I want to 
talk again a little about the ethics of the government. It is 
concerned about conflict of interest and influence peddling. Let 
us talk about conflict of interest for a minute. The Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services in Cape Breton has an 
agreement and he gets involved in the SHIP agreement, the 
strategic highway improvement program in Nova Scotia. This is 
a federal-provincial agreement, with both funding the projects.
<P>
	What does he do? First of all, the Minister of Transport is not 
even involved in this. The minister of public works says to the 
minister of transportation and highways in Nova Scotia: ``Why 
not upgrade the Fleur-de-Lis trail in our riding''-which is not 
funded by federal-provincial dollars. ``I'll take $26 million out 
of one of the most dangerous highways in Canada-Wentworth 
Bypass and we will move it on down to our riding. We will put 
some people to work and we will get re-elected.'' That is ethics? 
That is the kind of ethics a minister of this government practises.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals promised to move quickly and decisively in 
several ways to address the concerns about conflict of interest 
and influence peddling, and they did that. It only took them 18 
months to move the darned money from the Wentworth bypass 
over to their own riding. They are moving quickly.
<P>
	I will give the Liberals credit for one thing, they sure made a 
lot of promises. They sure moved fast to break them. No matter 
how much they tell the Canadian people that they are making it, 
they are not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member in his speech made very slighting 
references to a series of excellent appointments the government 
has made in the last while to various boards and commissions.
<P>
	He chose to read very selectively from the list of 
accomplishments of the men and women who had been 
appointed to these jobs by reading only their qualifications as 
members of the Liberal Party, which of course would stand 
anyone in good stead, anywhere, anytime. However, the hon. 
member neglected to mention in the course of his very partisan 
remarks the list of qualifications that each of these persons 
possessed in addition to their membership in the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member and his party are moving a 
motion today that has to do with broken promises. In light of 
their constant promise in the blue book to come clean with 
Canadians and tell the truth, would it not behove the hon. 
member to get up in his answer to my question and read the very 
impressive CVs of each of the candidates who were appointed to 
the positions he has just indicated, indicating to the House and 
all Canadians the excellent qualifications they possess, which 
entitled them to be appointed to these positions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it must be a 
coincidence that notwithstanding all of these appointments they 
were all involved in the election campaign, raising money for 
the Liberals. I wonder why in this day and age, with all the good 
executives and other people across the country looking for jobs, 
these ones at the trough just happen to be involved with the 
Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> It is just 
coincidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Long time supporter and 
personal friend of John Savage-I mentioned that; married to 
former Liberal mayor of Vancouver; a former Ontario Liberal 
legislative assistant; a former member of the Quebec Liberal 
executive. It has to be a coincidence. It just cannot be that 
notwithstanding the jobs they did, they were Liberals and they 
got the job.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I do not see anybody who 
was not a card carrying member of any party, nor do I see any of 
the old party from jurassic park, none of the separatists in there, 
no people who just do not get involved in politics. No. The one 
qualification they all have is they are Liberal Party hacks and 
friends. Make no doubt about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say at the outset that I certainly would never take 
a view as pessimistic of the role of Parliament and the work of 
the new Liberal government as my friend opposite has. Perhaps 
we simply see things from different sides of the House.
<P>
	I can assure my constituents and other colleagues in the 
House who would care to listen that my experience in 
Parliament is much more positive than my friend articulates. 
Again, by another dimension of measurement, my experience 
in Parliament is much more satisfying and fulfilling to me, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12476"> 12476 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament, and I hope to my constituents than was my 
experience in the last Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Hopefully we can continue to make things better. To be sure, 
things are not yet ideal. All of us in the House are working to 
improve the way the House represents Canadians in debate and 
in the generation of legislation and in that other area, which 
often goes unnoticed in the House, the area of delegated 
legislation; the field of creation of statutory instruments and 
regulations.
<P>
	The government has made great strides in fulfilling our red 
book commitments for a more open and accountable process 
based on fair play and other principles that they know Canadians 
will endorse. We have made a commitment in the red book to 
review the appointment process to ensure that necessary 
appointments are made on the basis of competence, not political 
affiliation or other criteria.
<P>
	My friend opposite has listed a number of appointments and 
made reference to their relationship and affiliation with the 
Liberal Party. He failed in almost every instance to make 
reference to the abilities of those individuals.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister has said, and I support him 
wholeheartedly on this, one is never going to be prejudiced from 
serving in a part time or full time position for the Government of 
Canada just because the person happens to be a Liberal.
<P>
	We promised accessibility and transparency. I accept that 
things do not necessarily happen overnight around here. One 
does not simply push a button and get exactly what one wants. 
But the process has been in place for over a year and we have 
produced some excellent results.
<P>
	We also undertook to examine the size and relevance of 
existing boards and commissions to achieve cost savings and to 
fill the remaining vacancies in relation to some of these 
agencies, boards, and commissions by way of an improved 
appointment system. The first step to establish an efficient 
appointment system was by means of a thorough review of the 
agencies. More than 350 agencies, boards, and commissions 
were examined, which involved 500 full time positions and 
2,000 part time positions.
<P>
	As a result of the review, 30 per cent of federal boards, 
agencies and commissions have been wound up or streamlined. 
Wound up means gone. We want to eliminate overlap, 
duplication, and to simplify government. Again, this is easy to 
say, tougher to do. We are still working on it. We will continue to 
wind up those agencies that no longer serve a purpose. This 
agency review has improved the accountability regime for 
governor in council appointments, and this enables the 
government to manage these agencies more effectively.
<P>
	The second part of this process, after streamlining the 
agencies and reducing the number, was to improve the 
appointment process. There also the government has done a 
thorough review of the process. We want to make it more open 
and accessible.
<P>
	The role that boards and agencies are expected to play is clear 
and appropriate. When that is the case it is possible to be more 
precise in identifying the qualifications needed by appointees. 
This in turn permits improvements in the recruiting process. In 
this respect the government has made changes in the process for 
these appointments, always keeping in mind accessibility, 
transparency and confidence.
<P>
	The appointment process has been made more open and 
transparent through the advertisement of vacancies for full time 
GIC positions in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. I know a lot of Canadians 
do not wake up with the <I>Canada Gazette</I> on their doorstep, but it 
is one instrument that publicizes for the public record all these 
openings and is disseminated across the country, including to all 
the libraries on the list. All these openings are advertised there. 
People who have an interest will be able to find out when the 
vacancies come open.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	In order to place the advertisements it is necessary to develop 
job profiles that contain job descriptions and selection criteria. 
In those notices there are references to job descriptions and 
selection criteria. All federal agencies are required to provide 
job profiles and these same selection criteria for full time fixed 
positions. The selection criteria are then used to find the most 
competent people to fill these positions.
<P>
	The advertisement of vacancies in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> 
generates a greater pool of candidates and contributes to better 
appointments. Interested individuals send their CVs either to the 
agency or to the minister's office. Some people even send it to 
the Prime Minister's office. At the end of the day these resumes 
and CVs end up in one pile. Each CV is then evaluated in 
accordance with the established selection criteria.
<P>
	This particular process has been in place for nearly a year. As 
I say, it was not in place when we first took over government. It 
may be some time before all of the wrinkles and variations in the 
process are fully dealt with. The improvements have begun. I 
can testify to that.
<P>
	As a Liberal member of Parliament in the last Parliament I sat 
in opposition and watched the appointment process as it was. 
While on the opposition benches we noted what we regarded as 
deficiencies in the process. We did not have much impact on it.
<P>
	In this Parliament we have made a change in the process. 
What is remarkable to me is that after nine years on the 
opposition benches and as a person active in Liberal politics, 
having ended the nine year mandate of the previous 
government, I have had more than one Liberal come to me 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12477"> 12477 </A></B>
<P>
question me as to why it is not  possible for Liberals to get 
appointed to agencies, boards and commissions.
<P>
	To be sure there are many Liberals being appointed. People I 
have worked with in the party have taken note of the fact that 
being a Liberal and just being there is no longer the way one gets 
appointed to an agency, board or commission. One has to have 
the competence. I have passed that message on to many. It is a 
change from what has happened in the past, going back five or 
10 years.
<P>
	The other part of the motion today has to do with 
parliamentary reform. It is a subject I have always taken a great 
interest in. I have said to my spouse and friends that I would be 
willing at the appropriate point in time to lay my career on the 
altar of parliamentary reform. I have not had to do that yet.
<P>
	Parliament is changing. It is reforming. This government 
made a commitment to be a part of the reform process. I have to 
point out something that is very fundamental in understanding 
what drives parliamentary reform. It is almost impossible for a 
government to say that it will and that it does take full 
responsibility for parliamentary reform. A government does not 
own Parliament. A government does not at all times of the day 
drive Parliament. Parliament belongs to its members and 
through them to the electorate of Canada.
<P>
	People must realize that this Parliament is a distinct branch of 
government, distinct from the executive. The lay person who 
has not spent time around the House of Commons or who has not 
studied it in great detail in high school or university might miss 
some of the more obvious distinctions between the executive 
branch of government and Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Let me record my perception that there is a huge difference. If 
Parliament is to be what Canadians expect it to be, it is 
important for members of Parliament and Canadians to 
understand that distinction and to understand what drives 
Parliament and parliamentary reform.
<P>
	The government has gone on record as wanting to play a role 
in the restoration of confidence in Parliament and confidence in 
government. The government can take care of the government 
but it is those of us in Parliament who have to take the 
responsibility for Parliament.
<P>
	It has to be pointed out as well that all ministers of the 
government sit in Parliament. I hope that their focus when they 
sit here is as much parliamentary as it is governmental, but I 
accept that from time to time a minister's role is to account to 
Parliament for the management of his or her portfolio. The 
ministers will not, by the nature of their work, be fundamentally 
involved in driving parliamentary reform.
<P>
	In any event, from the point of view of the government this is 
just not talk. We started with parliamentary reform very early in 
our mandate. In January 1994 we introduced quite significant 
rule changes to open up the parliamentary decision making 
process.
<P>
	The objectives of the reform were to make Parliament more 
relevant and to consult and work with MPs more in the day to 
day decisions of government so that MPs would have a greater 
impact on those day to day decisions. We have to keep in mind 
that outside of Parliament there is a vast public service which is 
loyal and operates 99.9 per cent of the time within the law in 
accordance with the mandate which comes to it by statute or by 
policy. We also wanted to give MPs a greater role in influencing 
legislation as it developed.
<P>
	That is what the government said it wanted to give 
Parliament. I would like to repeat that it is not as much for the 
government to give than it is for MPs to take. The history of this 
place includes the history of all the British Parliaments. Over 
time, parliamentarians have given their lives to ensure there was 
a Parliament which would work. We in this country are the 
beneficiaries of that history. All of us ought to subscribe to the 
philosophy where we accept the burden of making Parliament 
work and take the obligation to reform it to make it vital and 
responsive to Canadians.
<P>
	We made four changes in the rules of this place at the behest of 
the government. Committees of the House, which are a very 
vital part of Parliament, may now draft bills. Those are not just 
words. That was done.
<P>
	Bill C-69 was drafted in committee. I sat on that committee. 
It was a tedious exercise. It is one which MPs are not used to, to 
actually meticulously draft a bill. We needed a lot of help but we 
got it done. It was a big job and there is room for more of that in 
this Parliament.
<P>
	Bills can now be referred to a committee before the second 
reading vote. That is the point in time when Parliament approves 
a bill in principle. By referring it to a committee before the 
second reading vote, before approval in principle, it provides 
the committee with much more latitude to make changes or 
additions to the bill. The committee is not bound by the 
principles articulated in the bill which would have been adopted 
at second reading.
<P>
	That is a very important change. We have already seen the 
benefit of it several times in this Parliament, including the 
Marine Transportation Security Act, the amendments to the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and the amendments to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. I sat on that 
particular exercise and found it useful. There are a couple of 
other bills coming into the House where we believe colleagues 
may be so disposed as to refer them to committee before 
second reading. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12478"> 12478 </A></B>
<P>
Two of these are Bill C-62 and Bill C-84. My experience is 
that this is a very useful device.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Standing committees of the House will have the power to look 
at the department's future spending priorities. If there is one 
area of work in Parliament where I think Parliament and the 
government has let Canadians down it is in the review of the 
estimates. It is an institutional fault. The estimates procedure as 
it has evolved over many years has left this House almost 
functionless in carefully reviewing government's proposed 
expenditures.
<P>
	The new rules turn the tide and provide another area of work 
for MPs. As a member of Parliament, I cannot say that MPs have 
taken up the challenge. The process is just beginning and the 
proof will be in the pudding. I do not know where it will end up. 
However, if MPs do not take the challenge and work with the 
new procedures, then we may be seen to have been as ineffective 
under the new rules as we were under the old rules. That is 
something which is coming down the pipeline. I for one will 
watch it closely and do my best to make the system work.
<P>
	The finance committee was given the power to report on the 
budgetary policy of the Government of Canada. That was a 
specific mandate given to a specific committee. There is some 
historical precedent for that.
<P>
	There used to be a committee and I think it was called the 
committee of the whole but it was not the committee in the 
House. It was a standing committee that used to review all of the 
estimates and put its stamp of approval on it at the very end. That 
ended about the time John Diefenbaker ended his career here. He 
was one person who regretted the demise of that particular 
committee and procedure. In any event, we are making an 
attempt to get back to focusing on government expenditure 
policy in the one committee. At least one committee will make 
some macroeconomic comment on it, if I can put it that way.
<P>
	The last thing has to do with Parliament's right and ability to 
require disclosure from Canadians. In this place we call it the 
power to call for persons and papers. It basically consists of 
requiring people to attend, give answers to questions and 
produce documents much like the power a subpoena would have.
<P>
	There are a number of things developing in this Parliament 
where we will have an opportunity as a House to reconfirm the 
rights and authorities that we have as a Parliament to require 
disclosure. Over the last decades we have not used it. We have 
accepted an ill advised view of the executive branch of 
government that we really do not have those powers. However, 
we do. Parliament does and at the end of the day we may exercise 
them at committee and on the floor the House.
<P>
	I hope when these parliamentary tests both in the House and in 
the other place come up this year or next, MPs will make the 
right decision to confirm those powers which have been passed 
on to us over a number of generations of parliamentary history. 
It is a challenge and I hope my colleagues will not let us down. I 
am sure they will not, but the challenge will not be here until it 
gets here. I invite MPs to play a role in that vital element of 
parliamentary reform when it gets here.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was glad to listen to my hon. friend. I have had the pleasure of 
sitting on at least one committee with the member and really 
respect his fair mindedness, hard work and good judgment.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would comment on a situation that has 
been troubling me.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	At times all members of a committee would like to see a 
policy or a decision go a particular way. There is general 
agreement. The hon. member in his years in Parliament 
probably has seen more than one instance of this in a committee.
<P>
	However, word comes down from on high, from the minister 
or the department that it is not the recommendation that is 
wanted from the committee. Therefore government members on 
the committee tend to have to move in the direction they are 
told.
<P>
	I wonder if the member, even without commenting on any 
instance of this, could propose or suggest a way that we could 
deal with the situation so that members on a committee have a 
greater ability to put their own judgment forward. Is there a 
procedure he has thought about, a reform or a change that could 
make the situation a little more workable?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of raising this 
question about two weeks ago. I asked a similar question of a 
former prime minister who was prime minister here for many 
years. I thought I could get a crisp answer. He gave a good 
answer but it did not help us at all. It does not have the easy 
answer.
<P>
	Each MP sitting on a committee is part of a party. Members 
realize that they got elected as part of a party in many cases. 
When some direction comes from the team captain, they listen 
carefully.
<P>
	I have found in my experience that as one gets experience 
in parliamentary work and as committees get experience and 
build up a sense of cohesion, a policy base and a policy focus, 
its members are more confident in the views they may take 
and put forward. As to questions that have come up at 
committee where there has been some tilt from the executive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12479"> 12479 </A></B>
<P>
part of government, I can honestly say that I have seen these 
things go both ways.
<P>
	I remember on one committee a few years ago, I had to wait a 
whole year to get through a resolution on a matter where the 
government absolutely did not want that to happen. In the end 
colleagues on the committee on the government side saw the 
right way, acquiesced and it went through. That matter is still a 
matter for this Parliament. It is in the pipeline.
<P>
	It is a matter of generating the self-confidence and the 
knowledge in the field. It is a matter of MPs themselves making 
the right decisions in committee, taking into account their team 
responsibilities and the public policy interests that may be 
involved in a question. In the end, there is no simple answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in this debate on openness brought to us by the Reform Party, I 
heard the hon. member speak of his desire for openness, just as 
his own government dealt extensively with this issue in the red 
book.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to give me his opinion on the 
March 1987 report by the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Solicitor General, which recommended that the Access to 
Information Act apply to all federal institutions, including 
administrative tribunals, the Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member, first, to tell me whether he 
endorses this committee report and, second, to explain to me 
why, after 18 months in power, his own government has not 
ensured openness and free access to information from the House 
of Commons, the Senate, and some public officials reporting 
directly to Parliament, including the Chief Electoral Officer, the 
Commissioner of Official Languages, and the Auditor General. 
None of these people is subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	How does he explain that, after 18 months of Liberal 
government and especially 30 years of Liberal rhetoric on 
openness, people in Canada and Quebec do not yet have access 
to basic information, which would ensure openness in public 
administration?
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, this country has some of the most 
advanced access to information legislation in the world. I did 
not arrive in this place until 1988 but I did sit on committee with 
the chair of the committee who played a great role in the report 
referred to by the hon. member.
<P>
	I believe there is a role to expand the ambit of access to 
information. By the same token I am sure the member opposite 
will agree there are some areas of government that simply are 
not conducive to full and complete access.
<P>
	Where do we draw the line? Which agencies will be accessible 
via open access to information and which will be on the schedule 
as not being fully open to access? Even agencies that are on the 
schedule and cannot be accessed completely and 
comprehensively provide information with exclusion, for 
example, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service. Many 
others will provide information with some exclusions.
<P>
	Parliament has never been bound by access to information 
statutes or privacy statutes. Parliament in my view never did 
bind itself. Members need not feel restricted by those statutes. If 
a committee of Parliament wants access to an area of 
government, there are no restrictions on Parliament's ability to 
access them. That is something of which all members should be 
aware. These powers have been given to us historically over the 
past centuries. If members want the information, they have the 
ability on the floor or at committee to get that information. For 
heaven's sake, use it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I understand that the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe wishes to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Speaker, could I perhaps have the floor right 
after Question Period? My time has not expired yet, but I would 
prefer not to interrupt my remarks. I would like to deliver my 
comments all at once.

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the CBC has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
the name of free speech to get the permission of the courts to 
show tapes of the Bernardo trial.
<P>
	Has it asked Canadians if they want to see these shocking 
visuals? I want to know and the people of Canada want to know 
what can be done to protect the families of the victims of the 
Paul Bernardo case from the media.
<P>
	In light the CBC's refusal to respect the rights of the victims' 
families, perhaps the CRTC should be given the power to 
prevent the wasting of tax dollars on this sort of tabloid 
journalism. Some efforts should be made to stop the media from 
its selfish and uncaring attempt to make money and boost 
ratings at the expense of the privacy of the families of the 
victims with total disregard for the rights of Canadian children.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members have always opposed any 
attempt to abolish the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	However, some Reform, Conservative, NDP and Liberal 
members, including the Liberal member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, gave their support to the 
Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada, by tabling 
petitions asking the House of Commons to abolish the Official 
Languages Act.
<P>
	The government is guilty of double talk. How else can we 
explain the closure of the only French speaking military college 
in Canada? How else can we explain the evasive answers to our 
questions on the insignificant attention given to French as a 
working language in the federal administration, in Ottawa and in 
Hull?
<P>
	This government wilfully contravenes the Official Languages 
Act. That is confirmed by the reports of the Commissioner of 
Official Languages, and also by the actions of Liberal members.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I should point out here that, 
when tabling a petition in this House, a member does not have to 
support or reject that petition. In fact, the Chair asks members to 
refrain from making comments when they table petitions.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because of a court decision yesterday, same sex couples can now 
adopt children in Ontario. Although the nuclear family is the 
basic unit throughout all societies on earth and standard 
throughout all ages of history, this definition can now be 
quashed at the stroke of a pen by one man acting in one court. 
This is a sad day for the family in Canada.
<P>
	I remind the government that polls show that 67 per cent of 
Canadians believe that same sex adoption is a negative 
development. I would remind the government that the Liberal 
Party voted solidly against changes in the definition of the 
family. I remind the government that a provincial bill 
authorizing same sex adoptions was resoundingly defeated not 
one year ago in the Ontario legislature.
<P>
	Who runs this country, one man in one court in one province, 
or the people of Canada? The courts are embracing a public 
policy shift far removed from the people. The federal 
government bears a solemn responsibility to do whatever it can 
to fight this trend, to fight to protect the institution that forms 
the basis of our society. We must continue the fight for the 
nuclear family.

the Petawawa National Forestry Institute.
<P>
	This forest research laboratory, surrounded by 41 square 
miles of its own recorded research forest and history, is closing. 
Not only is this institute the oldest recorded research forest in 
Canada, but it is known nationally and internationally by top 
scientists. Tourists have come from around the world to visit it.
<P>
	With its impending closure, we are witnessing a brain drain. 
Some scientists have indicated their departure to other areas 
outside Canada and others will be obliged to take early 
retirement even though their interests and hearts are still with 
the Canadian Forest Service.
<P>
	It is rather ironic that trees that have come to the MPs in both

Forest Week have come from the Petawawa National Forestry 
Institute.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike 
his federal counterpart, the Quebec finance minister decided 
to tackle the deficit in his very first budget. In just one year, 
he will reduce Quebec's deficit by one third. By comparison, 
the Liberals only managed to reduce the federal deficit by 10 
per cent with their first budget. The cuts in transfers to the 
provinces announced  in last February's federal budget will 
deprive Quebec of $650 million in 1996-97 and $1.9 billion 
in 1997-98. Yet, the finance minister has the nerve to criticize 
Quebec's budget.
<P>
	Did the federal Minister of Finance spend the first year of his 
mandate trying to figure out how he was going to tackle the 
federal deficit, only to come up with this idea of offloading it

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we have leaned that an Ontario provincial court judge has 
ruled that laws prohibiting adoption by homosexual couples are 
contrary to the charter of rights.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has frequently insisted that including 
sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act as he has 
promised to do will be in accordance with the wishes of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The courts and not the legislatures are making the law in the 
country. In the face of the Ontario court judgment, how can the 
minister be so confident about how his legislation will be 
interpreted?
<P>
	A recent Angus Reid poll demonstrates conclusively 
two-thirds of Canadians disagree with the Ontario court and do 
not wish to extend adoption rights to homosexual couples. The 
Ontario legislature refused to do this last year. In the same way, 
Canadians overwhelmingly oppose the minister's plan to amend 
the human rights act.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice must reconsider his promise to add 
sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act and 
represent the wishes of Canadians, unlike the provincial court 
has done.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a day

the bureaucrats, not by elected representatives.
<P>
	A few examples are all I can give in one minute but there is the 
Hughes contract with Transport Canada officials, a $377 million 
contract that got way out of hand. Another Hughes contract is 
with the defence department which even the minister has not 
been able to figure out yet. External Affairs transfer costs were

<P>
	Instead of acting as spokespersons for the bureaucracy, it is

deputy ministers and directors general directly responsible for 
their actions.
<P>
	Because termination is currently very costly, the system 
keeps senior bureaucrats on even when they work at cross 
purposes with elected politicians.

	If cabinet is prepared to return to responsible government, 
Parliament may eventually be able to do its job of protecting the

<P>
	Environment Canada and FISH have been working together

audit by his office involving more than 300 public servants. The 
results are alarming. It appears that 33 per cent of federal public 
servants are afraid to lose their jobs if they blow the whistle on 
cases of conflict of interest involving their boss. Even worse, 60 
per cent of senior managers would take no action if the process 
for awarding a contract to a single supplier was clouded in any

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAINTEDBLOOD">TAINTED BLOOD</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Health. When the 
Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada started 
its proceedings, Commissioner Krever announced that he did 
not intend to start a witch hunt by identifying the people 
responsible for this situation but would suggest ways to correct 
the deficiencies in the blood supply system.
<P>
	Considering the very serious revelations made yesterday in 
Toronto, does the minister intend to intervene and ask 
Commissioner Krever to make recommendations for possible 
legal action against those responsible for the tainted blood 
scandal at the conclusion of his inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we must let Justice Krever continue his inquiry and 
finish his work. I do not intend to interfere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
must admit we have a problem. We have blood purchased from 
prisons in the U.S. that contaminated the Canadian blood supply 
system and, in the process, dozens and dozens of Canadians. We 
have a commissioner who announced at the outset that he was 
not there to look for the guilty parties, and we have a minister 
who does not intend to take her duties seriously. We have a 
problem.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Health agree that she has the authority 
to ask cabinet to take action and ask Justice Krever to change his 
position and ensure that charges are laid in connection with what 
happened, when the commission finishes its work? Does she 
agree that is the case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the purpose of this inquiry is to find out what happened 
in the eighties and make sure that everything has been done to 
ensure this does not happen again. That is the purpose of the 
inquiry.
<P>
	We asked Justice Krever to continue this inquiry. We support 
this inquiry, we provided $12 million in funding, and we must 
let Justice Krever do his job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering the serious revelations made before the Krever 
Commission and the reply we were given just now by the 
minister who told us that the purpose of the inquiry was to 
ensure this would not happen again, does the minister not realize 
that she is supposed to be responsible for the health of 
Canadians, that Canadians agree this should not happen again 
but also want the guilty parties taken to court and punished for 
needlessly contaminating hundreds of Canadians?
<P>

Speaker, I will not comment on testimony now before the Krever 
Commission.

and approved by the Department of Health.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Health explain that blood 
Connaught imported into Canada from American prisons could 
have entered the country without being inspected by Health 
Canada? Could she explain that to us?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will repeat it in the other official language of the 
House.
<P>
	We have asked Justice Krever to do an official inquiry into the 
happenings of the early 1980s. We are allowing Justice Krever 
to continue his work of looking into what happened to make sure 
it does not happen again.
<P>
	That work is continuing. We support that work. We await the 
outcome of his work.

happened and whether present officials are involved in this 
matter?

Speaker, Justice Krever has full authority to examine 
everything that happened. He has already examined what 
happened at the provincial level. Now he is talking to the 
people at the

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the auditor general's report our public servants' 
knowledge of ethics guidelines is mediocre at best.
<P>
	Today's report estimates that 57 per cent of senior managers 
are either unaware or could not mention any element of the 
policy governing the ethical conduct of civil servants. This is 
hardly a ringing endorsement of the red book promise of 
restoring public confidence in government.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. How does the 
government account for the fact that 57 per cent of its senior 
civil servants are not aware of their own ethics guidelines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a limited and random sample was taken by the auditor 
general in four departments of the government involving less 
than 400 people.
<P>
	There were some statistics as a result of that, but I am very 
happy to report that 86 per cent of public servants felt the ethics 
standards were very high. The auditor general said that when it 
comes to comparisons with other governments or with the 
private sector there is nobody that surpasses the ethics standards 
of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party recognizes that the ethical conduct of the majority 
of public servants is beyond reproach. Our concern is with the 25 
per cent who would accept goods and services at cost for their 
own personal use and the 30 per cent who would think it is 
appropriate to hire their brothers-in-law. Surely the Prime 
Minister would be relieved to find out that bureaucrats were not 
asked about sons-in-law.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Given the fact that a notable 
proportion of the public servants would not report such 
unethical behaviour, will the government introduce legislation 
to protect whistleblowers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, he points out the 30 per cent. How about the 70 per cent 
that quite clearly understood the question and gave the 
appropriate answer?
<P>
	There are systems in place that properly protect the ethics and 
the cost efficiency of operations of the government. There is an 
open bidding system. There are contract review boards to help 
ensure that it is all properly handled and above board. That is the 
essence of this. Furthermore training is provided for our 
employees. It has been subscribed to in even greater numbers 
over the last few years.
<P>
	I think we are in good shape and I think that is what the auditor 
general is also saying.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
President of the Treasury Board talks about the training and the 
auditor general has proposed that we introduce training, 
reporting and, more important, leadership from the top down.
<P>
	The auditor general emphasized that it is the responsibility of 
the Prime Minister and his cabinet to provide ethical leadership 
and suggested that ethic counsellors be appointed in every 
government department.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the 
government lead by example and implement the auditor 
general's recommendation for an ethical framework for public 
servants, including establishing truly independent ethics 
counsellors starting with the cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are doing precisely that. We have a framework for 
ethics, and the red book is a great demonstration of that.
<P>
	Since we formed the government, through the initiatives of 
the Prime Minister an ethics counsellor has been put in place. 
There is a lobbyist certification for all contracts. The Lobbyist 
Registration Act has been amended. There is a conflict of 
interest and post-employment code for public office holders.
<P>
	A great deal has been done to ensure confidence in the 
integrity of the system. I think the auditor general already 
recognizes that we are building on a very strong base.

<P>
	Yesterday, the auditor general released a report-to which my 
colleague alluded moments ago- regarding ethics in the 
government, which was based on a survey of 329 federal public 
servants. It revealed that 46 per cent of those surveyed would not 
intervene to prevent a member of their family from being hired 
and that 33 per cent of them feel that they would be putting 
themselves at risk if they were to point out a conflict of interest 
implicating their boss.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12486"> 12486 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that these figures are 
unacceptable and that they are the symptoms of the very serious 
problem that the public service has with ethics? Is it not the 
government's responsibility to react quickly to remedy the 
situation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Yes and 
the government is acting quickly, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	We have certainly brought to the attention of the deputy 
ministers in all departments that they are to get the proper 
information to all employees so that the policies of the 
government are followed.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that 91 per cent of public servants 
would report a significant fraud or illegal activity and that 78 
per cent of public servants recognize there are very high ethics 
within their departments and within the operations of the 
government.
<P>
	The vast majority understands the code. They read the code. 
They are given it. They all sign in writing that they have read it 
and fully understand it.
<P>
	We will continue to ensure that the code is followed and that 
the highest ethical standards are followed both in the public 
service and in the government itself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
that 12 per cent of all senior officials see nothing wrong with 
altering contract specifications to give a certain tenderer the 
edge, a very serious act, will the Deputy Prime Minister 
acknowledge that the government hierarchy is riddled with 
problems with ethics and that, unfortunately, the example comes 
from on high?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many of the people who were sampled, as I indicated 
before, are not in a position to make those kinds of decisions.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the ethics standards are important for all people 
in the public service to be aware of. The government, as I have 
said already in answering the question, is making every move to 
comply with what the auditor general has said. We have no 
disagreement with the auditor general whatsoever and are 
already taking steps to ensure that is implemented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in news 
reports released today the auditor general disclosed that 12 per 
cent of senior managers believe it is appropriate to undermine 
competition for a contract at the request of a supervisor. 
Furthermore one in three public servants would not intervene to 
stop it. Nor would they report it.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. How 
widespread is the undermining of the open bidding process? 
What checks are in place, if any, to prevent such unethical 
behaviour?
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope that the opposition, particularly the Reform 
Party, realizes that it has several people asking the same 
question.
<P>
	As I have indicated before, there are systems in place. There is 
an open bidding system. There are in fact contract review 
boards. There are codes of behaviour which are known to all of 
our employers. The vast majority recognize the good ethical 
standards which need to be followed.
<P>
	The system is working well. There is always room for 
improvement. We certainly agree with the auditor general. 
However, the auditor general also said that in terms of 
comparison with the private sector or with other governments, 
the ethics standards of this government and its public service are 
very high indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is 
despicable that any senior manager would even consider

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	In a letter to his Quebec counterpart, the minister rejected 
rather casually the $333 million in claims submitted by Quebec 
to the federal government. These claims include reimbursement 
of the costs incurred during the Oka crisis, the federal 
contribution to the education of aboriginal peoples in northern 
Quebec, and stabilization payments.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs assure us that, 
when he meets with his Quebec counterpart next Monday, he 
will be more open to Quebec's claims than he was in the letter he 
made public yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the claims mentioned in the letter to Minister 
Beaudoin were submitted a while ago and dealt with under a 
totally proper and standard procedure.
<P>
	In the case of the Kanesatake claims, the federal government 
has already paid a certain amount, and the remaining bills are 
being audited by the auditor general, who will report back to us 
within a few months. This equitable, normal procedure will 
allow us to resolve the problems in this matter according to the 
usual standards governing relations between the federal 
government and the provinces.
<P>
	The two other cases are similar, and we also expect the 
process to achieve equitable results. Therefore, the letter 
referred to by the opposition is totally proper and in line with 
good federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to the claim relating to the education of 
aboriginal peoples in northern Quebec, how can the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs wriggle out of his responsibilities 
under the James Bay Agreement and argue that the matter is 
progressing normally, when the first claims in this matter were 
submitted in 1986-87? Is a ten year delay normal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the facts are not as presented by the hon. member. 
In fact, the federal government has so far spent some $450 
million on native education.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	In this matter, the Province of Quebec refuses to implement 
the provisions of the agreement and to submit the various 
budgets to joint approval. That is why the federal government 
paid an amount equal to estimated costs. We asked Quebec to 
present us with its bill so that we could pay the balance.
<P>
	Again, this is proper procedure, and unfortunately in this case 
the Parti Quebecois is preventing us from settling this matter 
once and for all.

cannot be mistaken for a Liberal government.

continuing on this topic of wasteful spending, the minister

Cannes festival. What an expensive night at the movies.

<P>
	There is some confusion as to why the Prime Minister did not 
attend the military parade in Moscow. The Prime Minister said 
he boycotted the parade to protest against the war Russia is 
currently waging against the Chechens. On the other hand, the 
Prime Minister's assistants denied repeatedly that he had 
refused to attend, arguing that the parade had never been on the 
Prime Minister's agenda.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister explain the discrepancy 
between the statements made by the Prime Minister, who said he 
had boycotted the parade, and his assistants, who said that he 
was never scheduled to attend?

	How can the Government of Canada think that the Russian 
president would take seriously this symbolic protest against 
Russia's attitude in the Chechen conflict when in the same 
breath, in the same interview, the Prime Minister stated that the 
top priority for the Canadian government was to increase trade 
with Russia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that the fact the 
Prime Minister chose to boycott the military parade along with 
all the other heads of state does not take anything away from the 
message to the Russian government.
<P>
	That said, it is also obvious, as the Prime Minister indicated, 
that the celebrations marking V-E Day reflected the fact that 27 
million Russians lost their lives in World War II. That is why he 
wanted to be there, with the other heads of state, to celebrate 
V-E Day, without forgetting what is going on in Chechnya. He

<P>
	In his last budget, the Minister of Finance announced that 
immigrants and refugees would have to pay a $975 tax to be able 
to gain permanent resident status in Canada. We have learned 
that the Mississauga processing centre alone rejected over 4,000 
applications for settlement, between February 27 and April 28, 
because claimants could not pay that tax.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Immigration, who pledged that no 
immigrant or refugee would be adversely affected by this new 
tax, explain that 4,000 applications processed in Mississauga 
were rejected for the sole reason that claimants did not have the 
means to pay that $975?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is basing his 
question on an article in <I>La Presse</I>. The report is wrong. The 
reporter was called and a clarification is forthcoming.
<P>
	Let me outline for the member and the House the real 
numbers. Since the budget of February, some 18,000 cases have 
been processed. Of these, some 3,800 were processed without 
the landing fees attached. Therefore, they were not rejected. 
They were returned to the applicant for the fees to be attached. 
Those fees are now being attached and the applicants are 
reapplying quickly.
<P>
	On top of it all, of the 18,000 applications since February, 
only 3 per cent, some 400 cases out of 18,000, have requested a 
loan. I cannot suggest, based on those facts, that the fee is 
imposing the kind of hardship the member wants to impress 
upon the House.
<P>
	In addition, applications have gone up since the budget, not 
down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
the minister's denial, which we will look into, the situation is 
serious and is getting worse.
<P>
	How can the minister persist in denying the adverse effect of 
such a tax, given that, in two thirds of the cases, his department 
rejects loan applications from immigrants and refugees, on the 
grounds that they are insolvent?

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

is one thing. If he wants to look at the facts and have a 
reasonable discussion, that is something else.
<P>
	He says that the fee will jeopardize refugee cases. Let us look 
at the situation. A claimant coming to Canada makes a refugee 
claim to the best system in the world. As a result of the 
government's action last year, the claimant will also be able to 
work. If the claimant is accepted, he or she has the most 
important priority they were seeking-protection, refuge, 
sanctuary in the best country in the world. And they will get that.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

that. In the preparation of Bill C-68 we had the most intensive, 
most widespread, and most prolonged consultation conducted 
personally by a Minister of Justice that this country has seen.

Bill C-68 was ``extremely, extremely minimal''. I ask the

drafting and preparation of Bill C-68.

the Criminal Code under section 318: first, they have to get prior

agencies to ensure that our streets are free from this disgusting 
activity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the features of section 
318 to which the hon. member has referred were intended at the 
time of introduction as an effort to balance on the one hand the 
need to have in the criminal law a sanction for those who spread 
hatred and on the other a recognition of the freedom of 
expression. That difficult balance may not be achieved perfectly 
in the code and perhaps there is room for improvement.

	The code is under review. Also, our campaign commitment to 
create a round table on hatred chaired by a member of the

of the code to which the hon. member referred will be 
considered in that context.
<P>

expression of hatred that inspired the introduction of Bill C-41

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

issue that was before the court in the case that was decided 
yesterday.
<P>
	What was at issue yesterday was the constitutional validity of 
a provincial enactment dealing with the rights of adoption. That 
is entirely within the provincial sphere. What is intended by this

with discrimination based on sexual orientation.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance will know that the latest 
Statistics Canada report on unemployment shows that 56,000 
women gave up looking for work in the month of April, sending 
the labour force participation rate for women over the age of 25 
down to its lowest rate in 11 years. He will also note that the 
participation rate for youth has fallen by 8 per cent since 1990, 
and the small drop in the unemployment rate last month was due 
entirely to people leaving the labour market.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that this is a disgraceful performance 
by the economy which is supposed to be in a recovery and which 
needs massive job creation if there is any real hope of meeting 
the problems of the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the course of 
the last year the Canadian economy, thanks to the 
competitiveness of Canadians, has produced a large number of 
jobs. In the the last year it has produced a record number of jobs; 
over 433,000. In the last quarter the private sector has produced 
over 100,000 jobs.
<P>
	As a result of the activities and the greater productivity of 
Canadians, as well as the investment climate in which the 
government has certainly played an important role, the job 
creation capacity of the economy is stronger than it has been for 
a long time.
<P>
	That does not mean there are not major problems. The hon. 
member has identified them in terms of women's participation, 
in terms of the participation of youth, and the hangover from the 
terrible recession of 1990 to 1993.
<P>
	As a result, the very strenuous activities, fundamental 
reforms and the vision of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development are so important to the building of the country.

	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
National Revenue.
<P>
	In March 1994 the government introduced an anti-smuggling 
initiative to combat contraband such as cigarettes, alcohol, 
drugs and firearms. I ask the parliamentary secretary what 
progress Canada customs has made in stopping the flow of 
contraband goods at our borders.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	I am pleased to announce that as recently as Monday, May 8 a 
customs detector dog identified 25 pounds of cocaine hidden in 
luggage at Pearson airport worth an estimated $5 million in 
street value. On Saturday, May 6 another customs detector dog 
uncovered $7.5 million worth of hashish at Mirabel airport. On 
April 29 Revenue Canada seized another $4.4 million worth of 
cocaine at Pearson airport.
<P>
	That represents a seizure of $16.9 million of illegal drugs by 
Revenue Canada in less than 10 days. The minister, the customs 
officers and our fine nosed dogs, Shad and Buck, should be 
congratulated.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to take the floor regarding the 
Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12493"> 12493 </A></B>
<P>
Party's motion condemning the government for its lack of 
transparency and its inability to keep its red book election 
promises regarding the accountability of MPs to the 
electorate.
<P>
	Above all, I would like to thank my Reform Party colleagues 
for introducing this motion condemning the government and the 
least I can say is that it is timely.
<P>
	I therefore would like to take advantage of my time to bring to 
the attention of this House what I think is the most important 
point in this motion: the Liberals' lack of transparency. Indeed, 
day in, day out, these first 18 months of the Liberal 
government's mandate are far from shining examples of 
transparency, both as regards political appointments-a point 
which my colleague from Berthier-Montcalm irrefutably 
demonstrated this morning-and contract awarding and 
management. It is obvious that the promise of transparency 
contained in the red book was a trick to fool the Canadian public. 
Just smoke and mirrors to get elected.
<P>
	Regarding the Reform Party's motion on the Liberal 
government's lack of transparency, I would like to raise the 
following issues in the House: firstly, the status quo regarding 
access to information since the Liberals acceded to power and, 
secondly, the role of lobbyists in the management of this 
government's affairs.
<P>
	The Access to Information Act was passed in 1982 and went 
into effect the following year. It gives people the right to obtain 
federal government documents. Under this act, government 
institutions must give people access to their documents. 
Logically, we would have expected the Liberal government to 
rigorously apply the Access to Information Act, given the 
promises of transparency contained in the red book which the 
Liberal Party of Canada trumpeted so loudly during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	On the contrary, after 18 years of Liberal reign, government 
bodies such as the House of Commons, the Senate and certain 
positions reporting directly to Parliament, such as the Chief 
Electoral Officer, the Commissioner of Official Languages and 
the Auditor General of Canada are still not subject to the Access 
to Information Act. Another example, that of Atomic Energy of 
Canada, is particularly striking. Why has this body never come 
under access to information legislation? Does such a dangerous 
and polluting energy have to be developed in the utmost secrecy, 
far from public scrutiny? I ask the question.
<P>
	What about the transparency described in the red book? Why 
not make Canada's Parliament subject to the Access to 
Information Act, since it is the ultimate symbol of democracy in 
the Canadian federal system? In this context, the Bloc 
Quebecois, the official opposition, in the name of democratic 
principles and through its desire for greater transparency in the 
present system, has no choice but to support the report of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General of March 
1987, which recommended that the Access to Information Act 
be applied to all federal institutions, including administrative 
tribunals, the Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois gives particular importance to increased 
transparency in the Senate, our dear Senate.
<P>
	The public is entitled to be able to study in depth the wild 
imaginings of this body, which is nothing more than a place for 
political appointments. Given the political context in Canada 
since the reign of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1970s, we 
stress the urgent need for such transparency throughout the 
entire administration of federal institutions.
<P>
	The events of the last few years, especially those involving 
the conduct of government members, raise serious doubts as to 
the Liberal government's political will to establish a code of 
conduct ensuring total openness in public administration. The 
red book promises are pure fantasies needed to ease the 
Liberals' conscience and to make Canadian federalist 
democracy look good.
<P>
	Throughout the fall 1993 election campaign, the Liberal Party 
of Canada maintained that ethics would be an important part of 
its mandate. In the January 1994 throne speech, the government 
claimed that it attached the utmost importance to integrity and 
that it wanted to enjoy the people's confidence. It would 
therefore appoint an ethics counsellor to watch over government 
integrity and restore public confidence. So what happened? The 
ethics counsellor, who was appointed by the Liberal 
government, still reports to the Privy Council. He has no 
independent power of investigation and continues to report to 
the Prime Minister. The official opposition has often pointed out 
in the House that this hurts credibility.
<P>
	According to the Liberal Party's red book, government 
integrity is in question every time people feel that lobbyists set 
public policy by wielding undue influence behind the scenes.
<P>
	Recent events show that the whole Liberal strategy regarding 
a parliamentary code of ethics, confirmed by a government 
motion tabled in this House some 10 days ago, is just a smoke 
screen. The Broadcasting Act, which comes under the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, is no match for the powerful lobby for 
PowerDirecTv, a company run by André Desmarais, the Prime 
Minister's son-in-law. The Liberal government even started 
defending ideas that Brian Mulroney's Conservative 
government held dear, turning into the advocate of 
competitiveness in North America.
<P>
	Reading the ministerial orders from the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, one can only bow before the powerful lobby for 
PowerDirecTv and kiss democracy goodbye at the federal level, 
where money and political friends rule.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12494"> 12494 </A></B>
<P>
	The weakness of our political institutions and representatives 
is cause for concern. Not only does the government flout its own 
law and disown the CRTC, which is responsible for its 
application, but it takes retroactive measures preventing 
Expressvu, a competitor, from starting to provide service in 
September. All that in the name of competitiveness. In the 
meantime, the ethics counsellor promised in the red book is 
cooling his heels in the Prime Minister's outer office. And what 
about the recent visit of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to 
Los Angeles, where he was to meet with the majors of the 
American film industry.
<P>
	The facts are as follows: three weeks ago, Edgar Bronfman 
Junior, an American citizen, and Seagram announced the 
takeover of the American giant MCA, a multi-million dollar 
deal. This announcement was made from a Los Angeles hotel, 
with the heritage minister in the next room. So far, no problem, 
or so it seemed. But it must be pointed out that MCA holds 20 
per cent of the shares of Cineplex, a Canadian company 
controlled by another branch of the Bronfman empire.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	MCA also wants to control Cineplex by merging with 
Cinemark USA Inc., whose head office is in Dallas. The trip 
made to Los Angeles by the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
makes me wonder, considering that Edgar Bronfman Junior 
seems to be trying to convince the federal government that MCA 
is a Canadian company, so as to avoid a review by Investment 
Canada. This is the kind of transparency displayed by the 
government.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, according to the government's official 
policy, companies actively involved in the cultural sector must 
be controlled by Canadian interests. This explains why Mr. 
Bronfman is trying to give a Canadian identity to MCA. Under 
the circumstances, it becomes obvious that the real purpose of 
the minister's trip to Los Angeles was to reassure Liberal 
friends, namely Seagram, of the federal government's support.
<P>
	While the government House leader is tabling a motion to 
establish a special committee to develop a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians, that same government violates the most basic 
rules of democracy by favouring friends of the Liberal Party and 
by governing on behalf of the Canadian financial establishment.
<P>
	Another example which illustrates the political trickery of the 
red book, and which also shows the flaws of Bill C-43 regarding 
the ethics counsellor, is the letter sent by the heritage minister to 
the CRTC, supposedly an independent body under his authority, 
in support of a licence application.
<P>
	It must be remembered that the Prime Minister waited more 
than three weeks before seeking the ethics counsellor's advice 
on this sensitive issue. How can we not come to the conclusion 
that the Prime Minister cares little about the ethics counsellor 
and, therefore, about ethics?
<P>
	The Liberal leader simply wanted to save face. The 
appointment of an ethics counsellor and the Liberals' campaign 
promise to that effect were supposed to give the public the 
impression that the government is really doing something about 
restoring the integrity of our institutions.
<P>
	In the West, democratic institutions are now facing a crisis in 
public confidence. It is clear that in the future, it will be 
necessary to restore the trust that should exist between 
governments and the public they serve. This means public 
policy must be discussed, debated, influenced, changed and 
identified in a process that is absolutely open and transparent.
<P>
	This is one of the concerns that goes to the very heart of the 
kind of society we want for Quebec. The federal political scene 
has for too long been dominated by the political scheming of the 
Liberals and their friends. The acknowledged expert on 
scheming and adumbration in the political arena is 
unquestionably Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	As Professor Guy Laforest explained, this bourgeois 
aristocrat, this lackey of Canada's financial establishment and 
anti-Quebecer managed, during his many years in power, to 
establish close ties between the Canadian financial 
establishment and the Liberal Party. This political and financial 
network is the engine of Canadian Liberal ideology, a political 
perspective that makes every effort to isolate Quebec, to take 
away its distinct identity and make it a part of Anglo-Canadian 
culture.
<P>
	It is easy to identify the members of this political and 
financial network. They are the ones who keep referring to ``the 
most beautiful country in the world to govern''. The present 
Prime Minister is this network's new lieutenant. We have the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is responsible for Quebec. And 
remember Eddie Goldenberg, the Prime Minister's trusty 
adviser, who happens to be the son of Carl Goldenberg who 
helped Pierre Elliott Trudeau draft his bill for patriation and a 
charter of rights in the summer of 1967.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The Senate still harbours Leo Kolber, one of the Liberal 
Party's great bagmen, childhood friend of Charles Bronfman 
and member of the board at Seagram. Mr. Kolber is also a friend 
of Tom Axworthy, who was Mr. Trudeau's former chief of staff 
and is the current Minister of Human Resources Development's 
brother and the manager of The CRB Foundation, which was set 
up by Mr. Bronfman. As we know, The CRB Foundation is 
greatly involved in promoting Canadian nationalism. And Paul 
Desmarais, Charles Bronfman's equal, is still in Montreal.
<P>
	As Professor Guy Laforest wrote: ``-by boards of trustees 
and collaborators, their networks are interlaced. The Liberal 
planet finds everything it needs in its network. John Rae, one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12495"> 12495 </A></B>
<P>
of the key people at Power Corporation, was one of the most 
important strategists  behind the campaigns of the current 
Prime Minister of Canada''.
<P>
	It is the financial interests of the richest Canadians which 
govern Ottawa, not the elected representatives of the people. 
They are all following in Pierre Elliott Trudeau's tradition, and 
that is having a one track mind when it comes to Quebec: having 
Quebecers assimilate anglo-Canadian values as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	Before our very eyes, once this government got to office, it 
considerably diluted commitments it made in its red book 
during the 1993 election campaign. Such an about face raises in 
the minds of the public a legitimate doubt about whether the 
Liberal government truly intends to legislate ethics in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, believes that, to 
re-establish the integrity of our democratic institutions, we 
must put a stop to the empty promises of the past 30 years to 
legislate parliamentary ethics.
<P>
	In addition, the administration of the affairs of government 
must be as transparent as possible in order to eliminate the grey 
areas and to ensure Canadians that public policy decisions 
reflect the general interests of the people and not those of 
powerful lobbys. However, with the Liberals in power, the 
reality of the matter is something else.
<P>
	In the context of Bill C-43 governing the registration of 
lobbyists, the lobbyists increased their meetings in the months 
before the tabling of this bill. Others threatened suits if the law 
forced them to disclose their political ties. In this instance, as in 
others, a lack of transparency prevented the people of Canada 
from knowing the extent and the nature of lobby activities with 
regard to Bill C-43.
<P>
	We have to admit that Bill C-43 as it stands will not likely 
prevent such troubling events as those surrounding the 
privatization of Pearson airport or the business involving the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. Worse yet, according to Mitchell 
Sharp, the Prime Minister's principal adviser on matters of 
ethics, even if the legislation arising from Bill C-43 had been in 
effect at the time of the discussions on the privatization of 
terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport, the public would have been 
none the wiser.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, presented more 
than twenty amendments in committee on Bill C-43. They were 
rejected by government members who had not even been at the 
hearings or taken part in discussions in recent months.
<P>
	We were also hoping, good players that we are, that the new 
rules, or at least the approach taken and the commitments made 
by the Liberal Party of Canada in its red book would permit in 
depth discussion of this issue, so vital to a democracy.
<P>
	However, we have to admit that the Liberals' intentions with 
regard to transparency and ethics are those of the Bronfman, 
Seagram and Power Corporation families. These measures serve 
solely to impress, with the government using all kinds of lofty 
language to keep up appearances for political reasons.
<P>
	Once again, the federal Liberals' version of history is written 
on the backs of the country's most disadvantaged, and, just as 
obviously, on the back of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should 
like to ask the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe a question 
about an incident that occurred in the House a while ago. 
Perhaps it is a sensitive issue for him. I pose this question with 
all due respect. It is about integrity. It is about respect. It is about 
his feeling of frustration.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	One day when asking questions in question period he became 
frustrated with either the answers or the commentary or the 
behaviour of a minister of the crown or the representative of the 
minister of the crown. I wish the member would share his 
experience with us of the incident in which he stuck to his guns 
and was asked to leave the House. He had to go through a lot. I 
think it is an example of the lack of integrity displayed by 
certain ministers of the crown. If he would like to share that 
incident with us and tell us his true feelings about it, I think it 
would be another example of the lack of integrity of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to 
the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe, I agree with the 
member for Calgary Centre that he raises an issue of great 
sensitivity, but I feel very strongly that we are on the edge.
<P>
	I want to mention a fact regarding the incident being raised. 
Had the member withdrawn, the Chair would have deemed the 
matter closed and would not have allowed the question to 
continue. I will listen attentively to the reply of the member for 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I want to thank my colleague for addressing this issue 
because, as I just said, today, the Reform Party launched a 
debate on a fundamental exercise in democracy, that is, 
openness in government, the role of MPs representing their 
fellow citizens and constituents, and the possibility for each 
member to do his or her job honestly and to act in accordance 
with his or her principles.
<P>
	As for my experience as a member of Parliament, I think I 
have been guided by the desire to do my job very openly and 
honestly. I have been guided by this desire, although I was 
troubled for a while in this House to hear comments, opinions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12496"> 12496 </A></B>
<P>
and answers that went this way and that way, that were 
contradictory. It was obvious to me  that everything was far 
from clear and open in this matter.
<P>
	My conduct as a member of Parliament has been guided by the 
desire to be honest, to act in accordance with my principles, and 
to represent my constituents in a responsible manner. To allow 
MPs to do their job properly, the government must be open and 
answer straightforward questions truthfully. I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to add 
a brief comment. Without expressing a view for or against the 
opinions of either member who just had the floor, I appreciate 
the way both members handled the question and the answer on a 
very delicate and sensitive matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
want to commend the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe for 
his excellent presentation. He correctly identified all aspects of 
the problem. He reminded us that the official opposition had 
proposed amendments. I want to ask him a question which, in 
my opinion, is related to the issue. As he said himself, many 
people seem to have lost confidence in government because they 
see links with large corporations.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that there is a way to change this, 
if only symbolically, for example by providing that political 
parties should be financed only by individuals and that 
businesses should not be allowed to contribute?
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
hon. colleague for his question. Indeed, the hon. member for 
Lévis raises a fundamental issue relating to the democratic 
process and the ability of a government, opposition or third 
party to intervene in public interest issues or matters with 
maximum latitude and independence from lobbies, financial 
networks or any form of lobbying. One approach developed by 
the Quebec government and put in place following years of 
extremely aggressive and stormy debate was party financing.
<P>
	It is clear that when, in an effort to raise funds to pay its for 
publicity, promotion and propaganda bills, a political party has 
to go to large corporations and major financial concerns and that 
there are no regulations as to how much money can be raised and 
from whom, this party may find itself in an extremely difficult 
situation or literally have its hands tied if and when it becomes 
the government or the official opposition. There is no way that a 
political party that gets hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
institutions and corporations can act with complete freedom 
once in office. It is just not true.
<P>
	What happened at the federal level when it was suggested that 
election campaigns and political parties be funded through 
donations from the public at large and not from large 
corporations or labour associations? The federal government 
never had the courage to amend the provisions of the Election 
Act dealing with party financing. In that context, while 
governed by a federal legislation that does not contain any 
restrictions, yet refusing to be attached to any financial concern, 
the Bloc Quebecois decided on its own, during the last federal 
election campaign, to operate under the Quebec legislation 
providing for political parties to be funded solely by donations 
from the public. The Bloc never accepted donations from 
businesses or organizations.
<P>
	With respect to my hon. colleague's question, it is obvious 
that as long as this government will not take the necessary 
steps-and the first one is party financing-to free itself from 
the hold of Power DirecTv, the Bronfmans and the Seagrams of 
this world, with or without a code of conduct, it will continue to 
have its hands tied by these major financial concerns and the 
lobby of backroom boys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate this 
afternoon. I heard a few speeches earlier, including the one 
made by the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe, whose 
arguments were completely out of line.
<P>
	The member made all kinds of suggestions on other bills 
before the House, but not on the issue being debated today.
<P>
	The motion tabled by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its failure to keep its Red 
Book promise to make the government more open and permitting Members of 
Parliament to be more accountable to their constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> What a great idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Frankly this is one of the silliest motions we 
have debated in this Parliament. It is based on a completely false 
premise about what the government has done in the time it has 
been in office. There has hardly ever been a government in 
Canadian history that has so fulfilled the promises it outlined at 
the beginning of its mandate.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>

	In 30 some years of being a participant in this process I 
cannot think of another document that has so affected the 
lives of Canadians and so directed the operations of a govern-

<P>
ment than this red book has done. It has been a guide book of 
promises that the government undertook to do and it has kept 
the promises.
<P>
	I want to quote from the red book because it is extremely 
relevant to the motion before the House. After all the motion 
does mention this little tome. I will read the whole section on 
parliamentary reform. I know this may be a little long for the 
concentration of members opposite but I want to read it in any 
event.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the House of Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a greater 
role in drafting legislation, through House of Commons committees. These 
committees will also be given greater influence over government 
expenditures. More free votes will be allowed in the House of Commons, and 
individual members of Parliament will be involved in an effective pre-budget 
consultation process. We will establish mechanisms to permit parliamentary 
review of some senior Order-in-Council appointments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pension regime of members of Parliament has been the focus of 
considerable controversy. It is now the subject of an independent review, 
which Liberals support. We believe that reform is necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> So why didn't you do it?

listen.

	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I have the same copy right here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am glad to hear it. The hon. member only has 
a page. He should take the whole book home and keep it under 
his pillow. He might sleep better.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever the results of the independent review, a Liberal government will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end ``double-dipping.'' 
MPs should not be able to leave office and receive a pension from the federal 
government if they accept a new full-time paying job from the federal 
government. In addition, we will review the question of the minimum age at 
which pensions will begin to be paid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the Conservative government came to power in 1984, while citing 
the need for economy it nonetheless found the resources to increase both the 
size of political staffs and the pay available to them. These expansions created 
bloated political budgets and inflated salaries for members and friends of the 
Conservative Party. A Liberal government will reduce the size and budgets of 
ministers' offices and the Prime Minister's Office by at least $10 million a 
year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I challenge hon. members opposite to find one statement in 
that whole paragraph on parliamentary reform that has not been 
fulfilled by the government to date. The government has moved 
on every single one of its promises and it has gone further on 
most of them.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite who have been bleating, whining, 
blithering and crying all day should repent. Get off it, I say to 
them, and face the facts. The government has lived up to its 
commitments in full measure. They were all in the red book. 
They were all made manifest for the public to look at and 
consider in an election campaign. The public voted for the red 
book in droves.
<P>
	I know members in the Reform Party in particular do not like 
to hear that fact. They like to hear only the facts from their own 
perspective, their own friends. Their idea of consultation is to 
consult their friends and then say this must be what everybody 
wants. There are Canadians who are not friends of the Reform 
Party. There are lots and lots of them where I come from. I know 
lots and lots who think the Reform Party is quite idiotic. Still 
they are not the people to whom Reformers talk when they want 
a consultation.
<P>
	I want to read why Canadians and particularly the poor souls 
that have been following the Reform Party have been so badly 
deceived. We saw this kind of deception go on in the House the 
other day. I know I cannot imitate the accent but the quotation is 
this. It was on April 27 in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the reasons there is so much public cynicism about politics and 
government is that governments consistently break their promises.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> You can tell that is a perpetual opposition 
party, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This Liberal government, for example, is not yet two years old but already 
it has littered the political landscape with broken promises.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a falsehood. This is completely untrue. I have just read 
the whole section of the red book on parliamentary reform and 
we have complied with every single one of the promises and 
then some. Yet the member for Calgary Southwest had the nerve 
to get up in the House and utter this complete rubbish. I can only 
imagine how much worse it is when the hon. member is off 
speaking to his supporters at meetings around the country. They 
have been thoroughly, totally and utterly deceived by the hon. 
member. If they would simply invite me to some of their 
meetings, we might straighten some of them out. I can name 
about 176 other members of the House who could do a similar 
straightening job on some of the members of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I want to turn to the explicit promises with which we have 
complied. First, there was the promise that committees be 
strengthened, that members be given a greater role. We have just 
been through a procedure in the procedure and House affairs 
committee where we drafted a bill. I was before the Senate 
committee this morning on behalf of the committee defending 
the bill. It was the one drafted in committee. It was adopted by 
the government and then passed in the House.
<P>
	Bills have been referred to committee under the new 
procedures that we adopted in the House shortly after we took 
office where the bill is referred before second reading. 
Members have full scope in the changes they wish to make to 
the bill. The Lobbyists Registration Act is a perfect example 
and there are others. We are going to do it with the CNR bill 
on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12498"> 12498 </A></B>
<P>
Monday. This has given members of Parliament untold powers 
in respect of that  legislation which were not exercised or 
exercisable in the last Parliament.
<P>
	Hon. members in the Reform Party were not here in the last 
Parliament. They do not know how bad it was. They do not know 
how good this is. They do not realize how much they are getting 
out of this. If they had been here before, their complaints would 
be cut in half today.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board introduced changes in the 
expenditure management system so that committees can 
become more involved in the spending priorities of the 
government. We are about to embark on that process in the 
committees very shortly.
<P>
	We have opened up the process. We have given more power to 
committees and I need not recite for members opposite the 
changes to the budget process where the finance committee 
travels Canada to hear Canadians' views on the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Then they come back with their own 
recommendation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Of course they do. What do you set up a 
committee for but to come back with its own recommendations? 
At least they listen, which is more than I can say for the hon. 
members opposite.
<P>
	I want to turn to the question of free votes because hon. 
members are suggesting that somehow we have very few free 
votes. I note it was a red book promise. I just want to talk about 
how well we have delivered on that promise. Every private 
members' bill and motion has been a free vote. We have had 
dozens of them and they have all been free votes.
<P>
	The members of the House, unlike the last Parliament-hon. 
members opposite were not here and do not know how bad it 
was-have had an opportunity to vote on all these bills and 
express their views. We will continue to do that. There may be 
times when other matters will be the subject of a free vote but we 
were elected on a platform, the red book. It is right here. The 
promises are there.
<P>
	If members were elected to serve in this Parliament based on 
that platform, they are expected to vote for the things contained 
in the platform. That is the way political parties work. The 
Reform Party knows that is the way it works. Its members tried 
to do it with their little blue book but unfortunately they have not 
kept their promises, unlike the government.
<P>
	It is quite hypocritical of the Reform Party to put forward this 
motion. We have seen during recent debates how members of the 
Reform Party perceive it to be their duty to represent their 
constituents' interests. Our constituents voted for the policies in 
the red book. Our constituents are getting delivered to them the 
promises that were in the red book.
<P>
	The complaint we are getting from the Reform Party in this 
motion is that the Reform Party wants us to adopt their policies 
and say that is what we promised to Canadians. It is not what we 
promised. We promised something different, something a whole 
lot better. What Canadians are getting is what is in the red book.
<P>
	I want to turn to gun control as a perfect example because this 
bill has widespread support across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Not in my constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member should get the attorney 
general of Saskatchewan to do a poll like the attorney general of 
Alberta did. The poor old attorney general of Alberta came to 
Ottawa to complain about the bill, having conducted a poll that 
discovered 64 per cent of the electors of his province do not 
agree with him.
<P>
	The poor soul must be gravely misguided, if not something 
worse. I can only suggest to the hon. member that he take a good 
look at what is happening in his constituency and conduct a 
proper scientific poll, not one of the pay as you phone in polls 
for which the Reform Party is so well known.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to turn to the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest, 
who is here, I am delighted to say. I know he is a caring person. 
He conducted a poll in his riding and I understand he may have 
recanted his heresy at second reading and will now support the 
government on the bill. I congratulate him for showing a little 
independence of judgment. It is very rare on that side.
<P>
	The hon. member who is doing all the hooting and hollering 
over there should talk to the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest and conduct a poll in his riding and he might find 
himself constrained to vote with the government as well.
<P>
	The Reform Party is well aware-as is the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, of all members to have moved this 
motion, because he is on the procedure and House affairs 
committee-that we looked into all these things like free votes, 
recall, initiative, and referenda. We called witnesses and heard 
experts on all these subjects in the committee. We considered 
the matter and the committee tabled a report in the House. The 
majority of members of the committee disagreed with the 
Reform Party position and thought that referenda were 
unnecessary on a massive scale in Canada, that recall was not an 
idea worthy of importing into the political climate of the country 
at this time, and that initiative was unneeded. Reform members 
disagreed, but it does not mean we were wrong. It certainly was 
not something we promised in the red book.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12499"> 12499 </A></B>
<P>
	I encourage hon. members of the Reform Party to live up to 
the promise they made on their little blue book to publish the 
results of their caucus meetings and the votes in caucus. I see the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre has one. Those things are rare 
as hens' teeth. When we consider how many of the promises 
have been broken, I can understand why.
<P>
	I have a book here that I would be glad to share with the hon. 
member, and Canadians would love to read it, ``The Little Book 
of Reform''; it is a green book. I will quote from it. I know this 
may not be popular with the hon. members opposite, but I will 
find a quote in here as I continue speaking.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While I am on my feet the 
member might find that quote.
<P>
	I would not want the House to think there is any inconsistency 
on the part of the Chair with regard to props. Understanding of 
course that the motion today brought forward by the Reform 
Party on this allotted day specifically makes mention of a 
particular book, certainly I understand that it will have a greater 
and wider use than it or any other book normally would. If any 
other books are used, of any colour or for whatever reason, 
please quote from them before you do anything else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is fine. I appreciate the 
opportunity to have a chance to check for the right chapter.
<P>
	This book is also entitled ``The Gospel According to Preston 
Manning and the Reform Party''. I quote the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin. This is openness in government: ``For 
goodness sake, Jack, don't say things like that. We have a 
reporter in the car.'' That is a good quote. I suggest that reflects 
the Reform notion of openness in government. He was in the 
House a little while ago explaining a mistake he had made in 
debate earlier this morning to the hon. whip, who caught him up 
on some facts he had got completely wrong about some 
appointment. I suspect if there had been a reporter nearby he 
might have been more careful in his remarks.
<P>
	I want to turn to the one other thing that happened with respect 
to free votes. We adopted a motion in the House about free votes. 
The hon. member may have forgotten. It was a motion proposed 
by the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam. I quote the 
motion, because it was adopted unanimously, if I am not 
mistaken, in June 1994, in compliance again with the red book 
and our notion of free votes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should continue 
increasingly to permit members of the House of Commons to fully represent 
their constituents' views on the government's legislative program and 
spending plans by adopting the position that the defeat of any government 
measure, including a spending measure, shall not automatically mean the 
defeat of the government unless followed by the adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was all agreed to. There is no doubt that free votes are 
permitted and that they happen. The hon. member should be 
relieved by the fact that they happen on a daily basis.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Now I will turn to public consultation, because it is another 
area where the government has excelled. It has undertaken the 
most comprehensive consultative exercises to ensure that the 
views of the Canadian people are represented in legislation that 
is brought forward in the House. There have been broad national 
consultations on immigration policy, social policy review, gun 
control, and on two federal budgets. The result is policies that 
Canadians support and a government that Canadians respect in 
record numbers.
<P>
	This is far from the Reform idea of consultation. We 
witnessed something of its idea when one of its members 
travelled to Washington to consult with Americans who agreed 
with him. That is its idea of consultation. It opposes is trips 
where you might get exposed to somebody with ideas that are 
different from your own. When it can take a trip and meet with 
people who think exactly the way it does it goes. That is the 
Reform approach to travel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> If you pay your own bills.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I see, it is pay your own way. I am delighted 
they pay. Even if Reformers went at the public expense, all they 
want to do is meet with people who agree with them. I am sorry 
that is true, because I think part of the job of members of 
Parliament is to listen to all views. It is something that we on 
this side of the House try to do whenever we visit our 
constituencies. We meet with constituents whose views are not 
the same as ours. We talk to them, share their views and hear 
what they have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Then you tell them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We tell them our views. I am not afraid to 
discuss my views. I tell people what my views are.
<P>
	When they learn that the public supports a government bill, 
Reform members make excuses, ignore the wishes of their 
constituents, and vote against the bill just for the sake of 
opposition. I thought we were going to see a change.
<P>
	I cannot quote chapter and verse from the blue book because I 
cannot find a copy. The hon. member keeps waving it, but I do 
not have a copy. Perhaps he could send me one another day.
<P>
	One thing I recall from the blue book was that we were not to 
do things in Parliament the way we used to. My goodness, I am 
having trouble telling the difference between the party in 
opposition and the New Democratic Party when they occupied a 
similar position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12500"> 12500 </A></B>
<P>
	One only has to look at the record of the Reform Party in its 
consultations, particularly with aboriginal groups. We have seen 
the spectacle of its meetings in British Columbia recently where 
it was discussing aboriginal land settlement issues and it did not 
invite any aboriginal people to come to the meetings. I think it is 
a poor way to carry on consultations.
<P>
	I want to turn to the ethics counsellor and the whole question 
of ethics, which is indirectly raised-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, honestly, the braying on the other 
side is excessive. I believe my time is about to run out.
<P>
	The government has lived up to its commitment to provide 
more open and accountable government by setting up the ethics 
counsellor and introducing the lobbyists registration bill. The 
government also has proposed a special joint committee to 
develop a code of conduct for members, which motion has been 
opposed by the Reform Party and stalled in the House by the 
actions of the Reform Party. Obviously, they do not want the 
House to come up with this set of criteria of ethics guidelines for 
members, which I think is important and I would like to get on 
with.
<P>
	We have to look at the record of the government overall. I 
think it has been excellent.
<P>
	The member for Kindersley-Lloydminister in his speech 
this morning complained about the government's use of time 
allocation. Honestly, if the hon. member had been here in the 
last Parliament he would have learned a lot about time allocation 
and closure. There are two rules, which the hon. member should 
know. We have not used the closure rule recently. I do not know 
whether we have used it all in this Parliament. We have used 
time allocation. I can only say that if the members had been here 
the last time, they would think life in this Parliament is bed of 
roses. It was used by the government on repeated occasions 
against the opposition at that time. It has hardly ever been used 
in this Parliament.
<P>
	Members opposite have got off very, very lightly in respect of 
the government's approach to the House. We have deliberately 
tried to allow members to express their views on all these things. 
Hon. members opposite have had ample opportunity to make 
their views known, not just on government bills but in other 
debates.
<P>
	I would love to go on about some of the other aspects of 
legislation, but unfortunately I see my time has expired. There 
are questions and comments and I will be glad to answer 
questions from the hon. members opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
closely to the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. I 
noticed in particular that, according to him, all the decisions 
made by the Liberal government so far were in keeping with the 
promises in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I wish to remind the hon. member that, during the election 
campaign, the current Prime Minister, who was then Leader of 
the Opposition, was against free trade and in favour of GST 
reform and said that he would not touch social programs and 
transfers to the provinces. But we know what happened to all 
these resolutions. The Liberal government did just the opposite.
<P>
	I remember another matter that was widely discussed during 
the election campaign, especially in Ontario, namely the 
Pearson airport deal. It is one of the areas in which the former 
Tory government had to pay for its poor performance under the 
circumstances, since the Liberal Party had promised to review 
the matter. Yet, once in power, the Prime Minister appointed Mr. 
Nixon, a former Ontario finance minister, to look into this deal. 
During the investigation, Mr. Nixon himself said that there 
might have been certain irregularities due to lobbyists.
<P>
	A little later, the ethics counsellor, who reports not to the 
House of Commons but to the Prime Minister, admitted at 
committee meetings that Bill C-43 would not have changed 
anything regarding the misconduct of lobbyists in the Pearson 
airport deal. He said himself that it would not have changed 
anything. Yet, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
brags about the merits of the bill.
<P>
	I have two questions for him: First, how does he explain that it 
took the government 18 months to table this bill with the 
Pearson airport deal in the background, when the information 
obtained under the Access to Information Act reveals that Bill 
C-43 has been modified and is not in keeping with Liberal 
promises, precisely because of lobbyists' influence? I would 
like him to answer this question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member misunderstood 
the circumstances. First of all, I must say that the Minister for 
International Trade is here and that he is the one who made the 
necessary changes to NAFTA so that we could support it. That is 
why the Prime Minister promised during the election campaign 
that the agreement would be changed. The Minister for 
International Trade, an excellent minister, made all sorts of 
changes to the agreement so that it could be passed in this place. 
That is my first point.
<P>
	Regarding Bill C-43, I must tell the hon. member that this 
bill was introduced in this House June 16 1994. So, this is not 
brand new. If we had problems with this bill, getting it passed 
in this House and all, it was because of the hon. members 
opposite filibustering, talking endlessly and showing such a 
keen interest in this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12501"> 12501 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I say to the hon. member do not criticize the government for 
being slow and bringing it in 18 months after we took office. We 
introduced it six or seven months after we took office. It has 
taken almost a year to get it passed because of the obstruction 
primarily of members on the other side of the House, because we 
have not put up an inordinate number of speakers on the bill.
<P>
	Since the hon. member touched on something else the Prime 
Minister promised, which was transfer payments to the 
provinces, the Prime Minister indicated there would be ample 
notice of changes in those transfer payments. He never promised 
they would remain the same or always increase, and he has lived 
up to that promise fully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as Canadians from coast to coast know by now, the holy 
grail of the Liberal Party is its now infamous red book, 
otherwise referred to as the dead book-cold and getting 
clammier as each day goes by. I remind members opposite the 
infamous red book is a two edge sword. It will also hold them 
very accountable for what they have not done which they had 
promised to do.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	My question to the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, 
and I ask it most seriously, has to do with the efficacy of using 
the red book, primarily an election document. It was a 
compilation of promises put together in a binder. It was a 
method of appealing to voters and saying this is how they could 
get elected.
<P>
	In the last election the Liberal Party gained 177 seats, a vast 
majority in the House. It did so by getting something in the order 
of 41 per cent of the total votes cast.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was 43 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The hon. member opposite tells me it was 
43 per cent. I am wondering if the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands would speak about the integrity and whether it is 
right, proper and appropriate to foist on Canadians holus-bolus 
the Liberal election document as a mandate for change when that 
party received 43 per cent of the total votes cast. It is nothing 
like a majority.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Given the brevity of the 
question from the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest, I will 
take an equally brief question from the hon. member for 
Kootenay East and the parliamentary secretary can respond to 
both.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
reading from this holy grail, the red book, the chapter 
``Governing with Integrity'', it says the erosion of confidence 
with public servants, the members of Parliament, seems to have 
many causes. Some have to do with the behaviour of certain 
elected officials, others with an arrogant style of political 
leadership.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary agrees the justice 
minister, particularly today, showed a tremendously arrogant 
style when he completely dismissed the question of my 
colleague from Macleod in saying doctors supported objectives 
of the firearms legislation when he knows full well every 
Canadian supports the objectives of the firearms legislation, 
when he would have known that: ``The CMA, however, is 
unconvinced that the registration provisions proposed in Bill 
C-68 will be effective in reducing suicides or homicides 
because they seem to concentrate their efforts on that group of 
users which poses the least risk to society''.
<P>
	Does the parliamentary secretary not agree this is a very clear 
cut case of the Minister of Justice showing an absolute 
arrogance on the part of the Liberal government when he 
misquoted the CMA?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will deal with the questions in 
the order in which they were put.
<P>
	The first question suggested promises in the red book were 
being foisted on Canadians who did not vote for the Liberal 
Party and that because we have a majority in Parliament we 
should not foist the red book on members of the public.
<P>
	The hon. member, and I know he is one of the few reasonable 
members of his party, would agree we are at least operating on a 
blueprint. The red book was not just a series of election 
promises, it was a blueprint for action when we took office and it 
was advertised as such by the party. In putting it into place in 
government we are doing exactly what we said we would do with 
the 177 members elected as Liberals because they were relying 
on the red book and putting it forward as their policy.
<P>
	The problem the hon. member raises is not one he put in his 
question, but his colleagues would know this is the case. They 
want us to put in place the policies in the blue book and the 
policies they are espousing in the House which had the support 
of far fewer Canadians.
<P>
	In the circumstances we are probably doing the right thing in 
the context of the democratic system under which we have 
operated in Canada for the more than 130 years we have been in 
existence. I will leave it at that.
<P>
	With respect to the Minister of Justice and the phoney 
allegation of arrogance, the Minister of Justice is far from 
arrogant. We would be hardpressed to find a Minister of Justice 
who has done more consulting in respect of this bill and who has 
a firmer grip of the facts on which he bases his acts than the 
present Minister of Justice.

	The hon. member in his question is showing considerable 
contempt for his electors when he indicates to the House he is 
not supporting the gun control bill.
<P>
	I quote from an article written-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I am showing contempt for my electors?

the Liberal Party. He used to write Tory campaign tracts in his 
articles in the Globe and Mail. He is certainly one of the better 
known journalists in Canada:

Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today to address the Reform motion that the 
House condemn the government for its failure to keep its red 
book promises to make government more open and accountable.
<P>
	The Reform Party in 1988 compiled a book of principles and 
policies, which is probably one of the first political parties to 
ever put its policies and principles in writing and make a 
commitment to the Canadian public. On page eight it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe in the accountability of elected representatives to the people 
who elect them and that the duty of elected members to their constituents 
should supersede their obligations to their political parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will predict that within the Liberal caucus when it votes on 
Bill C-41, the sentencing bill, there will be members who will 
wish to vote against the government but they will not be allowed 
to for fear of being kicked out of caucus or off the standing 
committees.
<P>
	When it comes to Bill C-68, the gun control bill, some 
members of the caucus will want to vote against the government. 
They will have to toe the line or get kicked out of caucus.
<P>
	Unlike Reformers, they will not be able to fulfil the wishes 
of their constituents. On this side of the House on both those 
bills members will vote the clear wishes of their constituents, 
established in a fashion that has shown and expressed a 
complete communication system with  them, not a poll taken 
a year and a half ago and then coming out with a law like this 
gun control bill.
<P>
	In my original speech I was to speak about how the Liberal 
government whip has punished, castigated, disciplined, 
reprimanded, reproached, scolded and penalized several Liberal 
members for bucking the party line and reflecting the views of 
their constituents. My colleagues have covered all that. We 
know about that. The Canadian public knows all about that.
<P>
	After hearing the government whip's diatribe about Liberal 
ethics, which I believe is an oxymoron like Progressive 
Conservative, and hearing about how Liberals are spearheading 
a special joint committee to develop recommendations for a 
code of conduct for politicians, I cannot resist making a few 
comments directed at the Liberal whip.
<P>
	In typical planet Ottawa fashion the Liberals will study the 
issue of accountability and review the concept of openness 
under the guise of a special joint committee. The committee will 
be comprised of seven members of the Senate and fourteen 
members of the House of Commons who, along with countless 
support staff, will travel across Canada and the world to study 
how other governments hold their representatives accountable. 
It sounds very important.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers will wave goodbye as their brave 
representatives, along with their entourage, sail off to foreign 
lands to find out how their politicians conduct themselves.
<P>
	From experience I know the Liberal members of this 
committee will constantly utter cliches like ``what we need is 
effective inputs for effective outputs''. My favourite is from the 
Minister of Finance: ``What we are trying to do is square the 
circle with this budget''.
<P>
	That is how governments play up politics in Ottawa with 
touchy issues like accountability and openness. They study 
them. The Tories did it and now the Liberals are following suit 
with their code of conduct committee. It sounds good, looks 
good but does not do anything.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform wants to bring back some sanity to this process. We 
can give rule number one for code of conduct without even 
leaving the Chamber and without leaving the shores of this land: 
do not waste Canadian taxpayers' money on needless junkets.
<P>
	In 1987 the Ontario Supreme Court found the former 
cabinet minister Sinclair Stevens had breached the Canadian 
conflict of interest rules on 14 different occasions prior to his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12503"> 12503 </A></B>
<P>
resignation in 1986. As a direct result the Mulroney 
government introduced a conflict of interest bill for MPs 
which unfortunately died on the Order Paper at the end of the 
parliamentary session. A similar conflict of interest bill was 
introduced in the next session. It too died on the Order Paper.
<P>
	As a result of these failed attempts, the Mulroney government 
created a special joint committee of the House of Commons and 
Senate to study the issue. Does that sound familiar?
<P>
	A lengthy study of issues like conflict of interest and 
accountability was conducted. Witnesses were heard. Testimony 
was given. A 60-page report was submitted to the House and the 
Senate. Among the major recommendations was that an 
independent office be created, the holder of which would 
oversee the disclosure of assets and liabilities of both the 
members of the Senate and the Commons and act as an adviser to 
parliamentarians investigating possible breaches of the act. 
Does this sound like an ethics counsellor?
<P>
	The report also recommended clear procedures be established 
requiring members not to vote on issues in which they have an 
interest.
<P>
	These are a few of the recommendations of the 60-page report 
to the Mulroney government in 1992. Nothing has changed. The 
hon. Liberal whip was a member of the committee at that time. 
Now it appears we will spend more money and send another 
group out to do exactly the same thing. Can he remember what 
the witnesses said? Can he remember what they told him? I do 
not seem to recall ``vote Liberal and we will reinvent the wheel'' 
in the red book.
<P>
	It is obvious the Liberals have already attempted to act on a 
recommendation of the 1992 report which I mentioned earlier. 
They appointed an ethics counsellor. However, they did not 
follow through with the full recommendation in their red book. 
The ethics counsellor does not answer to Parliament. That is a 
sad disgrace. That lacks integrity. That smacks of 
misrepresentation.
<P>
	The Liberals observed this in opposition and subsequently 
incorporated the recommendations made to the Tories in their 
red ink book. I have no problem with a party picking up the ball 
and running with it if it has been fumbled by another party. The 
Liberals are very good at borrowing ideas from other parties like 
the Reform Party on the budget.
<P>
	However, I do have a problem when they waste money to play 
politics with an issue so they can sell it as their own idea and 
initiative.
<P>
	The groundwork for a code of conduct was laid in the last 
Parliament. Surely the issue of ethics has not changed that 
dramatically in the past three or four years. The only problem 
was that the Mulroney government lacked the intestinal 
fortitude to act on any of the recommendations of the code of 
conduct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> The more things change, the more they stay 
the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Indeed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberals want to be able to use the creation of yet another 
special joint committee as ammunition in the next election. The 
Prime Minister will stand in front of voters and talk about how 
Liberal ideas and initiatives have restored an integrity to the 
parliamentary system in Canada as a fait accompli. He will 
speak of how they established a special joint committee to study 
the code of conduct for MPs and report to both federal Houses. 
Finally, the Prime Minister will take great pride in the 
establishment of an ethics watchdog to scrutinize the conduct of 
Canada's politicians.
<P>
	People in the real world will think that sounds pretty 
impressive. They should think again. The Liberals still will not 
concede any control over the scrutiny of their affairs, as we have 
witnessed and seen with the conduct of three or four cabinet 
ministers, two or three members of Parliament of the Liberal 
caucus. Nothing has been done according to the usage of the 
ethics counsellor in applying the rules of conduct that currently 
exist at all the various levels. It is a scam, a sham and a disgrace.
<P>
	The ethics watchdog they appointed is a lap-dog with no 
teeth. The bottom line is you do not appoint somebody to 
scrutinize your activities and those of your colleagues. Where 
was the ethics watchdog during any of the three ``Dupuy-gate'' 
incidents? Nowhere to be found. Where was the ethics watchdog 
when the CRTC decision on direct to home satellite TV was 
suspiciously overturned by cabinet to the benefit of the Liberal 
family compact? The watchdog was nowhere to be found. I think 
the Liberals have lost their lapdog.
<P>
	I truly gained some insight about how the Liberals are 
justifying the expenditure of more taxpayer money to create yet 
another joint committee on a code of conduct. While in 
opposition all these code of conduct bills were falling by the 
wayside. The Liberal government whip was on the committee 
that reviewed the Tory proposals, in particular its last ditch 
effort at a code of conduct, Bill C-116.
<P>
	In his speech last Monday the Liberal whip referred to the 
difficulty he had reviewing Bill C-116. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I realized that so much time had gone by that some documents were 
becoming outdated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For example, the report of the Parker commission on the dealings of 
Sinclair Stevens was just about forgotten and we did not have a clear 
recollection of its recommendations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was not easy to examine the whole issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12504"> 12504 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Let me put this into perspective for members of the House. We 
had the Liberal whip saying that it was difficult to debate the last 
Tory code of conduct bill because too much time had passed 
since the Sinclair Stevens fiasco, which started the ethics review 
process, to remember the specifics. Reports were dated. Sources 
were poor. Details were foggy.
<P>
	The Sinclair Stevens report was released in 1987. In October 
1992, five years later, the Liberal whip wrote an essay in the 
<I>Parliamentarian Journal</I> entitled ``Members interests: New 
conflict of interest rules for Canadian parliamentarians''. In the 
essay he quite clearly referred to and built his argument around 
Sinclair Stevens case, the very case he said in the House he 
could not remember.
<P>
	The Liberal whip is using this memory lapse to justify the 
creation of a new code of conduct committee at great expense to 
Canadian taxpayers. If the Liberals want to send members to 
start a code of conduct review from scratch they should at least 
be up front about it. They should not feed the Reform Party the 
line that they cannot remember what was said in the past or that 
old reports are useless when it is quite clear that the member 
remembered. In fact his party used portions of the 1992 report in 
some of its policies and actions to date.
<P>
	The rationale used by the government whip to justify the need 
for the joint committee reminds me of a child with a perfectly 
good bike trying to justify the need for a new bike to his or her 
parents.
<P>
	They say: ``It is too old. It is not working. I do not like it 
because it was not my idea. Let's steal this one from the 
Conservatives. Let's steal the other one from the Reform Party 
and call it ours''. That is what the Liberals are saying about all 
the extensive code of conduct initiatives that have previously 
been undertaken. They want a new bike. They want a new 
special joint committee to show off to Canadian voters. The 
speech made on Monday by the Liberal whip is testimony to the 
fact.
<P>
	The Reform Party is saying that in a time of fiscal restraint 
there is nothing wrong with using an old bike and the Liberals do 
not need to blow taxpayers money on a new one. We do not need 
to send politicians across Canada and across the Atlantic to 
develop ideas to make politicians more open and accountable. It 
can be done right here using the information we already have 
and the minds of those who were sent to Ottawa to do more than 
collect frequent flyer points, those who were sent here to think, 
to act and to accomplish.
<P>
	If the Liberals are truly serious about scrutinizing the 
conduct of MPs, senators and cabinet ministers, the Reform 
Party will work with them in the House and in the procedure 
and House affairs committee. More important, the 
independent ethics counsellor should be able to enforce the 
rules without fear of repercussion  from his boss, the Prime 
Minister of Canada: a watchdog that can bite and not just 
bark.
<P>
	I cannot understand how the government plays games with 
words in the English language. It uses sophistry all the time, 
sophistry in terms of the budget presentation, sophistry in terms 
of Bill C-85, the MPs pension bill. Somehow because salaries 
are frozen is justification for $1 million, $2 million and $3 
million payouts for life after six years of service and attaining 
age 65.
<P>
	Why do government members not come clean with Canadian 
taxpayers, talk about truth and talk about the facts? They said 
that the ethics counsellor would be answerable to Parliament. 
They breached that. They have not done that. They are talking 
about promises in the red book. They are talking about holding 
politicians more accountable. The Prime Minister clearly 
breached that promise.
<P>
	Nobody hears from the ethics counsellor. He never says 
anything. All we ever hear is the Prime Minister saying: ``I 
checked with him and he told me it was okay''. Where does an 
ethics counsellor fit into the equation? He is supposed to be 
there to make sure, when the minister of heritage writes a letter 
to the CRTC advocating that a certain constituent be considered 
as a recipient of a radio licence, that it is a breach of his 
responsibilities and not in line with what he is supposed to be 
doing as a minister of the crown, especially after he has sworn an 
oath that he would not interfere or try to influence agencies and 
boards that work for the government.
<P>
	Where is the decision on that by the ethics counsellor? There 
was none. Is that fair to the Canadian taxpayer who is paying for 
a system that is there structurally but has no teeth to it? That is 
not the way the system should work. That is not integrity.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Is it integrity to rise in the House and continually shoot 
partisan shots at each other that do not have the facts behind 
them? All parties are guilty of it to some degree and we should 
stop it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> I agree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I have some support from the Liberal benches.
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons are elected not only to 
represent their party platform. When issues come up and they 
have to consult with their constituents they should be free to 
represent them and if they do not they are kicked out of standing 
committees like the three Liberal members were kicked out of 
the standing committee on justice because they could not 
support gun control. There are lot more, but those are the 
courageous ones.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12505"> 12505 </A></B>
<P>
	The biggest hoax, the biggest issue in my mind that lacks 
integrity is the business of the double standard of a politician. It 
disgusts me. I have been in the private sector almost all my life, 
with the exception of the last 18 months. I was outside this fish 
bowl. I thought I could come here and make a contribution, 
make a difference, but it is very difficult.
<P>
	Now I am inside the fish bowl with everyone else. I am 
finding that there are little red fish, little blue fish and little 
yellow fish swimming around. The national media is swimming 
around with us. We cannot even make a suggestion without it 
being distorted by a stupid headline and a stupid commentary. 
The people who write the articles are not the ones who create the 
headlines.
<P>
	In question period ministers continually do not answer 
questions. Why? They say that it is not answer period, that it is 
question period. We are charging up about $1 million per year 
per MP in the House, and this is the quality of work we are 
delivering to the Canadian taxpayer. We should be ashamed that 
we do not pay attention to our responsibilities and to the work 
we should be doing here.
<P>
	There are 200 rookies here. We have an opportunity to change 
things. Unfortunately we are the third party. We have already 
shown the courage and the intestinal fortitude to do what we said 
we would do.
<P>
	We say the MP pension plan is terrible and overly generous, 
and we opted out. We are showing leadership by example. That 
is not so with these people opposite. I cannot believe the 
stupidity of some Liberal rookies who allow the veterans to talk 
them into trough regular: ``For anybody in the previous 
government we cannot change that. We have to leave that and 
get a 6:1 ratio''.
<P>
	Then there is trough light: ``We will cut back. We will only 
take 3.5 to 1. We will wait until 55 years of age. We will only put 
in 9 per cent. We will reduce our accrual rate. We will do all this 
because I guess you guys know what you are doing''.
<P>
	Then there is trough stout where the cabinet ministers can 
continually add more to their pensions than anybody else.
<P>
	Where is the intelligence of those rookie Liberals, some of 
whom I have met, some of whom I respect and some of whom I 
know are much more intelligent than I am? I know some of them 
understand the issue much better than I do and agree with me 
privately but do not have the guts to say so publicly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre has a great mastery of the English language. I 
would ask him to withdraw the expression he used-I do not 
think I have to repeat it-and to find another one that will be 
more appropriate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected. I apologize for 
using the word. It is a slang expression that former football 
players used. I would replace it with intestinal fortitude.
<P>
	Where is the intestinal fortitude to stand up to their 
convictions? Why is it that only Reform Party members are 
willing to take the heat from the national media to express their 
points of view? Why does the national media seem to support 
and encourage the status quo when everyone across the country 
wants change? They want reform. However, because everyone 
in the House is worried about the media hit, they are afraid to 
speak their minds. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed. It lacks 
integrity.
<P>
	I do not want to speak to the veterans because they are 
coerced. They are finished. They have done it. They are has 
beens. They are millionaires. They are ready to collect at any 
time. However the rookies in the House have an opportunity to 
make a difference. The rookies in the Liberal government have a 
distinct opportunity to exert pressure in caucus on cabinet. 
Many members of the Liberal caucus are doing so. We read 
about them in the paper. They are the ones who are reprimanded 
for making democracy live and making the changes that 
Canadians want. They are the ones who are getting respect, not 
the ones who are following the line with the status quo. We need 
more of that. That is what this debate is all about. That is the 
point of the motion before us.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals said a bunch of things to get elected. The rhetoric 
was up here; the promises were way up here. They issued the red 
book in which the implementation of the rules was achievable. 
The targets were easy but still a double standard. The pension 
plan is still three times as good as those in the private sector but 
very achievable. They made some improvements.
<P>
	Their promises were up here, to get elected. Everybody knows 
they campaigned on the pension plan. They were to make it the 
same as those in the private sector. They were to address it. What 
did they do? They made these little changes.
<P>
	My point is that everybody in the House, especially the 
rookies, can make a difference. If we are to restore integrity to 
politicians then we in opposition have to hold the government 
accountable. I am holding rookie Liberal members accountable 
for their lack of solidarity in encouraging the government and 
ministers of the crown to act in accordance with what the 
Canadian public wants. They know what I am talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will comment on a couple of matters.
<P>
	With respect to the ethics counsellor, the Prime Minister 
made a clear statement before the House that regardless of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12506"> 12506 </A></B>
<P>
any positions out there the one person in Canada who is 
responsible for the integrity of the government is the Prime 
Minister. That is our ethics  counsellor and that is the person 
to whom Canadians should look. We have an ethics 
counsellor-that was an undertaking in the red book-whom 
the Prime Minister, as the member knows well, consults.
<P>
	The member commented on the matter of gun control and the 
removal of members from the committee. The member will well 
know that the bill at that time was only at second reading. The 
purpose of the vote was to move that important bill to 
committee. There has been much more consultation, much more 
work, much more deliberation and much more debate. 
Amendments are forthcoming, as the member also well knows.
<P>
	When a position comes forth from a government it is 
important that government policy be supported by its members. 
That is what was asked but it was not forthcoming. I believe the 
three members acknowledged that they had not given the 
process the full opportunity and that it was not really necessary 
for them to stop debate at that point and make a decision. There 
was more to be said on behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	The essence of the comments of the member concerned the 
credibility of the government and the credibility of members of 
Parliament. I read with some concern reports of the Reform 
Party's immigration critic who travelled to the U.S. capital on 
taxpayers dollars to attend a rally for presidential candidate Pat 
Buchanan. He was there and shared a platform with people who 
were saying that immigrants should be controlled, that 
immigrants were creating violent crime, reducing the standards 
of education and murdering their children. Here was a Reform 
member of Parliament, a critic of the party, sharing a platform 
before the public. What would the member say about the 
credibility of MPs when things like that go on?
<P>
	I raise the example of the hon. member who just spoke. In the 
House he recommended that members of Parliament should 
receive $144,000 a year. Now he is back pedalling. If the 
member is concerned about the credibility of members with 
regard to their voting record, does he not think that the public 
expects the actions and the words of members to reflect the 
views and the interests of all Canadians?
<P>
	I point out to the member that he has made calculations that 
would effectively double tax free expense allowances and 
somehow end up with a figure of $120,000. I understand the 
mechanics. The member has failed to recognize that if expense 
reimbursements on a pre tax basis are put in salaries those 
expenses will also be deductible for tax purposes. Therefore on 
the tax return the gross salary equivalent which the member has 
said is $120,000 in fact is only $92,000.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The member's credibility on matters of importance such as 
tax matters is also in question. The member should try to explain 
himself in terms of credibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, it sounds like we are back on a budget 
debate here.
<P>
	With respect to the ethics counsellor it interesting when we 
point out that the Liberals failed to keep their promise in the red 
book. They promised that the ethics counsellor would answer to 
Parliament. The fact is he does not and it is to a registrar or 
directly to the Prime Minister. The Liberals say the best ethics 
counsellor is the Prime Minister and that he really is who the 
ethics counsellor is. That is our point. We do not have an ethics 
counsellor and the Liberal government promised one.
<P>
	On the business of the Liberal caucus members who now 
claim to have not allowed the process to work, the member 
claims they agreed that maybe the process could work. The point 
is that a lot of people are saying the gun control bill will not 
reduce crime. Registration will not reduce crime. We already 
have a registration system in Canada. It has proven that it works 
better than the old system. Whatever level of crime we have it 
will not change based on registration. Criminals will not register 
their guns. A lot of people are saying that. That voice is not 
being heard by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In terms of credibility, let us take the member's intervention 
here. How credible is it for a member to rise and say that one of 
our members, the immigration critic, took a trip to Washington 
at taxpayers' expense? That member himself knows there is no 
way that a member of Parliament, outside of cabinet, gets 
reimbursed for travel outside this country. It is only for travel 
within Canada that we get reimbursed.
<P>
	If the hon. member has facts, I leave it up to him. He made an 
allegation. I would like to have him prove that our immigration 
critic went to Washington at taxpayers' expense, because that is 
the impression he is giving. Travel outside this country is not 
reimbursed. He knows that and I know that. That is an allegation 
not based on facts. It is just that type of partisan political 
comment that I think hurts the House and the reputation of 
politicians.
<P>
	Then the hon. member went on to attack my own credibility. 
He charged me with back pedalling on a suggestion I made in the 
House. In terms of MP compensation and restructuring MP 
compensation which everyone in the House agrees with me 
privately that we should be undertaking he said that during 
debate last week I suggested that an MP's salary should be 
$144,000. I said that and I am not back pedalling on that. It is out 
of line for that to be defended by me outside the House. I said 
that in the House and I will still say in the House that we have to 
restructure MP salaries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12507"> 12507 </A></B>
<P>
	What this whole debate is about is not the amount of 
remuneration. It is integrity I am talking about. It is about 
honesty and the lack of the will of the government to address the 
very issue of MP pensions. It shows the lack of integrity of the 
government, the rookies, the veterans and everyone in the House 
who supports this MP pension plan. It smacks of trying to 
promote something by using the argument that our salaries are 
frozen so let us overcompensate here; we are undercompensated 
here, so let us overpay there.
<P>
	The member who asked me the question has an accounting 
background. Now that I have everyone's attention by saying 
$144,000 in the House, and which went outside the House, let 
me say what MPs really get.
<P>
	Those people who have been here for six years or more get 
$64,400. They get $27,000 tax free. If the bill goes through, they 
will get three and a half times what they are contributing to their 
pension now; $25,000 accrues to their account. That is their 
benefit, their asset. They get it when they turn 55 years. That 
represents $114,000. In the private sector no one gets $27,000 
tax free. Gross that up and they are already getting $140,000.
<P>
	My point is if someone wants to talk about integrity and have 
an open and intelligent discussion on MPs compensation, let us 
have it. If someone wants to talk integrity and have an open 
discussion on MP pension plans and why they can justify this 
obscene amount of money on a fat cat Cadillac pension plan, 
three tier, trough regular, trough light, trough stout, then let us 
have that discussion. However, to take these cheap shots smacks 
exactly of what I am accusing the majority of the members of the 
House, because the majority are Liberals. They are the 
government. They lack integrity and they should restore it.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That concludes the period 
of questions or comments to the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre.
<P>
	Before I recognize the member for North Vancouver, I am 
going to take the initiative to raise I believe in part the same 
issue he wishes to address, which is the following. Earlier today 
I understand the House leader for the Reform Party informed the 
House that all members of the Reform Party would be splitting 
their time on this motion. I cannot apologize for not being here, I 
simply was not here when that was introduced to the House.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Centre of course with great 
enthusiasm and so on, used up the full 20-minute allocation. 
In part, I think we would all understand, due to travel 
commitments and otherwise, if the House would agree that the 
member for North Vancouver would do his 10-minute 
intervention now with five minutes for questions or 
comments. Then I would go back to the government where we 
will get at least two other interventions equally of 10 and five 
and there will be a  little bit of time before we have to 
conclude the matter at 5.30 p.m. Would that meet the approval 
of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no 
agreement, we will resume debate with the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to indicate to the Chair that I will be sharing 
my time with the member for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to rise in this House on behalf of the 
people of Guelph-Wellington on the motion introduced by the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. I do so not to condemn 
the government but to commend its actions to encourage more 
openness and accountability to our constituents.
<P>
	It has been a pleasure for me to have in the past 18 months 
sought the advice and counsel of the people of 
Guelph-Wellington at every opportunity. They have shared 
with me their concerns and suggestions. Through town halls and 
surveys, my constituents have expressed their appreciation for 
the opportunity to participate in decision making.
<P>
	I find it ironic that the member rose in this House to speak 
about broken promises. The red book was our commitment to 
the Canadian people during the last election. We were very much 
aware that they were tired of politicians who made promises but 
failed to deliver and political parties that relied on short 
memories.
<P>
	We want Canadians to remember what we promised them 
because we have kept our promises. That is the legacy of this 
government, a government that has reaffirmed the new politics 
of promises kept.
<P>
	The Reform Party likes to speak in the House about promises. 
During the last election it offered Canadians its blue sheet, a list 
of principles and policies, a list that is rarely if ever mentioned 
by Reformers in the House. They like to speak about the red 
book but are strangely quiet about the commitment they made to 
the Canadian people during the autumn of 1993.
<P>
	The Reform House leader, like many in his party, talks about 
openness in government. Reformers speak of it like they have a 
monopoly on consultation and accountability. When the 
members of the Reform Party presented their platform to 
Canadians during the last election, accountability of elected 
representatives was so important that it was listed as number 15 
in their statement of 21 principles. They argue that it is the duty 
of elected members to override their obligations to their 
political party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12508"> 12508 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the platform also states that Reform MPs shall vote 
with the Reform Party majority unless a member is instructed to 
abstain or vote otherwise by his or her constituents. We have 
already seen that despite majority support for gun control, only 
one member has risen in support of the government's proposal. 
Promises made and promises broken.
<P>
	Reformers like to share their vision of accountability but do 
not necessarily like to live up to it. In their own party assembly 
in 1994 for example, 600 constituency resolutions prepared for 
debate were reduced finally to 55.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Despite a promise in Reform's blue sheet to protect 
law-abiding citizens, one of its members suggested publicly 
that Canadians should not comply with gun registration. 
Reformers suggest we should break the law.
<P>
	Despite promises to support a new relationship with 
aboriginal people, the very member who is sponsoring this 
motion suggested that the aboriginal language should be spoken 
briefly, such as the length of time it takes to yawn, pause 
between sentences, or to take a drink of water.
<P>
	Reformers have asked for a minimum age in the pension plan 
for members of Parliament and are opposed to double dipping, 
but have spoken against the legislation that does just that.
<P>
	Reformers promised in their blue sheet to reduce expenditures 
by lowering the pay of members of Parliament, while one of 
their own suggests that salaries increase to $150,000 at a time of 
restraint. More promises made and more promises broken.
<P>
	I have said before that each of us elected in 1993 and our 
Liberal colleagues elected in the recent byelections are here 
because of circumstances of frustration and anger on behalf of 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	The constituents of Guelph-Wellington were concerned that 
too many candidates promised one thing and then would deliver 
another. They asked me to ensure they would be consulted 
before decisions were made. They wanted to be informed. They 
wanted us to act and they wanted to be heard. They did not want 
to reach their member of Parliament by dialling and paying for a 
1-900 telephone line. Their idea of accountability is their ability 
to contact their member of Parliament without incurring a 
service charge. For Reformers, accountability has a fee.
<P>
	The success of the red book does not rest simply with its ideas 
and its suggestions. Success has resulted from action by this 
Liberal government that was demanded by the people of 
Guelph-Wellington and people throughout Canada.
<P>
	The people of my riding welcomed the red book because for 
them it is a yardstick with which they can measure our 
success and they remind us of our promises. We are not afraid 
of that; we think this is a good thing.  As much as the Reform 
Party said earlier that it does not like the idea of being 
reminded and having accountability, we are not afraid.
<P>
	The red book is a contract made by the Liberal Party and 
affirmed by the people of Canada. The red book has set a legacy 
of election promises. It is a legacy in which I am proud to share.
<P>
	Liberals know the old ways of governing can never be 
repeated. But the difference between Liberals and Reformers is 
one of substance. Liberals like success. We celebrate good news. 
We attempt to uplift Canadians and bring them to the best that 
they can be.
<P>
	Our government was elected because the old way of doom and 
gloom was rejected by the Canadian people. Reformers do not 
yet know that Canadians like good news and want to share in 
prosperity and happiness. In a recent edition of the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I> writer Catherine Ford said it best. Speaking of 
Reformers she said: ``These are not real cheery, happy people. 
Everyone needs a spring break''.
<P>
	Reformers saw the last election as a chance for change. They 
were correct. Canadians demanded and received change. They 
reduced the Mulroney-Charest Tories to two seats because they 
saw a government that failed to represent their concerns. They 
voted for the red book, for good news, for a party that has 
historically protected their interests. They wanted openness and 
accountability. They wanted not only a spring break but a break 
from everything wrong in government.
<P>
	The government has responded. We are very aware of the 
commitments we made to the Canadian people. We know our 
contract is fragile, that Canadians are watching and that they 
demand the very best and will expect no less, nor should they.
<P>
	We need no lessons from the other side on accountability. The 
blue sheet represents promises made and the red book is 
promises kept.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	The blue sheet promises reform and the red book delivers a 
new Canada. The blue sheet offers a narrow vision, and the red 
book includes all Canadians and challenges them to return to 
greatness.
<P>
	Rather than condemning our government, I encourage 
Reformers to join us in our efforts to rebuild Canada and to make 
our country strong again. I want them to remember and to 
celebrate that despite their constant reminders to the contrary, 
Canada is the best place in the world to be.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Guelph-Wellington tried to point to contradictions 
in the speeches made by Reform members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12509"> 12509 </A></B>
<P>
	I will let Reform members take care of themselves. However, 
I myself see contradictions between the Liberal Party program, 
the famous red book, and some of the things which have taken 
place since the election campaign, including free trade. I asked 
the same question earlier to another Liberal member, and I was 
told-the member's colleague will certainly be able to give me 
an answer-that so many changes had been made to the free 
trade agreement that, in the end, the Liberals could not follow up 
on the matter.
<P>
	There is also the GST. The Liberals said they would change 
and even remove this bad tax on goods and services. 
Unfortunately, the GST is still there. There is also the issue of 
transfers to the provinces. What did the government do to these 
transfers? First, it froze them and then announced, in this year's 
budget, a major cut which will take effect next year.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Lévis and I was told that a summit on 
the future of Canada's shipyards would be held during the year. 
That was 18 months ago and there is still no summit.
<P>
	The government can certainly point to the contradictions of 
the Reform members of the opposition, but I am talking about 
commitments made by the party now in office, when it was in 
opposition. There is a definite difference between the 
commitments made and the actions taken.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member about another issue. What does 
she think of the power of banks as regards the monetary policy, 
among other things, given that six of the ten largest contributors 
in Canada are banks? I would like to hear her opinion on that 
issue. Would she support federal legislation which would limit 
political financing to individuals, instead of major 
corporations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer 
some of the points my hon. colleague brought up.
<P>
	Number one, the member talked about something achieved. I 
submit to members that in the last 18 months we have achieved a 
great deal as a party. I am very proud of that. Some things we 
certainly have made improvements to. I use the word 
improvements because the world continually goes around; it is 
not something one just does at one point and never looks at 
again, never fixes it or never goes ahead on it.
<P>
	I will come right out; other parties may want me to hide from 
this, but I will not. We have made improvements to the pension 
reform. We hope that all members will support that, because it is 
the way the Canadian people want this to be, with a minimum 
age and no double dipping. We certainly hope that we have 
members' support on that.
<P>
	We are working toward a united Canada, which is very 
important to all Canadians. We know that. The member across 
the way knows that too.
<P>
	The member talked about free trade. Certainly that has been a 
real plus for the country. That is indisputable with the figures 
and facts out there.
<P>
	The member spoke about the GST, and the reality of that is 
that we are working on it. We hope to have a solution to that 
soon. It has not been as easy as one might have hoped.
<P>
	Real change is not easy, so we work toward it. We are proud to 
say that we are working hard toward it. We do not hide from that. 
There is no reason for us to hide from it.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	There have been improvements to the GATT. Infrastructure 
has been one of our biggest projects. Every day I am in 
Guelph-Wellington I am stopped and told that the architects 
have benefited from this and the mayor says that things are 
going well. I see the member for 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe is agreeing. This 
infrastructure program has been wonderful; interprovincial 
trade, I could go on and on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow my thoughtful colleague, the 
member for Guelph-Wellington, and to take part in the debate 
on the proposition of the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, with whom I have had the pleasure 
of serving in committee. He is a thoughtful member and he 
usually brings forward in committee very helpful and reasoned 
propositions.
<P>
	He did not acknowledge the source of his motion. Openness 
goes back to Mr. Gorbachev and glasnost, which he thought was 
a precondition of perestroika, the open debate. Behind that was 
also the larger global concept of novie mishlenie, the new 
thinking, which says that you can offer hope for constitutional or 
other propositions for change, but unless you have some 
unifying philosophical principles, some sort of larger vision of 
the sort of constitutional society you want to establish, you are 
not likely to take these things very far. That was one interesting 
thing in the constitutional revolution on Russia with 
perestroika, that there was a larger vision.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in looking for foreign models they 
looked extensively at France, Germany, the United States and 
other countries but did not borrow from Canada. The largest 
contributions were made through borrowing of German 
institutions, which then the supreme court based essentially on 
American constitutions but updated to post-war conditions.
<P>
	What I think is rather sad in terms of our constitutional 
development in Canada in the last 30 years has been the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12510"> 12510 </A></B>
<P>
pre-emptiveness of the Quebec presence to the exclusion of 
debate on larger constitutional ideas. If we look back to the 
golden period of the quiet  revolution, in a certain sense its 
main ideas were achieved very early, by the 1970s, in the 
languages laws, Mr. Bourassa's on the provincial side and the 
federal official language law on the federal side. In essence a 
large social economic revolution was achieved under the guise 
of a language reform, with very profound consequences.
<P>
	Beyond that the constitutional ideas seem to lapse into the 
pursuit of constitutional particularity. If you do not have a larger 
pluralistic conception of a constitutional development, those 
ideas are not likely to go very far. Through successive failures 
they have not managed to go very far.
<P>
	One problem therefore is the absence of motor ideas. I find the 
same problem with the Reform Party approach to constitutional 
change, even though there are some reputable right wing think 
tanks in the country and there has been a considerable amount of 
debate in some of these institutions.
<P>
	One basic flaw in the Reform approach is the failure to 
analyse the contradictions in the proposals and to produce some 
sort of operational synthesis. The notion of establishing the 
independence of members of Parliament, of loosening the party 
ranks, and of encouraging free votes goes a certain way. When 
you link it to the concept of consultation and a notion that the 
results of the consultation are to be binding on members, you are 
riding horses running in different directions.
<P>
	This is not tabula rasa. It occurs in terms of constitutional 
development in the history of many countries. In that cradle of 
so many of the contemporary liberal democratic ideas, the 
French revolution and the post-revolutionary settlement, you do 
find the antonyms-government by assembly, highlighted by 
the convention, where everything was debated at great length 
and where the convention made all the decisions, and the 
plebiscitarian idea, which is ultimately consummated by 
Napoleon and others, of submitting it to the people and getting a 
legitimate nation by direct popular vote and the legislative 
chambers become mere ratifying organs.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	In this debate on questions of openness some of the 
contradictions have needed to be resolved, and that has not been 
done. I think that is a pity.
<P>
	There has been a failure also to realize the complexities of 
governmental decision making today and the constitutional 
law making processes. The hon. member for Beaver River, for 
whom I have a very great respect, asked a question today that 
was very critical of the judiciary and the judiciary's role in 
law making. The essence of law making today is the 
recognition that there are many roads to Rome in terms of 
making laws, that there are many players, and no one of these 
has an exclusive role. They are in a very real sense 
complementary. There are some aspects of social policy 
making that are ripe for judicial law making, because judicial 
law making, in essence, is empirically based and problem 
oriented. It is a step by step process that  proceeds in the 
particular fact context of particular cases, solves a particular 
problem in that specific context, and then moves on to the 
next case. After several of those decisions you begin to get 
what is called jurisprudence constante, an evolution of 
principles on an empirical basis.
<P>
	Some other matters clearly are ripe for full popular 
consultation. I think one of the things that is very clear today is 
that no substantive constitutional change can be achieved in the 
future in Canada without submission to the constituent 
processes, without submission to popular vote. I think this is the 
irrevocable lesson of Charlottetown. However, it would be a 
mistake to believe that every aspect of social policy and every 
fine piece of legislation should go that way. There is a 
parliamentary role.
<P>
	I think it would have been helpful in terms of the opposition 
motion today, of the second opposition party, to have had some 
recognition of the manifold nature of the law making process. 
There are some aspects that are ripe for judicial action, some for 
legislative action in the pure sense, and still others that might be 
left to popular consultation. Perhaps there should be some 
offering of criteria for deciding which of these fronts to move 
on.
<P>
	In general I felt that the hon. member for Beaver River was on 
the wrong track today in her particular criticism. That probably 
was the sort of area where we could have the trial and error 
judicial process. Every judicial decision is subject to appeal. 
There is a discretionary issue for attorneys general and justice 
ministers, and one can expect, with the proper exercise of the 
executive process and recognizing that it does not conflict with 
the legislative process, that judge and company operate 
together, legislature and executive, and that decisions of this 
sort, if they are regarded as retrograde by some elements of the 
community, can be appealed. There are interest groups, more 
developed in the United States, but some of them in Canada, that 
have taken this a considerable way in terms of the investigation 
and bringing cases before the courts.
<P>
	I think this has been a helpful debate. I thought that one of the 
questions relating to political parties, whether they should be 
constitutionalized, was a timely question. I hope there will be 
occasions in the present Parliament to consider that in some 
detail. I thank the hon. member opposite who raised the 
question.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of his speech, the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
spoke of the lack of coherence in the Reformers' program. What 
took me a little aback, coming from him was that, without any 
prodding, he spoke of Canada's constitutional development over 
the past 30 years. I realize that the riding of Vancouver Quadra is 
quite distant from mine, Lévis, but I must say that one cannot 
truly talk about constitutional development over the past 30 
years because there has been none. All of the constitutional 
conferences ended in failure and, in particular, I would like to 
remind him that the first version of the Meech Lake accord, 
which was signed by 11 premiers, was called into question 
because, following elections in various provinces, three Liberal 
premiers refused to respect the accord.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Given that the tone of the hon. member's speech would 
suggest that he is very open to consultation, relating back to the 
first point he made, which was the Reformers' lack of a coherent 
program, I would like him to explain to us the coherent program 
being followed by the Liberal government concerning the 
constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that Vancouver 
Quadra is far removed from the centre of Canada, but I myself 
am certainly not far removed from this debate.
<P>
	I acted as a special constitutional adviser to various premiers 
of Quebec, Ontario and other players in the constitutional game, 
but I repeat that in those years, the debate concentrated on 
certain details, while a broader constitutional vision was 
lacking. Canada probably needed a de Gaulle instead of officials 
discussing the finer points of a constitutional proposal.
<P>
	As for what the future holds in store, once the referendum is 
behind us, and we are very optimistic that everything will be 
over with before the end of this year, we can then resume 
constitutional talks without the limitations of pursuing 
something that was clearly rejected by the Canadian people, 
including Quebec, in the referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord in 1993.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.)</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra mentioned in his speech 
that he thought that I, the member for Beaver River, was off base 
today in my question. In terms of openness in government and 
some of the opinions that he has just shared, could he explain to 
me what he was talking about earlier in his speech where he 
assumed that courts and the provincial and federal governments 
are the people that have these avenues?
<P>
	Although provincial governments have the jurisdiction to 
administer and process adoptions, as he was referring to, they 
have absolutely no business, no jurisdiction and no right in 
either the federal, provincial or court system to redefine family.
<P>
	In the member's expert opinion, could he explain to me how I 
am so off base when I asked the minister earlier about legislators 
making the law and courts interpreting the law. Federally and 
provincially it looks as though the courts are actually making 
the laws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not use the phrase off 
base with the hon. member. I have a great respect for the hon. 
member. It seemed to me that her question neglected to include 
the notion that lawmaking is not limited to legislators alone, that 
in modern society the judiciary, the executive and others partake 
in it.
<P>
	Second, judicial lawmaking is particularly attuned to certain 
types of social problems because of the case by case 
development.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The decision the hon. member mentioned this morning is 
subject to appeal. In the normal process a good justice minister 
would consider that possibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the hon. member opposite spent so much time talking about the 
past, perhaps I will start my speech today with a quote from 
Edmund Burke dating back to 1774. The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> used 
this quote on May 21, 1994 to criticize the electronic 
referendum on the Young Offenders Act that I ran in my riding 
of North Vancouver.
<P>
	Edmund Burke said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and 
he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Burke made this statement more than 220 years ago, long 
before the information age. The level of education then was 
probably pretty low and it probably would have been doing a 
disservice to constituents to take their opinions to Parliament. In 
the 1990s people are well educated and well informed. A 
modification of Mr. Burke's statement is in order.
<P>
	I would like to see modern politicians saying: ``Your 
representative owes you not his industry only, but also his 
commitment to alert you to the affairs of government that affect 
you so that you may become informed and so that you may 
instruct him how to represent you''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12512"> 12512 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem is that even if every member in the House agreed 
that his or her first duty is to represent his or her constituents, we 
would still have to overcome the hurdle of repressive party 
discipline that we have already seen illustrated in recent times. 
We cannot change our present, benevolent dictatorship into real 
democracy until we come to grips with that situation.
<P>
	When I was in my late teens and early 20s I belonged to the 
Young Nationals in New Zealand. I worked at many elections, 
helping really good candidates to get elected to go to Wellington 
for which members can read Ottawa. I really hoped they would 
make a difference.
<P>
	It was disappointing to me to find that excellent candidates 
got elected but as soon as they got to Wellington, they were 
unable to represent their constituents' views. They had to toe the 
party line. They never voted against the party under any 
circumstances. At the very least, the strongest statement any of 
them could make was simply to abstain.
<P>
	In those olden days there were no computers or fax machines 
or CNN. Governments pretty well controlled what we knew 
about the world. Even then, I dreamed of a day when voters 
would be able to have a much greater say in the decision making 
of their governments.
<P>
	We have reached a point in time now when the information 
age has made it possible for my dream to become reality. We are 
on the verge of a revolution in democracy, despite the 
unwillingness of the Prime Minister to see the writing on the 
wall.
<P>
	Frankly I doubt whether our parliamentary system can survive 
the information age in its present form. It must adapt and change 
more quickly than it has ever done in history to cope with the 
new power each of us will have as voters. Reading the 
precedents from Beauchesne the way the government whip often 
does is going to have less and less relevance in the future.
<P>
	I can recommend to members a comedy that appears on 
television on Sunday nights on The women's network. It is 
called ``No Job for a Lady''. It is based on the experiences of a 
rookie woman MP in England. Whilst the program is pretty 
funny, it is a fairly accurate portrayal of what happens in this 
place.
<P>
	The writers obviously have a good knowledge of the workings 
of the House of Commons. They have no difficulty showing 
viewers that committee meetings and travel junkets have very 
little use other than to keep MPs busy between votes. They make 
no bones about the fact that the system is completely controlled 
by the Prime Minister and that the wishes of the voters are 
irrelevant to the process.
<P>
	There is growing awareness that the present system is 
becoming less and less relevant in modern times. Let me read a 
segment from an article written for the <I>Financial Post</I> recently 
by Rafe Mair, a talk show host on radio in Vancouver:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely we must now all agree that the system the Fathers of Confederation 
devised of pasting a parliamentary government on to a federal system no 
longer suits us and our present difficulties. Our system, with victory to the 
``first past the post,'' means a minority becomes an official majority which 
can do as it pleases for five years. It usually oppresses the majority and 
certainly oppresses all minorities such as B.C. and Alberta, a clear lesson of 
the election of 1993-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The main argument against changing our system is that it will result in 
weak governments. If by ``weak'' it is meant that the prime minister will not 
have his way unless the Commons, voting freely, agrees, then I will take weak 
government. Surely the collective wisdom of all MPs and their leaders is 
greater than that of a caucus which must agree or lose the perks of power-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For under our system, power is from the top down. The party in power 
must, to stay in power, stay united no matter how bad things get. The party 
leader becomes a dictator-for it is he who appoints cabinet ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries. He controls the patronage. Every backbencher is 
held in check by his own ambition to get into cabinet; each cabinet minister is 
held in check by his desire to stay there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If Chrétien proves incapable of handling our crisis how do we change 
him?-He can't be relieved of office unless the majority of Liberal MPs 
choose to share power, most unlikely given the track record of majority 
governments in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The leader to save Canada from its perils may be sitting in the present 
Parliament-it might even be the Preston Manning or Jean Charest-but we 
will never know unless the centrally dominated Liberal caucus wants it to 
happen. And it is an immutable political law-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Szabo):</B> I would remind the 
member to refer to members in the House by their riding and not 
by their name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was quoting 
from a newspaper article. I assumed it was okay for me to use 
names in that case, but I will avoid doing so in future.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada, in its time of great peril, should not be hostage to an outdated 
system. Clearly, confidence in the ability of our present setup to settle the 
great questions which face us is confidence badly misplaced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was quite a long article but I thought it was very 
worthwhile reading to the House because Rafe Mair made some 
very good points. The Prime Minister will have to face the fact 
that the system is in the process of change.
<P>
	Parliamentary democracies around the world are looking for 
new ways to be more democratic. Thirty years of experience 
under the old system are not going to account for anything in the 
information age. In New Zealand in late 1993 the government 
passed the citizens' initiative and referendum act. New 
Zealand's citizens  now have the right to start initiatives and 
control referenda on the ballot.
<P>
	In the 18 months or so since the implementation of the act a 
number of initiatives have been started. However in almost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12513"> 12513 </A></B>
<P>
every case, as soon as the initiative was registered with 
sufficient signatures, the government reacted, addressed the 
problem and the initiatives were subsequently taken off the 
ballot.
<P>
	We have always been told that initiative and referenda are 
incompatible with parliamentary style democracy, but here is 
New Zealand proving it works. The real reason we do not have 
initiatives and referenda in Canada is because the Prime 
Minister does not want to give up the power he has to control 
what happens in this place.
<P>
	Past governments have been no better. Twice the previous 
government passed a gag law to try to keep people quiet at 
election time. Twice the gag laws were struck down but the 
government still chose to appeal the decision of the Court of 
Queen's Bench in Alberta in an attempt to reimpose the gag law 
on free speech.
<P>
	On May 8 the appeal was heard in Calgary. To refresh 
members' memories, the Alberta Court of Appeal reserved 
judgment after only one day of hearings on the case. On June 25, 
1993, Justice MacLeod of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench 
struck down several sections of the Canada Elections Act which 
restricted expenditures by individuals to only $1,000 and parties 
could spend up to $10 million or whatever they wanted.
<P>
	It was clear from the reaction of the justices, particularly 
Justice Kerans, that the justices had no patience for the 
government's appeal. It looks fairly certain they will overturn 
the government's position and restore free speech, thank 
goodness.
<P>
	For the moment the Prime Minister still has power over his 
MPs but sooner or later, little by little he is going to have to give 
it up. I condemn the government for its failure to keep its red ink 
book promise to make the government more open and to permit 
MPs to be more accountable to their constituents.
<P>
	Besides all of that, the Deputy Prime Minister promised to 
resign if the GST was not gone within one year of the election 
and she still has not done it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
interested that he went back to Edmund Burke. He would have 
Parliament reduced to nothing more than having us be voting 
machines. We could have a questionnaire every night, push a 
button and there would be no need for the House to exist. There 
will be no need to study in detail various bills.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	When I look at the motion the inference is members of the 
Liberal Party are not given more freedom. I remind the 
member that if he were to examine the record in the House he 
would notice there is a lot more divergence in voting among 
the members of the Liberal Party, the  government side, than 
there is among members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> On government bills?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Examine the record. When we look at Reformers 
for the most part they vote as a block. It is borne out by 
examining the records of the House.
<P>
	I point that out to the members. I think they are being 
hypocritical and they do not examine the record. They try to say 
they represent something they do not.
<P>
	I applaud two members of the Reform Party who actually did 
what they said they would do which was represent their 
constituents' wishes in terms of legislation. It relates to gun 
control. I applaud the actions of the member for Edmonton 
Southwest as well as a member from Calgary who stood up and 
represented the wishes of their constituents.
<P>
	How can the Reform Party, whose central campaign was 
representing the wishes of its constituents, do such a flip-flop 
and ignore the wishes of its constituents when it comes to the 
gun legislation or legislation supported by law enforcement 
officers, by chiefs of police, and something that is needed for 
law and order? Not only do its members not support that, they 
are preaching civil disobedience against it.
<P>
	Could the member inform me why they do not follow the 
wishes of their constituents on the gun legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for his questions.
<P>
	When it is obvious to any clear thinking person that we should 
vote down a bill on the other side it is not the least bit surprising 
that 52 clear thinking Reformers would vote against it.
<P>
	The member brings up all the usual red herrings that MPs 
would become voting machines and so on. In my riding there 
have been in the last year only two really controversial issues 
which I have taken back to my constituents. I have done 
comprehensive surveys and even a scientific survey which I am 
currently undergoing with the gun control bill. I am perfectly 
satisfied that within my caucus members are representing their 
ridings. There is no problem with that at all.
<P>
	These red herrings about how we would become voting 
machines are nonsense. New Zealand has proven with its 
initiative and referendum act MPs do not become voting 
machines if you give people more power. I have proved it in my 
riding.
<P>
	Last year I overturned a grant for a women's monument 
project in Vancouver. The people who were organizing that 
were really upset. Two of them called me on a conference call 
and said: ``We will make sure we get rid of you at the next 
election''. I said: ``Please, do not wait until the next election. 
If you can get 15 per cent of the voters in this riding to sign a 
petition to say I am not representing the majority, I will 
resign''. They asked if they could get that in writing. I said 
yes. I put it in writing. To this day I have not seen one 
signature.
<P>

<P>
	Democracy is powerful but we have to give power to the 
majority. We have to give power to the people. That is what 
Reform is attempting to do. It does not mean we turn into voting 
machines. It simply means we give a Canada to people built 
the way they want it to be instead of built the way the elite want 
it to be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to follow my hon. colleague. I agree with 
what he had to say.
<P>
	It is helpful to have this type of motion presented every now 
and then for a reality check to see if anything has changed in 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	I will speak today about parliamentary reform. When we first 
arrived here in the cold of the winter 1993-94, I took on the 
responsibility of chairing the group in my party particularly 
interested in parliamentary reform. Except for the members for 
Lethbridge and Beaver River, we were all pretty new at this and 
we felt that with a little change here and there and a slight move 
parliamentary rules could probably be changed quite easily.
<P>
	We became quick learners, realizing rules and traditions 
grown up over many years were not so easily changed. I admit in 
some instance we became aware of the need for these rules and 
why they should be left alone.
<P>
	If life is a great learning experience, parliamentary life is at 
least doubly so. Two things happened very early in this 
Parliament that led me to believe real change was possible. The 
first was the introduction and subsequent adoption of the 
government motion which directed the procedure and House 
affairs committee to study a whole range of matters dealing with 
reform.
<P>
	The motion referred to freer voting, sending bills to 
committee prior to second reading, allowing committees to draft 
bills, referendums, recall and other methods by which 
backbenchers or private members could become more involved 
in the policy influencing process.
<P>
	The second matter that gave me hope was the adoption of my 
private members' Motion No. 89. During the third hour of 
debate it was amended by the government to read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should continue to 
increasingly permit members of the House of Commons to fully represent 
constituents' views on the government's legislative program and spending 
plans by adopting the position that the defeat of any government measure, 
including a spending measure, shall not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government unless followed by the adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice it does not specify Private Members' Business. It 
was adopted unanimously. This was the setting for real 
change, a committee ably chaired by the member for Kingston 
and the Islands and a motion advanced by an opposition MP 
from the Reform Party calling for freer  voting adopted 
unanimously by the House of Commons. This was the hope. 
Let us look at the reality.
<P>
	To be fair to the members on the government side, we have 
seen some change, and one measure I proposed as a private 
members' bill was the beneficiary of this changed attitude. Bill 
C-232, a bill to give grandparents right of access to 
grandchildren, passed through the House a week ago and was 
sent to the justice committee for study.
<P>
	The bill had been kicking around Parliament in one form or 
another for more than 10 years and never came this far. I have a 
changed attitude towards Private Members' Business to thank 
for at least getting the bill through second reading and off to 
committee. Private Members' Business does seem to be one 
avenue where the government is attempting to make changes.
<P>
	In my discussions with members opposite regarding whether 
they would support the bill, I was continuously assured free 
votes were allowed on private members' bills. It would seem 
from the number of private members' bills now in committee 
this is true.
<P>
	However, this is only the first very tentative step along the 
way to true freer voting in Parliament. It is almost the 
government saying when it really does not matter all that much, 
backbenchers are free to vote as they please. I believe it is time 
we moved this beyond the first step and started to apply freer 
voting to government bills as well.
<P>
	We have had with Bill C-68 first hand experience with 
punishment being handed out to those on the government side 
who dared to vote against the party line.
<P>
	It was the opinion of those involved in the writing of the 
McGrath report in 1985 and those who sat on the House 
management committee in 1993 that dissent should be allowed 
to be expressed without fear of retaliation by the leadership of 
the political party concerned. Both groups believed the 
expression of dissent would make the House a healthier place.
<P>
	I have to endorse that. It would be a healthier place. It would 
be a place where members who felt very strongly about an issue 
would not have to vote the party line and could do so without 
fear of retribution.
<P>
	What happened? We need only to look at the voting patterns in 
other Parliaments similar to ours to realize the confidence 
convention has been relaxed and the sun still rises in the east 
every day and governments have not crumbled.
<P>
	Some members in the House on the government side today 
worked on the McGrath report. What happened? The reality of 
the day seems to be while in opposition they protest loudly but 
when the people of Canada give the opposition a mandate to do 
everything it promised to do, suddenly it is no longer the 
champion of democracy.
<P>

<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	As my fellow Reform member for Calgary North reminded us 
all earlier, democracy has to be looked after. It has to be 
protected. Sadly in the House we do not have rule by the people, 
we have rule by the party. She was quite right.
<P>
	It appears party discipline is as strong as ever. When 
constituents clearly tell their MP how they feel on an issue that 
MP is not allowed to vote to represent a democracy. Rather, he or 
she is punished if they have the intestinal fortitude to rise in the 
House and truly represent their constituents, just for keeping 
their promises to their constituents.
<P>
	Something is wrong. We have 295 MPs but we do not have 
democracy. It is a sign of strength to allow dissent to be 
expressed. It is not a sign of weakness or of weak leadership.
<P>
	Professor Philip Morton, an academic in Great Britain who 
has devoted a great deal of study to this issue of freer voting or 
cross-party voting, has concluded this phenomenon, as he calls 
it, has led to a growing awareness of what can be achieved by 
such action by backbenchers. The lack of retribution or 
punishment of members who vote against the party line in Great 
Britain, Australia and New Zealand has produced a change in 
attitude on the part of many MPs as they now felt their views 
mattered and they were really participating in the policy 
process.
<P>
	The process had been expanded beyond the cabinet table. I say 
to those like Professor Robert Jackson of Carleton University 
who oppose freer voting on the grounds they would lead to 
chaos, nonsense. We are not advocating free votes on every 
piece of legislation. We are simply advocating limited 
expressions of dissent from the party line be allowed to take 
place without fear of repercussions from the party leadership.
<P>
	What happened in the House recently on Bill C-68 showed us 
very clearly on the government side-and let us be honest and 
truthful about this-it is not a fact yet. It is something I hope 
will come in the House but at this time it is not a fact that 
members of the government can vote according to the wishes of 
their constituents without severe repercussions. That is a sad 
state of affairs.
<P>
	All this bickering back and forth, all these smart, snide 
remarks will not change the facts or the truth. Let us stop with 
the silliness and start dealing with the truth. It is a fact that 
happened in the House.
<P>
	I spent many years teaching and I tried to tell students one 
thing. When one debates one does not make smart cracks or 
snide remarks to people; one deals with facts. When students 
debated in competition in British Columbia, which is the only 
experience I have to go on, judges and their peers sat in the 
back row. If a student were to ever make a point without fact 
there was a stroke right across the card. That student was 
never able to win in points on debate. I am really sorry 
because I thought  when we reached this level we would see 
people really using wisdom and experience.
<P>
	I have seen some excellent debaters in the House. I am always 
so sorry when I see this cheap shot being taken. I hope we can 
start remembering to treat each other more with respect in the 
House and debate as the House is worthy.
<P>
	We would like to see the intent of Motion No. 89 adopted 
unanimously by the House to be applied to government bills. I 
also congratulate those on the other side who voted against the 
party line on Bill C-68, but definitely not because they went 
against the party line. They allowed the wishes of their 
constituents to be expressed in Parliament at great personal risk 
to their political futures. They are to be congratulated, not 
condemned. They should remember they can always find an 
ideological home right here. I think we still have some spare 
seats.
<P>
	Moving on to other aspects of reform, committees, two in 
particular, have been allowed to draft bills. One bill deals with 
electoral boundaries and the other with lobbying.
<P>
	We on this side are concerned that at least with regard to the 
lobbying bill it was ultimately drafted to corresponded with 
instructions from either the Prime Minister's office or the privy 
council office. However, it seems we have made a start in this 
area, albeit tentative, and we should do much more with regard 
to committees drafting legislation. No one knows better than I 
how much time the drafting of legislation takes and then 
securing support for the legislation, but we owe it to our 
constituents to take this time.
<P>
	Will legislation be coming forward to allow for referendums 
to be of help on moral issues such as physician assisted suicide? 
What about the recall of members of Parliament who are not 
doing their jobs? What about legislation to provide for citizens 
initiatives?
<P>
	I hope I am not wrong, but I believe to effect these changes we 
will have to change places with the political party opposite.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., it is my 
duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 81 the 
proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.
