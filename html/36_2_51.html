NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a particular pleasure for me to 
present this next petition.  As you can see by the petition 
itself, Mr. Speaker, this is not a prop.  This is a petition 
bearing thousands and thousands of names, maybe 20,000 names, of 
people from Kamloops who are concerned about the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are suggesting that if we are going to have a tax reduction 
in the upcoming budget, we should phase out the GST so that 
everyone benefits from the tax reduction:  children, people on 
low incomes and people with fixed incomes.  They feel that every 
single Canadian would benefit from a reduction in the GST; 
whereas if we simply reduce the income tax only people who pay 
income tax will benefit.  This is the fairest way to reduce 
taxes.  Thousands of people in the great city of Kamloops are 
calling on the government to do just that.

Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition this morning, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, on behalf of many constituents as 
well as people from across Canada, including Kamloops, British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians are concerned that the Criminal Code of Canada 
makes it too easy for people, who have been convicted of serious 
crimes, such as murder, attempted murder, sexual assault and 
manslaughter involving imprisonment greater than five years, to 
obtain release from custody pending the hearing of their appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are asking the House of Commons and the 
Government of Canada to amend the Criminal Code of Canada to 
prevent persons convicted of these serious crimes from being 
released from custody pending the hearing of their appeal except 
in exceptional circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think many Canadians would support this particular petition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK35">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Legislative Committee on Bill C-20, 
An Act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out 
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference, to hold public hearings in all regions of 
Quebec and Canada so as to hear as many witnesses having an 
interest in the Bill as possible, that the hearings be broadcast 
and that the Committee be given sufficient resources to hold such 
hearings, all in accordance with the rules and practices of the 
House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I simply want to draw to your attention and to the attention of 
the members of this House that the Bloc Quebecois leader will be 
sharing his time with the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry 
and that all the Bloc Quebecois members who will rise afterwards 
will also be sharing their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are moving this motion 
today, the day after the committee began its proceedings on Bill 
C-20. As we know, this bill deals essentially with two things: 
the alleged clarity of the question and the percentage or 
majority required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, this is a bill that seeks to deny the rights of the 
National Assembly, which has held referendums under its own 
rules in the past. I am referring to the two referendums on 
sovereignty, in 1980 and 1995, and to the referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord, in 1992, when a Liberal government was in 
office in Quebec. The federal government is now questioning 
these eminently democratic exercises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of clarity, it is somewhat surprising to think 
that the members of the House of Commons, 75 of whom come from 
Quebec and 226 from the other provinces, are better able than 
the members of the National Assembly to determine the clarity of 
a question.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we know that two thirds of the members from Quebec, 
representing the people of Quebec and democratically mandated to 
do so, oppose this bill.  Those who think they speak on behalf 
of the Quebecers should look at those who represent them in this 
place and note that they represent only a third of the Quebec 
delegation in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders how people from Moose Jaw, Regina, Halifax, 
Vancouver or Toronto would be in a better position to determine 
the clarity of a question than people from Chicoutimi, 
Tadoussac, Laval, Quebec City, Montreal, Trois-Rivières or Hull. 
This sort of thing is rather insulting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes no sense is the fact that the government claims these 
people would be more able to determine what makes the question 
clear, but refuses to let the committee consult these people 
across Quebec and Canada to see whether the bill is clear. 
There is more than an apparent contradiction here. There is a 
real one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they want to consult everyone in Canada when Quebecers 
have to decide their future, but refuse to let the people of 
Canada and Quebec be consulted when the time comes for the House 
to pass this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of clarity, let us look at the latest referendum. 
On the eve of the referendum, I heard the Prime Minister say in 
a speech to the people, as he looked them in the eye with the 
camera focussed on him so that everyone could see his alleged 
sincerity “The question is clear: if you say yes, you leave; if 
you say no, you stay”.  I was not the one saying that, it was 
the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That evening, I said to myself that it was really clear, that if 
the Prime Minister understood, if the member for Saint-Maurice 
understood, a lot of people understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that rather contemptuous of the 94% of Quebecers who took 
part in this very democratic process.  That day, apparently 94% 
of the people went to vote without having any idea what they 
were doing.  That is extraordinary.  Those who voted no 
apparently understood, and those who voted yes, apparently did 
not know what they were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about all those Canadians who flocked to Montreal to 
take part in a love-in, thanks to Canadian Airlines' generosity—a 
$100 fare from Vancouver to Montreal, but not the other way 
around?  Was the question not clear when all these folks came to 
Montreal to tell us that they loved us?  Was the question not 
clear when they all rushed panic-stricken to implore us not to 
leave? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder about the reasoning.  Did these people come for 
nothing, or was it perhaps that what was not clear was how much 
they actually loved us. Now that is something else again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Finally, I looked at the question asked in a 
referendum held under the auspices of the federal government in 
the Lac-Saint-Jean region, for the Montagnais, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two questions, but only one possible answer.  It is 
not possible to answer yes to the first and no to the second. 
There are two questions, but it is yes or no to both; it is not 
possible to answer yes to the one and no to the other, or vice 
versa.  There are three paragraphs, some 250 words referring to 
a few pieces of legislation, to some regulations about an 
agreement that is not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government talks to us about clarity.  In this 
referendum, and I am thinking of the other point about this 
bill, there is a 50% plus one rule.  In this referendum, they 
will accept 50% plus one of the votes, a clear majority, an 
absolute majority, as they say in the book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we are saying.  You know what an absolute 
majority is, Mr. Speaker.  It is more than half of the votes, 
50% plus one.  That is what a majority is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority was good enough in the Lac-Saint-Jean referendum for 
the Montagnais.  A majority was good enough for Newfoundland in 
1948.  What was good enough for Newfoundlanders or the 
Montagnais is not good enough for Quebecers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I listened to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. He should realize that his bill accords more importance 
to a federalist vote than a sovereignist one. The vote of the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs would carry more weight 
than mine.  Is not everyone equal before the law? 
Yesterday, when I heard him get upset and talk to my colleague 
from Beauharnois—Salaberry in a familiar tone, saying “How can 
one assume there would not be any negotiations?”

reminded me of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, when he was the Minister 
of Justice here in Ottawa. At the time, he addressed the then 
Quebec Premier, Daniel Johnson senior as “the member 
from Bagot”. Daniel Johnson replied by calling him “the member 
from Mount Royal”. That is what it was, the same kind of 
slightly contemptuous attitude that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs displayed yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that we could not take for granted that he would not 
negotiate. But what are we to expect from someone who talks 
about clarity but is unable to set a threshold, which could be 
different from 50% plus one in his view? He wants clarity, but 
he says “Listen, let us first have a referendum, and then, in my 
greatness, I will tell you whether the result is acceptable or 
not”. It is rather disturbing for his students. I wonder if, as 
a professor, he used to tell his students “Write the exam first, 
I will decide if you made the grade later. I will let you know 
whether the passing mark was 60%, 75% or 80% and will determine 
if my question was clear enough”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what he told us and is telling us. He talks about 
clarity, but it was quite extraordinary to see the attitude he 
displayed yesterday. Of course we have to assume that he does 
not want to negotiate when we know that he will not even tell us 
what the required percentage is. How can we trust anyone who 
acts as judge and jury? This is what the minister is doing, 
acting as judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used some arguments, when answering a question from my 
colleague and critic for the Conservative Party, the hon. member 
for Richmond—Arthabasca, who was asking “The Bloc members, are 
they not afraid of losing their pension?” Why, as members, would 
we would not be entitled to our pension if they are? He need not 
worry, when the federal members' pensions is the only thing left 
to negotiate, we already know who we will choose as our two 
negotiators: the Prime Minister of Canada and André Ouellet. 
They have a major interest in negotiating theirs. I can assure 
you of that, Mr. Speaker, and I trust them in terms of 
negotiating their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister is currently moving in circles where others 
have moved in the past. It is very easy, as a Quebecer, to 
become a very popular minister in English Canada, as he is 
currently. As for the two solitudes, he personifies both of 
them, and could be called a hero in English Canada in Quebec. 
He certainly does not represent the people of Quebec. Now this 
is easy, it is what is expected from Quebec politicians; they 
are very popular in English Canada when they are used to stifle 
Quebecers. This is what he is doing and it is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, it seems to me that it would be normal—and 
my colleague will get more specific—to let the committee travel 
in every region in Canada and Quebec to meet people. All the 
other opposition parties agree with that. We differ on the 
bill's content, but certainly not on the need to consult 
Canadians and Quebecers in order to bring some clarity in this 
confused legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
leader for speaking out on this issue of the utmost importance 
for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him a question regarding the fact that there 
are Liberal members from Quebec who are taking part in this 
attack on Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what he thinks of members who were elected 
for the Liberal Party in Quebec and who support Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, they have the 
right to have an opinion that is different from ours, but they 
should have the courage of their convictions and come to Quebec 
to explain their position. That is what I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them are here today. It would be interesting if they 
took part in this debate and asked questions, but it would 
appear that they are not going to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the patriation of the Constitution in 1982. Out of 
the 75 federalist members representing Quebec, at that time, 
only two expressed their opposition, namely Roch LaSalle, a 
Conservative, and Mr. Duclos, a Liberal, who had the courage of 
his convictions and told his party “No. I refuse to play the 
role English Canada is asking me to play in Ottawa. I represent 
Quebecers. 
I am not a pawn to be used by those who want to impose their 
will upon us”. We remember that the federal Liberals had the 
lesson of their life in the following election. Since then, they 
are a minority in Quebec. They paid for what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, in the next election, voters in Canada will realize 
that the time has come to have people other than Liberals to 
represent them in Ottawa. I agree with the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Prime Minister when they tell 
us that they will not negotiate after a yes victory in Quebec. 
They are right, because Canadians will send other people to 
negotiate on their behalf. The work of Liberals will be 
finished. They will have failed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank our leader, the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, for 
this fine sortie against Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know his impressions on one specific issue.  If, 
in 1995, during the referendum debate in Quebec, the National 
Assembly had passed such a bill against the federalist vote, 
limiting it so that it would have less weight than the 
sovereignist vote, what would people have thought of the 
National Assembly and of its Parti Quebecois members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we did not, and would not, do 
such a thing, because of our respect for democracy.  For us it 
is a matter of one person, one vote.  Everyone is equal in the 
eyes of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been most extraordinary, if we had said “Votes in 
sovereignist ridings hold more weight than those in federalist 
ridings.  Let us weight them differently, arrange things so that 
it passes, and then we will let people know the outcome.  Vote 
first and then we will tell you the outcome.  We will concoct 
one”.  That is what they are telling us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes no sense.  The same goes for clarity.  If the 
question had been “Do you want Quebec to become a sovereign 
country?” and then the whole debate had centred on partnership, 
they would have said “Aha, there was a trick in it.  You 
referred to a partnership. 
You did not dare put it in the question”.  Damned if you do, and 
damned if you don't, as they say.  We are used to that here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers have wakened up.  Let Canadians do the same, and open 
their eyes to the fact that the Liberals are misinforming them 
about Quebec.  Let them send their own representatives to talk 
to Quebecers, equal to equal.  Let them respect the fact that 
Quebecers are a people, just as they are.  We are neither 
superior nor inferior.  For once in this whole business, we want 
to speak together on an equal footing, with the same status, not 
inferior and not superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never be the first country in the world.  There is no 
such thing.  This is a ridiculous illusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have our country, like the Canadians have theirs. 
Perhaps then we will be able to get along as friends, which we 
have trouble doing while under the same roof.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
rise on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to support this motion I 
will move an amendment to, at the end of my remarks, and to 
explain that Bloc Quebecois members really want Quebecers and 
other Canadians to have the opportunity to be heard on Bill C-20.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made this request repeatedly in the House. It has always 
been refused by the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Leader of the Government in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried again in the committee Bill C-20 was referred to. The 
Liberal majority rejected this proposal, which was supported by 
the three other opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last time in this House, we would like to try to 
convince the government members that Canadians should be given 
the opportunity to air their views on this bill, whether they 
agree or disagree, in a place where it will be easier for them 
to do so, that is in their own town or city, in the town hall or 
community centre where they usually take an active part in the 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks will deal with the undermining of democracy by Bill 
C-20, but also by the process by which the government wants to 
have it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The architect of this bill, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, does not like it when we tell him about the 
undemocratic nature of his bill. Nor does he like it when we 
talk about the extremely undemocratic nature of the process, 
which is under way, whereby this bill will be considered and 
passed by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the undemocratic nature of this. I am not 
shy to talk about it, and I believe a great majority of 
Quebecers share this view. In this respect, we, of the Bloc 
Quebecois, are very representative of what Quebecers think both 
about this bill and about the process by which the House wants 
to have it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think of it, this bill is undemocratic because the 
democracy it is creating will disallow what the national 
assembly and the Quebec people decide. This is also democracy 
that gags the work of the House and the work of the committee 
considering Bill C-20. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a democracy of disallowance, a sick democracy because it 
wants to disallow the national assembly, to disallow a national 
assembly that always had the privilege and the authority to 
adopt a question, to decide what Quebecers would be consulted 
on, to frame a question which was debated by the national 
assembly for 35 hours, which was debated by majority and 
opposition parties, sovereignist and federalist parties, and 
which was finally adopted by the assembly, the seat of the 
sovereignty of the Quebec people, who must continue to freely 
decide its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 would allow the House of Commons to disallow a question 
adopted by the national assembly. 
Despite all the rhetoric about the respect of the national 
assembly's right to determine the content and wording of the 
question, this bill confirms the right of the House of Commons 
to determine that a question adopted by the national assembly is 
not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons tells and, in a way, orders the national 
assembly not to ask a question dealing with a mandate to 
negotiate, or referring to an economic and political partnership 
that Quebec would generously offer Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a democracy is a democracy that disallows the jurisdiction 
and prerogative of Quebec, its national assembly and its people 
when it comes to deciding its future and how to shape that 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a breach of the national assembly's prerogatives is very 
serious, a breach of the Quebec people's sovereignty is even 
more serious because under this bill the federal government 
could challenge a majority vote by which the Quebec people would 
have decided to have its own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Bill C-20 is totally confusing in that respect, the very 
opposite of the principle of clarity it proclaims. For instance, 
clause 2(2) sets out a number of criteria that give no clear 
indication of what would constitute a real majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This democracy disallows the people of Quebec and the choice it 
would make in a referendum. As the Premier of Quebec said a few 
days ago, such a bill shows the will of the government to give 
this House a true power of disallowance and reservation 
regarding resolutions passed by the national assembly and 
decisions made by the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable, it is undemocratic and we will repeat it 
both in this House and in committee. We will have no reservation 
denouncing Bill C-20 as an undemocratic measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This democracy is also characterized by closure. 
The Leader of the Government in the House will not like to hear 
us say that, seeing as he introduced time allocation motions to 
end to the debate on the bill before the House after only a few 
hours of debate at second reading, when only seven members from 
the Bloc Quebecois had the opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gag order introduced by the government House leader is 
unacceptable and all opposition parties condemned it at the 
time of the vote. A democracy that gags debate on such an 
important bill for the future of Quebec people and in fact all 
Quebecers and other Canadians is a very troubled democracy 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the same kind of closure attitude and democracy in 
the committee that was set up to study the bill. At its very 
first sitting, members were informed that only 45 witnesses 
would be heard. Quotas were imposed on the parties. Each party 
is allowed to call in a certain number of witnesses: 15 for the 
Liberal Party, 12 for the Reform Party, 10 for the Bloc 
Quebecois and 4 for the Progressive Conservative Party and 
the NDP. We were even refused the right to inform the 
citizens of Canada and Quebec that hearings were being held and 
that the committee was prepared to hear their views and receive 
their briefs. The work of the committee was gagged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we know that the government is determined to move extremely 
quickly and to steamroller the opposition even though it represents 62% of 
Canadians in this House. The Bloc Quebecois represents a lot 
more Quebecers than the majority government party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party, I want to move an amendment to the 
motion. I move:

committed to considering those dissenting voices, and seeking to 
acknowledge and address those voices in the laws by which all in 
the community must live.

to congratulate my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry for his 
speech and thank him for enlightening us on the underhanded 
dealings by the government in its efforts to deny the basic 
rights of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 3(2) of Bill C-20 contains an unacceptable threat to 
territorial integrity and a threat whose intent is to limit the 
right of the people of Quebec to freely choose its status and 
its political future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry: in 
Quebec whose task it is to set the terms of its authority over 
all parts of its territory? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we realize that the bill 
talks of borders in the clause my colleague has cited, we truly 
understand that the issue of borders is raised not to enlighten 
Quebecers on what will happen, but to frighten them, to intimate 
that the territory of Quebec may likely or possibly be 
partitioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the minister has said—and he repeated it yesterday—that 
it is perhaps a matter of border correction as was the case in 
Slovakia or in other countries that achieved sovereignty, I am 
pleased to note that bill 99, currently being debated in the 
Quebec National Assembly, reaffirms the Quebec consensus on this 
matter, which involves all provincial political parties, be they 
the Parti Quebecois, the Quebec Liberal Party or the Action 
démocratique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reaffirms that Quebec's territorial integrity must be 
preserved and that all the political party leaders are unanimous 
in saying that, in the event of separation, Quebec must keep its 
borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is a healthy thing.  In most, all—I should 
say—of the recent cases of declaration of independence, even 
those involving minorities or native populations, the new 
republics of the USSR, Yugoslavia or Slovakia, for example, kept 
their borders.  This makes good common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry also explained that there is 
another piece of trickery going on and that is the choice of 
date.  We must remember the strategy used shortly before 
Christmas, and the impact this choice of date had on democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public was not consulted.  They mention 45 groups.  They 
seem to want to flaunt the fact that 45 groups will be appearing 
before the committee.  They think that 45 groups will do, but 
there is also a need for the public to be made aware of the 
impact of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is giving me an 
opportunity to inform the House, if it is not already aware, 
that it is very difficult to interest witnesses in appearing 
before the committee on such short notice.  Since it began its 
work, the committee has had great difficulty getting witnesses 
to appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were supposed to be witnesses yesterday evening, and none 
appeared.  Some were scheduled for 9.30 this morning, but the 
first were heard at 10.15 a.m.  We have no agenda for this 
afternoon because no witnesses could be recruited.  I do not 
know what is on the agenda for tomorrow or next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The haste with which the government wishes to proceed is an 
affront to Canadian democracy, which usually permits 
parliamentary committees to give citizens notice and invite them 
to appear and present briefs, which in many other instances has 
allowed committees to travel abroad, in Quebec and Canada to 
hear from witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prognosis for democracy in Quebec and in Canada is not good. 
That is why we want this bill withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should Bill C-20 be passed anyway, it will not have any

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in 
today's debate, even though, basically, it is sad to have such a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad because the Bloc Quebecois moved this motion for a 
somewhat artificial purpose, under the pretence of a procedural 
debate. However, as we just heard, on the substantive issue, 
they of course want to start the debate on Bill C-20 all over 
again, a debate they did not really participate in because they 
wasted the time of the House by wanting to table press clippings 
and old newspaper articles, and by resorting to other similar 
tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion from the Bloc Quebecois reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Legislative Committee on Bill C-20, 
An Act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out 
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference, to hold public hearings in all the regions 
of Quebec and Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably, this means of Quebec and of the rest of Canada, but 
this is how the motion is worded. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—so as to hear as many witnesses having an interest in the Bill 
as possible. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is opposed to this motion which would instruct 
the legislative committee on the bill to hold public hearings 
outside Ottawa. Why? First, because the goal of the Bloc 
Quebecois is not to make the committee travel to hear more 
witnesses. 
Its objective is to cause unreasonable delays. We already have 
plenty of evidence to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members tried to table in this House close to 300 
press clippings, 300 articles from old newspapers. They 
preferred to do that instead of hearing themselves talk. One 
must conclude that what they had to say was not very important 
since, instead of making speeches, they resorted to such 
manoeuvres in a futile attempt to attract the attention of the 
media and of Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, one cannot say that the parliamentary committee is not 
doing its work properly. To start with, the members sitting on 
this committee are doing excellent work. They are all members 
who take this whole debate to heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the witnesses appearing before the committee are of 
great quality. Of course, there are those who choose not to 
invite witnesses they want to be able to say that these 
witnesses could not be heard. For example, the committee is 
hearing today from Mr. Lebel and Mr. Castonguay. They are not 
just anybody. 
I am not saying that I will agree with all the witnesses who 
will appear before this parliamentary committee, but there are 
people who have something to say, important things to say, 
presumably, and who will appear before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the committee hearings will be televised and 
that all Canadians will be able to watch them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All hon. members are aware of the real agenda behind this 
motion.  It is not to enable more Canadians to testify before the 
legislative committee.  Bloc members have admitted that they are 
not even using all the time slots available to them now to 
produce witnesses, so how can they claim that they need even 
more?  It is not to hear from witnesses. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have to mention something important. I heard some 
members of the Bloc say a few days ago that certain witnesses 
will not be able to appear before the committee in Ottawa. 
However, these very same witnesses, at least several of them, 
and many others came in Ottawa a week ago to insist on being 
heard by the parliamentary committee. Now they claim that they 
cannot come to Ottawa to be heard by the committee. It is 
absurd. It is still the same distance to come to Ottawa as it 
was last week. How can we take them seriously when they are 
saying that it will be impossible for these witnesses to be hear 
d? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the real agenda is to do anything but have an open 
democratic review of this bill.  The real agenda is to stall Bill 
C-20.  We have proof of that.  Anyone who has watched the House 
of Commons over recent months will know.  When members of 
parliament try at least 300 times to waste the time of the House 
by tabling old newspaper clippings instead of making speeches, it 
is quite obvious what is going on.  The agenda is to kill the 
bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois that the 
way the legislative committee conducts its business depends, 
first, on the committee's recommendation and, second, on the 
House's decision. As I noted, regarding the selection of 
witnesses, Standing Order 113 says that the committee is 
empowered to examine the bill and to hear as witnesses people 
who have a technical expertise to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wanted to be as flexible as possible by offering 
members of this House the opportunity to use a definition of 
these witnesses on technical matters that is broad enough to 
allow the people to participate fully in this process, as long 
as some members of this House do not, of course, use this as an 
excuse to slow down the work of the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted that, because Bill C-20 affects all men and women in 
Canada, whether they live in Quebec or elsewhere, its 
proceedings should be televised so that all those who wish to do 
so, since 80% or 90% of Canadians who have access to cable 
services, can watch the witnesses appearing before this 
parliamentary committee.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also responded to a letter from the leader of the Conservative 
Party who claimed that he wanted to propose a reasoned amendment 
to improve the bill.  One does not need to be a student of 
parliamentary procedure for too long to know that a reasoned 
amendment does not amend the bill. A reasoned amendment amends 
the motion of the bill. It can only do one thing, kill the bill. 
This is from time immemorial. It is in all of our procedural 
documents. The bill would disappear after a reasoned amendment 
was carried which is what the leader of the Conservatives 
offered.  The bill would disappear from the order paper. That is 
on page 640 of our procedural manual. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does the government intend to do what the Conservative Party 
leader asked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative committee agreed to hear witnesses from all over 
Canada, witnesses such as the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs who yesterday made an excellent presentation before the 
parliamentary committee. Almost all Canadians, whether they 
live in Quebec or elsewhere, will be able to watch that 
presentation and many others on television. The media can also 
air excerpts in their news reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That's something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> The hon. member across the way says it is new. 
It is not something completely new, but it is nevertheless an 
exception for a parliamentary committee— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> An exception? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> If the hon. member wants to hear the answer, 
he should listen.  If a committee is televised, it is an 
exception, nevertheless, something that happens by order of the 
committee chairs in collaboration with the whips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Several committees are televised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> This does not happen with more than one 
committee at a time.  Anyone who comes to parliament regularly 
knows how things work in parliament.  In general, there can be 
only one parliamentary committee at a time with access to the 
room prepared for televising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter has been in the public domain since the supreme 
court's opinion on the reference, in August 1998.  The hon. 
members over the way cannot, therefore, claim that this is 
something new, something about which the Canadian public knew 
nothing. 
It will be remembered that even the premier of Quebec 
congratulated the supreme court at the time.  He said he was 
delighted with the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remind ourselves of what the supreme court said in this 
decision.  It said that it was up to the political actors, to 
the elected representatives, to determine what constituted a 
clear majority in the case of a referendum.  The court chose to 
add the word clear, a question that should be clear or 
unambiguous.  These then were the two criteria established since 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When certain members claim, as one just has, that the contents 
of the bill introduced in the House on December 13 last were 
unknown until then, they are not acting very seriously.  The 
supreme court opinion had been known of since 1998, so there was 
nothing new about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, they are not acting very seriously either in 
claiming simultaneously that this bill was introduced on 
December 13 and that the House is pushing it through too quickly 
on February 17 of the following year.  The members across the 
way are not acting very seriously, and they are well aware of 
this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember that other bills have been passed in this 
House and elsewhere a lot faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House why this government believes 
that we should pass Bill C-20. It is a vital issue for our 
country. The Government of Canada must play an important role to 
follow up on the requirement for clarity as set out by the 
Supreme Court of Canada in its opinion dated August 20, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty and our obligation to say which factors will be 
considered when the time comes to decide if we must negotiate 
the separation of one province from Canada. Obviously, like most 
Canadians and Quebecers, I hope this will never happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members accuse us of having no respect for the National 
Assembly of Quebec and the population of Quebec. Since when is 
it undemocratic to ask for clarity? The members opposite say 
that they respect democracy. Yet they refuse to accept the 
result of two democratic referendums. They say “Till next time. 
See you soon” or something to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite say “It is not a problem if the public does 
not share our views. We do not have to respect democracy when 
the answer is not the one we want. When it is the one we wish 
for, it is a different matter”. And they claim to be great 
democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the ones who launched this debate. It is not the 
Government of Canada. It is not the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs nor the Prime Minister of Canada nor 
the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. It is not 
the Government of Canada who is seeking to destroy the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we said that we would discuss the matter and give the 
House a role in the decision to undertake negotiations on the 
secession of a province in the unlikely event—an event I hope 
will never happen—that a province wanted to leave this beautiful 
country, which the United Nations has been determined is the 
best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like very much to put aside the debate concerning 
another referendum on secession, but the separatist leaders in 
Quebec refuse to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We have to talk about the Americans, the French 
and the Germans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> I just heard a member on the other side 
talking about the United States, France and other countries. It 
is rather interesting, because the United States of America and 
France are both indivisible countries. And yet, the members 
opposite say that “other countries are indivisible, but Canada 
can be divided”, even if people say that Canada must stay 
together and have said so twice in Quebec. But they do not care 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc afraid of asking Quebecers whether or not they wish 
to separate from the rest of Canada and become an independent 
country? Yes, of course. The member opposite just said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We are not afraid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> The members opposite have proven that they are 
afraid to ask a clear question and to obtain a clear answer. 
That is why we have always had ambiguous questions in the past. 
They were questions 70 and 120 words long to ask Quebecers “Do 
you want to separate, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> In my riding, 94% of the voters said yes and you 
claim that they did not understand? This is really incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> I see that some members opposite are reacting. 
They are free to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province's separation is too serious and too irreversible for 
our government to undertake negotiations leading to secession 
without its being sure that this is what the people really want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs spoke of this in his 
December 13 speech.  The more serious the decision, the more it 
must have the unanimous support of society.  This has been a 
principle of democracy from day one.  It is so strongly 
entrenched that even people's organizations say that it takes a 
two thirds majority to change their bylaws.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has spoken of this.  He even referred to 
groups such as hunting and fishing clubs, unions or other 
organizations, which require substantial majorities before their 
bylaws can be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The Montagnais too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> However, the people opposite are trying to 
tell us that the people of Quebec were able to say no to their 
proposal twice, even if the question was totally ambiguous, even 
if the members opposite tried to confuse the people.  With a yes 
vote, they could break up the country, even though the supreme 
court has said this is not the way to go about it.  This is what 
the members opposite claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this is not the way to break up a country.  Naturally, in 
any case, the people of Canada, whether they live in Quebec or 
elsewhere, do not want to break up this country.  Canadians want 
to keep it whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born in Quebec and am a Franco-Ontarian by adoption.  I too 
want this country to remain whole— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Yes, I hear the comments by the members 
opposite. I heard them again, as I have often heard them in the 
past, on the subject of francophones outside Quebec. This 
happens often— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Your language, your culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> —among the Bloc Quebecois element, contempt for 
francophones outside Quebec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> —is often heard.  We heard it again a few 
minutes ago in this House.  I do not like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am used to it a bit, but we know the source of it. 
It always comes from the same source naturally. The people 
opposite will not manage to break up the country. Neither will 
they kill off francophones outside Quebec with the disdain 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas:</B> That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> —they so often display, even today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity bill sets out the circumstances in which this House 
would say that the government of Canada would be required to 
undertake the negotiation of the separation of a province from 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we all want the country to remain united and strong 
as it is now. The bill is reasonable. The government has imposed 
a reasonable approach. Day after day, we have witnessed the 
delaying tactics used to hold up the bill. 
Then, we moved it on to the next stage. We let it go unto the 
Order Paper about two months ahead of proceeding to the next 
stage, again in order to let the people take part in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to remind the leader of 
the Bloc that, in 1997, when we were considering the 
non-denominational schools amendment, he said that the creation 
of a parliamentary committee not a travelling committee because 
the Bloc refused to hear about that was a stalling 
antidemocratic tactic and an affront to the democratic process. 
This held up the bill for five days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing time wasting or antidemocratic about the 
process being followed by this government. On the contrary, we 
want the public to be involved; we want parliamentarians to be 
involved. This is why we used a reasonable approach under the 
very capable leadership of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy because we will get to the bottom of some things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, as far as linguistic school boards are concerned, 
let me remind the government House leader that there was 
unanimity at the Quebec national assembly.  Through its national 
assembly, Quebec had the power to determine the structure of its 
schools because, as far as I know, education is a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa wanted to teach us a lesson and said “No, no; maybe they 
do not understand properly in Quebec.  We are going to show them 
how things are done”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115
<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people across the way, a consensus is not enough;  the 
unanimous consent of the national assembly is not sufficient. 
This time, things are very different because the Quebec 
government is opposed to the measure.  That is why the situation 
is not the same.  Let us compare what is comparable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, some people say we look down on Francophones living 
outside Quebec.  I have heard that very often.  It is absolutely 
false.  Maybe we have talked about the Reform Party, but we have 
also talked on several occasions about the sovereignists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francophones outside Quebec have rights simply because they 
exist and not because Quebec is part of the federation.  They 
will never serve as hostages in negotiations with Quebec. English 
Quebecers have rights in Quebec, not because Quebec is 
part of the Canadian federation, but because they do have rights 
and these rights will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the hon. member that he should fight in the other 
provinces so that francophones outside Quebec enjoy the same 
rights as anglophones in Quebec. He should support the Montfort 
battle instead of making false accusations here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as regards unions, the member's former colleague was the 
president of a central labour body in Quebec. I was with the 
CSN, where a change to the constitution required a vote of 50% 
plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a union wants to leave a central labour body, there 
is a so-called period of union raiding. The hon. member is not 
familiar with the Quebec legislation, but his colleagues from 
Quebec should be. Every two or three years, a union can leave 
and join another central labour body. 
The ultimate way to effect a change is when the Department of 
Labour, which is more or less the supreme court of labour 
relations, imposes a vote in which the absolute majority 
applies, that is the 50% plus one rule. The hon. member knows 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Let us talk about the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> I am not talking about the vote. Obviously 
the CEQ did not engage much in raiding activities, because it is 
involved in the education sector. But when a vote is taken at 
the labour department, the 50% plus one rule applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> He does not even know what was going on at the 
CEQ. He was totally out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> The hon. member is talking about the 
signature of cards. A distinction must be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was not involved in the organization at the 
grassroots level, he was president. I worked at the grassroots 
level. 
When we sign the cards, it is 50% plus one. But when things are 
not clear, the department wants clarity, and it is 50% plus one 
of the persons participating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, the member refers to the 
constitutional amendment on school boards, claiming it enjoyed 
unanimous support among the people. Of course, I do not know too 
many issues enjoying unanimous support, which was certainly not 
the case for this amendment, event though it was a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member claims that parliamentary unanimity means 
that the Constitution may be circumvented. He says, for 
instance, that such a constitutional amendment does not need, or 
hardly needs, the agreement of the Parliament of Canada. He 
knows full well that a constitutional amendment must be ratified 
by a resolution of the proper legislative assembly, in this case 
the National Assembly of Quebec, and of course by both Houses of 
the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because a constitutional amendment only concerns one province in 
particular does not mean that it should not be ratified by the 
Parliament of Canada. It had to be done, and it was done with 
the support of members across the way. It was necessary, 
therefore. At the time, even ministers from Quebec came and 
testified before the committee. Mrs. Marois was one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with that point and would like now to deal with the 
issue of francophones outside Quebec since it has just been 
raised by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, who said that 
francophones— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Assimilated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> I am being accused of being assimilated. This 
is the theme raised a while ago and one the Bloc leader has just 
renounced. 
We, the francophones outside Quebec, the Acadians, the Ontarians 
and all the other,  have been called all kinds of names, but we 
are used to it. We do not like it, but we are used to it. We 
know those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Turncoat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> According to the Bloc members across the way, 
francophones outside Quebec are turncoats.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is this. For members opposite to suggest that somehow 
Quebec is not the motherland of French speaking Canadians 
throughout Canada is to negate their very existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an Ontarian, and I recognize the importance of Quebecers 
and of the French culture in my country. How could I do 
otherwise? How can members opposite tell me Quebecers' culture 
has no significance for francophones outside Quebec? It is 
nonsense, because we do know the importance of Quebecers for us 
and for our own survival. I never would have thought that Bloc 
members would suggest the opposite. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. House leader 
of the government on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my very brief comments by saying that the Reform 
Party, as the official opposition, supports the bill.  We support 
this initiative by the government, but we do not support fast 
tracking it.  We see no need for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very seldom do we see a situation where all four opposition 
parties agree.  In this case, at the special legislative 
committee formed to study Bill C-20, when meeting to discuss 
setting the agenda for the committee, all four opposition parties 
agreed that the committee should travel to seek the widest 
possible input from Canadians on this issue of importance.  I 
find it ironic that the Prime Minister, before Christmas, touted 
Bill C-20 as an extremely important bill for Canada, for the 
national unity of our country, and yet the Liberal members on the 
committee said “It is not all that important.  There are only 
three clauses.  It is no big deal.  We do not need to have much 
input from Canadians.  We will hold committee hearings here over 
the next week or week and a half and we will ram it through.  No 
problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. government House leader to address this concern 
of all Canadians.  Why, when all opposition parties say the 
committee should be allowed to travel, in particular to Quebec, 
is the government refusing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, let us remember 
what happened.  The bill was tabled in the House on December 13. 
We all know that the bill was put in the public domain at that 
time.  The supreme court reference was on August 20, 1998. 
Things are not being discovered five minutes prior here.  This is 
something that is progressing and it is an issue which has been 
in the public domain for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we tried to introduce the bill last fall, the House was 
greeted with all kinds of dilatory motions to stop the bill from 
proceeding.  Newspaper clippings were tabled and hours and hours 
of House time were wasted.  It is not the government which acted 
in an unreasonable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill was tabled.  The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs made an excellent speech in the House at the beginning of 
the debate.  The very first item of business for the House to 
consider when we returned in February was this bill.  It has a 
very high priority.  It is an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean the bill is very long.  That is a different 
proposition.  It does not have hundreds of pages and thousands of 
clauses.  It is not a bill which is very lengthy to study or 
read, but it is important.  Those are two different concepts 
which some people seem to confuse when it suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had several hours of debate.  We have had stalling and 
more stalling in the House.  Then we put the motion for time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand:</B>  Talk about closure. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  We did not propose to do the bill under 
closure, with three readings in one day.  We had one reading and 
then we sent it to committee.  We are listening to a maximum of 
45 witnesses.  That is a very, very large number, as witnesses 
go.  We will have several days of listening to witnesses.  The 
government is behaving in a very reasonable way.  Then of course 
we will have report stage and, finally, third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is my 
opportunity to express, once again, the official opposition's 
support in principle for the so-called clarity bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the big issues which the official opposition 
wanted to address with this bill.  First, we felt that it could 
be improved in terms of its clarity.  The journalists in this 
country have named it the so-called clarity bill for good reason. 
There are some areas that could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we felt that the idea that this could be established by 
a few people in a room somewhere is old fashioned politics.  We 
wanted to have the broadest consultation possible.  This was a 
strategic decision that we made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also felt that some of the issues that were being put forth 
in the bill—and there are four of them—could be expanded.  We 
wanted to make sure that all the issues were addressed; the 
major, important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally—and this is the area that I think the bill completely 
misses—we wanted to put forward things that could improve this 
federation, to stop the eternal and infernal battle that the bill 
addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the House leader say that he felt it was 
reasonable to move time allocation at second reading and to 
shorten the committee process because the Bloc was doing things 
to slow down the whole process of parliament.  That is 
legitimate.  My colleagues in the Bloc have done everything they 
can to slow down the work of the House.  However, I know that the 
government never approached the Bloc to say “If you stop this we 
will allow the broadest consultation to take place”.  That, to 
my mind, would have been the reasonable, prudent course to take. 
The government should say “We understand you are really against 
this, but this is so important that we will allow the broadest 
consultation to take place”.  That is the sort of thing we would 
expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are as the allies of the government on the bill.  It is 
very rare for all opposition parties to want to consult broadly. 
Maybe we have different motives in doing that.  Maybe some would 
want to inflame passions.  Maybe others would just want to have 
this very well debated throughout the country so that everyone 
would know whether this was the right way to go.  I hope that the 
positive motives would be the ones ascribed to the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I vigorously denounce the committee events which took place.  The 
words we use in the House are carefully chosen.  I use that as 
the strongest denunciation of the process.  We went in with the 
idea that witnesses would be heard.  We had prepared our 
witnesses long in advance.  Other parties had not expected this 
to be so hasty and did not even have their witnesses available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt that surely the provinces should be brought into this 
process, and we presented a motion to that effect.  This is very 
important.  The Prime Minister said that.  That motion was 
defeated.  I will never understand the defeat of the motion to 
bring in every provincial legislature, the premiers' offices, at 
least to present a brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were allowed 12 witnesses for this whole process.  Who are 
our witnesses?  We called for every provincial legislature and 
the territories to be our witnesses.  That does not seem to me to 
be something that the official opposition should have to do.  It 
would be a natural thing for the government to say “Please give 
us your input.  Come if you will or present a brief if you 
will”.  It is a very strange process in my view.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could use a host of words to describe the process at the 
committee such as arrogant and anti-democratic.  That would sound 
chippy and partisan, so I will only say that I denounce 
vigorously the process at committee, and I am the ally.  Why 
would the ally not get at least a hearing for something this 
important?  I vigorously denounce it.  I think it is a mistake.

is. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn then to the one thing that we gained from the 
committee.  This is to say that we did gain something.  We gained 
televised hearings.  The hearings are televised.  Even clause by 
clause is televised.  That was not preferred by the government, 
but there was this one small gain.  The public will be able to 
listen to and watch the witnesses.  There are witnesses, 
literally at this moment, being heard on Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the things that the official opposition wanted 
to do.  We wanted to clarify the question.  This is something we 
have vigorously agreed with and talked about back in the history 
of our presence in the House.  A clear question is mandatory.  We 
take it so far as to suggest a question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is this. Should this province secede from Canada 
and become an independent state without any special legal link 
with Canada, yes or no? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to my colleagues in the Bloc say that there is 
no need for it because the assembly in Quebec will put forward a 
clear question.  I say quite frankly that is an area in which we 
disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous questions talked about more than one thing. 
Although every politically active person in Canada knew exactly 
what the question meant, I do not think the average Joes on the 
street, paying attention to politics periodically, had the 
absolute idea that there would be no more MPs in Ottawa from 
Quebec if it had passed.  I do not believe for one second that 
they felt their passports would be taken away from them in the 
broader context.  A plain question in my view is fair to 
Quebecers and fair to everyone else.  Those are my comments on 
the clarification of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the clarification of the majority the minister and I had an 
interchange yesterday.  He said that the official opposition 
position was not fair and not reasonable.  In fact he used a very 
strong word.  He said that it was irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain to every person in Canada why we feel 50% plus 
one of the voters voting in the referendum is fair, reasonable 
and legitimate.  First, the two previous referenda were run under 
those rules, in my judgment.  I listened to the Prime Minister 
say “We won the last referendum” when it was 50.5%.  It was 
very close.  The Prime Minister himself said “Phew, we won”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to change the rules in the middle of the game. 
It can be done if both parties agree.  I listened to things such 
as amending the constitution for various reasons takes 
two-thirds.  The parties agreed when they signed that 
constitution.  If only the Fathers of Confederation had thought 
of this we would not have the problem.  I agree that it is not 
the ideal percentage, but it is the one that the last two 
referenda were run under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two sides to this question.  The bill mentions that 
the boundaries of Quebec is one of the issues that needs to be 
discussed.  If 50% plus one will break up Canada, in my 
estimation it could also break up a province trying to secede. 
Because the question would be clear and the majority would be 
clear it removes all the fogginess.  That is debatable.  I will 
admit that.

of all votes cast in a referendum is not acceptable, to tell me 
what is.  We can debate that.   With arguments well presented 
maybe he could change my mind and the mind of the official 
opposition.  For various reasons that is not on the government 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again that is a bit of a gift to those who say that they 
raised the bar, no matter what the percentage, to suit their 
purposes.  That is risky and leaves an opening for those who want 
to say that Canada is not democratic.  The committee proceedings 
and that particular point are not particularly democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened to the minister ask how we could possibly break 
up the country on a judicial recount.  It does not matter what 
number we put on it.  What about 60% plus one?  Could there be a 
judicial recount there?  What about 70% plus one?  That is not an 
argument that has logic behind it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four major issues in the bill are minority rights, 
definition of borders, the native people's position and the 
sharing out of the federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things too, such as citizenship and the use of 
the Canadian passport, the sharing out of federal assets, the 
maintenance of creditor confidence, the use of the Canadian 
currency, international recognition, participation by the 
province in question in international agreements to which Canada 
is a party or its exclusion from them, as well as transportation 
and service corridors. All these things are important to me and 
I would like to understand why these issues are not included in 
the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about a battle between what I consider to be the status 
quo in Ottawa and the desires of Quebec.  These are legitimate 
desires to have the original constitution respected.  These are 
very similar to aspirations that come from outside Quebec.  I was 
born in Quebec.  I have lived in the west.  I have family in 
Quebec.  I have a reason to be concerned and interested in what 
happens there, more than just the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the message that there is another approach 
to continuing this battle.  There is another way other than going 
down the road of the status quo versus those who feel they need 
to leave the country.  We need to listen to one another.  There 
are strong allies outside Quebec for the changes that Quebec is 
hoping to undertake. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say that millions of Canadians 
from outside Quebec also believe that we cannot accept the 
status quo. Quebec will therefore be able to count on friends 
and allies if it tries to change Canada. Quebec will notice that 
many people also consider that a fundamental reform of the 
federation is a priority.

Speaker, I thank the member for his speech which I followed with 
great attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explore one aspect that he raised.  That is the 
question of his party inviting the provinces to the committee to 
testify.  In my reading of the legislation, the legislation deals 
entirely with federal powers, unless he has an opinion opposite, 
and I hope he will express it.  As far as I can see there is 
nothing in this legislation that goes beyond what are the powers 
of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to exclude the provinces absolutely, but I fail to see the 
utility of provincial testimony.  I can see other groups from 
society, but I do not quite understand where he sees that the 
provinces themselves have something material to offer on what is 
entirely federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
The issue for me is that this is why the Charlottetown accord and 
some of the other big narrow processes failed.  They were done 
behind closed doors with a few individuals talking about them. 
That is something that does not equate to broad consultation on 
something this important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the provinces have a significant part to play. 
Do I think they would agree?  I believe all but one would agree 
with this bill.  Do I think they might have some mechanism of 
improving the bill?  I would invite them here to listen to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not been done.  There have been very informal 
consultations.  I would formally consult with the elected 
representatives on this issue and do it so that all Canadians 
would know that their provincial government had the same 
feelings.  Beyond that we are back into the elitist mode which 
does not serves our country very well at all.

speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has insulted all Quebecers by saying that the people from 
Quebec are not intelligent enough to understand the question, 
that we politicians are the only intelligent people here. This 
is an insult, pure and simple.

them are intelligent: those who voted yes or those who voted no? 
Please tell me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> In my view, Mr. Speaker, this is not a very 
emotional issue. If I think the question is not clear, that is 
my opinion. If the hon. member says the question is very clear, 
that is his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that for politicians, the question is very clear. If 
people in Quebec believe it will still be possible to elect members 
of parliament here after sovereignty, obviously, the question is 
not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Bloc afraid of having a clear question, a question 
on sovereignty and nothing else? Quebecers are very intelligent, 
Bloc members too. In my view, with a clear question the battle 
is over.

the member for Macleod.  I must say that I am impressed with the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that there was a need to improve the term 
clarity.  He also said that the Reform Party would want more 
consultations and more issues addressed.  There must be more ways 
to improve federation.  The member across the aisle on the 
Liberal side said that the reason the provinces should not be 
involved is that it is within federal jurisdiction, which is 
total nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Macleod.  If he has all 
those points against the bill, why is the Reform Party or CRAP,

listen to the improvements.  I would hope that he would debate 
with me and try to say that those points are incorrect.  It is a 
straightforward matter of saying that in principle clarity is 
important.  Is there any other way to do this?  I do not know.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton—Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

interest in the clarity bill. I have a question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that Canada should stay united? Does he believe 
in official languages, yes or no? I would like him to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How it is that in the Standing Joint Committee on Official 
Languages the hon. member for MacLeod, as a representative of 
the Reform Party, voted against a proposal from the committee 
asking the province to designate as bilingual the national 
capital, the new city of Ottawa, which will be restructured by 
the year 2001. Why did he object to the city of Ottawa becoming 
bilingual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am for bilingualism.  Ideally, 
everyone should speak many languages.  I support voluntary 
bilingualism. I am against forced bilingualism.  Here in Ottawa, 
as the member well knows, things are bilingual because there is 
a need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I wish to say how unhappy I am, and I am trying to put this 
nicely, with the member for Macleod who sits beside me. I 
am having trouble when he says that those who did not 
understand the question are not intelligent enough and when he 
goes even further and says that if anyone does not agree with 
the bill, it is for lack of intelligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem is that he saying that in this country—and this 
will be a clear question—the English are intelligent and the 
French are a bit thick?  Is that what he is saying, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberal members of the 
ridings of Beauce, Laval West, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Verdun, 
Lac-Saint-Louis, Brossard—La Prairie, Pierrefonds—Dollard, 
Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Brome—Missisquoi, Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Ahuntsic and Gatineau, who are not 
ministers from Quebec, but members from Quebec, were probably 
ordered by their government not to talk about Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge them, through you, Mr. Speaker, to ignore the party 
line on this, at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for Macleod 
should have an opportunity to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. And perhaps he will give 
us the benefit of his superiority and enlighten us.  It is said 
that God does not need to be present for his will to be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the member for Macleod to use his superior 
intelligence. Does he not believe that these members should 
ignore the party line, which prevents them from commenting 
officially on Bill C-20, and participate in questions and 
comments at the very least so that we may know what they think? 
Or does he think that they all aspire to ministerial positions 
and therefore want to remain silent?

question that was asked in the last referendum in my opinion was 
not clear, that it could confuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may say that that somehow reflects on intelligence. 
That in my mind reflects on a very specific wish to make the 
question somewhat cloudy.  It involved more than one issue.  It 
had some negotiation with it.  It talked about something other 
than sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members have been very plain in that they want the 
country to split up.  They should say that and let us vote on 
that.  I do not believe that is what most Quebecers want and they 
are very, very intelligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we resume

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Well I am going to 
take it anyway. I remember when most of us arrived here in 1993, 
there were many who were unilingual French or English.  It is 
amazing the number who are able in a rudimentary fashion to 
converse in a second language.  As I sit here watching this 
debate it is an interesting ironic thrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona informed me, I should

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
far be it from me.  I want to address the motion before us.  I 
compliment the Chair on his wise observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of New Democrats in the House today to support 
the motion that has been moved by the Bloc Quebecois.  I think it 
points out what is wrong with the process that has accompanied 
the introduction of Bill C-20 and the process that has followed 
the introduction of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats have been unhappy with the process right from the 
beginning.  We were unhappy before we ever saw the bill. We felt 
that the Prime Minister was engaging in a rhetorical battle with 
the Bloc and with others in Quebec and creating an expectation 
about the bill that turned out not to be accurate. That is to 
say, there was some speculation prior to the introduction of the 
bill that the bill might actually set a particular percentage of 
support that would have to be met in any referendum.  Not just 
separatists but federalists were also concerned about that 
particular prospect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced by surprise when commitments had been 
made that the bill would not be introduced until the following 
week.  Then all of a sudden on a Friday morning it was 
introduced.  It was debated at second reading in the House. There 
were only three days of debate and closure was moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government House leader likes to say he only moved 
closure because the Bloc Quebecois members were not really 
interested in debating it, that they were using dilatory measures 
to preoccupy the House with matters other than Bill C-20. The 
fact is that we cannot win with the government House leader on 
this.  If we use dilatory measures, then he says that we do not 
really want to debate it.  And if we debate it, he says we have 
had enough debate, that we have had lots of opportunity to debate 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a bill like this one, which on the face of it, as 
we like to say in procedural matters is of prima facie import, 
having to do with the possible breakup of the country, it is 
something that parliament should debate in principle for a long 
time.  A long time in this parliament has come to mean three days 
of debate. 
That is certainly not what a long time used to mean in terms of 
parliamentary debate.

we must not debate it at any length because somehow that

transgresses on the understanding of how the Canadian people

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
notice there is not quorum in the House.  Can you please call 
quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Markham has requested a quorum call.  There is not quorum.  Call 
in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was commenting on the 
fact that tradition in this parliament, thanks to the Liberal 
government, has been that when important things come up for 
debate, we debate them only briefly and then time allocation is 
invoked whereas we seem to be able to debate unimportant things 
for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are debating things that even the government says are 
important, as the hon. member in his own way has pointed out, and 
I know it is not proper to refer to individual members not being 
here, but collectively speaking, government members are not in 
the Chamber.  This is something that has been raised before with 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government consistently shows contempt for the House of Commons 
by not taking upon itself the responsibility of maintaining 
quorum.  This is something that in the past governments did as a 
matter of course, as a matter of routine.  It was regarded as 
part of governmental responsibility.  The government after all 
has 150 members yet it cannot muster four.  Well, it has just 
mustered four of 150.  Yet it expects the opposition to maintain 
quorum.  But I am not here to talk about quorum. I am talking 
about the motion before us.  As I said before, we support this 
motion because we believe the committee— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, where are the rest of the 
hon. member's members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will match our 
percentage of members with theirs anytime unless they cannot do 
the math.  It is kind of obvious to anyone who has two brain 
cells to rub together who has the higher percentage of members 
here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the committee on Bill C-20 should have made 
a commitment to travel.  It should have made a commitment to 
consult widely with Canadians in Quebec and in the rest of Canada 
about the procedure the government intends to establish with 
respect to the possible secession of any province and therefore 
with respect to the breakup of the country.  It would only make 
sense that this is the kind of process that should have been 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have committees that travel the country asking Canadians 
about other things, about fishery matters, transport matters, 
agricultural matters.  Almost every other matter has had a 
committee travel the country to ask Canadians what they think 
about that particular matter.  Yet when it comes to something as 
important as breaking up the country or at least the procedure 
for doing so, or the procedure for a referendum to initiate 
negotiations to break up the country, the government says not 
only will we not travel, we will begin hearing witnesses on a 
Wednesday of one week and on Friday of the following week we will 
report the bill back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan in the committee is to hear the minister on Wednesday, 
as we did yesterday.  By next Wednesday we will move into clause 
by clause study and in that period of time hear all the witnesses 
who want to appear, but not all the witnesses, just all the 
witnesses the committee decides to hear.  That is a limited 
number; we are only going to hear 45 witnesses. 
We will be lucky if we can hear those in the little timeframe 
that the government has established.  I predict that we will 
probably have to extend the life of the committee anyway because 
witnesses have lives.  Witnesses just cannot kind of pack up 
their lives and say, “Oh, the Liberals need me”, or  “The Bloc 
needs me”, or “someone else needs me and I must truck on down 
to Ottawa and destroy my schedule for next week because the 
process that the House of Commons has decided, pursuant to the 
will of the Liberal majority in the committee, means that I don't 
have any time to plan ahead.  I don't have any time to write a 
brief.  I don't have any time to gather my thoughts.  I just have 
to get down there and present”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well be that the government plan will falter to some 
degree on the fact that witnesses simply cannot fit themselves 
into the government timetable.  There will be a certain amount of 
justice in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  We feel that the committee should have 
travelled. The motion also includes something having to do with 
televising, but my understanding is that the committee is being 
televised.  I am not sure why that is in the motion. It seems to 
be a bit redundant.  It is like protesting something that is not 
there.  The committee is being televised. Why protest the fact 
that it is not being televised or why move a motion to televise 
it when it is being televised.  There is a certain kind of 
inadequacy in the motion that we will overlook because we support 
the spirit of the motion which is that the way the government has 
handled this particular bill has been sorely inadequate and in 
violation, I think, of the best traditions of parliament when it 
comes to dealing with things that are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canadians should not let our objections to the process 
obscure the fact that we do support the bill in principle, that 
we support the view that there is a role for parliament, pursuant 
to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, in laying out what 
parliament would regard as the conditions that would create an 
obligation to negotiate on the part of the rest of Canada with a 
province of Canada having to do with secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its opinion, said that there 
would have to be a clear question and a clear majority.  It said 
that what constituted a clear question and a clear majority would 
have to be determined by the political actors; in other words, 
the court said that it would not determine that itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely no one would want to argue that the Parliament of Canada 
is not one of the political actors that the Supreme Court of 
Canada had in mind.  Surely no one would want to say that the 
only political actors that the Supreme Court of Canada might have 
had in mind are provincial governments alone or a provincial 
government alone; that is to say, the provincial government of 
the province that brings in a referendum.  I do not think that 
was what the court was saying.  I do not think anyone could 
credibly argue that was what the court was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is saying that, yes, the Parliament of Canada has 
certain responsibilities, just like the provincial legislatures 
of provinces have certain responsibilities, and like the National 
Assembly of Quebec, it has responsibilities, it has rights and it 
has the right to ask any question it likes in any referendum it 
likes.  That right coexists with the right of this parliament to 
say that only a certain kind of question, responded to by a clear 
majority, will create an obligation on the part of this place, 
the Parliament of Canada, to negotiate secession.  It does not 
eliminate the possibility of other kinds of referendums on 
association, or partnership or new forms of the federation.  All 
those kinds of things are still available and they are available 
in the ordinary course of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province may want to have a referendum in order to demonstrate 
that the people are behind its new constitutional proposal for a 
new division of powers or whatever.  That is all part of the 
ordinary political process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill talks about is an extraordinary political 
situation in which a province would ask the Government of Canada 
to begin negotiations on secession.  It seems to me that 
parliament would be shirking its duty if it said “Oh, we can't 
have anything to say about that because that is up to the 
seceding province.  It has to determine that”.  This is not a 
credible position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have responsibilities here in parliament as the 
representatives of all the people in Canada, including the people 
of Quebec.  We have our own jurisdiction in Quebec.  Quebec is 
not a separate country, and we hope it never will be.  However, 
it is not yet a separate country and therefore the federal 
government has its own jurisdiction in Quebec.  It has a right, 
on behalf of people in Quebec and people outside of Quebec, to 
determine what the conditions would be that would create the 
obligation to negotiation secession.  That is what the bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier on I talked about political actors.  I am not talking 
about what goes on during question period.  I am talking about 
the language of the supreme court which talked about political 
actors, and the political actors being the ones who would have to 
determine a clear question and a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find unfortunate in the bill, not just the process, is 
two things with respect to how the bill delineates who are the 
political actors.  There are two sections in the bill in which 
the government lists people whose views it would have to take 
into account in determining whether or not a question was 
clear—and that would happen prior to a referendum—and in 
determining whether or not a majority was clear.  As the bill 
stands now, that would happen after a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the government list?  It lists the Parliament of 
Canada, obviously, and the provinces, the territories and the 
Senate, which I will get to in a minute, and any other views that 
it might deem relevant.  It has the same list with respect to a 
clear question and a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP contend that this particular list is faulty in two 
grievous ways.  First, it includes the Senate.  It includes this 
unappointed body and gives to it a role that we feel is 
unwarranted, undeserved and not necessary in any constitutional 
way in the determination that those sections of the bill lay out. 
Having given this undeserved status to the Senate, the bill then 
compounds the moral offence by not giving status to the 
aboriginal people of provinces that hold such referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a situation in which provinces and territories are 
listed.  The government has to take the views of these people 
into account, as well as the views of the Senate or anybody else. 
I guess maybe aboriginal people fall under anybody else.  Yet, 
these are the same people, in the case of the Cree and the Inuit 
in Quebec, who won the last referendum for the federalist cause. 
These are the people whose solid block of votes for Canada made 
the difference between a winning referendum and a losing 
referendum in 1995 and the government has the unmitigated gall to 
ignore them and to treat them with contempt.  This is the one 
thing that unites federalists and separatists in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the process that is going on with respect to Bill 99 
in Quebec and in Quebec City, the aboriginal people there in that 
context are ignored as well and not given full recognition of 
their rights and status.  I might add that that committee is not 
travelling either.  It is not going to northern Quebec to get the 
opinion of the Cree, when we hear all the self-righteousness of 
the Bloc.  Two wrongs do not make a right. The committee in this 
House should show up the committee in Quebec City and do the kind 
of travelling that is not being done there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who are New Democrats find this to be a major flaw 
in the bill.  We hope the government will see its way to amending 
this.  I asked the minister in committee yesterday why he did not 
have the aboriginal leadership of a province listed in this. 
He said that he listed only the people who were constitutional. I 
told him that the native people are in the constitution.  I said 
that I was there when they were put into the new constitution 
when it was patriated in 1981.  He then said that it is people 
who are involved in the constitutional amendment process.  I said 
that the supreme court did not say “take into account the views 
of constitutional political actors”.  I would argue that 
aboriginal people are constitutional political actors, but let us 
leave that aside for a minute.  In the government's own bill it 
lists the territories.  The territories do not have a part in the 
constitutional amending process, yet their views have to be taken 
into account, and rightly so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to the minister that since he has the territories in 
there, why does he not have the aboriginal people in there.  The 
minister said that the territories are not in the bill.  I told 
him to check the bill.  He had a little huddle, came back and 
said that I was right, that the territories are in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who wrote that bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I thought the minister wrote the bill 
but I now have to take that back.  Somebody else clearly wrote 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to be too cute here, but there is a good case to 
be made, both in terms of the bill itself having listed the 
territories, and rightly so, and the rights of aboriginal people 
as established both in the constitution and by constitutional 
convention going back to the Charlottetown accord when Ovide 
Mercredi was at the table.  Are we retreating now from what was 
accomplished then in terms of aboriginal people having a place at 
the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that in order for the bill to be as just as the 
government wants to portray it as being, aboriginal people should 
be included in that list of people whose views have to be taken 
into account.  They should be listed clearly, definitively and 
separately from everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should also provide that in any negotiation of 
secession, subsequent to a referendum with a clear question and a 
clear majority, that aboriginal people are not just people whose 
interests have to be taken into account, which is the way the 
bill reads now, but should be part of the negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having done that, I think the government would be much better 
able to come before the House and say that this bill is indeed a 
piece of democratic legislation.  I do not accept the view of the 
Bloc that it is antidemocratic.  There is still all kinds of room 
there for sovereignists to win.  If they really feel Quebecers 
want to have a sovereign country then they should not be afraid 
of a piece of legislation that asks them to ask a clear question. 
If they get their clear majority they can have their country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to hear the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona speak on this issue because he is a member 
with great experience.  But I think he has actually misread the 
act in some respects, and there is a contradiction in what he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of his speech, he made allusions several times to 
the fact that Bill C-20 sets conditions on the question and the 
prospect of separation.  But I submit that is not what Bill C-20 
does at all.  What Bill C-20 does is it sets limits on the 
government.  It says very clearly that the government cannot 
enter into negotiations before the House of Commons has 
determined whether the question is clear or not and other aspects 
of the percentage and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view—and I would like the member to comment on this—this 
is quite a different kettle of fish, shall we say. Limiting the 
government is something that indeed all members of parliament, 
even those of us on the backbench on the government side, would 
like to see a government limited from time to time and indeed 
this bill does that.  I would suggest to the member that not only 
does it do that, but that everything in the bill is entirely 
within the scope of the House of Commons.  It is not something 
that is inconsistent with what we can do as members of parliament 
because we have added no additional powers to parliament.  We 
have merely limited the powers of government, which I would have 
thought would be entirely in keeping with what this parliament 
should be doing at any time.

the hon. member is fishing for differences that are not there.  I 
never said that it is was not within the purview of parliament. 
In fact, I thought I had made an argument about why it was within 
the purview of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the language of conditions, I used the word 
conditions in an entirely different sense than the hon. member 
attributed to me.  What I said was that the bill outlines what 
would create the conditions for an obligation to negotiate.  I am 
trying to stick very carefully to the supreme court ruling.  It 
said that only after a clear question and a clear majority—a 
clear question being a question that was very clear about the 
fact that it had to do with separation and with the province 
holding the referendum on becoming an independent country and 
with a clear majority on that clear question—would there be an 
obligation to negotiate.  That is the sense in which I was using 
the word conditions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
several questions for the hon. member from the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he talked a little about the clear question. I would now 
like to hear him describe his idea of a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he should explain the biological or genetic advantage 
that the people from Winnipeg, from his riding or from his 
province have over Quebecers to understand what is a clear 
question. What is missing biologically or genetically in 
Quebec the explanation surely lies there so that we cannot 
understand what is a clear question while they can? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we need the advice of the hon. member from the 
northeast part of Prince Edward Island, a member whom I do not 
know but for whom I have much respect? Why should his advice be 
superior to that of the national assembly that, unanimously or 
by a majority, could determine what is a clear question? I would 
like him to enlighten us about that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not very experienced, I know that we cannot mention 
absent members in the House, but we can present members. The 
hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies who is here surely has 
much to say on this issue, but he has not risen since this 
morning. I rose in part to take his place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brome—Missisquoi has been reading <I>La Presse</I> 
all morning. Perhaps he would also have something to say about 
Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the member for Brossard—La Prairie, who has been 
twiddling his thumbs all morning. He might have had something to 
say about Bill C-20. I could say the same for the member for 
Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from Quebec have been instructed to shut up or else 
they are simply devoid of ideas and afraid to stand up. I am 
therefore speaking on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to ask the member from the New 
Democratic Party if he thinks the following question is clear, 
and I will read it slowly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you accept and approve the settlement agreement dated, for 
reference purposes, the 14th day of December 1999, between the 
Montagnais band of Lac-Saint-Jean and Her Majesty the Queen in 
right of Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the first question. I will now read the second one: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you agree to sanction, pursuant to sections 38(1) and 39 of 
the Indian Act, the absolute transfer to Her Majesty the Queen 
in right of Canada by the Montagnais band of Lac-Saint-Jean of all 
its rights and those of its members to all parcels of reserve 
lands on concession IX of the Ouiatchouan township? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By voting “YES”, you authorize the Chief of the Montagnais band 
of Lac-Saint-Jean or any other member of the band council duly 
authorized by resolution to sign on behalf of the band council, 
the band itself and its members all documents, and to take all 
measures required to put into effect the settlement agreement 
and the absolute transfer of all parcels of reserve lands on 
concession IX of the Ouiatchouan township. Yes or no? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this question, written by the governmental party without 
any consultation, seem clear to the hon. member?

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for leaving me so much time to answer his questions, for 
having gone on and on about something that I had nothing to say 
about, and for pointing out in his own procedurally quirky way 
the absence of people that he is not supposed to point out the 
absence of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the last question, I know what the member is up 
to.  He wants me to say it is a clear question.  Then he is going 
to point out that 50% plus one is enough for that, and then he is 
going to extrapolate from there that 50% plus one is good enough 
for any other referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what is debatable here is whether a referendum having 
to do with the secession of a province like Quebec is in fact a 
qualitatively different kind of referendum, and whether 50% plus 
one is all that would be required.  That is part of the debate 
that is going on in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in all parties who feel that 50% plus one is 
the standard, and there are people who do not.  Whether it comes 
to be something that is actually in the bill, or whether 
amendments are moved to that effect, we shall see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also brought up this genetic, biological argument, 
which I think was unfortunate.  The fact of the matter is that, 
yes, voters in my riding, voters in Prince Edward Island, which I 
think he also mentioned, voters everywhere in Canada ought to 
have a say through their parliament about what the conditions 
would be which would obligate them to negotiate the secession of 
a province that contains some 10 million of their fellow citizens 
from their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned that is self-evident.  I do not think 
we are non-participating spectators in the process that would 
break up our country.  I am sorry, but I have to disagree with my 
colleague from the Bloc.  I think that all Canadians have a say 
in what conditions would create an obligation on the part of 
their government to negotiate the secession of a particular 
province from Canada, and I make no apologies for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers have their rights too.  This relates to the other 
thing the member said.  He was listing members from Quebec and 
why they have not said anything.  He believes that in order to be 
a true Quebecer one has to agree with him.  These other people 
who have not spoken up in favour of the position he advocates, 
they are somehow not true and real Quebecers.  I think this is 
one of the more despicable elements of the way the Bloc members 
conduct themselves with respect to this debate, that somehow 
people who do not agree with them are not real Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I allow for a Canada in which Quebecers can defend their right, 
not the right of the rest of Canada, but their right to have a 
clear question and a clear majority, their right not to be 
snookered by a separatist government that has a strategy to get 
them into the lobster pot that Jacques Parizeau described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a democratic principle which respects the rights of all 
Quebec citizens and not just the rights of sovereignists and 
separatists to cleave to their own particular strategy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, 
during my speech, I will certainly raise points that may be 
somewhat redundant. Since I do not want to sound redundant, I 
will put some emphasis on certain points that were raised this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by taking a look at the motion brought forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> I can see that, by my mere presence, I woke 
up a number of government members and I am very happy about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today arises from the frustration expressed 
by the four opposition parties about the approach used by the 
government to decide how the committee on Bill C-20 will proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It felt a little strange to hear what the eight members 
delegated by the government to deal with this issue had to say. 
They all said the same thing, almost word for word “You know, 
with just three clauses, this bill is not all that important. It 
is not very detailed. There is no reason to worry”.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that it is indeed important. Besides the 
great legal and constitutional issues raised by this bill, which 
I will address in a moment, the fact remains that it stirs up 
emotions and triggers reactions. As a matter fact, this bill is 
the result of a poll taken last summer by the federal government 
and paid for with our taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I really want to discuss is what happened at committee on 
Monday night when we were trying to decide how to operate. We 
discussed whether the committee should travel. The government 
said no, the committee should not travel. Its position was 
clear: people can come to Ottawa, it is not that far. If people 
from Quebec want to come to Ottawa, the government will pay 
their expenses. It is as simple as that. 
That is the decision that was made. The government said “The 
committee will not travel”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then thought “Okay, the committee will not travel, but 
why?” And the answer came back “No time”. It is clear, you are either 
for or against it. We were told we would not travel. We said 
“Okay, it is fine, we cannot travel”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we asked “Will there be any time for people to prepare, 
because we are breaking new ground here?” Not only can we not 
travel, but we are now being told that we must be done by 
Friday. An member of the opposition introduced a motion 
requesting an extension until February 28, to give people time 
to put a brief together. The government said “No, there is no 
time. It is now or never. Your mind must be made by now; this is 
a simple bill. Show up now or forget it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggested publishing a notice in the papers to let people 
know when the committee hearing would be held. The government 
said “No, you cannot do that”. “Could we at least send an 
invitation to the provinces, we asked, telling them that we will 
be doing some legislative work and considering an important bill 
that concerns them in certain regards? Could we simply invite 
them, to tell them that we are here and that we will try to do a 
good job?” The answer was “No, that is out of the question”. We 
then asked that the committee be allowed to hear witnesses who 
wish to appear. Again, the government said “No, that is out of 
the question”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee will hear only 45 witnesses. 
We asked “Does this mean that we will all submit our lists of 
witnesses and the steering committee will decide?” Again, the 
answer was no. Limits are being put on the number of witnesses 
by political party. Some members suggested we might look at that 
together. The government said “No, this has been decided; there 
will be 15 witnesses for the Liberal Party, 12 for the Reform 
Party, 10 for the Bloc Quebecois, four for the NDP and, because 
we are very kind, another four for the Progressive Conservative 
Party”. “Does this mean we may invite other witnesses, we 
asked?” Again the answer was no. A committee member asked “Could 
someone who wants to appear, who is following the committee 
proceedings on television, invite himself? This is a democracy. 
One may want to be heard and say 'I have questions and I would 
like to address them'.” The answer remains no, he cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time—for one of very few times at least—to be a 
witness at a legislative committee studying a bill, one has to 
be sponsored by political party. Those who have no connections, 
like the non-aligned people—because I was asking the question: 
what do non-aligned people do? Imagine this, the government will 
invite witnesses who will toss ideas that might be more or less 
close to ours, but at least we will discuss. As for the others, 
the doors are closed. This is a tightly closed committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Exactly. The hon. member for Lévis just said 
it. Is the bill undemocratic? We will discuss this later. But is 
the legislative committee democratic and open? The answer is no. 
This is absolutely terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will, of course, support the Bloc Quebecois motion asking for 
the committee to travel. 
But when we say that the committee will travel, whether you like 
it or not, that means that more witnesses, maybe, will be heard, 
that we will take more time. We are talking about a bill that, 
for the Liberals, has become unimportant. We talked about a flip 
flop by some opposition parties on Bill C-20. But it is quite a 
flip flop that the Liberal Party has made on the most important 
bill ever introduced in this House. But it is not important, 
there are many other things to do. That is quite a flip flop, is 
it not? The Prime Minister should look at himself in the mirror. 
That is quite a flip flop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are only hoping that, in effect, this will be discussed 
because it is not clear. The role of the committee is not clear. 
The bill is not really clear either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just hope that the 
government will wake up and say to the committee: “Listen, you 
are having problem getting witnesses in the short term because 
you are pushing people around.” The people are told: “Come and 
appear before the committee. These are the days and time of the 
hearings. You show up on this day, at that time, or do not 
bother. You either show up or you do not.” Then I go: “Wait a 
minute, I have previous commitments. I am a member of a board or 
of an organization.” And they say: “No, this is it. Either you 
find it important or you do not. You come on that day or you do 
not show up at all.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an outrage, a slap in the face by the committee. And the 
funny part is that we had our “Cassoulet”, as he was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember that children's program on Radio-Canada 
called “Plum-pouding”. The star of that show was the father of 
Marc Labrèche, a comedian whose first name I forget now; he 
played a French spy. He would take off his hat and call his boss 
to receive orders. He always said “What do I do now?” The name 
of the character was Cassoulet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am about to say is unbelievably funny. There was a 
Cassoulet, the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, in committee until I rose in the name 
of the opposition.  He was listening to the proceedings, but his 
cellular phone was on all the time.  He took notes and brought 
them to the parliamentary secretary, who then said “Here is my 
position”.  The connection was direct.  There was another 
invisible player and I can tell members it was not the Holy 
Ghost, but minister's office or the office of the government 
House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is insulting.  It was funny to see, really. However, it was 
insulting for the eight Liberals present.  They had absolutely 
nothing to say.  The cellular phone determined everything.  I 
agree that technology is important nowadays, but I do not agree 
with Cassoulet and his cell phone.  This makes no sense 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion will probably be defeated because Cassoulet, the 
House leader, the whip, and the Prime Minister will say no, we 
vote against that. Let us get it out of the way.  We have 
important issues to deal with.  The government has a heavy 
legislative program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we had the opportunity to talk briefly about Bill 
C-20, the bill dealing with the clarity of the referendum question. 
If it were so clear, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
would probably never have submitted a 16 page document dealing 
with a three clause bill, three clauses that are supposed to 
define what negotiations will be in the event of a secession. Is 
that clear? No, it is not. The bill makes no mention of the 
question nor does it specify what the majority will be. The 
committee has already started hearing witnesses, at least those 
who have been able to come before it, but they do not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody wants a clear question and a clear majority. What 
everybody is really saying is that if Quebecers decide to get 
out of this federation, everybody must agree on this. We do not 
need a bill to do this. I asked this question to the minister, 
because it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently considering a lot of legislation. There is, for 
instance, Bill C-23, which contains hundreds of clauses. They are 
significant. These bills mean something to us. They call for our 
careful consideration, as citizens and as members of this House. 
We did not hesitate to propose amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that we must not complicate things. He said 
that if Quebec ever leaves this country and thus breaks Canada 
apart, things will have to be kept simple. Maybe because it will 
be too complicated. This bill is supposed to enlighten 
everybody, but it does so only partially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise some points that show how unclear this bill is. 
Of course, the question is not clear, because it is not spelled 
out. The majority is not clear either, because it is not 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I asked the minister about this. 
For those who were unable to watch that wonderful program live, 
I said “The only thing you indulged in in your presentation, 
Minister,—and even in French I used the English term—is Quebec 
bashing”. It was bashing, and nothing else. People need only 
read the minister's speech. The only province associated with 
secession was Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore asked the minister “If you wanted the bill to be so 
clear, Minister, why did you not have the balls to be clear and 
use Quebec and not a province in all three clauses? Are you 
telling us that another province wants to separate? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is certainly not the case, since you spoke only of Quebec 
in the whole 20 minutes. You attacked almost all democratic 
institutions. Thus I contend that you do not want to use the 
term Quebec”. The answer was “We do not want to use the term 
Quebec”. Why? The supreme court opinion was about what? Cape 
Breton? Prince Edward Island? No, it was about Quebec. The title 
mentions Quebec. The preamble mentions Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They thought it might be dangerous to attack Quebec directly, so 
they removed the term Quebec from the clauses. The minister 
avoided the issue and said “Well, I will not reply to that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I asked him was “Is this constitutional 
amendment?” He answered “Yes”. I asked “What amending formula 
will apply?” Because the supreme court referred to a 
constitutional amendment. “What amending formula? The 
7-50 formula? Unanimity? Which one?” He replied “We do not know, 
we will see”. I said “What? You are supposed to be clear, and 
you do not know? There is a problem”. If the 7-50 formula 
applies, the weight of some provinces increases or diminishes, 
depending on whether or not Quebec is a partner to that amending 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even went further because, sometimes—most often in the rest of 
Quebec, among anglophones and allophones and even among some 
Quebecers—people are afraid of telling the truth and asking  the 
real questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, it is Mr. Bouchard, in Quebec City, and the Prime 
Minister and member of Shawinigan, in this House. Let us suppose 
there is a yes vote on a clear question. The result will be 
clear. But who negotiates for whom? How will the people of 
Ontario accept that Quebecers share the debt and the assets of 
the country? Are the hon. members of this House comfortable with 
this? Probably not. Am I comfortable with the idea of entrusting 
a Quebecer, namely the member for Shawinigan, with the task of 
negotiating? I am not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do with the 75 members from Quebec, men and women who 
were elected democratically, whatever their political stripe? 
Are they still part of the constitution? If the constitution has 
to be amended unanimously, does Quebec have a veto? If a 
negotiating committee on secession is struck will Quebec be 
part of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members ask those questions to the members of the government 
party, they will say “André, do not raise those points, people 
in the west will react negatively”. I say “Of course, it is all 
fine and well not raise those points, but do you want clarity, 
yes or no? If you do not, stop. 
If you do not, you have to go all the way”. Let us ask the real 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> The Bloc members and the Conservatives know 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We are Quebecers first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> I believe one can be a proud Quebecer and a 
proud Canadian. Earlier the NDP member told the member for 
Repentigny that being a Quebecer does not necessarily mean being 
a sovereignist, and being a Canadian does not necessarily mean 
being a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Put that in your pipe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> The court 
talks about political actors, as mentioned by several speakers. 
Why is it that the federal government decided it was the 
political actor? It wants to have the lead role, maybe like 
Bruno Pelletier in “Notre-Dame de Paris”, or something like that. 
It wants to be applauded, but this is not what the supreme court 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said “it will be for the political actors to determine 
what constitutes a clear question”. It will be for the political 
actors to determine what constitutes a clear majority, to engage 
in a negotiating process, to decide what its results will be. 
Liberal members are political actors. We are political actors. 
The provinces are political actors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go much further and broaden the scope. The Liberal 
government has highjacked the supreme court's opinion, and is 
serving it up its own way. 
It put people in a comfort zone regarding the future of the 
country. It told  “With this bill, Quebec will never separate; 
you can sleep on both ears, everything is under control”. We 
must remember what the Prime Minister was saying before the 1995 
referendum “Everything is being looked after”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am definitely not a sovereignist; I am definitely not a 
Liberal. But I most definitely have questions. For us in the 
Conservative Party this bill has been a hard blow. We have 
members outside Quebec. But we should abide fully by everything 
the supreme court said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I asked the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs yesterday, 
what is a political actor?  He answered with a non-answer. I 
said “If the provinces are political actors, do you suggest 
that the provinces pass the same bill, this bill that is so 
clear? The provinces are, so far as I know, equal partners in 
the federation, so if they are equal partners, are you prepared 
to suggest that they adopt the same bill?”  The minister 
replied “Not really; it is not necessary.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked whether or not we like the Senate, until 
there is a constitutional change, have to live with it.  It 
needs to be improved, clearly.  We Conservatives agree with 
that. But how is it that the Senate has no representative on 
this legislative committee of the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bicameral system after all, two chambers. Whether we 
like how it works, or not, we have to live with procedures. 
Whether or not we like to have the wool pulled over our eyes by 
the Liberal majority in a legislative committee, we must 
unfortunately live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Power must be properly exercised because it is something we run 
into head on pretty quickly.  I asked the minister “So what 
about the Senate?” “Oh, we don't know about that”. But the 
Senate has a right of veto on this.  There are Liberal senators 
traipsing about with a letter demanding an amendment, because 
the government is not even respecting the parliamentary system. 
When it hits the Senate, the senators are going to tell you 
“Here we are, and maybe we are appointed, but there are some in 
our bunch that would like to do their job properly and to have 
some recognition. Maybe not individual recognition, but we do 
have the upper chamber. Show at least some respect for your own 
parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed up with two questions, with which I 
shall close.  “Are you open to amendments?” Because in a 
parliament system— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> The answer was “No, it is not necessary. 
It is clear and quite simple. 
You are for or against”. It is a slap in the face. As the 
parliamentary process goes, it is a kick in the pants. The 
government brings in a bill and says “You may consider the bill, 
but we will not change it.” Not at all. What purpose are the 
witnesses going to serve in committee? One witness would say “I 
think the majority should be 70 %.” The government is going to 
say “Good”. The witness would add “The territory of 
Quebec is indivisible”. To which the government would reply 
“Oh, I do not know about that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why refer the bill to a legislative committee if the 
government cannot make a difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last question, and I will finish with that, was for the 
minister: 
“If the bill is so simple, so clear, so directly in line with 
the Supreme Court of Canada, before Royal Assent, since you have 
the prerogative to do so, could you not ask the Supreme Court to 
establish if it is contrary to the opinion of the Supreme Court, 
to the existing legislation in Canada and to the Canadian 
Constitution or in keeping with them?” The answer was “No”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his excellent speech.  He

about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  He may know what he is talking about.  I

question whether he knows what he is talking about.  He made

parameters on the events and the negotiations leading to the 
secession of a part of Canada or a province of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the member that if he reads the act very carefully 
he will see that the act exactly does not do that.  It does not 
define the question.  It does not define the number required for 
a majority vote, and it does not define the actual conditions of 
the negotiations.  It precisely avoids doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it very clearly does instead—and I would ask the member to 
agree with me or disagree with me, and if he disagrees to please 
explain—is limits the power of a government, any government, a 
future government of this country, to negotiate with a province 
on secession.  It says that government must first go to the House 
of Commons and determine whether or not the House of Commons 
approves of the certain events leading up to the negotiations 
that government might want to do, for example the question has to 
be clear, the House of Commons has to determine what is a clear 
majority, and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the member that in doing so, in limiting the power 
of future governments in negotiating with a province that wishes 
to secede perhaps on an ambiguous question, what in fact the 
government is doing is withdrawing from the separatists in 
Quebec.  I do not necessarily say this to members of the Bloc 
Quebecois because they are very good parliamentarians, but it 
withdraws from the separatists in Quebec of having one of their 
winning conditions.  That winning condition would be a leader of 
a government side who would be willing to negotiate on an unclear 
question and might have a majority in the House that has such 
party discipline that they would follow that leader no matter 
what he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the winning condition that we are trying to avoid by 
Bill C-20 is surely the leader of the Conservative Party who we 
know, if he ever did come to power, would be instantly ready to 
negotiate on an ambiguous question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the last comment of the hon. member, 
I should say that if Mr. Clark were in power, if there were a new 
government, we would  probably not be faced with the same 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things I want to say. When the hon. member says “limit the 
power of this government”, it is not true. He should read the 
opinion of the Supreme Court and examine the bill, then he would 
see that it is not a question of limiting the power but of 
increasing it. They are grasping, claiming to be political 
actors. The rules for the vole are not altered. What percentage 
will be needed in this House to say that the question and the 
majority are clear and to start negotiating the dismantling of 
our country? Will it be 50% plus one or will there be new rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-20, the federal government would force all of 
Canada to negotiate the terms and conditions of secession, if 
49% of members in the House said the question was not clear and 
51% said it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has given itself every power. This bill 
may not seem important today, but I dare the government to take 
it to the supreme court right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says the bill does not mention a clear question or 
suggest a clear majority and a negotiation process. I will 
reiterate what the hon. member said. We in the Progressive 
Conservative Party will take his note and his remarks and send 
that to the people of Ontario and western Canada. We will tell 
them that the clarity bill is not clear on the question. 
It is not clear on the majority and it is not clear on the 
negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I want to thank the hon. member personally and on 
behalf of the Conservative Party and all the federalists who 
still hope to accomplish something in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted.  We appear 
to be having a kind of dialogue here.  I draw the member's 
attention to a subclause 2(4) of the bill, and I will only read 
it in part, which says very clearly:  “The Government of Canada 
shall not enter into negotiations on the terms” of a province 
seceding “unless—there has been a clear expression of a will 
by a clear majority of the population of that province”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is absolutely clear.  It says a government will not 
enter into negotiations unless parliament has approved.  What we 
have simply done by this bill is that we have given parliament 
the power, not government the power.  We have given parliament 
the power to decide whether any government, especially a 
Conservative government, shall ever enter into negotiations to 
break up this country.  As for myself, I will trust parliament 
any day over a government that might be led by a Mr. Joe Clark. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is good news.  If we ever 
come to power, and he leaves, so much the better.  That is good 
news.  I cannot disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that, according to him, without a clear question and 
a clear majority there is no negotiation.  He says “This 
parliament is given the power”.  But the way it works is that 
there is no exceptional provision in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now wants to include an exceptional provision in 
case secession occurs, but not within our own operation. They 
eliminate all the provinces, all the other partners and the other 
place and they say “Here is where it is done”.  And they do not 
change one iota of parliamentary proceedings.  Who are the 
Cassoulets in the Liberal realm?  The PMO decides.  On an issue 
as crucial as this one, why did it not say it would be decided by 
a free vote in the House to the two thirds representing seven 
provinces, minimum.  Why not have done that? Why could the 
government not take the spirit of the amendment to the 
Constitution of 1982 and establish it here in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before someone on the other side of the House is empowered to 
negotiate the break up of this country, it will take more than 
50% plus one, from all appearances.  There should be a majority 
of the members here, representing a majority of the regions of 
the country, before a Prime Minister, who has done nothing to 
save the country, can go and negotiate the end of it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted actually 
because the member wants to refer everything to the supreme court 
which, I have to say, follows the tradition of the Mulroney 
Tories who made laws so vague that we are still cleaning up the 
mess with the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the speaker that the supreme court in this 
country comes under the Supreme Court of Canada Act.  The supreme 
court comes under this parliament.  So what he wants us to do is 
to refer the question to a body that in fact is under this 
parliament.  There is a sort of confusion.  We are going to go 
round in circles here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he not become a real true parliamentarian and take 
control in this House of the future of the country and use this 
House as the forum for debate and decision rather than going 
outside to an unelected body like the supreme court? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the Liberals who started 
the supreme court “game”, not me or the opposition parties. Who 
made the reference to the supreme court? Who said “We do not 
know what to do with the sovereignist, nationalist, and 
independentist movement in Quebec. Help. We call on the wisdom 
of the supreme court judges. We will ask them questions and hope 
they will side with us”? Who said that? Not me. We were opposed. 
We are of the opinion that, within a country, people are 
supposed to talk to each other, to understand each other, and to 
make compromises. Clearly, that is not how they see things 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Intergovermental Affairs stated—and it 
said it all, a wonderful, poetic statement—“I respect the supreme 
court of my country”. The minister should teach a lesson to the 
hon. member and show him how to respect the judiciary system of 
this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that all the opposition parties, which 
represent 62% of voters, have asked that the committee be 
allowed to travel. 
The Reform member for Macleod has accused the Liberals of not 
respecting Canadians or democracy.  The NDP leader and member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona said the following, and I quote: “The 
government has acted not expeditiously but with arrogance.  It 
is showing its disdain for the rules and traditions of the House 
on matters of such importance.  This bill deserves more 
attention and different treatment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not the words of a Bloc Quebecois member or a 
sovereignist, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the opposition parties, a large number of groups 
of Canadians and Quebecers, a large number of individuals, have 
called for the committee to travel in order to make it easier for 
the witnesses to take part. Who are these groups that are 
deploring the government's tactics for looking at Bill C-20? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what the spokespersons for some of them think about 
the government's steamroller tactics.  Let us see what they 
think, which is probably what is stopping the Liberal government 
from letting the committee travel, for fear of hearing the truth 
about Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Laviolette, president of the CSN, said “Basically, the 
Prime Minister ought quite simply to pass legislation stating 
that Quebec is not entitled to secede.  Period.  That would be 
the end of it, and it would be clear.  But instead he has 
decided to play at being democratic.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henri Massé, the general secretary of the FTQ said “There are 
all the makings of a good debate in Quebec, and this has been 
the case since the 1970s.  The debate is being conducted in a 
civilized fashion, the forces present are quite responsible and 
need no outside help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monique Richard, the president of the CEQ, also had this to say 
“This bill flies in the face of the most basic rules of 
democracy and our parliamentary system.  What entitles the Prime 
Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to come 
blindly marching into this debate and tell us what to do and how 
to do it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daniel Baril of the FEUQ calls for the withdrawal of the bill in 
the following terms “Mr. Prime Minister, we demand the 
withdrawal, pure and simple, of your bill and we ask you to come 
back down to earth with us”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Geneviève Baril puts it as follows “If the Prime Minister wants 
to give lessons on democracy, let him go back to school and do 
his homework”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society says “We will never allow 
Ottawa to eliminate the right of the people of Quebec to freely 
decide its future.  Canada will lose a few feathers in Quebec, 
but it will lose more internationally.  No one on this earth 
will ever again listen to a country that promotes rights and 
freedoms but fails to honour them itself. 
Canada is violating its international commitments and is turning 
into a prison of nations. It is time the Prime Minister get out 
of his village and realize that he is taking an action that is 
an embarrassment to the whole international community”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for François Saillant, of the Front d'action populaire en 
réaménagement urbain, the FRAPRU, he said “The federal 
government is tarnishing the image of the Canadian people on the 
international scene by denying the people of Quebec a right as 
fundamental as the right to self-determination. This is totally 
unacceptable on the part of a government that has been boasting 
for years that we are the best country in the world. The 
Canadian government is once again showing its hypocrisy when it 
comes to the respect of fundamental rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Yves Desgagnés, of the Front commun des personnes assistées 
sociales du Québec, points out the following “The federal bill 
is an attempt unprecedented in Canadian history to impose on the 
people of Quebec a legal yoke to prevent it from being the 
master of its own destiny. Twice, in the 1980 and 1985 
referendums, Quebecers were asked to decide on their future. 
That process was conducted under rules determined by the Quebec 
national assembly and no one in Quebec, whether on the 
federalist or the sovereignist side, challenged the legitimacy 
and democratic nature of these two consultations. Why question 
the political maturity of that people and its ability to discuss 
its future in serenity and in the respect of the various views 
expressed?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Claude Majeau, of the Fédération des locataires 
d'habitation à loyer modique du Québec, had this to say “The 
federal referendum bill is a tactic which may divert the 
attention of Canadians and Quebecers from a very important 
issue: the use of the federal government's budgetary surpluses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the parties in the national assembly and a great many 
community groups in Quebec and in Canada are begging the federal 
government to withdraw Bill C-20.  This shows that there is a 
strong consensus in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is too afraid of being democratic.  It knows that 
its bill undermines the basic principles of democracy.  It knows 
it will have to withdraw it.  So it goes underground.  It works 
behind the scenes, hoping that the legislative committee will 
make as few waves as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saw about still waters running deep, but we 
should also heed what appears on the arch over the door to 
the opposition lobby. It says in part: 
“A time will come, which is not yet, when I'll bite him 
by whom I'm bit.”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose the national assembly decides to hold a referendum and 
prepares a question, and the House of Commons likes the 
question. Now suppose the vote in favour of sovereignty is 52%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this very original game where one of the players sets the 
rules once the game is over, one can expect that, with a 52% yes 
vote, the federal government would say that a 54% majority is 
needed. With a 54% yes vote, it would probably say a 56% 
majority is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, it would not recognize this 52% result. We would 
therefore find ourselves in a situation where Quebec would be 
48% federalist and 52% sovereignist. Yet it would remain within 
the federal system, which means that it would be dominated by a 
minority. This is obviously undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague what kind of social peace she 
thinks we would have in a province that is part of the 
federation against the will of the majority of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is probably an 
extremely interesting question to ask, but the answer could be 
fraught with consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem when I hear, for instance, my colleague from 
Richmond—Arthabaska, and when I note all the questions he asked 
the minister yesterday in committee, and all the answers he got. 
We told the government on many occasions that nobody wanted to 
hear about it. Why also is it that the Prime Minister said “This 
is a small bill, it will go through fast; nobody is interested 
in it”. I wonder why, instead of striving for harmony and 
seeking some kind of agreement, the Liberal government 
constantly does its best to pour oil on the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in committee, it tells our colleagues “We will see, we 
will decide later; we will work something out”, it leads one to 
believe that Quebec will never in a million years meet this 
government's requirements. As my colleague said, the percentage 
might not be to its liking. As for the clarity of the question, 
it look for someone who claims it is not clear. It is telling us 
that it will consult as long as—it is not written, but we can 
sense it—it has not found someone saying it is obscure. As our 
leader said this morning, funny enough, both times, in 1980 and 
in 1995, Mr. Trudeau and the current Prime Minister respectively 
told Quebecers “Remember, the question is clear. A yes vote is 
irreversible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why is what is clear one day obscure the next? This is rather 
strange. So, this is what is going to happen: it will be obscure 
one day, and obscure the next, or rather, clear one day, and 
obscure the next. This government cannot be trusted. As my 
colleague said, this government has done nothing to save Canada. 
It gloats it is Canadian, but it does not even know what that 
means. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard my hon. colleague talk eloquently about 
the democratic need for the committee to travel.  We in the NDP 
agree with that, as my hon. colleague from Winnipeg mentioned 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in a little more detail as to where the 
hon. member believes the committee should go and over what period 
of time.  How thorough should these hearings be? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, in Quebec we have a very 
democratic process when it comes to consulting, to parliamentary 
committees. The rules compel the government to publish 
advertisements in newspapers saying “A committee has been struck 
to study such and such a topic. If you want to have an input, 
register with the committee's secretary by such and such a 
date”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, people are so afraid of democracy that it takes 
a vote by the government majority to decide who will be called 
as a witness. Witnesses have to be sponsored by a party, and 
there is a limit on the number of individuals or groups who can 
come and testify here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the significance of the issue for Canada as a whole, 
as the Prime Minister said, I believe ads should be published in 
every Canadian newspaper saying that a bill has been introduced, 
and that there will be hearings in the provinces that have asked 
the committee to come. It should take the time to consider the 
bill properly if it is really serious about the future of this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to participate in today's historic debate that 
has already left its mark on my short political career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today in this Canadian parliament, which has a rich 
tradition and a strong respect for democracy, to condemn the 
most undemocratic operation ever organized by the federal 
Liberals, led by the current prime minister, the last servant of 
his grand master, Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History will show that this man dedicated his whole political 
career to trampling down the people of Quebec. Today, with his 
accomplice, another loyal supporter of the Trudeau philosophy, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, he wants to impose a 
permanent gag order on the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa will now decide on the future of Quebec. The men and 
women who have been democratically elected to the National 
Assembly are not capable of doing it. This is a real insult to 
democracy. Canadian democracy, under the adepts of Trudeau's 
philosophy, is sick. It no longer works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is constantly imposing time allocation motions, 
better known as gag motions, to silence the democratically 
elected members. This parliament has become a place where 
undemocratic measures are taken repeatedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, when I saw the government House leader get up at 
second reading stage to move closure again, I told myself that 
democracy was on its way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This closure motion upset me tremendously. I would like to 
remind members that for about fifteen years, I worked in the 
media, where people get to hear the various declarations of the 
main decision makers in society, a place where people can find 
out what is going on. 
Here, in Ottawa, in the House of Commons, they want to gag 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing the Liberals' arrogance, I realized that members of the 
House no longer have the right to express themselves and take 
part in important and significant debates on the future of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gag imposed last week and the rules set by the legislative 
committee show us that this government no longer wants to listen 
to the population. The Prime Minister and his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs do not want to allow Quebecers to 
express themselves. They have set up a rigid framework, limiting 
to 45 the number of witnesses to be heard by the committee; 45 
people will be heard in Ottawa, and nowhere else. Out of this 
number, ten witnesses can be selected by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the rules of procedure laid down by the committee 
endorse the whole undemocratic operation orchestrated by the 
champion of arrogance in the House, the Prime Minister of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now living here in Ottawa, in the House of Commons, 
through some dark moments in our current democracy, 
unfortunately supported by 26 members of parliament from Quebec, 
26 members who refuse to see the political consequences of Bill 
C-20, that constitutional ripoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History will be harsh with them, as harsh as it was in 1982, 
when 74 Liberals unilaterally approved the patriation of the 
constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, the Quebec people responded by throwing them out of the 
Canadian parliament, and the little guy from Shawinigan, the 
great democrat, resigned in 1986 because he disagreed with the 
leader of the Liberals at the time, John Turner. Once again, we 
we see what sense of democracy the current Prime Minister has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once again appeal to all my federal Liberal colleagues from 
Quebec. Wake up. Bring the Prime Minister to his senses. Talk to 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. This is serious. As a 
member of the Standing Committee on Finance, I had the 
opportunity to take part in consultations throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, I 
travelled to Australia, Washington, Paris, Chicago and even 
Brazil. But today, for Bill C-20, we must stay in Ottawa and be 
bulldozed under by this government, which is ignoring all the 
demands of Quebecers and Canadians who would have liked to be 
heard by this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All opposition parties demand that this legislative committee 
travel across the country and in Quebec. Since this undemocratic 
bill was introduced, members of my party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
have spoken out repeatedly in this House and across Quebec to 
inform people of the political consequences of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only yesterday, about 20 of my colleagues travelled throughout 
Quebec to condemn the approach of the legislative committee of 
the House of Commons. Back home, in Lotbinière, I have had five 
interviews with regional media and, during the weekend, a series 
of events will be held to continue informing and alerting people 
about the impact of this bill intended to muzzle Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, on behalf of democracy, on behalf of Quebecers, I ask the 
Liberal government to allow the committee to expand its 
consultation process and to travel wherever Canadians want to be 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 40 years ago, the people of Quebec, the people of the 
riding of Lotbinière, proud Quebecers, embarked on a long 
political process that will very soon lead them to Quebec's 
sovereignty. It will be soon because Bill C-20 will become the 
necessary political tool to convince Quebecers that the only 
real way to gain complete freedom of action and to fulfil 
Quebecers' expectations is sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither Bill C-20 nor the antidemocratic stubbornness of Liberals 
in this House will prevent me from continuing this battle, which 
is so dear to me, to have Quebec's flag at the United Nations 
and to live in a Quebec free of the federalist yoke once and for 
all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to see our colleague express his emotions while 
trying to teach a lesson to my colleagues on this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he forgets that it is the supreme court ruling which 
stated that the political players will be the ones to determine 
what is a clear majority in reply to a clear question, depending 
on the circumstances of any future referendum.  This does not go 
against the bill put forward by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague will recall that, during the last referendum, when 
one entered the city of Montreal one could see posters showing 
the Canadian dollar, the “looney”, with a Yes beside it.   There 
were other posters with a shovel and a Yes, suggesting that if 
we voted yes, we would have much more money in our pockets, and 
yet other posters suggesting that there would be many more jobs.

hypothesis? Does he agree with that yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> I cannot believe what I am hearing, Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Close to Montfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Is there a split in the nation's capital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot get over such a diagnostic! For 20 years, I worked in 
the communications sector. Excuse me but I have never seen such 
a twit! Do you know what a twit is in Quebec? A twit is someone 
who does not understand anything, who should go back to school, 
who needs to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, if such explanations are supposed to convince us that 
Bill C-20 will make things clearer, I am worried, very worried 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the supreme court opinion, people always seem to 
forget one crucial sentence. It is because of this sentence that 
we now have Bill C-20. It says that after a winning referendum, 
you will have to negotiate our becoming a sovereign country. Get 
that through your head once and for all! 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the member for Lotbinière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggests that we take up this issue with the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Was the question put to 
Mr. Facal, Quebec's intergovernmental affairs minister, who said, 
in November, that the government of Quebec would never comply 
with the supreme court opinion?  This was a call to civil 
disobedience.  Does this means that the hon. member is for civil 
disobedience? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go further. If 50% plus one is the democratic limit 
universally accepted, why is it not mentioned in Quebec's 
referendum legislation? Why did Mr. Burns, the PQ minister 
responsible for this legislation in Quebec, say, when 
introducing this bill, that the “moral weight” of a referendum 
that would be won based on the clearly and widely expressed will 
of the people would have to be assessed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very interesting question for the hon. member. If 50% 
plus one is the democratic limit universally accepted, does he 
support the precedent that France created regarding Comoros, the 
group of islands off Madagascar, when it decided that regions 
that vote against independence may remain a part of France? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's question makes 
so little sense that I would be inclined to think it was written 
by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is referring to an international context that has 
nothing to do with our own context. He is trying once again to 
engage in demagoguery with regard to the Quebec minister of 
intergovernmental affairs. Since we came back here in the 
fall, the federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has 
repeatedly shown his arrogance by ignoring all of Quebec's 
demands. In that context, I have nothing to learn from these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Resuming debate. I know 
that the hon. member for Châteauguay would like to ask 
questions, but I promise that as soon as there is an 
opportunity to do so I will give him the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is indeed an important debate, one in which Canadians take a 
great deal of interest, and rightfully so.  We are talking about 
the very country in which we exist. 
I believe it is important that all members of the House have the 
opportunity to debate a matter such as this.  I am very pleased 
to be a part of this great and historic debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rimouski—Mitis talked about the Prime Minister 
having to go back to school to do his homework.  I also heard 
somewhat of a lecture from the hon. member for Lotbinière, who 
seemed to indicate to the hon. member for Ottawa Centre that he 
too should go back to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of arrogance and condescension really is inappropriate 
in the House.  The hon. member opposite claims to be a 
communications expert.  It seems to me that he should listen to 
his constituents, to the people of Quebec, and indeed to all 
Canadians.  People do not want to go down this path, no matter 
where they live in this great country of ours.  They want to talk 
about jobs.  They want to talk about taxation levels.  They want 
to talk about health.  They want to talk about education.  They 
do not want to talk about another referendum.  They do not want 
to talk about the breakup of this great country.  Quite frankly, 
we have better things to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is really quite frivolous.  I 
certainly oppose it, and I would urge all members of the House to 
do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has moved that the House legislative committee 
considering Bill C-20 hold hearings in all regions across the 
country.  I ask, to what purpose?  Why would we do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I understand the importance of this bill.  I 
think everyone in Canada does.  We understand the importance of 
consulting Canadians.  However, I and others draw the line at 
insisting that the House committee cross this land to obtain 
input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee can and will hear ample witnesses without having 
to travel.  It is open to the public and we will hear a number of 
witnesses, all of whom will be invited, without any holdback, to 
attend.  It is televised to Quebecers and to all Canadians. 
Through the television they can watch the deliberations of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has decided in its own right to remain in Ottawa. 
This type of decision is its prerogative and I certainly respect 
that, as do other members of the House.  I am confident that the 
committee will be able to fulfill its mandate and satisfy 
Canadians that it is an accessible and democratic process, one 
that is in place and one that will serve Canada well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say, for example, as chairman of the health committee, 
that we deal with issues all the time of grave and great 
importance to Canadians, no matter where they live.  We do not 
travel.  We have other ways of doing it, in the sense of, through 
other mechanisms, allowing witnesses to come here and still have 
their say and input without having to go to that expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the committee examining the province of 
Quebec's Bill 99 is not travelling through Quebec.  When the 
Quebec national assembly examined the Calgary declaration, Mr. 
Jacques Brassard, the Quebec Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and Deputy Leader, said the issue was of primary concern 
for all Quebecers, but that committee did not travel either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear one thing from the Bloc, but we hear quite another thing 
from the Government of Quebec.  It is not always clear in terms 
of what the Bloc wants and how it wants to go about things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Beauce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear that under Quebec's referendum law, when the 
national assembly examines a referendum question, it does not 
even have to refer the question to committee, let alone a 
travelling committee.  Imagine that.  It does not even have to 
refer the question to a committee.  It does not even have to hear 
technical witnesses.  It can debate the question and after 35 
hours—a measly 35 hours—adopt it without listening to any 
public input whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the Bloc put forward this motion to have our committee 
travel?  It does not strike me as being vital to the functioning 
of the committee examining Bill C-20.  It is simply another 
example of the Bloc twisting and turning for its own purposes. 
Those purposes, I say, are twisted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has been tasked with studying the clarity act 
which the government holds as important and urgent.  I believe 
that all Canadians do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 follows the opinion of the supreme court.  As 
political actors, the House of Commons and the Government of 
Canada have a duty to make their views known on how they should 
assess the circumstances of clarity that would trigger an 
obligation for the Government of Canada to negotiate secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent press release from the Prime Minister's office it is 
important to note that the government indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insisting on clarity is about respecting the rights of Quebecers 
to make an informed choice.  It is about respecting democracy. 
Those who choose to obstruct the democratic system with cynical 
delaying tactics to prevent a real debate should be held 
accountable for their own anti-democratic actions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Bloc has been doing all along.  It is not on 
this side of the House that it is undemocratic, it is on that 
side of the House.  They are the anti-democrats. What we are 
seeing today is the proof and the proof justly shown.  We on the 
government side will have no part of it and neither will 
Canadians.  Bloc members are the ones accusing us of undermining 
the principles of democracy by tabling the bill in the House. 
Imagine.  What nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, the bill is about democracy. It reflects our 
democratic heritage by ensuring that Canadians would be asked a 
difficult yet clear question and that they would fully understand 
the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the criticisms directed against us in the House relates 
to the 50% plus one rule to define a majority which the Bloc 
members consider ironclad.  We all know that it is an 
internationally recognized principle of democracy that 50% plus 
one does not always suffice.  It is not difficult to understand 
that under some circumstances a majority of this amplitude is 
simply not enough. Would it justify so grave an action as 
breaking up a country such as ours?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform member opposite caterwauls while this huge and historic 
debate is going on, asking what is the number.  I would point out 
that in my view those Reformers opposite are every bit as much 
separatists as those other people opposite.  It is unbelievable 
how they flip-flop on such an important issue.  They have 
flip-flopped repeatedly when it comes to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Reform member opposite and all his colleagues 
sitting in the House, why is it that the Reform Party does not 
stand up for Canada?  Why is it that the Reform Party always 
wants to break things apart, pit society against society, people 
against people, region against region, province against province? 
Why is it that they are always intent on doing that?  I do not 
know. What I do know is that Canadians reject that kind of 
nonsense and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple majority touted by the Bloc is not by any means 
absolute.  How can we be criticized for opposing a simplistic 
vision of democracy which holds that a simple majority is 
sufficient to take such a serious and irreversible step?  The 
rule of 50% plus one cannot apply when it comes to amending a 
province's political and legal status.  This is only common sense 
and Canadians understand that.  Canadians understand common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tabled the bill because we believe that democracy is 
more than mere arithmetic, unlike the Reform Party and unlike the 
Bloc.  They have always been close allies.  Even at their own 
convention Reformers had Monsieur Biron, a separatist, as the 
lead speaker. Imagine, a separatist speaking at the convention 
for the Reform Party.  Does that not tell Canadians a great deal 
about who those Reformers are and what they stand for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tabled the bill because we believe in democracy.  We 
believe it is important.  It is a protection of rights.  It is 
one of the four principles the Supreme Court of Canada said we 
must consider if ever we have to tackle the important issue of 
secession.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be crystal clear.  The Bloc's objective is not to have 
the committee travel but to destroy Bill C-20 by unreasonable 
delays.  That is unacceptable.  We on this side of the House will 
simply not allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us defeat this motion.  Let us expose it for what it is. Let 
us get on with the business of the House.  That is what all 
Canadians want us to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
listened to a lot of things in the House.  What we just listened 
to was at the bottom of the list as far as intelligence or having 
any meaning or relevance in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not sit here and let the gentleman across the way call 
me a separatist because I am not.  I will do whatever I can to 
work hard to keep this country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are debating today is about opening up the debate 
and allowing Canadians to have input.  I would like the member to 
explain why he feels that Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
should not have input into this clarity bill, a bill that has a 
potential to divide the country. All Canadians have an interest 
in this.  All Canadians have a right to come forward and to 
speak.  I would like him to clarify the government's position on 
not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting to 
hear what the Reform Party has to say and how it says it. 
Canadians see through its kind of tone and extremism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to before Christmas.  All members know that the 
Nisga'a treaty was a huge and very important treaty.  When the 
clarity bill which we are talking about today and that historic 
Nisga'a treaty came before the House, where was the Leader of the 
Opposition?  He was in Mexico.  We are dealing with these all 
important issues and where is the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition?  He is not in the House.  I assume he is still 
getting taxpayers' money to be here. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
you forgot to tell him he is not allowed to mention who is not 
in the House. It must be an honest oversight. I mentioned who 
was present, not who was absent since that is not allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague, who is a stalwart and, I must say, very 
convincing Liberal, must recall the time when, in 1980, at the 
Paul Sauvé Centre, Pierre Elliott Trudeau very eloquently stated 
“Trust me, ladies and gentlemen, the question is clear. If you 
vote yes, you will leave Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen years later, in the riding of Verdun, Jean Chrétien said 
“Ladies and gentlemen, the choice before you is gut wrenching. 
The question is clear. If you vote yes, you will leave Canada”. 
By the way, they both made promises they did not keep. I am 
anticipating the answer. They both promised renewal, and neither 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that both said the question was clear. In 1995, 94% 
of Quebecers voted on a question the Prime Minister had 
determined to be clear. Why is the hon. member suggesting today 
that it was not, contrary—incidentally—to what his leader, his 
Prime Minister and his own party said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as my Conservative colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska 
mentioned earlier, is it going to take a majority of 50% plus 
one in the House to determine if the question is clear? This is 
another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, who can tell us what the numbers will be? Earlier he told 
the Reform member that, if you inquire about the numbers, it 
means you are a separatist. But if one inquires about the 
numbers when dealing with a clarity bill, it might be that one 
wants to be perfectly clear. What are the numbers according to 
him? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about 
my historic memory.  I would appeal to his historic memory. 
I would appeal to him to reread the questions of 1980 and 1995. I 
will not bore the House by doing it here but I can say that they 
went on and on and on.  They were not clear; they twisted and 
turned with all kinds of nuances. That will not happen again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the government on this side of the House will ensure that 
we will keep whatever promises we made in terms of including all 
Canadians.  We will also continue to provide the peace, order and 
good government required by all Canadians. That is not to twist 
into this kind of nonsensical equation.  Rather we will make sure 
that we provide jobs for Canadians.  We will make sure that we 
have our fiscal house in order.  We will make sure that we 
provide the kind of government, health care and all the things 
that Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the numbers are concerned, the supreme court was very 
clear.   Even Mr. Bouchard said that the supreme court's judgment 
had merit.  The supreme court said it will be a clear question 
and a clear majority. That is good enough for me.  It is 
democratic and it is what Canadians want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to 
say that I am opposed to the motion introduced by the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois because it is not designed to broaden or 
advance the debate on the clarity bill. On the contrary, it is 
part of the Bloc Quebecois' strategy on this bill, which is more 
or less respectful of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's motion before us today would have the House 
“instruct”, and I stress the word “instruct”, the legislative 
committee on Bill C-20 to hold public hearings in all regions of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House who sit on various committees are well 
aware of the standing orders of the House governing committees. 
We all know that the committees of the House can establish their 
own rules and restrictions, as long as they do not exceed the 
basic powers granted to them by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, on the legislative committee on Bill C-20, have availed 
ourselves of that prerogative and decided, by ballot, that the 
committee would sit only in Ottawa. We have also taken steps to 
ensure that a wide range of witnesses are heard and that 
committee hearings are broadcast so that the people interested 
in the clarity bill can watch the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, the legislative committee on Bill C-20 has acted in 
accordance with the standing orders, but our colleagues from the 
Bloc would now have the House give orders to this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, do I have to remind this House that our colleagues from the 
Bloc, after having tried everything they could to prevent the 
introduction of this bill, after having delayed and disrupted 
the second reading debate, tabled, on February 10, a motion that 
this House decline to give second reading to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the respect our colleagues have for the legislative 
process which aims, as we all know, to allow open debates on 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this House know that the Bloc resorts to these 
tactics and strategies because its members are opposed to this 
bill which they consider antidemocratic. I would like to use the 
time I have to go over a few basic notions of democracy and say 
a few words about how democracy is perceived by the members of 
the Bloc and their independentist mentors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing like a definition to put things in their true 
perspective. 
Here are some simple definitions found in dictionaries. A 
democracy is “a country where the people choose their government 
by voting for it.” Also “a government in which the people hold 
the ruling power either directly or through elected 
representatives; rule by the ruled.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our colleague, the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, 
said in a speech before students of the University of Montreal 
law school, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Canadian democracy, despite its failures and dark 
chapters, can be put up against democracy in any other 
countries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also quoted what an historian of the University of Edinburg 
said on the 150th anniversary of the responsible government in 
Canada:

</I></B></P><P align=left>With regards to the crucial combination of grassroots 
participation, human rights and self-government, the history of 
Canada is unequalled in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy does not boil down to simple mathematics or to a 
simple majority in a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the introduction of its opinion on the reference concerning 
the secession of Quebec, the Supreme Court of Canada warns 
against that danger: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is a fundamental value in our constitutional law and 
political culture. While it has both an institutional and an 
individual aspect, the democratic principle was also argued 
before us in the sense of the supremacy of the sovereign will of 
a people...Democracy is commonly understood as being a political 
system of majority rule. 
It is essential to be clear what this means. It would be a grave 
mistake to equate legitimacy with the “sovereign will” or 
majority rule alone, to the exclusion of other constitutional 
values. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the January 29 issue of the prestigious magazine <I>The 
Economist</I> there was an editorial describing what could 
constitute secession rules and dealing namely with the majority 
issue in light of the underlying challenges posed by the 
secession project. After defining one of the problems at the 
very heart of any secession project, the author asked about 
those who are left behind and those who are dragged along 
against their will. He declared that any secession should be 
made only if a clear majority—of a lot more than 50% plus 
one—opted for it freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading that article, will the proponents of separation 
speak out against the editorial staff of <I>The Economist</I>? Probably 
not. They know all too well that this 50% plus one rule, which 
they say is sacred, is arbitrary, as evidenced by the fact that, 
on November 24, 1996, the day after a vote of confidence in the 
leader of the Parti Quebecois and current Premier of Quebec, a 
headline in <I>La Presse</I> read “Bouchard shaken up after finding out 
he does not have the confidence of one delegate out of four”. 
The article said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the scenes, it was mentioned that Mr. Bouchard, who was 
expecting a lot more support, was stunned when he heard the 
results in the presence of his closest advisers. Strategists had 
set the psychological threshold at 80%, assuming Mr. Bouchard 
would clearly get more. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vice premier and finance minister of Quebec said, and again 
I quote from <I>La Presse</I> “Like him, we are stunned; we would have 
liked to get a lot more support”. Nobody said that Mr. 
Bouchard's attitude was undemocratic. Nobody said that. 
Everybody understood he wanted a clear mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for our opponents, wanting to clarify something through 
legislation within the rules of our democratically established 
institutions is a breach of democracy, members will agree that 
we ourselves could easily question their good faith as 
democrats. Our opponents are pulling their holier-than-thou 
routine. Are they really above reproach as far as behaving 
as true democrats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Philippe Séguin, the former president of the French national 
assembly, found it appropriate recently to point out that one 
must accept the result of a referendum even though it is 
different from what one expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 1, during an interview he gave on Radio-Canada's 
<I>Téléjournal</I>, he said:

today, eight years after Maastricht, I was to ask for another 
vote on Maastricht, my fellow countrymen would find it odd. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This person, who until very recently was a friend and ally of 
Jacques Parizeau, simply recognizes that, in democracy, once the 
people has expressed its will, one must accept the result.

not try again and again to obtain a result that would be

to which the secessionist leaders are constantly referring to 
are concerned, we are being accused of doing a flip-flop and of 
suddenly refusing to abide by these rules for the wording of the 
question and the majority. However, it takes two to tango. We 
were never consulted when these rules were established and, 
moreover, contrary to some reports, we never accepted them 
complacently, as if they were untouchable principles which 
absolutely could not be questioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the House that before the 1980 referendum, 
the Prime Minister of Canada had very clearly said that if 
somebody knocked on the door of sovereignty association, there 
would be no answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be said of the leaders' refusal to recognise a role for 
the members representing the people they would leave behind and 
the others that they would drag along with them against their 
will? Refusing the right to speak in their name to the members 
of this House is, members will agree, a serious breach of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, members will understand my refusal to support this 
motion which basically is only another example of the great 
liberties that our colleagues from the Bloc are taking with 
democracy. My refusal is even more categorical due to the fact 
that these same colleagues are trying to us how democracy should 
operate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the speech by the hon. member for Beauce, who paid a 
lot of attention to the opinion of the supreme court. He said 
“The supreme court said this, the supreme court said that, the 
supreme court thought that—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court is their court. The court whose judges they 
appoint. My colleague who just spoke probably does not know 
this, but before 1949, when there was a dispute, particularly a 
constitutional dispute, things were referred to the privy 
council in London. It was a neutral arbitrator that could rule 
on disputes of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say so for the benefit of the member sitting to the right 
of the member for Beauce, because I am sure that she does not 
know it either. These references to the privy council in London 
were prohibited in 1949. Does my honorable colleague know that 
out of the nine judges sitting on the supreme court, three come 
from Quebec?  These are usually not the type of people who would have 
sovereignist leanings or who would even be able to understand 
what the sovereignists are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit like a divorce case, where the wife would say “In 
our dispute, the arbitrator will be my mother”. The verdict is 
easy to predict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member who keeps talking about the supreme court not 
recognize that it is acting a bit in this way? I would like to 
say something, but I will not say it here because it would not 
be polite. I also have a mother and she would be offended. I 
would rather let him answer on the subject of his beloved 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this question, 
because it gives me the opportunity to quote a certain statement 
to the House “I have practiced law for 20 years and I can 
testify that justice in Canada is in good hands, that we have 
judges who are responsible and at all times aware of their 
obligations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said in the House on September 1, 1988 by Quebec's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Speaking about democracy, in the last 
election in Quebec, in 1995, the riding of Beauce-Sud elected Mr. 
Quirion with a majority of 68 votes. In the riding of

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not overwhelming majorities, but it was democratic. We 
had judicial recounts and all citizens in Beauce accepted the 
verdict, even with such narrow victories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the hon. member for Beauce. If Bill C-20 
is so clear, why is he refusing to travel with the committee to 
his riding? That is what all his constituents want. Why is he 
refusing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-20, the majority is not indicated anywhere. From his 
seat in the House, can he tell us whether the majority will be 
79%, 59% or 50% plus one? If he has any idea, let him tell us. 
If not, he should not say a word. But he should tell his 
constituents that he has no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinon, it is deplorable 
that the president of Frontenac—Mégantic should try to think for 
the people of Beauce. They are quite capable of expressing 
themselves. Moreover, they did so in the last election, in 1997, 
by electing me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The

election where the member for Beauce-Sud won with a majority of 
68% and the other with a majority of 61%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he has a 
selective memory, because he forgot to mention that the member 
for Beauce-Sud who replaced the late Paul-Eugène Quirion, the 
member for Beauce-Sud, was elected in the next to last election 
with a majority of 5,000 votes and was elected in the last one

system of public health was created by Canadians who believed 
that all citizens deserve equal access to high quality medical 
care regardless of where they live in this great country. 
Canadians I have spoken to are proud of this accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our health care system is under stress.  Both service 
demand and costs are rising while hospitals and medical personnel 
are attempting to stretch their budgets to new limits.  Clearly 
the realities of health care have changed over the last 30 years. 
While we know more about illness prevention, we continue to 
depend on technology and drugs to cure ailments that might be 
addressed at a lower cost with equal success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to engage in open, inclusive debate to address the 
challenges of our health care system.  I believe we can continue 
to provide Canadians with the care they deserve by renewing our 
health care system and addressing today's realities.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the dangers of racist hate speech, which in Bosnia and 
Rwanda took us down the road to ethnic cleansing and genocide. 
As the Supreme Court of Canada put it in upholding the 
constitutionality of anti-hate legislation, “The Holocaust did 
not begin in the gas chambers, it began with words”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the danger of remaining silent, of indifference to evil, 
be it the killing fields of Sierra Leone, Chechnya or Burundi, 
“Dans ce temps-ci, qui s'excuse, s'accuse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the importance, as Sweden has demonstrated, of Holocaust 
and human rights education as an antidote to racism, xenophobia 
and hate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the struggle against impunity; of fidelity to the 
Nuremberg legacy of bringing war criminals to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the inspiration of a Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish 
non-Jew who saved 100,000 Jews in the Holocaust, who showed that 
one person can make a difference, that each one of us in our 
daily lives can make the world a better place.

branches saving 53 jobs in the province of Alberta.  Former 
customers of the Bank of Montreal in both provinces will be able 
to continue doing business with a financial institution in their

</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the important role played by co-ops and credit unions

minister confirm these facts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I will confirm is that when I became 
Minister of Human Resources Development Canada I delegated the 
authority for approvals in my riding to my deputy minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister knows that the Canada jobs fund requires a 1997 
unemployment rate of 10% for any given riding to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the riding of Brant did not exceed that 10% threshold, 
no matter the deputy minister or who would give approval to that. 
By what authority did the minister authorize these grants? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, as I mentioned, I did not 
authorize them because I delegated the authority for decisions in 
my riding to the deputy minister.  Second, the employment region 
in which my riding falls was 10.3%. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not true.  The average rate for unemployment in 1997 in 
the riding of Brant, the category and the criteria for which the 
Canada jobs fund looks at, was in fact 8.4%, by her own 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot delegate authority for these things.  She is the MP. 
She is the minister.  I do not think one can just delegate to the 
deputy minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since she ultimately approved grants to her own riding in spite 
of the fact that it clearly did not qualify, can she tell us what 
constitutes an illegal grant? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we did qualify.  In fact the investments 
are making a difference in the opportunities available to the 
people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in my place and I am very grateful, as are the people in 
my riding, for the opportunities that the Government of Canada 
has presented to them as individuals and to our community as a 
whole. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
terms and conditions of the Canada jobs fund are very specific. 
They say the rules can only be amended with the approval of 
treasury board.  Clearly, the 8.4% unemployment rate in the 
minister's riding did not meet the guidelines to receive $640,000 
in CJF grants that she herself approved on November 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us and will she produce the authorization 
from treasury board that gave her the authority to break those 
rules? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no rules were broken.  As I mentioned the 
employment region was 10.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that hon. members opposite stand here day after 
day and say they want to kill these very important programs. Here 
and nationally that is the message they give.  However, back home 
in their own ridings they say to their own constituents “Yes, we 
will write letters in support of your undertaking. Yes, we think 
these grants and contributions make a difference”. They cannot 
have it both ways. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we want to do is clear up a billion dollar bungle that the 
government and this minister continue to perpetuate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the minister did not receive treasury board approval, 
and she absolutely did not, rather obviously, under whose 
authority did she break the rules to reward her own riding with 
$640,000 in CJF grants?  Whose authority?

<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.  Yesterday the 
minister indicated that he thought the rising price of oil and 
gas was strictly a provincial matter, which is an odd point of 
view given that the Governor of the Bank of Canada thinks it is 
an issue, as does the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in the 
United States.  Even President Bill Clinton has expressed his 
concern about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a pattern here of not being able to stand up to the oil 
and gas industry?  First the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
collapses over Sudan and then the Minister of Industry will not 
take his responsibilities, washing his hands of the problem of 
rising oil and gas prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government express its concern and when will the

intends to do about rising oil and gas prices? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to that remarkably foolish question let me say that we 
have expressed our concern over gas prices repeatedly on this 
side of the House.  We have financed several studies by the 
Competition Bureau into determining whether there is competition 
in the industry.  The competition police so far have not found 
any offence under the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The superlative investigative skills of the New Democratic Party 
apparently can find such evidence when all the police at the 
Competition Bureau cannot.  Congratulations to them.  Let them 
give us the evidence and then we will proceed under the proper 
law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr.

They burn gas and oil and they want to know that something can be 
done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will perhaps ask the Minister of the Environment or the 
Minister of Natural Resources a supplementary question, because 
the underlying issue here is whether or not we are going to 
eventually break our dependence on these kinds of fuels, on 
exhaustible resources and on the internal combustion engine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the appropriate minister this question.  Does the 
government have any new plan, given the fact that these high 
prices may be maintained, for breaking our dependence on the 
internal combustion engine and finally getting around to doing 
many of the things that were recommended in the seventies and 
eighties?

know among other things that we have made very substantial

British Columbia and across the country led by the Ballard 
corporation that the government is very strongly supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also investing with the Iogen Corporation of Ottawa in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House the Minister for HRDC stated 
that she was using Statistics Canada figures to justify TJF money 
that was flowing into her riding.  We have been informed by 
Statistics Canada that they do not produce unemployment numbers 
on a riding by riding basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the minister is very simple.  Where did the 
minister get her numbers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Statistics Canada.  That process has now stopped, but in the 
context of this project the numbers that were made available to 
the department came from Statistics Canada and they indicated 
quite clearly that this was an area of high unemployment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in recent conversations with an official from 
StatsCan we were told “I am very suspicious.  I don't know how 
HRDC comes up with these numbers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this direct contradiction, can the minister tell us why 
she is using bogus numbers to circumvent the rules for her own

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

was an area of very high unemployment, spiking at over 14%.  Very 
clearly the program, the transitional jobs fund, was there to 
assist ridings like mine.  I am absolutely convinced that it is 
these programs that have helped men and women in my riding find 
opportunities that otherwise would not have been there.

choose his words wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  I will, Mr. Speaker, and I wish the 
minister would choose her statistics wisely.  A moment ago she 
told us that the unemployment rate in 1997 in her riding was 
10.3%.  I have in my hand the unemployment statistics of the 
human resources development department for 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant with respect to comparative 
unemployment rates, which indicate in 1997 an average rate of 
8.4%, and in every month, save one, a lower unemployment rate 
than Ontario and the national average.

had been settled in law.  Corbeil has acknowledged his guilt and 
therefore acknowledged having acted illegally.  But what has not 
yet been settled is the fact that it seems it is easier to get a 
hold of the lists of projects when it is illegal than when it is 
legal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a very serious matter on our hands today because 
the Minister of Human Resources Development has stood in the 
House and said that her riding qualified for CJF grants because 
it had an unemployment rate of 10.3%.  However, I hold in my hand 
the statistics from her very own department for Brant, which show 
that in no month for the operative year was unemployment at 
10.3%.  In fact, the average for that year was 8.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the minister to explain this very clear discrepancy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

jobs funds as a result of being part of the Niagara economic 
region which had an unemployment rate of 10.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs have made a difference in my community, and I 
remind the opposition members that there were times when they 
came to my riding and they spoke about how difficult the times 
were there.  They challenged me as a member of parliament to 
stand and do something for my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done that and I am very proud of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I suggest to the minister that her pride is sadly 
misplaced because she cannot and has not produced justification 
for putting money into her riding. 
She brings forward figures which are not supported either by 
Statistics Canada or by her own department.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through access to information we have learned two conflicting

TJF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain how a $750,000 grant became a $2

<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the Government of Canada has made in the province of the hon. 
member.  That province has had considerable concerns with 
providing employment opportunities to its members. As a partner 
in all these undertakings, we know that the federal government 
can help make a difference.  It has done so in Bras d'Or and in 
other parts of Cape Breton. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister knows the NDP are not against good job 
creation initiatives, but this is about the integrity of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents clearly show Scotia Rainbow received $2 million for 
job creation, but the company's financial statement shows that it 
only spent 7% of that money on salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the minister's definition of job creation or a way to 
funnel money to Liberal supporters?

the Minister of Human Resources Development likes to use the term 
pockets of unemployment.  There is no mention of pockets of 
unemployment in the criteria for HRDC.  I assume she was 
referring to the ridings of Sarnia and Hamilton Mountain which 
saw two companies pull out and move to the minister's riding. Her 
riding received close to $2 million in TJF funds, yet the 
minister's riding did not qualify for TJF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister use her cabinet clout as a minister to have her 
riding qualify? 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
according to Statistics Canada the riding of Brant did not 
qualify for TJF funding.  It did not qualify using the economic 
region criteria.  It did not qualify according to data for the 
city of Brantford.  It did not qualify according to the county of 
Brant statistics that the minister selectively used on Monday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

as a result of Statistics Canada numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear to the House that no jobs were taken 
from other communities.  I have explained the Duchess 
circumstances.  It came as a business opportunity and created 
extra jobs.  With regard to RMH, I am glad to say that that

more money than what was needed for a helicopter that was totally 
inappropriate for today's needs, we would be a lot further ahead 
in terms of this replacement at this point in time.  They wasted 
taxpayer money.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON BILL C-20 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK211">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on the motion of the Bloc Quebecois ordering the 
legislative committee studying Bill C-20 to hold public hearings 
in all regions of Quebec and Canada so as to hear as many 
witnesses as possible having an interest in this bill, and 
expressing other considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to explain to Quebecers and Canadians why the 
Bloc Quebecois, with the support of all opposition parties, is 
so vocal in its condemnation not only of the so-called clarity 
bill but also of the process whereby this bill will be rushed 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time I have, I will speak of the content of the 
bill as well as of the accelerated process. 
This bill, which is entitled—we have no choice but to say it, as 
but we find that it is not well named—an act to give effect to 
the requirement for clarity. For the record, this bill was born 
under the influence of the instigator of the government's plan 
B, in the days following the referendum where the yes side 
almost won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, plan B was the stick while plan A, which we have heard 
little about, was supposed to be the carrot, a very small, 
transparent, translucent, genetically engineered carrot we have 
not often seen.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been hearing about, since the 1995 referendum, 
which was almost won but was unfortunately lost, is plan B. When 
history is written, it will be clear that plan B was developed 
at the instigation of the current Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to remind the House that, as early as 1992, 
this minister, then a professor, gave advice to Premier 
Bourassa, saying that “Mr. Bourassa must draw the conclusions 
from these endless negotiations that are leading nowhere. He 
must come to the defence of Canada such as it is today and tell 
Quebecers that constitutional amendments will not happen in the 
foreseeable future, even if it means telling Quebecers that an 
economic association between an independent Quebec and the rest 
of Canada would be equally improbable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, realizing 
that Canada would never follow up on what has been called the 
traditional demands, or the set of Quebec demands, which were 
taken up by Claude Ryan, Bourassa and others, said “Since we 
cannot change it, let us be content with it. Let us be happy. 
Let us say that we have is good”. But it was not enough because 
there had been this referendum with a 49.9% yes vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should he do? He had to find the means to scare these proud 
Gallics from Quebec. To scare them, he developed a scheme and 
figured it ought to go through the supreme court. He personally 
put questions to the supreme court, urging it to render a 
decision on Quebec's right to unilaterally secede. Never did the 
Quebec plan involve a unilateral declaration of independence or 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the carefully crafted questions put by the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, in one part of its opinion, the 
supreme court said something he did not like: a clear majority 
on a clear question would require Canada to negotiate. If I am 
digressing here it is because, through the bill, the minister is 
getting rid of the only part of the supreme court's opinion that 
he did not like, that is, the obligation to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this famous so-called clarity bill do? First, it says 
that a majority of 50% plus one, which has always been 
understood in Quebec law as being sufficient to determine if a 
referendum has been won, is not enough. But it does not say what 
the majority should be. It only says that the government would 
consult here and there, and could decide that the majority the 
referendum got is not sufficient and not clear enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill say about the question? It talks about what 
the question should not include to get the federal government to 
negotiate. In fact, it is the federal government, at the 
instigation of its Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, that 
would choose the topic of the question. However, this is not 
included in any way, shape or form in the supreme court's 
opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We too sought the opinion of a leading expert, in the person of 
Alain Pellet, a professor at Université de Paris-Nanterre, who is 
a member and former chair of the UN International Law 
Commission. He said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It follows that a clear question on something else than 
secession [...] would not be incompatible with current 
international law. Neither the supreme court's opinion nor the 
draft bill introduced on December 10, 1999, if passed, would 
preclude asking such a question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to be able to choose the topic of the 
question and what the majority should be. And there is more. 
This government, whose bill provides for every legislative 
assembly in Canada, the Senate and everyone who has an opinion 
to be consulted on the question, is ramming this bill through 
the House, and not allowing the committee to travel and listen 
to Quebecers and Canadians who, for years, have been emotionally 
involved in this very important debate on what is called, in 
Canada, national unity, and in Quebec, the national issue. It 
will not let the committee go and hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it proposes a bill that gives it extraordinary leeway and 
provides that it consult everybody, but there can be no 
consultation before passing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, I toured Canada for two months; we travelled to 22 
cities, where we listened to Canadians and Quebecers from 9 a.m. 
to 11 p.m., for two or three days at a time, before tabling a 
report which was shelved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting in an irresponsible, shocking and 
provocative manner on a bill that will play a key role in the 
future of both Quebecers and Canadians. But I think that, in 
acting this way, it also undermines the significance of this 
bill. Who will give credit and legitimacy to a bill passed like 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government itself is undermining the position that it wanted 
to be so strong, and Quebecers will not be fooled by this bogus 
exercise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
found the remarks of my colleague, the member for Mercier, very 
interesting. I would like to ask her if the government opposite 
is likely to find support within Quebec's civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the three parties in the Quebec National Assembly 
reject Bill C-20. It is clear that here, in the House of Commons, 
more than 60% of members are also against Bill C-20. But what 
about the various groups within Quebec's civil society? What is 
their reaction to Bill C-20? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry for his question. Quebec's civil society, 
which the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs arrogantly 
referred to as a “mothball group”, cares about democracy in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable and incomprehensible that intelligent people 
like the members opposite cannot understand that closing the 
door on democracy in Quebec is the same as closing the door on 
the people of Quebec and that civil society will always defend 
the people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues opposite who are from Quebec should have thought 
twice. Quebec has always known these two tendencies, one of 
which is a growing movement, with various stages, and that 
movement will continue. It is a democratic movement that belongs 
to the people of Quebec. It is a shame to want to sabotage it, 
to override it, to close the door on democracy in Quebec, but 
Quebecers will strike back. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the 
member to explain to us how is it that, if this bill is so 
undemocratic, the Premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, said that 
the opinion of the supreme court was an excellent opinion. Bill 
C-20 is based on that opinion and its purpose is to ensure that 
Quebecers can clearly decide, with a clear question and a clear 
majority, if they want to separate from Canada. The question and 
the rules will be decided by the Quebec National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to explain to us why she says this bill 
is undemocratic when Mr. Bouchard said that the opinion on which 
it is based was a good one. Is she against the leader of the 
separatists? 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will gladly 
answer him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not listen to me. The only thing that the government and 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs do not like is that 
that opinion—yes, we were proud of it—forces the government to 
negotiate if the question and the majority are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what this bill does is discharge the government from 
its obligation to negotiate because the government will decide 
what is a clear question and what is a clear majority. It does 
not say in the bill what majority means. It is leaving open the 
possibility of setting the majority as high as it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, it chooses the subject. It refuses the idea of 
negotiation between equal partners. It refuses the concept of 
sovereignty partnership which is the way for Quebec. 
Quebec's sovereigntists do not want to build a fortress around 
Quebec. They want the establishment of a new and modern 
relationship with Canada, a type of relationship that our 
friends opposite promote for other peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is good for other peoples, why can it not be good for 
Quebec and Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great pleasure that I speak today, beside my 
colleague from Laval Centre who has returned to the House today 
after a period of convalescence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Now, on a less happy note, I wish to 
condemn the odious approach taken by the government in Bill 
C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as 
set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the 
Quebec secession reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, and I am choosing my words carefully here, the 
federal government is using the law for purely partisan reasons 
and is making a sham of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must remind the House that the Supreme Court of Canada 
never gave the government the responsibility and the power to 
give effect, as it says, to the requirement for clarity, which 
the court allegedly set out. 
jugement de la cour. J'ai donc traduit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, and I 
quote “It is up to the political actors to determine what 
constitutes a clear majority and a clear question”. Contrary to 
what the federal government claims, the court has given no 
exclusivity or precedence to any political actor regarding the 
definition of what would be a clear majority and a clear 
question. Thus, the federal move blatantly exceeds the scope of 
the supreme court's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, concerned by the fact that Quebecers are attracted to 
the concept of partnership, the federal government claims that 
is has the power to order that an eventual referendum should 
deal with only one issue, what Ottawa calls secession, which, 
again, would go against the spirit and the letter of the supreme 
court's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recognize that this is not the first time the 
federal government violates established constitutional 
conventions and its own constitution. We need only think of the 
numerous encroachments by the federal government on provincial 
jurisdictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice of terms is not, of course, ever neutral.  The court 
stipulates in fact as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—conferring a right to initiate constitutional change on each 
participant in Confederation. In our view, the existence of this 
right imposes a corresponding duty on the participants in 
Confederation to engage in constitutional discussions in order 
to acknowledge and address democratic expressions of a desire 
for change in other provinces. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the future proposals for constitutional changes referred to 
by the supreme court would not, contrary to federal claims, be 
limited solely to secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its opinion, the supreme court also takes great care in 
making it clear that it is speaking of a clear majority in the 
qualitative sense of the word.  It is therefore wrong to claim, 
as the federal government does unreasonably, that 50% plus one 
would not, in the eyes of the court, constitute a clear 
majority.  In democracy, 50% plus one is a majority, and in a 
democracy a majority is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would point out that in a 1991 supreme 
court decision it was stated that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—each vote must be relatively equal to every other vote. 
To water down the importance and significance of an individual's 
vote is to weaken the democratic process. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore the court's constant opinion, since it has 
also concluded in the past that a system which dilutes one 
citizen's vote unduly as compared with another citizen's vote 
runs the risk of providing uneven and unfair representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, therefore, conclude, based on precedents established by 
the supreme court itself, that the federal manoeuvre is not only 
potentially illegal and unconstitutional, but also basically 
undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is unacceptable also because the House of Commons 
would be deciding the acceptability of the question even before 
the debate on that same question in the Quebec National Assembly 
is over, and the latter is the legitimate decision-making centre 
for the entire process leading up to the decision by the Quebec 
people on its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise another profoundlu undemocratic element of 
the process followed by the government, namely the hearing of 
witnesses during study of Bill C-20 by the legislative committee. 
If it wants to have a minimum of credibility when claiming that 
it intends to preserve the integrity of democratic institutions, 
the federal government must adequately consult the people on a 
bill that has such an importance for its collective future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the government impose closure on the study of Bill C-20 
at second reading? How could it so outrageously limit the number 
of witnesses that the legislative committee can hear and decide 
that only those who are duly chosen by one or the other of the 
five recognized political parties in this House will be heard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it refuse to allow the committee to travel in Quebec 
and Canada to meet all those who would like to be heard on an 
issue as fundamental as this one? How could it flout normal 
parliamentary practice and the most elementary principles of 
parliamentary consultation, if not because it knows that its 
tactics does not meet with the approval of the Quebec people and 
because it wants to proceed quickly enough to prevent any 
organized opposition to this infamous bill to organize? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec does not have any democracy lessons to receive from 
anyone, especially not from the federal government. Quebec's 
democratic institutions are respected and admired all over the 
world. Furthermore, the level of democratic ethics in Quebec is 
far superior to the one seen on the federal scene and which 
sometimes take us back to the dark ages. 
This is evidenced by the partisan appointment process used by 
the party in office to select returning officers responsible for 
the administration of federal elections in each riding, and by 
the permissiveness that exists at the federal level regarding 
the rules for political party financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some democracy, when it promotes influence peddling and always 
allows the affluent to be the strongest voices heard by people's 
representatives. When one lives in a glass house, one should not 
throw stones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Do as I say, not as I do” goes the old saying. 
I tell the minister sponsoring Bill C-20, and also government 
members, that the question asked by the federal government to 
the Montagnais in the Lac Saint-Jean region is not exactly a 
model of clarity, a clarity allegedly being sought by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs with his bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about a rather complex question with two

to an agreement and to two sections of an act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the clarity of the question. How can we presume that 
the Montagnais of the Lac Saint-Jean region would automatically 
give the same answer to the two questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government demand a single answer to these two 
questions? This government, which boasts about having the 
monopoly on clarity, is asking a very ambiguous question that 
lends itself to very different interpretations by voters. Sure, 
the federal government will claim that the 1995 referendum 
question was not clear. But another saying provides that when in 
doubt, do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the turnout for the referendum on sovereignty-association 
on October 30, 1995 was 93%, we conclude without a doubt that 
Quebecers understood the question put to them and its issues 
very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to show that the federal government is not a prophet in 
its own land, I would add that, for the referendum it is 
organizing for the Montagnais of Lac St-Jean, the majority 
acceptable will be 50% plus one of the voters.

the game are set in advance.  They are clear and remain

themselves a country that reflects their abilities and their

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
fairly clear from the words of the hon. member that he is not 
supporting the legislation currently in front of the House and 
that in the context of this debate he urges more time and more 
witnesses for the committee studying the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those, and I think my constituents are among those 
who look back at the last referendum and say that we should look 
at the grouping that lost the last referendum.  The oui side lost 
the last referendum.  Was the question clear at that time?  I 
personally do not think so.  It was not a clear question.  Did 
they lose clearly?  Well, apparently not.  If the oui had 
actually lost the last referendum clearly, it would not be 
pursuing the issue now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last referendum is a wonderful example of why the supreme 
court has said that for something as final as a separation of a 
region of this country from Canada we must have a clear majority 
and a clear question.  When the process is over it has to be 
absolutely clear to those who have lost what has happened so 
there will not be a repeating process of referenda that will 
continue to undermine the entire country ad infinitum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask a very short question.  If 50% plus one is a 
majority, what is a clear majority? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I get the feeling that the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader is mixing up all sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we would simply tell him that the best proof that 
sovereignists respected the 1995 referendum verdict is that 
Quebec is still part of Canada.  Since the Government of Quebec 
was a sovereigntist government at the time and still is, if it 
had not respected the verdict of the people, it would have 
subsequently proclaimed Quebec's sovereignty, which it did not 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It therefore respected the verdict of the people, even though 
the referendum results were very close.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, if, as the federalists argue, Quebec were 
divisible, the very great majority of Quebec's territory would 
already have been sovereign since 1995.  All regions of Quebec, 
with the exception perhaps of three, the Outaouais, West 
Montreal and the Beauce, voted very heavily in favour of 
sovereignty and yet they are not part of an independent country 
called Quebec today.  They are still part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1995, the possibility of constitutional amendments 
was held out to the people of Quebec and a small majority was 
once again misled into voting no. 
They voted no, probably hoping that the Prime Minister's empty 
promises would result in a renewed federalism.  Once again, as 
it did 1980, the federal government reneged on these promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, since the promises made to Quebecers in 1995 were 
not kept, we are fully entitled to again ask ourselves whether 
we wish to belong to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to my hon. colleague that the reason I am still 
promoting Quebec's sovereignty is because in 1997 Quebecers gave 
me and my 43 Bloc Quebecois colleagues a renewed mandate not 
only to defend their interests but also to promote Quebec's 
sovereignty here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am going to continue to do because it is why my 
constituents sent me here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me no 
great pleasure to be here today speaking to this motion.  I have 
been in the House since 1993.  Prior to that I spent five years 
in the Manitoba legislature in opposition, so I have some 
sympathy for some of the concerns raised by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Winnipeg—Transcona representing the New 
Democratic Party raises concerns about the use of time allocation 
to get the bill into committee, the use of restricting debate in 
an attempt to get the bill dealt with by the government, I have 
some sympathy with that.  I have a fear at times that we move in 
ways that make it difficult for the House to give bills the 
consideration they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to what I hear coming from the New Democratic 
Party, the member in discussion with the minister last night 
raised some very legitimate concerns which I think the minister 
will think about.  He raised some questions which I think we have 
to answer.  That is what this process is for.  That is why we 
have this kind of examination.  It is to hear testimony, to 
listen to expert opinion, and to challenge each other about what 
we are trying to create so that we create a better piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the Reform talk about it and the critic for the Reform 
raise concern about a majority of 50% plus one.  It is a very 
important question.  I appreciate his constant pressuring us to 
think about it.  If we are not clear on how we feel about 
important issues as we approach this very important topic, we 
will simply do a disservice to everybody that we represent, no 
matter who we are in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear from the Progressive Conservative Party I feel a 
little saddened to see that once great national party take the 
kind of positions that it does and play the kind of divisive game 
it has chosen to play on this piece of legislation. 
Frankly, I have tried hard to understand the position of its 
leader, and I do not.  I have considered the arguments very 
carefully.  I know he will come before committee and I will 
undertake to listen to what he has to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bloc members stand in the House and talk about democracy, 
and when they talk about this being an affront to the people of 
Quebec because we are not being democratic in the way that we 
approach this bill, I reject that absolutely.  I think the Bloc 
is exactly the wrong party in the House to lecture anybody in 
Canada about democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to do with this bill—and I thought it was 
talked about very eloquently today by the witnesses who came 
before the committee—is create a structure around the most 
important set of discussions our country could have. We are 
trying to put in place not the decision, not the end point, but 
the structure within which we have the discussion, something that 
is extremely difficult to do, to talk about the breakup of our 
country.  Do we not owe it to all the people we represent, no 
matter where they live in Canada, to put in place a mechanism for 
having that discussion that allows us to do it in a peaceful and 
sane manner?  We should not simply build upon the little nuances 
of the argument or inflame the debate for the sake of running up 
a motion so maybe we can get a decision.  Does it not make sense, 
if we are going to approach such a discussion, that we do it in a 
way that will not cause more harm to those people to whom we are 
responsible?  That is what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has three clauses.  The only thing one of the clauses 
says is “let us be clear”.  If we want to talk about breaking 
up the country then let us ask the people if they want to break 
up the country, yes or no.  Let us not play with it.  Let us not 
run up motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the talk about democracy over here, it was the leader of 
that party who said “Why do we talk about partnership?  Because 
we know that partnership represents seven to eight percentage 
points more support than the population.  Therefore, we must 
think twice about clarifying the option.  So what we will do is 
keep the options muddy.  We will make sure people do not quite 
understand what they are getting in the vain hopes that they will 
vote for it”.  Is that the way to go into this kind of decision? 
Does that produce the kind of environment that allows us to 
actually have this discussion?  Does that represent honesty? 
Does that represent democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a statement which said that the minister was insulting 
Quebecers because he thought that the result was not clear and 
that was why we needed some clarity in this.  The current premier 
of Quebec said that they had deliberately made it unclear in 
order to gain more support.  Those are not my words, those are 
the words of the current premier of Quebec, the former leader of 
this party.  I just do not think that the Bloc has the right to 
come in here and lecture anybody else in the House about 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the percentage, I am thinking specifically of 
some of the questions that the member from the Reform Party 
raised.  We all have this kind of instinctive sense that 50 plus 
one makes sense.  It gives us one of those comfortable kinds of 
feelings.  However, when we think about this, when we get away 
from the theatre of this place and away from the charged up 
atmosphere we get in here under the cameras and all the fighting 
and debating, which is all very exciting, we must come down to 
the point where we actually sit down and talk about taking apart 
the country.  Do we not want to be certain that is the will of 
the people and not a momentary passion?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Professor Lebel was very helpful today.  He certainly 
was very helpful to me as he walked through some of that trying 
to clarify it and trying to make debate real, not in terms of the 
debate that happens here but the debate that would happen if we 
were to ever reach that point around a series of tables with the 
entire population looking on.  He said that before we go there, 
do we not want to be absolutely certain that is where we want to 
be.  We have to be clear but we also have to be sure, and 50% 
plus one is just too narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, the parliamentary secretary to House leader, asked 
the obvious question.  At the time that the supreme court 
released its decision, I was here and I went through it very 
carefully.  I heard the Bloc saying that it was great and that it 
was a good decision by the supreme court.  The supreme court said 
that there has to be a clear majority.  If 50% plus one is not a 
clear majority, my friend asked, then what is an unclear 
majority?  The supreme court clearly differentiated between one 
kind of a majority and another kind of majority.  There is not a 
lot of room between 50% plus one and 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that causes me great conflict.  I am from 
the west and I have not lived this issue the way some have. As a 
Canadian I have, because it has been a recurring theme throughout 
my adult life, but I have not lived it, in fairness to the 
members from Quebec, the way a Quebecer has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came here in 1993, one of the first things I did was to 
meet up with the hon. member for Québec East in the gym.  He 
taught at the University of Manitoba.  He is a member of the Bloc 
and was the agriculture critic.  I had been here for about a week 
when I met him and I said to him “Help me to understand this. 
Tell me what is going on”.  He recommended a book, which I read. 
The hon. member for Mercier actually wrote a book and I got her 
book because I wanted to understand why, when Canada is such an 
incredible country, that someone would want to smash it apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travel every summer and every chance I get I am in Quebec.  I 
work with members of the Bloc on policy committees, on human 
resources and on foreign affairs and it is terrific.  Those 
members make valuable contributions.  When we talk about 
virtually every policy that we deal with, I find I often feel a 
lot more simpatico with members of the Bloc than, dare I say, 
with some of my companions from the west in the Reform Party, 
until we come to this question of breaking up the country.  I do 
not see what we would gain or what the people we represent would 
gain by doing that.  I certainly do not see what any of us would 
gain if we do it in an atmosphere of confusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened closely to the comments of the hon. 
member for Winnipeg South.  I want to say that the New Democratic 
Party supports Bill C-20, the referendum bill, in principle.  I 
believe people in my riding want us to support the bill if the 
Liberal government will improve it somewhat.  It is very 
important that the Parliament of Canada has something to say in 
the event that a province decides to secede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member revolves around the committee 
and its hearings which are supposed to elucidate the whole debate 
around how the bill might be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member and some of his colleagues not that 
long ago toured western Canada to decide how the Liberal 
government might best improve its fortunes there, although I 
think that is unlikely.  In that case it was important to travel. 
However, we are now hearing that it is completely adequate to 
simply have television.  In other words, people can watch but 
they cannot participate before the committee. Justifications were 
given for that today but I do not agree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the member's experience travelling in western Canada with 
the Liberal committee, does he believe that this committee should 
travel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no, I do not.  I have been 
in opposition in the prairie legislature and I have been here 
since 1993.  I have travelled extensively on some committees and 
not on others.  The hon. member is new in this place.  He needs 
to spend a little time watching how this place operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we will consult broadly.  The minister has 
been consulting very broadly.  What we have said is that we will 
not bring forward all the witnesses. 
What we are saying to the New Democratic Party and every party in 
the House is that they can bring any witnesses they want before 
the committee and we will listen to all their opinions.  We are 
not closing the door on that.

he comes forward and raises his standard concern with us.  It 
does not matter what is talked about because the Bloc members

Quebecers have of what we want to do.

answer lies in the words of his former leader.  If he wants that 
kind of honesty and open discussion, then why does he say that we 
framed the question this way because we know that more of the 
population will vote for it than if we framed it another way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If at the end of the day the question is the separation of the 
country, what is the problem with clarity?  What is the problem 
with saying “that is what we want”.  If that is what he wants 
then he does not need to be playing games with the question.  The 
intention of the question, in the words of his own former leader, 
was to confuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member referred to clarity.  In reality, 
when one looks at the bill there is very little that is clear. It 
is very confusing for Canadians.  It is so confusing that last 
night in committee his minister did not know that the 
territories, in terms of their having a say, were included in 
this.  The political actors are not clear.  The input from 
aboriginal peoples is not clear.  The boundary disputes that 
could erupt are not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to comment on that and give us a direct 
comment, not the vitriol and the bombast about that party over 
there siding with the separatists.  We are a federalist party. 
We have always been a plan A party.  We have worked very hard, 
much to the dismay of the hon. member, Mr. McKenna and others, 
including the Prime Minister who torpedoed attempts to bring 
Quebec into the federation and try to improve the way the 
federation worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not about clarity, it is about political advantage. 
It is about bolstering the Bloc and the Reform Party. What does 
the hon. member have to say about the real intention of the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the irony of this party 
lecturing anybody on clarity on this particular issue is not lost 
on anybody in the House.  “Exactly what is the policy on that? I 
am not quite sure what it is”.  It depends, of course, on which 
member we ask and on which day of the week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the former leader of that party, who is now the 
leader of the opposition in Quebec, who said: “the Quebec 
government's strategy has less to do with having the national 
assembly speak with one voice than with reviving the sovereignty 
thrust of the party in power”, which is trying to manufacture a

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion, the Bloc leader thinks, as he said himself, that 
it is imperative for the legislative committee on Bill C-20 to 
hold hearings in all regions of Quebec and Canada so as to hear 
as many witnesses having an interest in the bill as possible. He 
also demands that the hearings be broadcast and that the 
committee be given sufficient resources to hold such hearings, 
all in accordance with the rules and practices of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sceptical as to the real meaning of this motion, which is 
obviously a veiled attempt at partisan politics. 
The list of witnesses that have already been invited to appear 
before the committee shows that they are Canadians from all 
walks of life who want to express their views on a bill aimed at 
ensuring a clear and straightforward referendum process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the real reason the Bloc Quebecois is asking for such 
measures? I know the only reason is to try to win the support of 
Quebecers and other Canadians. The Bloc Quebecois wants to delay 
the process as much as it can, hoping the public will strongly 
oppose the bill. From the very beginning, the Bloc laid its 
cards on the table and showed that it intended to delay the 
adoption of the bill as long as possible. That is the real 
purpose of this motion. In these circumstances, one can easily 
understand that our government cannot support such a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us look at the bill itself and its purpose. The purpose 
of the bill that was introduced is, and I quote, “to give effect 
to the requirement for clarity set out in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference”. And 
if there is word on which the court insists, it is certainly the 
word clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clarity is the basis of any democratic process. People must be 
able to understand the impact and the consequences of their 
action when they express their will. As for governments, they 
must be sure of the mandate given to them. Therefore, it is 
important that the issues at stake in a referendum be clear to 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the court reminded us, it is the role of political actors to 
ensure this requirement for clarity is met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being criticized for allegedly interfering in the 
referendum process of the PQ government. 
On this side of the House, we far prefer no referendum be held 
since this sort of debate simply sets people against one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the PQ government keeps repeating, through Premier 
Bouchard and the minister of Canadian intergovernmental affairs, 
Joseph Facal, that such a referendum will be held during the 
present term.  Mr. Facal, my colleague in Laval, was very clear 
in his remarks, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind, there is positively no doubt.  I work every day and 
with every ounce of energy to have the winning referendum on 
sovereignty held in this term. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, if a referendum on sovereignty were to be held, we 
think the question to be asked must be clear and that Canada 
cannot be broken up without a clear majority of the people of a 
province choosing secession, expressing clearly its desire for 
the province to cease being a part of Canada.  This is 
self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a little time on the need for a clear 
question.  If the justices of the supreme court insisted on this 
so much, they had a reason for doing so.  They understood that 
the break-up of a democratic country is a matter of the utmost 
gravity, as the bill states, that a country must not be broken 
up in confusion.  The vote must faithfully reflect the will of 
the voters to have their province cease to be a part of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Québec has made public its proposal to 
negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the 
equality of nations; this agreement would enable Québec to 
acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and 
establish relations abroad—in other words, sovereignty—and at the 
same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association 
including a common currency; no change in political status 
resulting from these negotiations will be effected without 
approval by the people through another referendum; on these 
terms,— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here comes the question, at last. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—do you give the Government of Québec the mandate to negotiate 
the proposed agreement between Québec and Canada? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of my colleagues will recognize that as the 1980 referendum 
question.  I do not believe that everyone will acknowledge that 
it was very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the 1995 question, it read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign, after having 
made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political 
partnership, within the scope of the bill respecting the future 
of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That one was the question with the partnership project, which 
Mr. Bouchard was later to describe as a skeleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in 1980, the 1995 question was not clear, and there is one 
very convincing way to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll carried out just before the October 30, 1995 referendum 
indicated that 80% of Quebecers proposing to vote yes believed 
that, if the yes side were to win, Quebec would continue to use 
the Canadian dollar; close to 80% believed that economic ties 
with Canada would remain unchanged; 50% believed that they would 
continue to use Canada passports; and 25% believed that Quebec 
would continue to elect members of the Canadian Parliament. 
Moreover, another poll informed us that nearly one backer of the 
yes in five believed that a sovereign Quebec could remain a 
province of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the truth on the so-called clarity of the 1995 
question. 
Let me remind those who might still not be convinced of the 
ambiguity of that referendum process of a statement made by 
Jacques Parizeau in an open letter published last year in the 
daily <I>Le Devoir</I>. Mr. Parizeau wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often been told that the 1995 question was not clear. It 
is true, as I often pointed out, that the question I would have 
wanted to ask was: Do you want Quebec to become a sovereign (or 
independent) country as of—? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders why Mr. Parizeau did not want to be so direct when he 
was Premier of Quebec and leader of the yes side. But this is 
not an issue I want to discuss today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Mr. Parizeau's successor provided us with an interesting 
element of answer. On October 19, Lucien Bouchard suggested that 
the notion of partnership was supported by 7% or 8% more people 
and that, therefore, one should think twice before taking a more 
radical stance. They are not being honest and direct when they 
play with words like that in order to get Quebecers to agree to 
achieve independence, which they have not agreed to twice 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has a duty not to undertake any negotiations that 
might lead to the separation of a province, unless the voters of 
that province clearly and democratically state that they want 
their province to secede from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatists usually refute our objections regarding the lack 
of clarity of the referendum questions by saying that we think 
Quebecers are unable to understand what is at stake. 
This is a rather dramatic display of cynicism and contempt. Let 
me simply say, in response to that groundless accusation, that 
it is because we respect Quebecers and the citizens of all the 
provinces that we want to ensure that any referendum question 
put to them is clear and void of any ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I am opposed to the motion 
tabled by the Bloc Quebecois leader.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when my 
colleague talks about the referendum question and about 
Mr. Parizeau, she is insulting me and she is insulting the people 
of Quebec. If somebody has ever been clear in his life, it is 
Mr. Parizeau. And I pay tribute to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the 1980 question, Mr. Trudeau, then Prime 
Minister of Canada, had told Mr. Chrétien a week earlier “If we 
win the referendum, it is fine. If we loose, I will ask all the 
ministers from Quebec to resign”. That is what Trudeau said one 
week before the referendum.  This means that, for him, the 
question was very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they want to subdue Quebec. Once again, they want to quash 
us. My colleague talks about clarity; I want to ask her a 
question and I hope that she can answer very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will she recognize a result of 50% plus one? Because this is 
how it works in a democracy. If she is not prepared to recognize 
50% plus one, what would be the required percentage then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to reply to 
the comments made by the hon. member for Matapédia—Matane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I will answer a question that he did not ask, but 
that is still a question for me. He said he was insulted by the 
comments I made about Mr. Parizeau. In reply to that, I say that 
I was only quoting the exact words the former Quebec Premier had 
used, as reported in <I>Le Devoir</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is so insulted by what the former Prime 
Minister of 
Canada, I would ask him this: Why did the Parti Quebecois ask 
for Mr. Parizeau's resignation immediately following the 
referendum? Because Mr. Parizeau had insulted Quebecers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the member opposite a question.  Let 
us say, for the sake of it, that Quebec holds another referendum 
with a clear question, and with a clear majority Quebec wins. 
Then we would have to go through secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would negotiate for Canada?  Before the members stands, I 
want to remind her of something.  The Prime Minister, at least 10 
of his cabinet ministers and all of the MPs who come from Quebec, 
under the Geneva Convention, the United Nations and international 
law are not bound by law to negotiate for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would negotiate for Canada then? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer that 
question. First of all, I apologize for answering in French, but 
it is my mother tongue. I can express myself much better in 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Since when do we have to apologize for speaking French in this 
House? How totally colonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order. The hon. 
member may say what she wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to answer the 
question. It is because I respect both official languages, and 
my hon. colleague spoke to me in the other official language, 
and I feel I have a responsibility, in order to respect both 
languages, to answer him in his language. Sadly, I do not speak 
that language well enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, let us come back to the question. My hon. 
colleague asked the question “If Quebec wins”. For my part, I 
say that, in 1995, when Quebecers said that they wanted to stay 
within the Canadian Confederation, Quebec won. That is what 
happens when Quebec wins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I would like to answer the first question of my hon. 
colleague on figures. I would like to mention Quebec's caisses 
populaires.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is more important for Quebecers, men and women, than the 
caisses populaires. It is a success story for Quebec. The 
caisses populaires, which are now merging need, in order to 
merge, not 50% plus one, but 65% and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Who will negotiate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> This is further evidence of the fact that 
even among Quebecers, in all activities, 50% plus one is 
unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to split my time with my colleague for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to read the motion proposed today by the 
Bloc Quebecois. This motion says— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. We can hardly hear the hon. 
member who has the floor. I hope that all the members will 
remain quiet during the speech by the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona, to whom I am giving the floor once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Legislative Committee on Bill C-20, 
an Act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out 
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
secession Reference, to hold public hearings in all regions of 
Quebec and Canada so as to hear as many witnesses having an 
interest in the Bill as possible, that the hearings be broadcast 
and that the Committee be given sufficient resources to hold 
such hearings, all in accordance with the rules and practices of 
the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to Bill C-20, the motion proposed by the Bloc today is 
very clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some of the comments we heard earlier 
from the hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister.  He spoke 
quite eloquently and quite passionately about his concern about 
what the law addressed when it came to pulling the country apart. 
He felt that his party was standing in the House defending 
democracy, while the Bloc on the other hand was not, and in the 
process of dealing with this law was adding clarity to something 
he felt was very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However on reading this motion it seems that the Bloc is very 
concerned about pushing ahead with the idea of democracy in the 
House and extending it to a very important part of the committee 
procedure of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fears many of us have had in dealing with this 
important legislation, as my hon. colleague mentioned, is that we 
are not giving enough time to deal with an issue that affects all 
of us in Canada, no matter what the result would be of a 
potential referendum to secede from the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with the issue does not only apply to one region. My 
colleagues in the Bloc have said that as well.  If the law sets a 
precedent we know that in the future there could be other regions 
of the country that may well go through the same process of 
referendums to secede from the country.  I hope not, but in the 
event that it happens we need to hear from Canadians across the 
country about what they might feel should be added to the law or 
what they might feel is missing from the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we get as many Canadians as possible involved in this 
issue which, as my colleague mentioned, is one of the most 
important issues that we face in the country?  In speaking 
passionately about the hon. member's feelings for democracy and 
about democracy in this place, I was very shocked to hear him 
disagree with the motion and say that the committee should not be 
allowed to travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the committee with two of my colleagues in the official 
opposition.  So far we have unfortunately seen a very 
disorganized committee.  We have seen the committee propose to 
hear from 45 witnesses in the span of a week.  Because of the 
time allowed to notify the witnesses to come to Ottawa, some of 
them will not have a chance to make it. 
How is that participation in democracy?  How is that including 
Canadians from across the country?

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member were serious about his comments on democracy 
and serious about his love for this country, he would not be 
scared to have Canadians from coast to coast join in debating a 
particular law as I aforementioned that is of paramount 
importance to almost all Canadians.  This is the irony of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the parliamentary secretary his belief in 
democracy and his commitment to democracy.  We have seen in the 
House the most time allocation motions put forward by any 
government in our history.  We have had restrictions on debate. 
We have had restrictions on trying to allow democracy to unfold 
in the country.  The government is at the root of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary flatly rejects the idea of putting 
forward a simple motion on an issue that is so important to 
Canadians, that of giving the committee the ability to travel and 
hear from Canadians across the country.  Where is his commitment 
to democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the root of the motion today comes from Bill 
C-20 which is supposed to add clarity to the idea of a question 
being formed on the issue of a referendum but also clarity 
surrounding majority as it pertains to a referendum.  When I talk 
to my colleagues across the country I know many of them feel they 
would like to see some issues addressed in the bill that have not 
been addressed thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have continuously raised one of these issues.  My colleague, 
the parliamentary secretary, correctly pointed out that the 
official opposition wants to know what will constitute a clear 
majority in the bill.  We have proposed our solution.  We have 
discussed the idea of 50 plus one, a standard in democracy that 
is accepted around the world in other modern democracies.  We 
know there are some concerns in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like the government to make clear where it plans to go 
on the important question of what it will respect in the event of 
a referendum vote.  Will it change the bar halfway through the 
game?  Will it alienate various Canadians in the process of 
making a decision on whether they want to stay in this country? 
These are important questions to which we still have no answers. 
There is not the clarity we would like to see in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Macleod has said, we support the bill 
in principle.  The Reform Party has been calling for clarity 
surrounding this issue far longer than the government. We would 
like to see these things outlined clearly.  We hope the committee 
process will be able to deal with some amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>   Exactly.  As my colleague from the 
Bloc has just said, what committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will rush through this procedure.  There has not been a time 
restriction put on the committee as yet, but half the 45 
witnesses scheduled have not appeared.  I am hoping the rest will 
be given the time allowed to come here.  How are we to deal with 
the issue seriously?  How are we to include the amendments to the 
bill required to make it satisfactory to the rest of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress once again that if the committee were allowed to travel 
as the Bloc is proposing, if it were allowed to go to different 
parts of the country, we would get a different view from 
Canadians of what they would like to see the government show in 
the area of leadership when it comes to national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government is afraid to start discussing these 
options because it has shown no leadership when it comes to 
vision, when it comes to how to make the country work better.  We 
in the official opposition have talked about it quite clearly. We 
have put forward what we feel Canada should do in order to make 
it work better.  Our proposals have been outlined in the new 
Canada Act.  We are not afraid to talk about this and put forward 
positive solutions to make this federation work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the government is satisfied with status quo 
federalism which most Canadians have rejected time and time 
again.  Canadians want more from their government.  They want 
leadership.  They want to see their country put aside alienation 
and differences and build on the strengths of diversity, the 
strengths the official opposition has outlined in the new Canada 
Act on how we can make our federation work better.

Canadians.  I hear they would like to see more leadership from 
the government.  That leadership could start with democracy in 
this place and democracy at the committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the motion put forward by the Bloc today, I hope the 
government will take seriously the idea of democracy in the 
committee, the idea of Canadians from across the country taking 
part in such an important issue, and give the opportunity for the 
committee to do its work in a pertinent fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave those comments with the government.  If as the 
parliamentary secretary said it is committed to democracy, I hope 
it will consider them.  We on the opposition side support the 
effort to try to make the work of the committee more democratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for his comments.  Let us see what we can do.  The purpose 
of this place is to debate ideas.  The purpose of this process is 
to try to come to a common understanding of how we might build 
better legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised the question that his party raised.  Is 50 
plus one a sufficient majority on which to make this decision? 
Three witnesses came before committee this morning, not the 
minister but constitutional experts from universities in Quebec, 
who argued very eloquently on that question.  The member was 
there and listened to the arguments put forward on why 50 plus 
one was not enough.  Is the member able to hear that, or does he 
feel he must support the first position put forward by his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  As he has correctly identified, we have only 
heard from three witnesses on this committee.  We have not had 
the chance to hear any opposing views.  For all that we could put 
on the record, maybe those witnesses were from the government 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the chance to invoke democracy as I talked about in 
this place and have the committee travel to different parts of 
the country, maybe then the hon. member would hear a different 
story from Canadians.  The fact of the matter is that many 
Canadians across the country actually endorse the position of the 
official opposition and the idea of 50 plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member to open his eyes and encourage democracy 
to work and Canadians to speak out.  Maybe he will hear the same 
message. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak in English in the House.  I do not 
need to excuse myself.  As a sovereignist it is useful to speak English 
for people who want a partnership with Canada.  I truly 
believe that will happen in the near future when Quebecers choose 
to opt for sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my colleague is to some extent a question I 
wanted to put to the parliamentary secretary.  We understand now 
that there are supposed to be 45 witnesses.  That is the quota 
that was given to our party.  This is unprecedented in the 
history of parliamentary democracy in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently only 23 witnesses have accepted.  The debate is 
supposed to last until next Tuesday.  Does my hon. colleague from 
Edmonton—Strathcona believe the work of the committee should be 
prolonged to hear at least those 45 witnesses and time should be 
allocated to hear more people?  Does he believe that the Liberal 
Party and the government want something like this to happen and 
want us to hear more witnesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc for his question.  To answer it very quickly, I do 
not believe the government is committed to hearing more witnesses 
or allowing this process to go forward.  It is trying to rush it 
through.  It is trying to rush the amount of witnesses through

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to have some of the other provincial 
representatives give their thoughts or give Canadians from 
different organizations across the country the chance to be heard 
on this legislation.  For many of them it is tough to come to 
Ottawa on such short notice.  That is why we should expand the 
ability of the committee to do better work and more work and to 
allow it to travel to hear from Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple request.  If the hon. parliamentary secretary 
were serious about his demands for democracy and commitment to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the member from the Reform Party will be 
brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just heard, the member is not happy with the way the 
committee work is going on the clarity bill.  He also stated that 
he is not happy with any majority higher than 50% plus one. I 
guess he believes in a majority of 50% plus one.  If that means 
that the hon. member has problems with half of the bill, why is 
he supporting the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I made it clear during my 
speech that in principle we are supporting the bill.  We are 
hoping that with responsible motions such as this Bloc motion the 
government will listen and actually put some democratic 
principles into the committee so that we can improve the 
legislation.  We are hoping that it will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For now I have made it clear and the opposition has made it 
clear that 50% plus one is a standard of democracy that we are 
willing to respect.  Let us challenge that and see what happens 
in the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the parliamentary secretary who 
is in charge of the process on the clarity bill has heard the 
comment and realizes the difficult position the government has 
put its allies in. Here we are trying to support the government 
in principle because we feel that clarity on this issue is 
required, yet the Liberal members carry on in committee in a 
fashion I have not seen in the seven years I have been in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat on six different committees and I have never seen the 
type of railroading that I saw when we tried to establish the 
principles upon which the committee would operate. The official 
opposition proposed a motion requesting travel.  Knowing the 
importance of the issue and the inability of Canadians to take 
part in that discussion other than through the committee process, 
we thought it was important that the committee that has been 
established to look at Bill C-20 travel across the country to all 
regions to allow Canadians to participate in this most important 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people who are watching these proceedings, the Liberal 
members of the committee defeated that motion. They felt that 
they did not want to travel to bring this issue before Canadians. 
I am not sure what the Liberal members are concerned about.  I 
am not sure what they are afraid of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they owe it to Canadians to open this discussion because 
it concerns each and every one of us. For those who think this is 
only an issue between one province and the federal government, 
they are mistaken.  This issue concerns every single Canadian. 
The government has put the official opposition and others who 
want to support it in a very difficult position by treating the 
committee with such disrespect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get the feeling that the government is reacting.  We 
questioned the timing of Bill C-20. It appears to me even more so 
after the committee hearing that the government is knee-jerk 
reacting to a situation and for its own agenda it chose to pick 
this point in time to throw the bill on the table, limit 
discussion and hope it quickly gets through and no one will even 
notice it. It is very similar to the knee-jerk reaction the 
government had after the 1995 referendum.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone in the House remember the government's Motion No. 
26?  No, because it zipped through here so quickly.  It is the 
one that recognized distinct society.  How about Bill C-110? 
Does anyone here remember that bill?  No, because it zipped 
through the House so quickly.  It is the one that gave regional 
areas in the country a veto.  Did Canadians get a chance to 
debate, to discuss, to give any attention to those issue? 
Absolutely not. There was not even a committee formed to discuss 
those very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are one more time.  The government is throwing in a bill 
at an inappropriate time to talk about an issue that it does not 
want to talk about with anybody other than a handful of its own 
people who agree with it.  Canadians deserve more than that. 
Canadians deserve something that is much better and something 
that is much more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the principle and the concept of the bill.  As has 
been said by my hon. colleagues, the official opposition brought 
up the issue of clarity five years ago, the need to be clear 
about what it means to Canada to have one of its provinces 
secede.  We brought up the issue that there has to be clarity on 
what numbers are required.  Whether it is 50% plus one, 65% or 
75%, we have to be very clear about what the measurement is. Does 
the bill do it?  Not really.  It does not outline what a clear 
question is going to be and it certainly does not clearly outline 
what number is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members seem to take exception when we argue that 50% 
plus one is the accepted line.  There have been two referendums 
on the separation of Quebec and on both occasions it was 50% plus 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government that if the Liberals have a problem with 
50% plus one, they should ask the person who wrote the 
Constitution Act, 1982, the repatriation of the BNA act, an 
individual who happens to have sat on that side of the House, why 
the number was not changed when there was an opportunity to do 
so.  If 50% plus one is not acceptable, why did they not change 
it when they had the opportunity to do so?  Why did they not 
state the number that would be required? The constitution is 
silent on this issue.  There is no mention of any other number. 
The accepted majority around the world is 50% plus one.  If the 
government does not like that, then it should have taken the 
opportunity to change it when it had the chance in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the issue of travelling and communicating 
with Canadians.  I had the opportunity to participate in the 
British Columbia unity debate and the British Columbia unity 
panel.  The Government of British Columbia took it upon itself 
when we were dealing with the Calgary declaration, the question 
of unity and of trying to keep the country together, to 
communicate with the people of its province.  It did not worry 
about time.  It did not worry about costs.  It worried about 
communicating with the people so that the people understood what 
the issues were and they had a chance to give their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in that and travelled to every corner of British 
Columbia.  I listened to the people of British Columbia, not the 
politicians and the business community but a collection of all of 
those people.  It gave me a much greater understanding of what 
being a Canadian means to each and every one of us and how 
important that issue is to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do a great disservice when we eliminate Canadians from the 
process that is happening today. We do not gain anything by 
excluding Canadians from the dialogue that is taking place.  I 
understand even the people who are most interested in it cannot 
gather themselves quickly enough to appear before the committee. 
It is understandable when they are given one day, 24 hours 
notice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the kind of subject matter on which somebody can get 
a phone call the night before to appear before a committee the 
next morning. How do we expect the Canadian public to participate 
in this process if the people who are most interested in it 
cannot be prepared to speak? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government has a hidden agenda and I am not sure 
what it is.  I am not sure why the Liberals are afraid to talk to 
Canadians on this issue.  If they really want support and do not 
want to face another 1995 situation where they are on one side 
and everybody else is on the other, if they lose the opportunity 
to have this communication with Canadians and understand what 
Canadians are feeling, then they are not going to be ready when 
the time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government owes it to Canadians to open up the committee 
process to travel and hear what Canadians have to say and how 
they feel.  The government owes it to Canadians to give it the 
time that is required.  I am not sure why the Liberals think it 
has to be finished in seven days.  They sat on it for two months. 
This bill was introduced two months ago and a good deal of 
travel could have been done in that period of time. I do not know 
why they think they have only seven days to get it through the 
House.  The government has used time allocation to limit debate 
in the House and now the committee is being shut down. 
Limitations are being put on the committee. I have been on six 
different committees and I have never seen this kind of abuse of 
democracy and parliamentary process in my life.

but I have been hearing so much rubbish I want to be on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be told the reality which is that we have been 
debating this issue for 40 years.  In the years I have been here 
we have been doing nothing but accommodating the separatists. We 
have bent over backward and for the life of me I cannot figure 
out why the Reform Party wants to continue this debate. Canadians 
are fed up with this debate.  This debate with the separatists 
has cost this country billions of dollars.  It has affected our 
exchange.  It has affected investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  This is a democracy.

I am not finished.  No one interrupted the separatists all 
afternoon but when I get up to remind Canadians that we have been 
debating this, we have had two referendums, the Reform Party will 
not let me speak.  This is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think debating this issue for 40 years is a 
long enough debate?  It is time to bury it, put it to bed and get 
on with building Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only amazing thing I 
have heard from the member across the way is that if he thinks 
the debate that has been going on for 40 years is going to end, 
then I do not know what he is smoking.  The bill does not clarify 
anything. If the member has been debating it for 40 years, then 
why can he or the government not come up with the number that is 
required to pass this legislation? After 40 years what is the 
magic number?  What is the number?

Speaker, it is not that I want to criticize, but Reform members 
have spoken all day.  They say that they do not agree with a 
majority higher than 50% plus one.  The member who spoke a while 
ago said that there is no clarity about this question.  They said 
that they were not satisfied with the amount of work that has 
gone on in committee.  There is nothing in this bill that they 
are satisfied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Reform Party supporting a bill that it does not like? 
It is as simple as that.  It is not a matter of principle; it is 
a matter of values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for

to give a very good reason— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The present member speaking from the government side and 
the previous member from the Progressive Conservatives have 
referred to the number of individuals in the House of Commons.  I 
do not believe that is in keeping with the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Wentworth—Burlington referred to the general House, which is 
done often, without referring to a specific member.  The member 
for Tobique—Mactaquac, at the Chair's invitation, because the 
member was called away, had the floor to express his comments. 
Both were in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact I congratulated 
both parties, the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois, on having so 
many members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that anyone in the House can be a more committed 
federalist than I am.  I very much appreciate the contribution 
that Bloc Quebecois members have made in the Chamber over the 
years that I have known them.  Nevertheless, I am very much a 
federalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to take you back to 1995 and the 
so-called referendum crisis, from our side, and what occurred at 
that time leading up to that question, to the actual referendum. 
We in the backbenches of the Liberal Party were assured that it 
looked as though it would be an easy win for the no side, which 
was the federalist side.  What happened was, it was a very 
narrow, close race.  Members will remember that there was a 
margin of only 50,000 votes on the no side that rejected the 
proposed question put by the Parti Quebecois.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aftermath—and I tell this to my Bloc colleagues—in the 
Liberal caucus of which I was a part, we were in shock.  We were 
absolutely devastated because it appeared that we had nearly lost 
our side.  No matter what the Bloc says, it was a terribly 
emotional experience to feel that we may have lost our country 
based on what turned out to be a terribly ambiguous question, 
from my point of view.  It turned out to be a very narrow margin. 
Indeed, being 50% plus one, we could have lost the entire 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members, just in passing, of the actual text of that 
question.  That question which we agonized over read:  “Do you 
agree that Quebec should become sovereign after having made a 
formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political 
partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of 
Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were appalled that our government could have taken us that 
close to the abyss without ensuring that a clearer question, a 
real question, had been on the table.  In caucus government 
members constantly talked about how narrow an experience it had 
been for Canada and how Canada would have had to negotiate and if 
we had lost by a margin of 60,000 votes Canada would have had to 
negotiate the separation of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got up in my national caucus and I said in front of the Prime 
Minister “Do not talk about Canada having to negotiate on a 
question like this”, if we had lost that referendum, “talk 
about the government having to negotiate because”, I said in 
national caucus at that time, “if my government ever lost a 
referendum on such an unclear question, the first thing that 
would happen is there would be a vote of confidence”, because I 
would never agree, as a Canadian, as an MP, to negotiate the 
breakup of a country based on such an unclear question.  There 
would have been a vote of confidence.  We could not have accepted 
it.  There would have been a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very much behind getting a clear question and very much 
behind the clarity bill as we see it now, because what the 
clarity bill does, what it simply does, is it binds future 
governments to be responsible for ensuring that before they even 
begin negotiating they have to consult parliament and parliament 
has to decide whether the question is clear.  The reason I 
believe my Bloc Quebecois colleagues should support Bill C-20 is 
because, in the end, if there ever were a clear question that was 
agreed upon by this parliament, I, in the interests of civil 
society, would have to go along with negotiations.  But so long 
as there is an unclear question I could never abide by it.  I 
would always be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have a clear question.  We have to have a majority 
that I, as a federalist, accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem became this.  As it was realized in the years that 
followed, at least realized by some on the back bench, the real 
problem was not with the federal Liberals, because by that time 
it was very clear in our caucus that it had to be a clear 
question and it had to be a decent or clear majority.  What 
became clear was that if in the event the Conservatives came to 
power or the Reform Party came to power, we know that Joe Clark 
would have accepted an unclear question and begun negotiations 
and we know from his own mouth that the Leader of the Opposition 
would accept a thin majority and carry on to negotiations to 
break up the country.  The question is how to confine future 
governments that are willing to trade off this great nation on 
such a thin margin; how to confine them to the will of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 does that.  It does not set conditions on the 
questions.  It does not set conditions on the majority.  What it 
says simply in clause 1(6) and clause 2(4) is that before any of 
the governments of the future can negotiate the breakup of the 
this country parliament has to approve by free vote—one vote, 
one MP—the nature of the question and the nature of the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly a situation where it is parliament restraining the 
power of future governments.  This issue is between parliament 
and governments. 
It is not between the provinces.  It is not between all the 
special interest groups out there.

witnesses, because this is between the entire 301 MPs and future 
governments of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government was right in putting it to a legislative 
committee, because clearly there was no other standing committee 
that could possibly have the jurisdiction over a question like 
this.  It cannot be sent to government operations, the justice 
committee, or any other committee.  There is only one committee, 
and it had to be a committee of these MPs, and so it is before 
that committee now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why Reform Party members are standing up and 
saying “We have to bring in the provinces.  We have to bring in 
all these special interests groups”, when this is entirely an 
issue, and I stress this, between the House of Commons, all the 
MPs assembled, and the government of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if ever the day comes, and I hope it never does 
come, that the Bloc Quebecois can mobilize enough support in the 
House with a free vote on a question that it thinks contributes 
to secession, I would have to support it, but only if it is a 
clear question, and I have a free vote, and I can act on behalf 
of the Canadians I represent.

That is what they have trouble getting into their heads.  He 
tells us that the caucus was, as he said in English, “shocked”. 
Shocked indeed, they ought to have woken up earlier, because on 
the eve of the referendum, the Prime Minister had said that the 
question was clear and that it was irreversible.  They did not 
have enough brains among the bunch of them to realize that the 
question was clear.

us somewhere.  It will, into a dead end, into a confrontation.

want to dwell too much on the past. However, I find it rather 
strange to hear about clarity in procedure and respect for the 
rules coming from a member who very recently altered a bill 
after a number of members in this House had signed it. It is a 
bit strange. This is not what I call very democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people say the 1995 question was not clear, they are dead 
wrong. The concept of Quebec's independence, in its modern form, 
started in 1960 with the RIN. The Parti Quebecois was created in 
1968. I was born in 1970. Quebec's sovereignty was being debated 
well before my time. And people believe that Quebecers, whether 
they voted yes or not, do not know what we are talking about. 
This shows a lack of respect. 
This shows arrogance towards all Quebecers, the 93% who voted in 
the 1995 referendum, whether they voted yes or no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple. Does the member, who knows how 
things works and who knows full well that Liberal backbenchers 
have no power, not believe that giving the federal parliament, 
this House, the authority to determine what is clear and what is 
not means that parliament will decide? In other words, the 
Liberal majority will decide.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  But there is a problem with clarity, Mr. 
Speaker.  I distinctly said that what is happening here is we are 
taking the issue of the clarity of the question away from 
government and giving it to every member of the House of Commons, 
everyone, the Bloc Quebecois included.  It is a decision for all 
MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I will not be confined by party 
discipline on an issue of whether a question or a majority is 
enough to break up the country.  One of the reasons why I am 
afraid of the Conservative Party and I am afraid of the Reform 
Party in the future is that if they ever did acquire power I 
would be afraid that they would have enough party discipline in 
order to accept a question that was unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This way future governments will be required to undertake a free 
vote in this parliament before any government can negotiate 
separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I am sure my colleagues would be willing to give their unanimous 
consent so my colleague can ask a question to the eloquent 
Liberal member, who showed us in spectacular fashion that 
federalism is leading us nowhere. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the House give 
unanimous consent to extend time for three minutes to provide for 
one more question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for allowing me 
to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning, I was in Sept-Îles, in Quebec. I could have 
been in Rivière-du-Loup, or Rimouski, or elsewhere. Since the 
member would like so much to understand what is going on, I 
would like to ask him why he does not tell the House that it 
would be interesting if the committee could travel to listen to 
what Quebecers have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to come and listen to what Quebecers have to 
say when they are being told that a question that basically 
focuses on a mandate to negotiate will not be allowed. I would 
also like him to come and listen to what Quebecers have to say 
when they read in the bill that a question that envisages 
economic or political arrangements with Canada will not be 
allowed either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member realize that this bill belittles the Quebec 
National Assembly, the only parliament where Quebecers have a 
majority and always will? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I would actually submit that clause 3 of 
the bill is a hollow clause.  It really does not commit the 
government to do anything other than to consult, which would 
happen normally anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of this whole issue, and the reason I do not 
think we have to seek witnesses outside the House, is that we are 
really discussing an internal parliamentary democracy issue. The 
reason I love this bill actually is that it is one of the few 
instances where parliament has actually seized control and is 
eliminating the power of the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the terrible things that has occurred over the years and 
I think got us into a lot of trouble with the Charlottetown 
accord, the Mulroney years and even the Trudeau years, is that 
the executive branch of government, the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet, had too much power.  Now we have an instance where 
parliament is actually taking some of that power back.  I think 
it is a very positive thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is impossible for the Bloc Quebecois to rally 
more sovereignty support, perhaps not separatism support, but 
sovereignty support.  We see the Reform Party in the House today 
that is very much in favour of decentralization and more power to 
the provinces.  We know that has been the tradition of the 
Conservatives for a very long time.  We also see that the 
Conservatives are in fact supporting the Bloc Quebecois on this 
particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So theoretically it is possible in this place for us as MPs on 
all sides of the House to change the nature of the country. 
But it is an internal problem.  It exists in this House.  It does 
not exist in the provinces.  It exists between all MPs versus, in 
many instances, the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak to this debate at this point.  As 
we can see and hear, it is at the request of the Bloc Quebecois 
as well as of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rather painful debate, because it is based ultimately 
on the assumption of a desire by Quebec to separate and the 
negotiations that could follow.  It is very painful because, in 
my opinion, it would be a step backwards for Canada and Quebec. 
It would also plunge the people of Quebec and Canada into 
problems we have no idea how to resolve.  It is also very 
painful because the people of Quebec are less than ever 
interested in the option of the people opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the remarks made in the fall by the Quebec Premier and by 
Minister Facal, who were continuously threatening to hold a 
referendum during their current mandate, our government has 
decided to bring the matter out in the open. Even though it is 
painful, even though this time could be given to other 
priorities, this is a debate that was forced on us and one that 
had to be held because it is useful for everyone now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I heard the leader of the Bloc Quebecois setting 
himself up as the sole champion of Quebecers, saying “Quebec 
does not want Bill C-20”.  He was talking about Quebec, its 
separation, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the Bloc Quebecois that it is an election and 
even a referendum behind.  In Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, the Bloc 
Quebecois was defeated in the latest election by 7,600 votes. 
This was the case in Bourassa, in the northeastern part of the 
island of Montreal, as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the Bloc Quebecois tend to say “Yes, but there are 
the English. 
You were elected where there are anglophones”.  For them, votes 
are not equivalent in ridings if there are a lot of allophones 
or anglophones.  In both Bourassa and Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, 
there cannot be more than 1,000 people of anglophone origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Mercier and Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, neighbouring ridings, Bloc 
Quebecois members were elected, but with a majority of 10,000 
votes fewer than before.  In Québec, the Bloc Quebecois had 
500,000 votes fewer than last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the referendum was in 1995.  As the 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With due respect to my colleague, when he said I had 10,000 
fewer votes than previously, he lied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member may have been mistaken. If 
this is the case, this is not a point of order, this is a point 
of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> It was 10,000 fewer votes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had the wrong numbers he should withdraw his 
words now. If not—

Quebec. Liberal members from Quebec can represent those 
Quebecers who do not want a referendum and do not want 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is talking about a travelling committee. If 
we were cynical, we would have accepted its proposal. We would

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> The leader of the Parti Quebecois had an

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois members are 
yelling, as you can hear, and they are desperate, because they 
do not like clarity. It scares them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the national assembly in 1995 when the Quebec 
Liberal Party tried to have the Parti Quebecois say clearly that the 
referendum vote would be about the creation of a new country 
but the amendment was defeated. These paragons of clarity 
refused to say that they wanted to have a brand new country. 
They hid behind the June 12 agreement and had Quebecers vote on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> It was not an agreement with Canada, but 
with the Action démocratique under Mario Dumont. The referendum 
question was on that agreement. 
These people are afraid of clarity. Their leader, Parizeau, 
spent the whole summer saying he wanted to trap Quebecers like 
lobsters, and use lots of tricks and tactics to confuse people. 
Parizeau was even ready to make a unilateral declaration of 
independence after he had refused to use the word country in the 
referendum question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> These paragons of clarity keep talking about 
self determination. We all accept the principle of self determination. But a 
unilateral decision is not the way. One just does not get out of 
a country like one gets out of a shopping centre. They do not 
accept that Quebec self determination is counterbalanced by 
other things. They do not recognize the heritage we share with 
all Canadians, our common history, our economic and social 
links. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that does not count. They just want to have a vote and get 
out. It does no work that way; not in a co-operative, not in a 
marriage, not in a workers' union and not in a professional 
association.  These people are irresponsible.  They want to 
restructure the partnership with Canada.  The member for 
Joliette said “We want to rebuild Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> They have no respect whatsoever for the 
partnership forged throughout our common history. These people 
are in a state of total disarray and they want to hide it with 
shouts and insults. They deny that the rest of Canada has any 
interest in the issue.  For them, the approach is unilateral 
“Hello, thank you, we are leaving”. Even separatist Quebecers 
have no right to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Their problem is that their option has lost 
all or most of its supporters. 
Parizeau said these people were the spearhead, but the spear has 
separated from the head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> They are guided by Parizeau, who is pushing 
them towards independence and they talk about rebuilding Canada 
with a new partnership.  This option is totally illogical and 
the people of Quebec see it quite well— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the member, but the

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>VETERANS HEALTH CARE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK241">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
institute national standards for veterans health care with 
maintenance and special needs provisions, and have these 
standards agreed upon by all provinces before devolving 
responsibilities to any province for any portion of care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 13. 
I will repeat the motion because it is very important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
institute national standards for veterans health care with 
maintenance and special needs provisions, and have these 
standards agreed upon by all provinces before devolving 
responsibilities to any province for any portion of care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic concern behind the motion is that the federal 
government has been too quick to rid itself of its health care 
responsibilities for veterans by devolving responsibility to the 
provinces, and that further devolution of responsibility for our 
veterans' health care should be reviewed with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government used to fulfill its responsibilities to veterans 
through a federally funded and administered regime of military 
hospitals and veterans homes. Over the last several years many of 
these hospitals and homes have become the responsibility of 
provincial governments and subject to provincial standards of 
health care.  Yet the provinces are often in the midst of their 
own cost cutting initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visited many health care facilities for veterans 
throughout Canada.  I have seen firsthand the effects of 
downloading and consolidation.  I have spoken to veterans who 
have been left to sit in wet and soiled diapers for the better 
part of a day due to staff shortages and institutional 
indifference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those military veterans who are sick and disabled are subject to 
two government imposed hardships:  standards of health care which 
are no longer consistent across the country and growing erosion 
in the quality of veterans health care.  A further hardship to 
which our veterans are exposed is the indifference of the active 
military to the health care concerns of recently discharged 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, Colonel Joe Sharpe released the report of his 
board of inquiry into the health care of our peacekeeping 
veterans in Croatia.  He described the Canadian military's care 
of sick peacekeepers from Croatia as disgraceful.  His chilling 
comment was that the military showed more care and concern for 
its airplanes than for the sick veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our veterans do not have access to military standards of 
health care either because the health care responsibilities have 
already been devolved to particular provinces, or because a 
disbelieving military, fearful of being seen to favour large 
numbers of disability claims, denies at the outset that the 
veteran's health problems relate in any way to his or her term of 
military service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearing loss from the sound of artillery, cancers as a result of 
exposure to radioactive toxins in the theatre of war, and 
psychiatric challenges as a result of exposure to the carnage and 
inhumanity of war are examples of very different conditions 
experienced by our veterans from those experienced by the 
civilian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political leaders make sure that those whom they send to 
theatres of war are completely healthy and they do not arrive at 
a battlefield with disabilities.  Our healthy men then return 
changed by war.  Some are damaged physically.  Others are damaged 
psychiatrically.  Some return with mysterious but persistent 
ailments for which there is no identified cause and for which 
there is no clear cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our veterans should not be subject to civilian levels of health 
care since their exposures to the theatres of war are far from 
being the normal civilian experiences of most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ste. Anne de Bellevue military hospital outside Montreal 
provides long term care to veterans.  The hospital is currently 
in a limbo status in terms of its proposed devolution to the 
province of Quebec.  The Quebec government, while having the 
right to act to effect the devolution from the federal 
government, has not yet done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The veterans who are cared for in this institution plus their 
many supporters prefer that the hospital remain under the 
jurisdiction of veterans affairs rather than the responsibility 
being devolved to the province. Veterans are concerned that they 
will be subject to a lower standard of care if the hospital is 
administered by the province of Quebec.  Veterans are also 
concerned that they will lose service if their first language is 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this hospital were to be devolved to Quebec, there is fear 
that no Canadian flag would be permitted to fly there if the 
recent policy resolutions of the Parti Quebecois on flag 
management were to be implemented, specifically that no Canadian 
flag be permitted to fly in front of any building under Quebec 
jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons alone, quality of health care plus potential 
effects of separatist politics, I suggest that further devolution 
to the provinces of health care responsibilities for our veterans 
should be viewed with extreme caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A growing number of veterans who return from contemporary 
theatres of war with unexplained ailments are more likely to be 
regarded as malingerers by their military superiors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louise Richard, a military nurse in the gulf war, comes from a 
family with a famed military history.  Her father was a general 
in the Royal 22nd Regiment, the Van Doos.  She returned from the 
gulf suffering from multiple ailments including tuberculosis, 
chronic fatigue, blurred vision and severe pain in her muscles 
and joints. Her appeals to the military were met with scepticism. 
Post-traumatic stress indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Captain Terry Riordon had 23 years of military service. He went 
to the gulf war and returned with multiple disabilities which 
were categorized by the military as merely epilepsy or psychosis. 
At the time of his death nine years after his gulf war service, 
tests showed that his body contained depleted uranium.  Captain 
Riordon was exposed to depleted uranium during his service and 
now he is dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite their claims to the contrary, Canadian military leaders 
clearly knew there was something seriously wrong with Captain 
Riordon's health. After his death, his body was medically defined 
in Canada as contagious and then taped shut in an orange toxic 
bag. Post-traumatic stress again. Captain Riordon's wife had 
asked the Canadian military to do a tissue analysis but they 
refused.  She turned to U.S. researchers for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other veterans who have become ill after having returned from 
recent peacekeeping arrangements have indicated that they also 
want to be tested for the presence of depleted uranium in their 
systems, but the military says that such tests prove nothing 
since depleted uranium is not harmful.  What the military fails 
to acknowledge is that depleted uranium outside one's body has 
very different effects than uranium particles that are ingested 
in a theatre of war.  In such circumstances I have been advised 
that the inner body acts like an open sore permitting the 
radioactive effects of depleted uranium to directly affect cells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as opposition critic for veterans affairs, I have 
proposed that an annual medical assessment be made available to 
any member or veteran of our armed forces who requests it so that 
no one would be compelled to wait for the results of tissue 
sample tests in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of the military who has reason to believe that he or 
she is exposed to toxins in a theatre of conflict would have a 
legal right to a determination of the nature and extent of such 
exposure.  Such procedures would also facilitate annual 
documentation of developments of physical ailments and ongoing 
effects of environmental exposures which would assist in future 
health and disability assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It defies logic that so many returning soldiers could all be 
categorized as suffering from stress related illnesses.  This is 
the case with many of the disability claims resulting from 
service in Croatia, including that of Colonel Matt Stopford.  To 
say that these claimants are suffering from some form of 
post-traumatic stress does grave disservice to the bravery of 
these men and women.  Any categorization of the illnesses of 
these soldiers as resulting from a nervous condition castigates 
all soldiers as potential malingerers even though many are career 
oriented soldiers with distinguished military careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When soldiers bound for Rwanda raised questions concerning the 
effects of anthrax vaccine and its relationship to gulf war 
syndrome, they were compelled to take the vaccine under threat of 
court martial.  Such is the case of former Sergeant Michael 
Kipling whose court martial has commenced in Winnipeg this week 
despite his resignation from the military. The military 
relentlessly and shamelessly hounds Kipling through the courts to 
this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some illnesses defy medical categorization based on the current 
state of medical knowledge.  The gulf war syndrome is suspected 
to be caused by the anthrax vaccine or more likely by exposure to 
depleted uranium.  It may be caused by both.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the cause, our soldiers are returning from these 
theatres of war with very serious illnesses and reportedly high 
levels of radioactivity in their bodies.  Their claims for 
assistance must be given the benefit of the doubt and not have 
doubts cast upon them through the insult of categorizing most 
such problems as stress related. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House is one step toward more formal 
recognition that throughout their career and afterward the men 
and women of our military bravely face experiences that most of 
us do not.  Their bravery, when face to face with the dark side 
of humanity, calls for them to be treated differently upon their 
return to Canada or their retirement from the military.  We must 
acknowledge that their lives are different from the lives of most 
of us in terms of what they have had to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National standards of veterans health care referenced 
specifically to the unique experiences of our military are but 
one step.  We must recognize that the devolution of the health 
care of our veterans to the provinces should be approached with 
extreme caution and safeguards, if it is to be continued at all. 
We owe a great debt to our veterans.  Surely we must provide them 
with the best of health care at all times.  We must never forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would seek unanimous consent to make this motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place 
today to respond to the motion of the hon. member for Edmonton 
East regarding national standards for veterans health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for maintenance and special needs provisions 
that would be based upon national standards.  These standards 
would be agreed upon by all provinces before health care 
responsibilities for veterans were to be devolved to any province 
for any portion of care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's experience to date is that there has been no 
problem in the quality of care that could not be solved through 
its relationship and its agreements with the contract facilities 
and the provinces.  If situations arise where action is required 
we should let the existing system work, rather than begin the 
long process of working with the provinces to create a national 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the system cannot be improved.  There is 
room to do that.  Veterans Affairs Canada has 75 contract 
facilities across the country.  The department encourages all of 
its contract facilities to be accredited.  Veterans Affairs 
Canada also recognizes and respects provincial standards of care 
and, to provide assurance that the level of care is meeting the 
health needs of veterans, works with the provinces on quality 
assurance issues.  The department also monitors its own set of 10 
outcome areas in its contract and community facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way to improve the system, through the agencies and 
authorities now in place and through the effective partnership 
that has evolved with the provinces in the delivery of health 
care to veterans.  That is why we should continue to allow the 
work that is already under way to be refined and improved upon in 
the best interests of Canada's veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the motion is that it involves complex issues 
and proposes a very simplistic solution.  No one who has watched 
the evolution of health care across the country would say that 
there are simple solutions, especially when these matters involve 
both federal and provincial jurisdictions and both the private 
and public sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In resolving these complex issues there are several constants of 
which Canadians can be assured.  One constant is the good work 
and continued interest of veterans organizations.  They have 
monitored the provision of health care for veterans very closely 
over the years.  I can assure the House that if the health care 
delivery system somehow fails to meet the needs of our veterans, 
these organizations let us know it.  They are very forthright in 
their views and they enable the health care system in this 
country to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constant is the emphasis that Canadians, as a whole, 
place on ensuring that our veterans receive treatment 
commensurate with the gratitude we feel as a nation; our 
gratitude for the sacrifices of those who served their country so 
well in our fights for freedom and democracy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third constant is the importance that the Parliament of Canada 
places on making sure that veterans receive appropriate health 
care.  Today's debate on the motion of the hon. member is one 
example.  Another is the report done by the subcommittee of the 
other place, entitled “Raising the Bar:  Creating a New Standard 
in Veterans Health Care”.  This report provided input for a new 
residential care strategy by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a fourth constant in dealing with the complex issue of 
health care for veterans is the work of Veterans Affairs Canada. 
I will talk about the services the department provides in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to emphasize that when it comes to actual 
delivery of the health care services there are many different 
forces at work.  For example, within the health care system there 
is a shift toward primary health care that emphasizes early 
identification of problems or potential problems and taking a 
holistic approach to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are a growing emphasis on home care.  Veterans 
Affairs Canada has been at the forefront of this movement with 
its veterans independence program, VIP.  This program was first 
put in place in the early 1980s and has evolved to meet the 
changing needs of veterans.  Through VIP, clients are offered 
choices for services based on their needs.  The idea is to permit 
them to remain at home or in their communities as long as 
possible.  This program has been called one of the most 
comprehensive and advanced home care programs in the world and it 
may well set the standard for the delivery of health care 
services in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important shift in health care delivery in Canada is the 
aging of our veterans.  This is one of the areas where Veterans 
Affairs Canada is making a significant contribution, not only to 
the health of veterans, but to our understanding of the ways to 
respond to the aging population.  The department has been 
recognized internationally for its work in research and care 
giving.  The department has been involved in a number of research 
projects and helps the government to make informed decisions on 
ways to ensure that the health system meets the changing needs of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change in the provision of health care in Canada is the 
shift throughout the country from a clinical model of delivering 
health to a residential model.  Clinical care utilizes nurses as 
the primary provider of patient care.  In a residential model the 
nurses and other health care professionals serve as team leaders 
and most of the direct care to the patients is provided by health 
care aides who are part of these teams.  Veterans Affairs Canada, 
through its review of veterans care needs project team, has 
determined that this emphasis on residential care is in keeping 
with the principal needs of veterans.  Clinical care is still 
available for veterans and it is maintained in the larger 
residential care facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the hon. member for Edmonton East proposes 
national standards for residential care facilities agreed upon by 
the provinces.  But given this complex and changing environment, 
I do not believe that agreeing on a set of standards is 
realistic.  The environment is changing too quickly.  We know 
that reaching agreements with the provinces takes time.  By the 
time an agreement is reached the environment can change so much 
that the terms of the agreement are no longer applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the needs of Canada's veterans are becoming more 
urgent as these veterans get older.  We need to act quickly to 
address veterans' needs, not wait to reach an agreement with the 
provinces.  I believe that the federal government has taken a 
more effective course in using the processes now at our disposal 
to promote a high standard of health care in these facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important aspects of the process now in place is 
the vigilance of veterans organizations.  Where they have 
perceived that health care delivery has fallen below a standard 
they feel should apply to veterans, they have spoken out and the 
federal government has responded.  For that reason, we have a 
process in place today which helps to ensure that veterans 
receive good care in these facilities.  The process involves an 
annual review of long term care facilities.  Staff of Veterans 
Affairs Canada, usually the area councillors and district office 
nurses, visit contract and community facilities.  They speak to 
the veterans on a confidential basis.  They ask questions 
designed to determine whether the needs of our veterans are being 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions they ask involve 10 specific areas of health care 
that research has shown to be the most important for our 
veterans. 
Those 10 areas are:  safety and security, food quality, access to 
clinical services, access to specialized services, medication 
regime, access to spiritual guidance, socialization and 
recreation, activation and ambulation, personal care, and 
sanitation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extensive list.  It is a comprehensive list of the 
key issues that would likely be negotiated with the provinces if 
we were to try to establish a national standard for veterans 
health care.  It is a list of key health care deliverables that 
are already being applied across the country, not as a result of 
an agreement with the provinces, but through the persuasion of 
Veterans Affairs Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has good intentions with this motion.  He wants 
to ensure that veterans can receive quality health care at long 
term residence facilities, but it would mean a more complex round 
of negotiations with the provinces.  It would become more 
difficult, not easier, to make any changes necessary to improve 
the health care provided to veterans.  Such negotiations would 
delay the real changes that can be made now to improve 
residential care for veterans.  There are already initiatives in 
place that will deliver the results we all desire, that is, 
quality health care for our veterans. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to congratulate the member on his motion.  I know that it stems 
from a sensitivity to our elders, who certainly acted on the 
strength of their convictions in World War I and even World War 
II, although certain historians claim that, strictly speaking, 
it was all one war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to go over 
the motion once again.  The Reform Party member is moving: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
institute national standards for veterans' health care with 
maintenance and special needs provisions, and have these 
standards agreed upon by all provinces before devolving 
responsibilities to any province for any portion of care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in our respective ridings we all have veterans who 
come to us about the deteriorating health care system and the 
various administrative difficulties they are experiencing.  But 
it seems to me that there is a problem with the motion being 
suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the assumption is made that management of veterans 
services is an exclusively federal jurisdiction. 
Even though funding for access to health care comes from the 
federal government, the fact remains that the services people 
receive are often provided by the various provincial health care 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult for us to support national standards. True, we 
already have the Canada Health Act, which is somewhat of a 
paradox. When one looks at the constitutional distribution of 
powers, one realizes that, except for the military aspect and 
for quarantine, the federal government has little responsibility 
with regard to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, allow me to salute my colleague, the chairman of 
the Standing Committee on Health, who always seems interested 
when I make a speech. I am not so pretentious as to think he is 
a member of my fan club, but I do think he is a friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the paradox of having a national health act 
when the Constitution gives the federal government very little 
responsibility with regard to health since it is only 
responsible for the health of veterans and for any issues 
related to quarantine and to mechanisms to prevent contagion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the federal government does not have primary 
responsibility with regard to health, it has a Department of 
Health employing several thousand public servants.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act promotes the five following principles: 
universality, portability, comprehensiveness and public 
administration, and of course universality. These principles are 
the main features of our national legislation on the health care 
system. Of course, we believe that these principles have merit, 
but that it is primarily the provinces that must ensure the 
comprehensiveness, the universality, the public character, and 
the portability of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, no matter in what region, in Quebec or in the 
rest of Canada, people must be sure to have access to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would readily have agreed. 
The Reform member who, I know, is greatly concerned by these 
issues should know this: we would certainly have supported a 
motion asking the federal government to restore transfer 
payments for health. But when this government becomes history, 
we will never forget that, through its policies, its unilateral 
cuts, from 1993 to 2001, this government cut several billion 
dollars in health care alone. This must be said to all those who 
are listening today. On the whole, transfer payments were 
reduced by $42 billion, and nearly a third of that was cut from 
health care, and for Quebec alone, it was $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Bouchard, the Premier of Quebec, one of its great 
premiers, is certainly one of the most gifted men of his 
generation.  I believe that, if I called for unanimous consent, 
I would get it, acknowledging Lucien Bouchard as certainly one 
of the most gifted men of his generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first ministers conference, the Premier of Quebec 
reminded the others that, Quebec alone had had $4 billion cut 
from health.  I believe that we need to make the connection with 
the position the premiers adopted and the motion our Reform 
Party colleague is proposing.  If we are to provide better care 
to our fellow citizens who served on the battlefield because of 
their convictions, adopting national standards is not the way to 
do it.  I repeat, however, that this objective is an eminently 
desirable one. 
The way to do it is to reinvest in the health care systems 
existing in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dying to see what is in the budget.  I shall be here on 
Monday, February 28, of this year of our Lord 2000 AD, in order 
to find out what the Minister of Health and the Minister of 
Finance have to say.  This will be a historical responsibility; 
all members are going to follow the budget speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that it will not be possible, whether in the 
specific case of care for veterans or the case of all those 
covered by the health system who end up in the emergency 
departments, in the CLSCs, in the institutions.  The people in 
those places know that the Minister of Health and the Minister 
of Finance need to speak the truth and redress the wrongs of the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the Quebec government, which is one of the best 
ever, wants to offer health services to our fellow citizens, but 
is being deprived of several billions of dollars because the 
federal government, suddenly and without negotiating with the 
provinces, acted unilaterally. Do you know what “unilaterally” 
means? It means a one-sided decision. The federal government 
without negotiating with the provinces deprived them in a 
cavalier fashion of several billions of dollars. 
As I said, we appreciate the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the hon. member, who is the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Health and who is said to be a strong supporter of 
the Minister of Health for future events, will join me in asking 
his government to exert pressure and to make money available in 
the Minister of Finance's budget, so that the provinces can meet 
the needs of all their clienteles, including the veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I thank the hon. member for being sensitive to this 
issue, but we do not believe that the solution lies in national 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot, as a Bloc Quebecois member who is highly respected by 
his peers on all sides of the House, support the idea of 
national standards. This would not be in agreement with our 
vision. I would go against my own principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by asking all members of this House to ensure 
that transfer payments are restored, to make sure that the 
provinces, which are responsible for the health care system, can 
meet the needs of all their clienteles, including the veterans, 
with new moneys. This is our position on that motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to rise tonight to speak to 
this motion, which I think is a very important motion.  I want to 
commend my hon. colleague from Edmonton East for bringing forward 
his concern for the well-being and the health of our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP support the motion.  We think it is very important 
that there be national standards for veterans' health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National Defence, as we know, comes under federal jurisdiction 
and we feel that the federal government must not abandon its 
responsibility to ensure that those who defend our country 
receive quality health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is not happening at present.  We all know 
the many stories, and we see them coming forth daily, of our 
military personnel who are returning home from missions abroad: 
the gulf war, Somalia, various other missions.  These people are 
ending up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, depleted 
uranium and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is a state of denial by DND with respect to even 
giving these veterans the benefit of the doubt that their 
illnesses may have in fact been caused by something that happened 
while they were overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak for a moment on depleted uranium.  I attended a 
briefing today where DND again attempted to indicate that there 
was no real serious concern about this material, no danger in 
this and that there was no evidence to support this.  However, 
this seems to fly in the face of the very real evidence that we 
see from the people who are suffering and have been exposed to 
this material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House of what Dr. Rosalie Bertell, a famous 
epidemiologist, had to say about depleted uranium.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DU is highly toxic to humans, both chemically as a heavy metal 
and radiologically as an alpha particle emitter which is very 
dangerous when taken internally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon impact, the DU bursts into flames.  It produces a toxic and 
radioactive ceramic aerosol that is much lighter than uranium 
dust.  It can travel in the air tens of kilometres from the point 
of release, or settle as dust suspended in the air waiting to be 
stirred up by human or animal movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very small and can be breathed by anyone from babies and 
pregnant women to the elderly and the sick.  This radioactive and 
toxic ceramic can stay in the lungs for years, irradiating the 
surrounding tissue with powerful alpha particles.  It can affect 
the lungs, gastrointestinal system, liver, kidneys, bones, other 
tissues and renal systems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most likely a major contributor to the Gulf War Syndrome 
experienced by the veterans and the people of Iraq. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that after the war Iraq experienced explosive rates of 
stillbirths, children born with defects, childhood leukemia and 
other cancers and, in particular, near the Basara region where 
these shells were fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look seriously at the situation concerning 
depleted uranium and not put our heads in the sand and try to 
pretend that it does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do see that there is a constant state of denial by 
the department to connect any of the symptoms experienced to 
depleted uranium or to the missions that our soldiers have been 
on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, after a lot of pressure, a lot of studies and so forth, the 
government has finally agreed to do some testing of the veterans 
for depleted uranium.  Even then, I have some concern that the 
testing may not be as thorough, as impartial and as complete as 
one would like because the talk today was only about the testing 
of urine.  However, if we want to have any faith restored in our 
military and in the capability of the government to support our 
men and women when they return home, we must take an impartial 
look at this whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of why we need some high standards of health 
care for our veterans is the case of the former Sergeant Kipling, 
a veteran with 26 years experience.  Eight years ago he refused 
to take a vaccine when it was administered before the gulf war 
conflict.  What did he get for this refusal?  He got a court 
martial.  He refused the vaccine because he was concerned about 
his health and about the effects of the vaccine, which has not 
been approved in Canada for general use.  He had many questions 
surrounding its safety and his well-being, yet rather than 
getting support, he was court-martialled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at those individuals who do not come under military 
health care.  Those of us who come under the provincial health 
care system do not find ourselves faced with these problems.  We 
do not have to accept medicines or vaccinations that we do not 
want to take.  However, this is the case in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government does institute national standards for 
health care with maintenance and special needs provisions, as 
indicated in the motion, it may indeed have a problem having such 
standards agreed upon by all the provinces, particularly if the 
federal government does not restore the funding that has been cut 
from the health care system.  If there is going to be a standard 
of health care there has to be sufficient funding to meet that 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there have been billions and billions of 
dollars cut from the health care system to the point that even 
our provincial health care systems are struggling today.  People 
are waiting in long lineups in hospitals.  People are not able 
to get the kind of care that they should get because of the 
funding crisis in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we did agree to national standards for our veterans, 
there is still a problem in that regard if there is not 
sufficient funding coming forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion talks about having these standards agreed upon by all 
provinces before devolving responsibility to any province for any 
portion of care.  I would point out that the federal government 
is extremely good at devolving responsibilities to other levels 
of government or to other parties without first putting the 
things in order that should be put in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the example of the Halifax International Airport. 
That airport was eventually passed down to the Halifax Airport 
Authority without the federal government first accepting 
responsibility and cleaning up the environmental hazard due to 
the pyritic slate in the area.  This was a very important issue 
that should have been resolved before the transfer took place. 
However, the federal government put the authority in a position 
that it had to take it or leave it in the final bargaining. 
The authority had to finally accept what should have been the 
responsibility of the federal government, which was to clean up 
the hazard before devolving the airport down to the authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would have that kind of concern with national health 
standards for our veterans.  We should work these things out in 
such a way that we do not leave the provinces with any 
responsibilities that should rightly be carried by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from the massive cuts that have taken place in our 
health care system that we are now slowly moving toward a 
two-tier American style health system.  It is time for Canadians 
to take back control of our country, to take back control of the 
things we should control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall back to 1993 when the federal government decided to get 
out of the housing program and pass the responsibility over to 
the provinces.  We now see the results of that where we have many 
people without homes who are dying on the street.  Why? 
It is because the federal government withdrew from the social 
housing program.  It devolved and put this responsibility down to 
the provinces and again did not provide adequate funding to 
maintain adequate shelter for our citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be very careful when we talk about the devolving of 
responsibility and passing it down.  The federal government seems 
to be good at wanting to privatize things, to put them into the 
hands of the private sector as if they can do so much better than 
public control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion that has been brought forward 
concerning the health of our veterans.  It is very important that 
Canada supports and looks after those who have gone off to defend 
our borders, to fight in places where perhaps we would not even 
want to go ourselves, and to carry out jobs that many of us would 
not want to do.  The least we can do is make sure that when they 
return they are well looked after and that we give them the 
benefit of the doubt when they are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wind up very quickly by saying again that I commend the 
member for bringing forth his concern in this motion.  I 
certainly feel that all of us in the House should be concerned 
about the well-being of our veterans and do everything we can to 
ensure that their health and safety are carried forward in a very 
positive way.  We should also remember the effect not just on 
those veterans but on their families, their wives, their 
children, and the communities in which they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I understand the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest is speaking clothed as he is with special 
dispensation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate that.   You might notice that I am being 
surrounded by some of the most cerebral people in the House.  It 
is nice to be accompanied by so many members from all sides of 
the House.  It very seldom happens in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things I want to make clear from the 
outset.  Our critic in this area, who should have spoken tonight, 
the member for Saint John, had to go back to her constituency.  I 
am pleased to be speaking in her place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back at people who have taken on causes in the House 
from time to time, I do not think any member of the House has 
been more dedicated to a particular cause than the member for 
Saint John.  She has done an extremely good job in working with 
the government, sometimes criticizing the government but 
certainly working with the minister on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the veterans are looking at one particular minister in the 
past that really did it all for them it would be George Hees.  We 
are hoping that the new minister from Newfoundland will evolve 
into that type of minister in terms of historical recognition of 
someone that really did something for veterans.  Obviously there 
is more to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the motion to Canadians so they will have an idea 
of what we are talking about.  The member for Edmonton East, and 
we applaud him for it, moved this motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
institute national standards for veterans health care with 
maintenance and special needs provisions, and have these 
standards agreed upon by all provinces before dissolving 
responsibilities to any province for any portion of care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member was somewhat agitated and a bit emotional on the 
topic.  Maybe the members from Quebec would agree with me in what 
I am about to say.  It is probably the only point we will agree 
on tonight.  The veterans hospital in Montreal is a hospital I am 
familiar with because that little stretch on Ste. Anne de 
Bellevue is the shortest piece of road between routes 20 and 40. 
When I do from time to time drive back to New Brunswick I take 
that little street by the hospital we are speaking about, the one 
that led to this discussion.  It is the last veterans hospital in 
Canada that will be taken away and devolved into provincial 
jurisdiction. 
In other words, the federal government will move that hospital 
over to the province of Quebec to look after the veterans.  It is 
telling us that is just a proposal.  No negotiations are 
presently under way but that is obviously what it is looking at. 
I believe it is the last hospital in Canada so designated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of the bigger picture which I think every member of 
the House has expressed in terms of the federal government's lack 
of funding in health care.  We are seeing that from one end of 
Canada to the other in the have provinces and have not provinces. 
We are finding that every province has to scramble to find a way 
to fund health care because of the denial and cutbacks in funding 
from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about the five principles of health care in 
the country, those principles have been violated time and time 
again.  We do not have a so-called universal system of health 
care.  Health care delivery, primary care delivery, varies from 
province to province.  Some provinces can afford to do more. Some 
provinces cannot afford to do more.  Some provinces have 
continually done less year after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this?  It is because of the cutbacks by the federal 
government.  We might argue about what the numbers are, but most 
of us, regardless of what side of the House we sit on, are 
arguing in the $10 billion to $12 billion range.  That is a lot 
of change, but it is money that the provinces cannot come up 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the model for universal health care or medicare in Canada 
was invented back a number of years ago and we entered into 
agreements with the provinces, the federal government was coming 
in for a bigger share of the cost of delivering those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that constitutionally the delivery of 
primary care is a provincial jurisdiction.  Maybe what we are 
talking about, to have this matter finally solved, is some kind 
of constitutional arrangement that would allow people who 
actually make the rules to somehow have access to the tax dollars 
to do that.  Presently the federal government has the money to do 
it but it is trying to enforce the rules on the provinces without 
giving them the tax dollars to actually do it.  We have to sit 
down and intelligently talk about it at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before coming to the House I was in a meeting.  Believe it 
or not the topic of discussion was the delivery of health care 
services to seniors, our aging population.  As hon. members know, 
that is the next crisis that will hit health care and Canadian 
society as our aging population continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is heartwarming that one of the individuals to whom I spoke 
just a few short minutes was a gentleman named Larry F. Gray.  He 
is the service officer for the Royal Canadian Legion.  He is a 
retired gentleman and donates a good deal of his time to helping 
veterans, older citizens, cope with the realities of the present 
day.  I should have him standing beside me because he could 
contribute to this debate like none of us could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the statistics he gave me indicated that there are 
approximately 1,630 legion branches in Canada with 450,000 legion 
members.  If we were creative and we wanted to do something, 
imagine what we could do if we could mobilize on a community 
basis those people back home.  I think we have to find some way 
of reinventing the wheel.  I know tax dollars will do part of it 
but they cannot do all of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the federal minister raised this trial balloon a few 
short weeks ago.  It was systematically shot down by just about 
every province in terms of delivering community care back in the 
communities, back in the provinces.  We were talking about home 
care and community care. 
It was routinely shot down by the premiers.  It goes back to my 
earlier argument.  They are saying “Listen, we cannot afford to 
deliver the programs that we have out there presently.  Let us 
not come up with something else”.

limitations.  What can we do to solve the problem?  Let us not 
continue to argue about it.  Let us not continue to talk about 
the past.  We have to look at the future for ways of 
realistically dealing with the health care crisis in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion before us is laudable.  It should be 
supported by every member in the House.  At the end of the 
argument he is not just talking about veterans, although that is 
the primary concern here this evening.  It is about all 
Canadians.  He is really saying in this motion that we should 
support health care to a level where all Canadians can expect the 
best health care in the world.  We are capable of doing that as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting into education.  We are getting into a provincial 
jurisdiction again.  Let us realize as parliamentarians that the 
two biggest issues are education and health care.  They go hand 
in hand.  Let us educate our young people so they have meaningful 
jobs and the kinds of income that will sustain our tax system and 
support the programs we are talking about in the House such as 
the best health care system in the world.  We can do it. I 
applaud the member.  We are in a position to support his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member for Edmonton East 
speaks at this point, he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for their comments on this very important 
issue.  I believe it is possible to develop national standards. I 
thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for his comments.  He made 
reference to a comprehensive list that is used now to discuss and 
to look at each individual veterans health care centre.  It would 
not be complicated to expand that list, to formalize that list so 
we have national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for national standards for veterans health care is 
that veterans are not and have not experienced the life 
experiences of ordinary citizens.  This manifests itself on my 
visits to the veterans health care centres in many ways.  For 
example, the oxygen rooms in veterans health care centres are 
much larger than in ordinary senior homes.  There is also 
psychiatric difficulties that veterans experience which can 
manifest themselves in their later days considerably more than 
with ordinary seniors because some of them had horrific 
experiences in their wartime service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate a quick story of my experience in the military as 
a military policeman being sent to downtown Trenton to pick up a 
person from a hotel.  As I was driving him to his home I thought 
he was receiving fantastic service for an impaired corporal. I 
found out why I was picking him up and taking him home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halfway home he broke down and started mimicking machine gun 
sounds.  He broke into tears.  I left him at his doorstep with 
his wife consoling him.  On my return to the guardhouse I asked 
the sergeant what had happened.  He explained.  This gentleman 
was a tailgunner in World War II.  He had taken off, tired and 
fell fast asleep.  The bumping of the takeoff awoke him.  He saw 
a plane in his gunsight and shot it out of the sky.  It was one 
of his own planes.  These type of experiences only war veterans 
have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, veterans in veterans care facilities need extra 
consideration.  Yes, they need extra rules.  Yes, they need extra 
protection.  This is very clear, whether it is the Perley Rideau 
Hospital where there are ongoing discussions right now or Ste 
Anne de Bellevue. 
Before we devolve more we should develop standards that would 
reflect the extra psychiatric help.  My experience and the 
experience of others who have been in the military is that we 
were brought up on cigarettes.  A lifetime of that does affect 
them.  There is a substantially higher level of lung problems 
among veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is need for extra provisions for veterans health care 
centres.  How could an ordinary hospital understand all of the 
problems of veterans?  It is very important for these issues to 
be addressed in special facilities with special rules for the 
veterans who need it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
December 10, 1999 I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs when 
Canada planned to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law 
of the Sea.  Tonight I would like to reiterate some of the 
reasons why it is in Canada's interest to ratify this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea in 
1982.  This marked the culmination of more than 14 years of work 
involving participation by more than 150 countries.  The 
convention needed ratification by 60 countries.  It entered into 
force in 1994 without Canada's ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the law of the sea is the virtual constitution of the 
world's oceans. It regulates a wide range of issues including 
pollution prevention, conservation of fish stocks, limits of 
coastal state jurisdictions, states' rights and responsibilities 
and mining of the ocean floor.  The law of the sea is a landmark 
achievement of international law treating the resources of the 
ocean floor as the common heritage of mankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that 143 countries have ratified the law of the sea, now 
that 18 years have passed since Canada signed it, and now that 
the red book promise is seven years old, this globally recognized 
regime is still without Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1993 Liberal Party red book says:  “New multilateral 
regimes are needed to address many emerging global issues, the 
management of global fish stocks, the protection of the world's 
atmosphere” and so on.  It goes on to say: “A Liberal 
government will foster the development of such multilateral 
forums and agreements, including an improved law of the sea”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1999 the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that 
the only question remaining was the complete ratification of the 
straddling stocks agreement.  The excuse Canada gave for not 
ratifying the convention in 1994 was problems with the deep 
seabed mining provisions of the convention.  Canada is thus 
putting obstacles in the way of ratification of the law of the 
sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time Canada is awaiting complete ratification of the 
agreement for the conservation and management of straddling fish 
stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.  This agreement promotes 
good order in the oceans through the effective management and 
conservation of high seas resources by establishing: detailed 
minimum international standards for the conservation and 
management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish 
stocks; by setting out principles for the conservation and 
management of those fish stocks based on the precautionary 
approach and the best available scientific information; by 
ensuring that such measures taken under national jurisdiction and 
in the high seas are compatible and coherent; and finally, 
ensuring there are effective mechanisms for compliance and 
enforcement of those measures on the high seas.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's objective of conserving national fish stocks cannot be 
achieved by the straddling fish stock agreement alone.  Canada 
must achieve its objectives through international co-operation. 
Canada, with three oceans and immense marine resources, has a 
special responsibility to show international leadership. 
Therefore Canada can only gain by ratifying the law of the sea 
convention rather than risk losing its international reputation 
by further delaying the ratification of this important law.

adoption of the UN agreement on straddling and highly migratory

Canada played a leading role in the negotiation of the UN fish 
agreement which provides for a strong conservation, management 
and enforcement regime on the high seas.  We need an effective 
international high seas enforcement regime to protect fish stocks 
which straddle Canada's 200 mile fishing zone and the adjacent 
high seas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on November 5 I asked the Minister of Finance a question about 
taxes for business and why he did not undertake to reduce taxes 
for businesses to help the economy.  At that time the 
parliamentary secretary responded that we already have very low 
taxes for businesses.  I simply disagree with that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources will be answering my question, I assume the Liberal 
government views taxes as a natural resource to be gathered into 
their coffers to redistribute as they see fit. We are witnessing 
that with what is happening at human resources.  We know all 
about that billion dollar boondoggle.  Perhaps it is because of 
the underlying belief that tax dollars are a natural resource.  I 
can only assume that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did see the parliamentary secretary practising his answer.  I 
hope he puts away the scripted response that has been given to 
him by the department and actually answers the question.  It 
would be reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, why does the hon. member not 
put his script away?  What is he reading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hear the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington also saying that he wishes the parliamentary 
secretary would put away his scripted question and answer as 
well. I thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has just wakened to the fact that 
corporate taxes are very high in this country and they need to be 
reduced.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the brain drain is a job drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What studies are turning up is not that personal taxes are such 
a big deal, but that opportunity is leading people to the United

policies that are going to increase opportunity in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to state that corporate taxes are high on his list of 
wishes.  That was the Minister of Industry.  I hope he has a 
chance to sit down and talk to the Minister of Finance in the 
next couple of days because the Prime Minister already leaked 
that the budget would be announced on February 28. 
We hope there are going to be substantial reductions in taxation, 
not only for small businesses, but for hard working Canadians as 
well.  We really hope that will be the case.  We somehow doubt 
it, but we hope that will be the case.

everything is going fine, just wait until February 28 and we will

would state that this is the government that has increased taxes 
year after year in a shell game approach of saying that it has 
reduced taxes when, in effect, it has increased them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not see that reducing personal income taxes 
and taxes for business will stimulate the economy.  The Reform 
Party has a proposal which has been endorsed by WEFA, a highly 
regarded independent organization which the Minister of Finance 
uses himself for his own numbers that he runs for his budget 
projections, which says that this is a very good program in which 
we will be able to substantially reduce taxation to stimulate the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my wish and my hope that the government will take such an 
approach to stimulate the economy and to substantially reduce 
taxes for businesses and for all Canadians.  However, I do not 
think it is actually going to be delivered by the Liberals 
because of their actions of increasing taxes over and over again. 
We will wait to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge Canadians to wait to see what kind of new spending the 
government is going to announce when the budget is brought 
forward.  I wait with bated breath to hear my colleague's, 
hopefully unscripted, response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say 
first that the sense of humour of the member for 
Dewdney—Alouette is almost as good as his hockey skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has always taken the issue of business taxes very 
seriously.  In fact it was this government which set up a 
technical committee on business taxation, announced in the 1996 
budget, because we were and are concerned about the impact of 
business taxes on jobs and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must not lose perspective concerning the problems we 
inherited when first elected in 1993.  In fact we were left with 
quite a mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we had to deal with a $42 billion deficit.  Nothing could 
take priority over wrestling that deficit to the ground.  In 
fact, we have announced a string of surpluses which, to my 
understanding, is a record in the history of this country, and we 
are proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada still faces a debt burden that is the second 
largest in the OECD.  Five years ago 36 cents out of every dollar 
collected was used to pay interest on the debt.  We have 
successfully brought it down to 27 cents on each dollar, and it 
is falling.  This is clearly an important problem that needs 
further fixing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we have a personal income tax burden which is the highest 
we have had in our history, granted, and too high in relation to 
other developed nations.  That is why this is our number one tax 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not to say that we will not act on business 
taxes.  We will.  The 1999 fall economic and fiscal update stated 
that this government is committed to ensuring that we have an 
internationally competitive business tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the upcoming budget will lay out a multi-year 
tax reduction plan which will respond responsibly to our 
commitment to split surpluses between tax and debt reduction on 
the one hand and social and economic investment on the other 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member across the way to be here on February 28 to 
hear the good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  The House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.28 p.m.)
