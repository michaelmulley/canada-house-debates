	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-82, an 
act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-82 is of wide ranging significance for 
Canadians. The piece of legislation will enable the government 
to modernize Canada's currency by introducing a new $2 coin.
<P>
	The bill is part of a two-tier approach that will transform 
Canada's currency system and save Canadian taxpayers a half 
billion dollars over 20 years. The other element of the strategy is 
the decision to change the metal composition of the 1-cent, 
5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent and 50-cent circulation coins. Such a 
move has become necessary given the rising cost of producing 
the coins.
<P>
	For example, it now costs approximately 1.4 cents to produce 
a 1-cent coin. In all, altering the metal content of the coins will 
result in annual savings of $12 million.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These new measures, an important stage in the history of our 
currency, are arousing a lot of interest throughout the country. 
For Canadians, their currency is more than a mere payment 
instrument. It is part of their heritage, a national symbol.
<P>
	By deciding to replace the $2 bill with a coin and by changing 
the metal composition of the lower denomination coins, the 
government remains true to the principles it has always stood 
for.
<P>
	Since our government took office, it has been faced with 
difficult choices. We have never shirked our responsibilities and 
we always tried to face the music in cooperation with all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The savings to the people of Canada are considerable. I have 
already discussed the savings that will accrue to the people of 
Canada as a result of changing the metal composition of the 
lower denomination coins. It is estimated that moving to a $2 
coin will by itself save taxpayers $254 million over the next 20 
years. This is because coins last so much longer than notes.
<P>
	At present the $2 bill costs 6 cents per unit to produce, but 
with all the wear and tear it takes a note only lasts one year. A $2 
coin, on the other hand, will cost approximately 16 cents to 
produce but will last 20 years.
<P>
	The new $2 coin brings another benefit to the government: 
within 18 months of issuing the coin the government will obtain 
$449 million in seigniorage. The difference between the unit 
cost to produce a coin and the face value of the coin is 
seigniorage. Within 18 months of issuing the $2 coin $449 
million in seigniorage will accrue to the government, thus an 
additional $500 million for the government's consolidated 
revenue fund within 18 months. This is not bad by any stretch.
<P>
	This move also reflects the government's sense of priorities. 
All Canadians understand that we have to get the government 
deficit under control, which demands spending cuts in every 
government department. As was stated in this year's budget, 
Canadians want the government to spend money and secure 
savings in ways that make sense and that reflect their values. To 
do so it is essential that our efforts be guided by clear principles.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed changes to our currency are a good example of 
the savings that can be achieved with some determination and 
creativity.
<P>
	Let me also tell the House that the government is looking for 
other ways to reduce spending in order to avoid tax increases. 
The introduction of the new $2 coin and the proposed changes to 
the other denomination coins will also meet our needs, since 
coins are still widely used in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12828"> 12828 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, despite the growing popularity of credit cards and 
debit cards, coins are still used in over 75 per cent of all 
financial transactions made in this country.
<P>
	The third principle is frugality; each dollar matters. The 
initiatives put forward today are probably the best way to 
illustrate this principle. Some will argue that savings of $12 
million a year, or half a billion dollars over 20 years, are not a 
big deal, but on this side of the House, we think that every little 
bit counts and as the old saying goes: ``Little streams make big 
rivers''. This government thinks that a dollar saved is a dollar in 
the pockets of the taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By making these impressive savings in the production of our 
coins we are helping Canadians avoid painful budget cuts in 
other areas. Let me be perfectly clear. Our government is 
committed to eliminating the deficit, which will require more 
spending cuts in the years to come. Reducing the cost of our 
currency is a good example of spending cuts that are fair to all 
Canadians and relatively painless.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Some people have expressed concern about the changes to our 
national coinage, but the disadvantages which are mostly related 
to the bulk of coins are far outweighed by the advantages, 
especially the considerable savings.
<P>
	I am convinced that if given the choice all Canadians would 
choose a few more coins in their pockets or purses over fewer 
dollars in their bank accounts as a result of tax increases. 
Canadians understand that a $2 coin will add a little weight to 
their pockets but will take a big load off the debt.
<P>
	The government also understands the concerns of the vending 
industry and is committed to giving this and other important 
factors the time they need to adjust to the changes. The 8 to 12 
months advance notice they have received should allow them to 
convert their equipment to handle the new coins. One reason we 
decided to introduce the new $2 coin at this time as we change 
the composition of other coins is to assist the vending industry.
<P>
	By pursuing the two initiatives at the same time the industry 
will only face a one-time investment in recalibrating its 
machines.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not only will the new $2 coin be better adapted to the needs of 
our trade and industry sector, it will also be more practical for 
users. As more and more goods and services such as coffee, 
snacks, laundromats, subway tickets and public parking require 
the use of coins, the need for printing low denomination bills is 
increasingly reduced.
<P>
	By modernizing its currency in this fashion, Canada is joining 
the ranks of the many countries all over the world that already 
have higher denomination coins. The United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Japan and Switzerland are only some of the countries 
which have recognized the practical value of coins as a method 
of payment. Many countries have coins that have a much greater 
nominal value than ours. For example, in the United Kingdom, 
the one pound coin has approximately the same value as our new 
$2 coin.
<P>
	France is another country where low denomination bills have 
been withdrawn. In fact, their smallest bill, the twenty franc bill, 
is worth almost $5. Some European countries have coins that are 
worth as much as our $10 bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed coin is composed of a nickel outer ring with a 
round aluminium bronze core. The use of bimetallic coins is 
another trend that is growing throughout the world. Such 
countries as France, Italy, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico and 
many others are already using such coins. The government's 
choice of a bimetallic $2 coin reflects another one of our 
principles, that of helping Canada break into new markets with 
new products. The capability of producing a bimetallic coin in 
Canada will position the mint and Canadian suppliers to 
compete internationally for the bimetallic coin business.
<P>
	This is especially true given the Royal Canadian Mint's 
worldwide reputation for unsurpassed quality, its markets and 
its production expertise internationally. I am convinced that the 
capability of producing the bimetallic $2 coin will give the mint 
and potential Canadian suppliers another advantage in foreign 
markets.
<P>
	I have outlined many of the tangible benefits that will flow 
from the changes. Canadians will benefit directly from the 
immediate cost savings as well as from the more cost effective 
method of producing coins. All this will result in a more 
efficient and effective coin system that can only help our 
economy.
<P>
	The criteria for an effective coin system are that the system 
will first meet the needs of trade and commerce, will be cost 
effective, will have public acceptance and will meet public 
preference.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I have already addressed the first two points regarding the 
new coin. I would now like to address the issues of public 
acceptance and public preference. As was the case with the 
introduction of the ever popular loonie, I am confident that 
Canadians will also come to enjoy the convenience, the 
distinctive look, and the feel of the $2 coin.
<P>
	The $1 coin may give us an idea of how popular its sibling 
could prove to be. Since its introduction, more than 685 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12829"> 12829 </A></B>
<P>
$1 coins have been struck, which is more than double the 
number of $1 bills that were in circulation when they began to be 
withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a matter of fact, after seeing the success we have had with 
our loonie, the U.S. general accounting office is looking at 
reintroducing the $1 coin in the United States. That says a lot.
<P>
	It is not necessary to wait and see if our $2 coin will be 
popular. According to the information we have now, more than 
79 per cent of Canadians are in favour of the new $2 coin 
because of the savings it will bring.
<P>
	Once they are informed of all the advantages associated with 
the new coin and of the modifications that will be made to the 
metal composition of other coins, I am convinced that 
Canadians will support this project wholeheartedly.
<P>
	Canadians in all the provinces have shown their support for 
the new $2 coin by sending their ideas on the theme and the 
illustration of the coin. The Royal Canadian Mint has already 
received over 17,000 submissions from school children, artists, 
coin collectors and other Canadian men and women.
<P>
	I encourage members of this House who have received 
suggestions from their constituents or who want to make their 
own suggestions to send them to us, but they have to do it as soon 
as possible because this cost-saving measure is progressing 
very quickly.
<P>
	Our government is making these changes in the interest of all 
Canadians. The savings alone justify this decision but, more 
importantly, these changes reflect our determination to prepare 
for the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In making these changes we are also responding to the 
message we received from Canadians from coast to coast and we 
are putting into practice the message we sent out in the February 
budget. They want us to spend money and secure savings in 
ways that make sense and reflect Canadian values. We want to 
carry out their wishes in ways that cause the least pain possible.
<P>
	It is only a small step in our larger march toward the future, 
but it is a symbol of our government's ongoing commitment to 
reducing the cost of government while providing service to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Surely the people of Canada will benefit greatly from the 
introduction of the new $2 coin. That is why I strongly urge all 
members of the House to help us in passing Bill C-82.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-82, an act to 
replace the $2 bill with a coin.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary just explained, this change 
would save the government some $12 or 13 million yearly for 
the next 20 years. This measure will save us money. In fact, as he 
explained, the production cost of a bill, which has a circulation 
life of about 1 year, is 6 cents; the cost of minting a coin, which 
has a circulation life of 20 years, is 16 cents. Hence, the savings 
of $250 million over 20 years.
<P>
	However, the parliamentary secretary neglected to mention 
the costs, amounting to approximately $30 million, which will 
be associated with the new coin. There certainly is the potential 
for savings; that is the main reason the government tabled this 
bill. When it comes to that pursuit, the Bloc Quebecois has 
always striven to propose to the government ways of saving 
money. This is always practical, especially for a government 
facing a deficit.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Some businesses, in particular bus companies, also support 
this initiative because they are having problems with their 
money boxes. All those $2 bills tend to get stuck in the money 
boxes on buses. That is indeed a great problem, and perhaps one 
of the arguments in favour of replacing the bill with a coin.
<P>
	We can talk about savings for the government and for the 
government only. That is where the savings end. Substantial 
costs will be associated with making the transition to the use of 
the coin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, when a member has the floor, I 
think his colleagues should at least give him a chance to express 
his views and other people a chance to listen. The comments 
being made right and left make it impossible for us to listen 
undisturbed to what the speaker for our party has to say. I would 
appreciate, Mr. Speaker, if you would call my colleagues to 
order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure that is what we 
want, regardless of the topic or the member who is speaking, and 
I hope hon. members will remember this, and that the debate 
will proceed in a way that is acceptable to all members on both 
sides of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity 
to thank the hon. member for Joliette for coming to the rescue. I 
was so absorbed in my speech that I did not notice the other 
conversations that were going on, but now, as I look around me, I 
see people talking.
<P>
	As I was saying, the purpose of Bill C-82 is to issue a coin that 
will replace the $2 bill, as a money saving measure that, I agree, 
will save approximately $240 million over 20 years. But that is 
where the saving stops. When we consider the transition period 
until this legislation can be implemented, we are talking about 
substantial expenditures, because it is clear that the private 
sector will again be stuck with spending several million dollars 
during the transition. As you know, when the government issues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12830"> 12830 </A></B>
<P>
a new coin, in this case the $2 coin, it means all cash registers in 
every business in this country have to be changed.
<P>
	At the present time, cash registers can accommodate coins in 
denominations of 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and one 
dollar, and now all cash registers will have to be changed to 
accommodate the $2 coin. Who is going to pay? The merchants, 
of course. We will have to change all the vending machines 
across the country, at an estimated cost of more than $80 
million. And yes, there is more. We will have to change parking 
meters in our municipalities to accommodate the $2 coin, and 
ticket counters and video games. And what about telephone 
booths? There are a lot of those in Canada. Apparently, the 
additional cost for the private sector in Canada will be $400 
million during the first year, and that is a conservative estimate. 
That is the minimum cost to the private sector.
<P>
	These are very substantial amounts.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	It is nonsense to say, like the parliamentary secretary, that it is 
painless for the business community. There is nothing painless 
about obliging merchants to change their cash registers at a time 
when many are already suffering as a result of poor decision 
making by this government. Consider the GST and all the 
paperwork small businesses have to cope with, businesses that 
in some cases are on the verge of bankruptcy. Now they are 
being asked to change their cash registers. This is not 
necessarily good news for them.
<P>
	We can hardly say this is painless and that the government is 
acting in the best interests of a private sector that will have to 
spend at least $400 million because a new coin is being issued.
<P>
	I heard some comments from government members. Sure, this 
will get the economy going. This will make a real difference. 
Four hundred million dollars at least will be spent. That will 
make a difference. I think this reasoning shows a lack of 
imagination and I would even say a lack of intelligence on the 
part of the government, because we know perfectly well that if 
the government really wanted to boost the economy, it could do 
it in a positive way.
<P>
	If the government really cared about promoting private 
enterprise and small business, it would make an effort to 
simplify the paperwork, the forms and all the taxes imposed on 
small business and forget about issuing a $2 coin.
<P>
	Issuing a $2 coin is no help to small business or even 
businesses in general in Canada. It complicates their lives. It 
forces them to spend money for something they did not ask for. 
Who, in the end, is going to pay for it? Businesses will pass the 
cost on to the customer. It will have an inflationary effect, 
perhaps like the introduction of the GST and all the other 
government measures of the past. It will have an inflationary 
effect.
<P>
	We all know that, with the introduction of the dollar coin a 
few years ago, a whole slew of things that sold for 80 cents, 85 
cents or 90 cents suddenly started selling for a dollar. The same 
thing will happen again. Everything that now sells for $1.75 will 
now suddenly be selling for $2. It is not fair. This negative effect 
is not fair for consumers who will have to pay a little more for 
each purchase.
<P>
	All the business people who will have to buy another cash 
register will pass the cost on in the goods and services they sell 
to their customers. Basically, the consumers will be the ones to 
pay. On the pretext of saving $250 million, the federal 
government is handing another bill to the consumers, who will 
have to pay two or three times more. This is unimaginative, 
would you not say, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	Besides, this is not a new approach. The federal government 
has often passed a debt on to the provinces or the municipalities 
in order to save money and reduce its deficit. In this case, it is 
passing the debt on to the consumer.
<P>
	Furthermore, this measure not only does not help the 
economy, it may even have an inflationary effect on certain 
items. It may even be said to have a slowing down effect, 
dragging the economy down. Here again, this is not helping 
private enterprise, which is being stuck with a needless 
expenditure, one it never asked for. There is no money in this for 
private enterprise.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	No business asked for this, except perhaps bus companies 
which could benefit from the elimination of the $2 bill. There 
would be no more $2 paper money. People would probably have 
to use one dollar coins. In other words, what I am trying to tell 
the parliamentary secretary is that there may be other ways to 
solve the problem caused by $2 bills in bus fare boxes.
<P>
	To introduce a $2 coin at this time, given the present 
economic situation in Canada, with its crushing debt load and 
cuts to social programs and elsewhere, could possibly slow 
down the economy, because of the additional costs to the 
system. The government is considering expenses the private 
sector finds useless. It will cause consumers to spend more for 
the sake of saving a few million dollars.
<P>
	Again, we, in the Bloc, believe Canada should save money, 
but not just any which way and at any cost. If, to try to save $250 
million, you ask consumers to pay $400 million, what kind of 
saving is it? The parliamentary secretary mentioned the fact that 
the reaction from the public was very positive, that people were 
enthusiastic, and that the $1 coin had become the ever popular 
loonie. We were given the impression that the public agreed, and 
so did associations and merchants, but this is not the case at all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12831"> 12831 </A></B>
<P>
	The majority of merchant associations and consumer 
associations were not consulted. Only a few were consulted, and 
some said they felt the government was going too fast. 
Consumer and merchant associations remember the costly 
introduction of the $1 coin which was not readily accepted by 
the public and is not quite entirely accepted yet. Its impact was 
not very positive. It took some time to get used to it. Right from 
the start, the coin was found to be too heavy, too big, and 
unacceptable. This was a mistake.
<P>
	The consumer and merchant associations I consulted told me 
that the government was going too fast. It might make another 
mistake and introduce a coin which might be heavier, bigger, 
and even less acceptable for the public, and which will be of no 
help to the private sector or retail business and will hurt them. It 
will cost shopkeepers at least $400 million more to adapt to this 
new coin and, in the end, consumers will have to foot the bill.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves whose interests the government is 
defending? Who exactly are we serving here? For whom do 
politicians work? To whom are we accountable? Is the 
government taking these measures just to solve some small 
problem of its own? By creating this $2 coin, we might be 
solving problems only for the Royal Canadian Mint, while 
ignoring those of the business people and the population.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary argued that the Royal Canadian 
Mint will have the opportunity to develop an industry and 
compete with other similar industries over the world, even sell 
$2 coins to the United States maybe. But can he explain why the 
Royal Canadian Mint is unable to compete on the international 
market right now? Why does it need a $2 coin? We already have 
the nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar coin; we could 
mint 2, 5 and 10 dollar coins for other countries.
<P>
	Is helping the Royal Canadian Mint compete internationally a 
good enough reason to introduce a two dollar coin in Canada, 
when in fact, the Royal Mint is quite capable of competing on 
the international market as things stand right now? Are we 
creating that coin just to please the Royal Canadian Mint? 
Should we not first try to find out if the public wants such a 
thing? Do shopkeepers and business people want that coin? That 
is the question.
<P>
	Before we implement a change as important as this one, it 
seems to me we should get to the bottom of the issue and ask 
ourselves who we are supposed to serve. I happen to think we are 
here to serve the public. Therefore, before doing anything else, 
we should consult the public. We should find out if Canadians 
really agree with the introduction of a $2 coin.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary says that everybody agrees. 
Everyone wants coins, they love the loonie, the ``ever popular 
loonie'', as he said. Yet, when you look at the poll which was 
conducted, you wonder whether it was not also orchestrated to 
please the Royal Canadian Mint.
<P>
	The were two polls, the one we are interested in was done this 
year or at least the results were released this year. In fact, this is 
the only poll done this year by Environics, although it was in two 
parts. It shows that, deep down, there is a strong reluctance in 
the public.
<P>
	The company did one poll that showed that about 50 per cent 
of the people said no, absolutely not, no $2 coin. Another 50 per 
cent said maybe, they hesitated. And this was interpreted as a 
positive response, 50 per cent said yes.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary did not talk about the people who 
are against it. Environics redid the poll a second time and talked 
to the same 1,000 people-because they only talked to 1,000 
people in Sherbrooke, Toronto and Calgary. They repolled the 
same 1,000 persons and they told them that the country would be 
saving $250 million. That second time, of course, the 
acceptance rate jumped to almost 80 per cent. Sure, everybody is 
in favour of motherhood and apple pie.
<P>
	Everybody in Canada wants to save money. Nobody in Canada 
would refuse the government a chance to save. But did they take 
the time to explain to these people that it will also cost a lot of 
money to merchants and consumers? No, they did not take the 
time to explain that. They did not take the time to explain the 
other possibilities or to do a thorough polling to try to avoid the 
mistake made when the $1 coin was introduced. There was a big 
mistake made at the time. We know that.
<P>
	When you look back at the history of our currency, you realize 
that there was a very strong opposition to the loonie. People 
were saying it was not real money, it was just a piece of metal of 
the wrong colour and it was far too big and too heavy.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	But worst of all, the government did not take the time to 
inform the people. It did not launch, let us say, an advertising or 
information campaign to explain to citizens the need for this 
coin. It could have consulted people and put some effort into 
producing a coin that would perhaps be less bulky, lighter and 
more original, but it did not do so.
<P>
	Once a coin is introduced, we are stuck with it for the rest of 
our lives. We cannot change it. The same thing can be said of the 
loonie. A mistake was made and this is not the ever popular 
loonie. Even in Kingston, as in cities everywhere, banks have 50 
million loonies in their strongrooms, because this coin is not 
circulating. People did not accept it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12832"> 12832 </A></B>
<P>
	Here we are stuck with perhaps 50 million loonies which are 
not in circulation, quite a load. Obviously, in Kingston as 
elsewhere in the country, we will witness the same reluctance to 
use the $2 coin and it is already happening. I sense it myself but 
one has only to speak to people in the streets, on the buses and so 
on to see that people do not want a $2 coin. People did not accept 
the loonie, so why would there not be even greater reluctance to 
use a bigger and heavier coin?
<P>
	Of course such reluctance is normal, because the idea is new. 
But if we decide to eliminate the $2 bill, for example, it will be a 
new experience too.
<P>
	The government lacks imagination and vision. It does not take 
the time to really think things through. Even if, for some, the 
introduction of a $2 coin will not change the world, one has to 
take the time to do one's job. The Department of Public Works 
certainly did not do its job in this case; besides the minister did 
not even bother coming here to defend his bill this morning. Or 
rather, the hon. minister is here in spirit, smiling through his 
colleagues.
<P>
	I note, however, certain factors that clearly indicate to me that 
the minister is not particularly interested in defending his bill as 
I would have liked him to.
<P>
	Polls which unfortunately are made to serve the interests of 
the Royal Canadian Mint, but polls which are also incomplete, 
very incomplete, and which repeat the errors of the past, which 
do not consider two other alternatives that must be considered, 
that the government could consider, with the same regard for 
economy and with a greater respect for the general public.
<P>
	If, for example, the government took a close look at the 
situation, maybe it would realize that this is not the right 
moment to introduce a $2 coin. Maybe this is not the time. 
Maybe we should maintain for some time the current system 
with the $2 paper bill. Maybe the timing is not right. Maybe the 
retailers do not want to be involved in another change, when 
they are already being buffeted by changes in taxation and forms 
coming from the government. Another government 
requirement, more useless spending by the government. Maybe 
this is not the right time. Maybe this is a lack of judgment on the 
government's part, bad timing, and if the government really, 
sincerely wanted to save money, it could do it elsewhere.
<P>
	I could suggest many ways to save those $250 million. The 
Minister of Public Works could himself abolish the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities agency, something that has been 
suggested to him many times, because we know that this agency 
spends its money very freely, making gifts to this one and that 
one. We read in the newspapers that the minister, who does not 
have the best reputation in the government when it comes to his 
handouts, could, by abolishing the agency which spends 
between $300 million and $500 million every year, have saved a 
much greater amount that the savings that we are supposedly 
making by issuing a two dollar coin.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	There are all sorts of reasons and examples that we can give to 
encourage the government to save $250 million. Also, there is a 
second alternative. First, we can maintain the current situation 
and continue for a while, because the timing is bad for 
merchants and consumers. The other alternative that the 
government did not even consider and that I suggest simply 
because I too am interested in savings, is to abolish the two 
dollar denomination, whether paper or coin, as was done in the 
United States.
<P>
	In the past-I have a $2 bill, I had a $2 bill in my hand-there 
was a $2 bill in the United States. I was in New York when they 
abolished it. There was no problem with that. There are no $2 
bills any more in the United States. It is not the only country in 
the world that has abolished the two dollar bill. The 
parliamentary secretary mentioned that a two dollar bill had 
been introduced in Great Britain. But that is not true. In Britain, 
it was abolished, and several other countries simply abolished 
the two dollar denomination.
<P>
	Some countries did convert it into a coin, but others did not. 
The parliamentary secretary seemed to want to mention only 
those who converted it into a coin. Many countries have 
abolished the two dollar denomination, and if they did, so can 
Canada. That could be very well received. It is not as if we 
wanted to abolish the 1 cent coin or another denomination 
essential to counting money. A $2 bill is not like a cent. To 
abolish the cent would have a devastating impact because we 
would be abolishing a unit essential to counting money. But the 
$2 bill is not essential, for that purpose. The proof of that, I 
repeat, is that other countries did it successfully.
<P>
	That is what I am suggesting to the government. If we kept the 
present $2 bill for a while or if we simply removed it for some 
time, the government would save more money than by 
introducing a $2 coin.
<P>
	This way, private business would not have to spend another 
$400 million to no real puprpose. Municipalities would not be 
forced to spend money replacing parking meters, vending 
machines, cash registers and all sorts of other business machines 
all across Canada. We would save a lot of money, and even the 
government would save.
<P>
	If the government decided to eliminate the $2 bill, it would 
still be possible to reintroduce it later, if it was considered a 
mistake or if the public did not accept the change. By contrast, 
once the $2 coin is introduced, we will already have spent $400 
million. The damage will already have been done. If it were 
abolished later on because the public did not accept it, the 
private sector would still have made unnecessary investments.
<P>
	Some say that perhaps the timing is wrong, since the 
government is considering the introduction of a $5 coin. Some 
coun-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12833"> 12833 </A></B>
<P>
tries, Australia for instance, introduced a $5 coin. By the way, in 
Australia, the $2 and $5 coins have not been accepted yet.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	At least the government understood that this is not the right 
time to issue a five dollar coin. They have understood that at 
least. They say: We may issue a five dollar coin in five or ten 
years from now. Why not wait and issue the two coins at the 
same time? Why now? What is the hurry? Why impose 
unnecessary expenses on the private sector? Why not wait for 
technological advances?
<P>
	As we all know, we live in a rapidly changing society. I, for 
one, pay my newspaper with a credit card. I do not use spare 
change very often. People, at least in my town, use credit cards 
or debit cards issued by their caisses populaires to make 
purchases at their convenience store or supermarket. Plastic 
may be the way of the future.
<P>
	New technologies could make currency obsolete a few years 
from now. Why should we have a bill which will force 
unnecessary expenses on merchants and tax consumers even 
more, when we know that in a few years from now technology 
will make coins obsolete? I believe this bill shows a lack of 
foresight, intelligence and vision.
<P>
	This government is clumsy. Obviously they have not done 
their homework. Even their argument regarding fare boxes in 
buses is clumsy. They claim that there will be no more two dollar 
bills obstructing fare boxes and that using two one dollar coins 
instead will solve the problem.
<P>
	Some say that, if we eliminate the $2 coin, we will end up with 
a lot of small change in our pockets, with many more $1 coins. 
We will keep them in our pockets instead of leaving them in the 
bank. Obviously, if a $2 coin is introduced, we will have more 
change in our pockets anyway. Having one $2 coin is no better 
for us than having two $1 coins. What I am saying is that four 
quarters are still equal to a dollar, but that in the end we are 
forcing shopkeepers to spend considerable amounts.
<P>
	My government colleagues disagree, arguing that people in 
Canada are weak and vulnerable; that they do not know how to 
count; that they are used to the $2 bill; that if this bill is 
eliminated, they will have trouble counting to two. These 
arguments come from the Liberals.
<P>
	I think that people are smart enough to figure out that one plus 
one is two. They do not necessarily need a $2 coin.
<P>
	Another argument from the government-as the 
parliamentary secretary put forward a moment ago-is that this 
coin would be a symbol of our national heritage. Just imagine! 
Some Liberal members also told me that a Canadian $2 coin 
would enhance the Canadian identity and makes us different 
from the Americans, who do not have a $2 coin. What an 
argument.
<P>
	The Canadian identity must be pretty fragile if we need a $2 
bill to maintain it. That is a pretty weak argument.
<P>
	The issue of future developments must also be considered. 
The parliamentary secretary talked about all the other countries 
in the world, listing a few-like England-that have introduced 
a $2 coin. He said that England had issued a $2 coin which, in 
fact, has been eliminated. He is showing bias in his remarks, 
stating that several countries have issued a $2 coin, although a 
number of them have eliminated it.
<P>
	The way of the future is not so clear. Either we eliminate the 
two dollar denomination or we introduce a coin. Both examples 
can be found in this country. The other way is perhaps to act 
prudently and wait for technological developments to see if 
credit cards and plastic money could do the job instead.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps now is not the time to make such a change, requiring 
business and private enterprise to pay out up to $400 million for 
the sole purpose of alleviating a government concern. You know, 
many reasons militate against passing this bill, but the main 
reason that I would like to call to your attention is the fact that it 
was brought forward by the Minister of Public Works, who has 
quite a reputation.
<P>
	The minister has already introduced legislation, namely Bill 
C-52, which had to be put off indefinitely because it was flawed. 
The minister was trying to introduce through this legislation a 
means of competing with private enterprise, in particular with 
the Canadian architectural and consulting engineering sector. 
There was a general outcry across the country and it was decided 
not to go any further with this bill. Bill C-52 was never seen 
again.
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of Public Works lacks good judgment in 
his bills. Here is another example: this ongoing competition 
with Canada Post, which competes unfairly with courier 
companies. Again, the minister seems to encourage unfair 
competition with private enterprise, which goes to show that 
this minister does not care very much about the business and 
industrial community. This is a minister who has, time and time 
again, squandered the taxpayers'money. And the list goes on. If 
I had more time, I could give you more examples of how this 
particular minister diverts funds, wastes money and does not do 
his job, because what we have here is a perfect example of a 
minister not doing his job.
<P>
	We, Bloc members, care about savings and there are great 
savings to be made. Perhaps this is not the right time to be 
introducing Bill C-82, as it entails major transition costs. This 
measure will cost businesses and consumers a bundle, and 
introducing a $2 coin will not solve the problem with the $1 
coin. We suggest that the government do its job, that is to say put 
out feelers to check whether or not the time is right to be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12834"> 12834 </A></B>
<P>
introducing something like this or if other alternatives should be  
explored, like eliminating the two-dollar denomination 
altogether, which was not done. This should be done because we 
stand to save even more by eliminating the two-dollar 
denomination.
<P>
	It would also add an element of flexibility, since a two-dollar 
coin could still be introduced in the future, if need be. At least, 
this would be a more prudent, economical move. All I have to 
say to the Minister of Public Works is: ``Do your job, because 
you have not done it so far''.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind our 
colleagues from the maritimes and Ontario that, this year, trade 
between Quebec and the rest of Canada will amount to over $70 
billion in goods and services. In Ontario, hundreds of thousands 
of jobs are tied to exports to Quebec. As for the maritimes, let us 
just say that access to the Quebec market accounts for a large 
part of their GDP.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it: the Quebec market is the second 
export market for the rest of Canada. Ontario's three largest 
private employers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, would really suffer 
if they were to suddenly lose the Quebec market, which absorbs 
one quarter of their total production.
<P>
	The federalists' bluff must be denounced. If Quebec becomes 
sovereign, no politician from Ontario or the maritimes in this

for the economy of their respective ridings. Negotiating the 
maintenance of a common economic space will then be a

Mr. Speaker, every May New Westminster, British Columbia

<P>
	This year marks 125 years of these May day festivities. The

continues to be the longest running celebration of its kind in the 
British Commonwealth. Children dancing with ribbons around 
the maypole, parades, music and fun fill the week.
<P>
	Dignitaries from many countries including Queen Elizabeth 
II have joined the festival in past years which includes marching 
bands from across Canada and the United States, as well as 
traditional cannon shots in memory of Queen Victoria, done

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recent estimates of the size of the underground economy range 
from $20 billion to $140 billion per year. Even at the low end of 
the range the loss of revenue to Canada is significant enough to 
warrant the urgent attention of all Canadians.
<P>
	When a consumer is offered a lower price in return for a cash 
payment and no invoice not only are they condoning tax evasion, 
they are also hurting honest taxpayers. Under the table 
economic activity creates unfair competition to honest 
businesses, resulting in bankruptcies and loss of jobs. It means 
lost revenue necessary to sustain health, education and other 
essential eco-

nomic and social programs, and it means honest  taxpayers must 
bear the burden of those who do not pay their fair share.
<P>
	The preferred approach to reducing the underground economy 
is voluntary compliance. Therefore I call on all Canadians to 
just say no to tax evaders. If everyone pays their fair share we 
will all pay less.

Speaker, I stand in the House today in order to raise an extremely 
important but often ignored problem in Canada. Learning 
disabilities presently affect between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of 
the population, which translates into two or three children in 
every classroom. With the proper guidance these Canadians, 
with average to above average intelligence, are quite capable of 
functioning normally in mainstream society.

	Such guidance is increasingly provided by such organizations 
as the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada. Since 1963

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
wonderful world of politics, it is not unusual to see signs of 
government posturing after it makes dubious decisions or 
budgetary choices that are in the very least debateable.
<P>
	Yesterday, in a very clumsy attempt to deflect criticism, the 
Prime Minister's behaviour was a prime example of this when 
he tried to justify the federal grant for the construction of a new 
arena in Winnipeg under the pretext that it was needed for the 
1999 Pan American Games.
<P>
	I would like to mention a few facts which should debunk this 
myth. First, Winnipeg's designation as host of the games was 
not contingent on it building a new arena. Second, the list of 
competitive sports featured in 1999 will only be issued in 
September 1995, and hockey is never featured at summer 
games. Last, an arena with a capacity of 22,000 is not needed for 
volleyball competitions: a capacity of 17,000, such as in the 
current arena, suffices. So how can the government continue to 
maintain that this grant is not an attempt to save the Jets?

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Thursday, May 25, is missing children's day. Every 
year in Canada police receive thousands of reports of missing 
children. The overwhelming majority of these cases, about 
45,000, are runaway children. Too frequently these runaway 
children turn to the streets and engage in delinquent activities as 
a means of support. This makes them extremely vulnerable to 
further violence and exploitation while on the streets.
<P>
	A cornerstone of the federal government's efforts to protect 
Canadian children is the RCMP's missing children's registry. In 
operation since 1986, the registry is the major source of 
computerized information on missing children in Canada. It 
supports the efforts of Canadian and international police and 
concerned agencies in the search and recovery of missing 
children.
<P>
	The RCMP has also joined forces with National Revenue 
Canada and citizenship and immigration in a joint initiative 
called ``Our Missing Children''. This partnership has resulted in 
a significant increase in the recovery and safe return of missing 
children here and abroad.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last night in the debate among the party leaders 
running in the Ontario election campaign, we again had the 
pleasure of listening to Lyn McLeod, leader of the Liberal Party 
of Ontario.
<P>
	With great eloquence and sincerity, she showed that she is 
ready to take over the reins of the government in Ontario. Her 
style, clear and forthright, reflects her firm resolve to serve the 
people of Ontario.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that Lyn McLeod is worthy of 
representing her fellow citizens. A few weeks from now, 
Ontarians will at last be free and unencumbered by the savage

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In the context of the announcement of $20 million in direct 
assistance to the Winnipeg Jets, Izzy Asper, the head of a group 
of businessmen trying to acquire the hockey team, has 
confirmed that discussions on federal funding for the Jets have 
been going on for a long time.
<P>
	Would the Deputy Prime Minister confirm Mr. Asper's 
statement that discussions have been going on for a while 
between the federal government and the promoters trying to 
save the Winnipeg Jets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the 
member is mistaken. There is no direct assistance for the Jets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, pardon 
me if I laugh. Answers like that are a laugh for everyone.
<P>
	Yesterday, the President of Treasury Board confirmed having 
found funding for the Winnipeg Jets with the cancellation of a 
$35 million highway contract. In the meantime, however, the 
Prime Minister was stating in this House that the funding had 
come from the cancellation of a series of small projects worth $3 
million, under the infrastructure program.
<P>
	My question is simple and straightforward and, I am hoping 
for an answer from the Deputy Prime Minister. Would she tell us 
clearly which projects were cancelled to pay for the 
government's $20 million subsidy to the Winnipeg Jets?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the very specific 
project that was referred to was a $30 million overpass near a 
CN mainline, and the member will know that the overpass 
project was opposed by many constituents. I personally received 
letters as Minister of the Environment in opposition to the 
project. The decision was made by the local community not to 
proceed with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
owners of the Winnipeg Jets will decide next Thursday whether 
the franchise will remain in Winnipeg. The federal government, 
for its part, yesterday agreed to pay $20 million toward the 
construction of the new arena the Jets need.
<P>
	Would the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether the federal 
government's funding is conditional on the Jets' remaining in 
Winnipeg or whether it will still be provided to build a 
22,000-seat arena even if the Jets leave Winnipeg?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in putting the 
infrastructure system in place, we gave municipalities and 
provinces the option of making their own decisions.
<P>
	We do not agree with the comments by the Leader of the 
Opposition, Lucien Bouchard, who has a hard time believing 
that Ottawa would spend public funds to refloat a hockey team. 
In his opinion, the federal government would be wrong to invest 
in Quebec City or in Winnipeg.
<P>
	We do not agree with this approach, because we feel that, if 
the mayor of Quebec City chooses a project, he should be 
entitled to proceed with his choice. This is why we agreed to 
fund the infrastructure program in Winnipeg, just as we did in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is also for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister of Canada seems to be the only 
one not to know that she has just given the Winnipeg Jets $20 
million. The premier of Manitoba and the mayor of Winnipeg 
both are not hiding the fact that they want to save the Jets 
franchise.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister put $20 million in a 
22,000-seat arena for the Winnipeg Jets, without any business 
plan, whereas, last year, the attendance figure per game was 
12,500 on the average and the team has lost $30 million over the 
past four years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we did what people in 
Winnipeg and Manitoba wanted, just as we did when we decided 
to fund the congress centre in Quebec City, at the request of 
Mayor L'Allier who said, and I quote: ``The congress centre has 
been a regional priority for the past ten years. Economic 
spin-offs are proven. We cannot sideline the centre which, year 
after year, employs thousands of people in the hotel and catering 
industry, for some infrastructure this area does not need, but 
which is needed by one company to survive here. This is the 
reason why I cannot support Marcel Aubut's approach''. This is 
exactly what the mayor of Quebec City said.
<P>
	We respect Quebec City's decision to spend money on a 
congress centre, just as we respect the wish of people in 
Winnipeg to spend infrastructure money on an arena.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12839"> 12839 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why is the Deputy Prime Minister refusing to admit that the 
federal government uses double standards when it deals with 
Quebec? Indeed, when asked to come to the rescue of MIL 
Davie-the industry minister knows this well-and its 
thousands of workers, who do not skate for one million dollars a 
year, the government demands to see a business plan, but when it 
comes to the Winnipeg Jets, the money is paid without 
conditions or guarantees.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we respect the will of 
cities to make their own economic decisions. Quebec City chose 
a congress centre and received $25 million from the federal 
government.
<P>
	Similarly, Winnipeg chose to build an arena to promote 
economic development; this is why we are giving this city its 
fair share, just as we gave it to Quebec city for its congress 
centre, the first project awarded under the infrastructure 
program.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hockey fans and businesses in Winnipeg deserve a great deal of 
credit. They have come together and are well on their way to 
keeping the Jets in Winnipeg and in Canada.
<P>
	What I have to question, however, is why infrastructure 
money is being used to build luxury boxes and to subsidize a 
professional hockey team. This program was supposed to 
improve sewer systems and make Canadian highways safer. 
Instead, it is going toward boccie courts, the Calgary 
Saddledome millionaire club, and the Peter Pocklington bottom 
line. The infrastructure program is a failure.
<P>
	How does the Deputy Prime Minister justify Manitoba's 
reallocation of infrastructure funding?
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> In the same way we justified the 
decision by the city of Calgary to finance infrastructure funding 
for the Saddledome.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Deputy Prime Minister is quite right that it is up to the province 
or the city and they make their request. However, the issue is 
why the infrastructure program is designed in such a way as to 
make hockey arenas, museums, and other sports facilities a 
legitimate expense.
<P>
	Canada's sewers and roadways are deteriorating. It will cost 
taxpayers billions of dollars to replace them. Infrastructure that 
benefits the maximum number of taxpayers should be the goal, 
not political gain.
<P>
	Where will the money come from for the real infrastructure 
spending that will be required?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed that the 
member for Calgary, the city that hosted the Olympics, and the 
world had an opportunity to see his great city, is now saying that 
infrastructure is a bad investment.
<P>
	Infrastructure in sports is also about nation building. That is 
why I am sure he would not want to turn his back on the 
infrastructure spending that paved the way for the Calgary 
Olympics, nor would he want to turn his back on the 
infrastructure spending that made it possible for the 
Saddledome.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, true 
infrastructure spending is fine, but direct subsidies to the private 
sector are not fine. The taxpayers are against that.
<P>
	We learned yesterday that the save the Jets group in Winnipeg 
is considering applying for charitable status. That would make 
every donation tax deductible, and then tax weary Canadians 
would be picking up even more of the tab. The Minister of 
National Revenue said it was out of the question. However, the 
Manitoba Entertainment Centre applied for charitable status six 
weeks ago. Since the Jets have received so much government 
money and will be receiving more now, they should consider 
renaming themselves the Winnipeg Challenger Jets.
<P>
	Will either the Deputy Prime Minister or the representative of 
revenue and taxation assure the House and Canadians that the 
Jets and their supporters will not receive charitable status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member exhibits 
what I hope is an unintentional misunderstanding of the 
infrastructure program. He says there are direct subsidies. There 
are no direct subsidies.
<P>
	What we have done for Winnipeg is exactly the same thing we 
did for Calgary at the request of the former mayor of Calgary, 
Premier Ralph Klein, who endorsed the Saddledome funding.
<P>
	Frankly, I did not see the member for Calgary stand up and 
complain about the Calgary Olympics; he did not stand up and 
complain about the Calgary Saddledome. Heavens, he should 
not stand up and complain about the Winnipeg arena, which is 
going to permit a Canadian national institution to stay in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that $5 million out of the 
$20 million spent on saving the Winnipeg Jets came from the 
Pan American Games budget. Yet, no event featured in these 
games requires a 22,000 seat arena.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12840"> 12840 </A></B>
<P>
	Since no event featured in the Pan American Games requires 
building a 22,000 seat arena, will the Deputy Prime Minister 
admit that, by taking $5 million from the federal contribution to 
the Pan American Games and giving it to the Winnipeg Jets, the 
government is in fact misappropriating public funds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in fact, just as we will 
accept the decisions made by the Québec 2002 committee as to 
the need for a renewed infrastructure, should that city be 
selected, we accept the decision made by the Pan American 
Games committee to set aside $5 million, precisely because it 
wanted to put in place the infrastructure required for future Pan 
American Games in Canada. We respect the committee's 
decision, just as we will respect those of the Québec 2002 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's response makes no sense. This is 
appalling.
<P>
	Since Winnipeg hosted the Pan American Games in 1967 and 
has just been selected as host of the 1999 games, in particular 
because it already has all the facilities required, why does the 
Deputy Prime Minister refuse to admit that the Prime Minister 
was the first to authorize the misappropriation of $5 million 
solely to serve the political interests of the human resources 
development minister, who is the person responsible for 
Manitoba and the member for Winnipeg South Centre?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I find 
unfortunate and dishonest-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> -about the opposition's stance is their claim that 
what we did for Winnipeg, we are not willing to do in other 
cases.
<P>
	We simply respected Quebec City's decision, which was 
supported twice by Mayor Jean-Paul L'Allier, to build a 
convention centre in order to promote its economic 
development.
<P>
	In the same way, we have accepted the request made by the 
City of Winnipeg and the Manitoba government, which feel that 
this infrastructure is important to Winnipeg's economic 
development.
<P>
	If you agree with the principle that Quebec City is free to 
make its own decisions, why do you not accept it for other 
cities?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I must remind you that you 
should always address the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to set 
the record straight for the Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre publicly denounced the government 
for the misuse of infrastructure funds on  the Saddledome in 
Calgary. To bring him into it is absolutely unfair and uncalled 
for.
<P>
	I want to continue to shed light on the Liberals' bailout of the 
Winnipeg professional hockey team. She did not answer the 
question. The Manitoba entertainment complex has asked for 
charitable status. Will she, on behalf of her government, 
unequivocally state that the government will not give the 
Manitoba entertainment complex or any organization related to 
this unconscionable bailout charitable status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no bailout.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
ask the question again. Will the Deputy Prime Minister 
unequivocally state on behalf of her government that there will 
be no special status, no further tax grab from the Canadian 
wallet?
<P>
	Is there anything she does not understand about my question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that the 
basic premise of the member's question is false. There is no 
bailout of any hockey team.
<P>
	I am astonished the Reform Party, which swept into office in 
western Canada on the wave of allowing people to have their say 
locally, is now prepared to turn its back on the local initiative of 
the city of Winnipeg that sees this is a priority. Who are you-
<P>

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Perhaps we will finally get an answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Since he itabled his budget on February 27, the 
Minister of Finance keeps repeating that, next year, the cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces will represent only a $350 
million shortfall for Quebec, mocking the $650 million figure 
put forward by the official opposition.
<P>
	Yesterday however, in his testimony before the finance 
committee, Bill Murphy, a senior official at the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12841"> 12841 </A></B>
<P>
Finance, assessed this shortfall at $625 million, which is very 
close to the amount put forward by the official opposition.
<P>
	In light of the statements made by finance officials, does the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs still maintain, as his 
colleague from finance does, that cuts in the Canada social 
transfer will translate into a $350 million shortfall for Quebec in 
1996-97, and not $650 million as suggested by the official 
opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, there are three factor affecting transfers to the 
Province of Quebec: equalization payments, tax points and cash 
payments.
<P>
	When Bloc members or the Parti Quebecois finance minister 
quote an amount of approximately $650 million, they are not 
taking into account tax points or equalization payments, or both.
<P>
	I repeat that the exact shortfall figure, when you factor in the 
reduced transfers to Quebec and these three sources, is only 
$350 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government has control over its cash 
transfers to the provinces and those are the transfers that were 
cut back in the last budget. These cuts total $650 million for 
Quebec. The federal government's own officials said so 
yesterday. They are the ones who brief the Minister of Finance 
and they should brief this government.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs persist in 
denying the facts, if not to conceal from Quebec until after the 
referendum the true extent of Ottawa's cuts to social program 
funding? The shortfall will reach $650 million next year.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, one cannot conceal the truth by playing with 
figures. It was clearly set out in the agreements negotiated by 
the federal government and the provinces-read them-that 
transfers to Quebec would be in the form of tax points and cash 
payments.
<P>
	Also, equalization payments are not freebies given for one 
reason or another to the provinces. These payments are made to 
have-not provinces, so that all the provinces, rich or poor, can 
offer comparable levels of public services. Consider that more 
than 60 per cent of provincial expenditures are social 
expenditures. So, equalization payments are clearly part and 
parcel of the transfers designed to fund social programs.
<P>
	Logic demands that the three types of transfers be taken into 
account in determining that the shortfall is only $350 million.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Industry thinks that highly paid CEOs set a bad 
example for ordinary Canadian workers. I think I have heard it 
all now.
<P>
	The minister is eligible to receive $1.5 million in pension 
payments in a plan that is three times more generous than the 
best private sector plans. What kind of an example does he think 
this sends to the ordinary Canadian workers who are paying for 
it?
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to explain exactly the point I made in a 
speech I gave to the Canadian Association of Family Enterprises 
last week.
<P>
	At this stage in our economic cycle when corporate profits are 
recovering, which is a very good sign, it is time for Canadians to 
continue to invest in further productivity gains and further 
competitiveness as we had through the economic cycle.
<P>
	We have been very successful in gaining competitive points 
vis-a-vis the rest of the world although much of it has 
unfortunately been based on our exchange rate. We need to 
continue to save and continue to invest.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast have lived on no increase in 
family income on average over the past 10 years. They will be 
asked by their corporate leaders to continue to keep their belts 
tight as federal public servants have and as all members of the 
House of Commons have by not taking a wage increase in over 
five years. The time is not yet to start raising wages. The time is 
now to continue to invest and save.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
respectively suggest that the minister and the government 
should save their managerial advice for the companies that 
managed to lose over $35 billion last year.
<P>
	I wonder what business the government and the minister think 
they have commenting on the issue of private compensation 
when yesterday the government, in alliance with the separatists, 
decided that it would refuse to hear testimony from private 
citizens, from private organizations and from ordinary 
taxpayers on the issue of MP pensions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think one point needs to be made very clearly. I made 
the point in the interview I gave based on that speech. I really do 
not have any particular interest in what any CEO is paid. I am 
not a shareholder of any of the companies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12842"> 12842 </A></B>
<P>
	However what is clear is that Canada stands poised to succeed 
very well on issues of competitiveness in the world. Now is the 
time for us to continue to save and invest.
<P>
	This man wants to talk about pensions. That is all they really 
think about. I will tell him something. When we deal with issues 
of compensation in the House, let us talk about what it costs 
many people to be here as well. Let us cost out what the forgone 
opportunities are. Then we will put everybody on an even 
footing.
<P>
	At the same time let us also recognize that members come to 
Ottawa to serve their constituents often at great cost to 
themselves and their families. We are looking for a recipe for 
continuing competitiveness in the world. In that way we will 
benefit all Canadians.

<P>
	Once again, the minister has refused to grant entry visas to 
three Algerian actors scheduled to participate in the Theatre 
Festival of the Americas, in Montreal. At the same time, we 
have learned that Mr. Abdennour who, according to the 
Quebec-Algeria committee, is a lawyer close to the Islamic 
salvation front, was granted a visa by the Canadian embassy, in 
Paris.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Immigration explain the fact that a 
person close to the Islamic salvation front can come to Canada 
without any problems, while Algerian actors who denounce 
torture and fundamentalism cannot do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is mistaken 
because the minister has refused no visitor visa to anyone. The 
visitor visa is done on a processed basis. It should be done fairly 
and not with any favouritism to anyone regardless of 
background.
<P>
	There are a million applications for visitor visas. Surely the 
member does not expect a minister or a government to be 
interventionist with visitor visa applications easily and loosely. 
Eighty-five per cent of all applications are approved.
<P>
	There is a process in place that if a visitor visa is refused, the 
remedy is to reapply and try to address some of the concerns. 
The member should know one of the three actors has gone to the 
embassy today to make such a formal reapplication. The other 
two actors have not seen fit to go back.
<P>
	We should allow the individuals to do as they please, rather 
than to force the issue and play politics on the backs of a visitor

<P>
	Given the obvious incompetence of his departmental officials 
at the Canadian embassy in Paris, who make surprising 
decisions almost on a daily basis, will the minister tell them to 
shape up, so as to put a stop to these errors in judgment, which 
have become too frequent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, his leader used to be a 
Canadian ambassador to France, situated in Paris. It was under 
his leader's jurisdiction as well that some visitor visa 
applications coming through France were accepted, some were 
refused, and some were reviewed. That was the process when his 
leader used to be a Canadian ambassador in France. That 
continues to be the process today.
<P>
	What I would suggest is that the situation in Algeria, by no 
means easy or by no means orderly, should be solved by the 
international community. What I would suggest to the hon. 
member, however, is that to utilize a visitor visa program for any 
one country is not the solution and it would jeopardize our 
visitor visa program internationally.
<P>
	There is a way to deal with refugee crises. There is a way to 
deal with how to utilize a country's forces to address a 
destabilized area. That solution, however, does not lie in a 
visitor visa program.

Canada a very competitive place in which to do business, more

means to Canadian workers, to Canadian business, and to 
Canada's role in the global community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

refers substantiates the conclusions of similar studies in the 
recent past that have emphasized Canada's highly competitive 
position in the global marketplace. Thanks to a number of

measures that have been taken, including such factors as payroll 
and benefits, material and energy inputs, taxes, research and  
development costs, and distribution costs, as the report notes, 
Canada has become increasingly competitive.
<P>
	I would want to emphasize that in creating jobs through such 
international competitiveness, the principal factor that is going 
to play in the future is the excellent budget the Minister of 
Finance brought down, which will increase further Canada's 
competitiveness.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
phone lines have been lighting up in my office in Ottawa and in 
my constituency over the Ebola virus. People believe that they 
are not being protected by their own government. They are 
frustrated with the health minister's non-answers to direct 
questions.
<P>
	Now that we have the minister in a forum where she cannot 
run away, I ask the minister why she chose to withhold 
information from Canadians regarding the number of people 
who have been detained at Pearson because they were suspected 
of carrying the Ebola virus.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no information has been withheld. We have been quite 
straightforward about describing the two individuals.
<P>
	The first individual arrived in Toronto. It had been three 
weeks since he had been in Zaire. The period of incubation had 
passed. The gentleman was nevertheless examined by a 
physician and was found to be in very good health.
<P>
	The second individual arrived in Toronto. He claimed that his 
mother had died after visiting Kikwit. He has been detained, is 
under quarantine. Nevertheless, he is in good health and has no 
signs of illness.
<P>

	Canadians need to know if they have a Minister of Health and 
a Minister of Immigration who have the wherewithal to take 
direct proactive measures to protect the health of Canadians.
<P>
	There is a simple solution to all of this. Will the immigration 
minister put Canadians' minds at ease by stopping the threat at 
the source? Will he place a temporary moratorium on visitors' 
visas from Zaire and surrounding regions until this disease is 
safely contained there?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find this member of 
Parliament irresponsible in the way he is trying to exploit the 
situation.
<P>
	What the member should do is take a page from the health 
critic of the Reform Party, who yesterday said-and he is a 
doctor-that the government's action and approach to dealing 
with this dilemma were ``sensible''.
<P>
	Today instead we have the immigration critic, who is not a 
doctor and not responsible or respectful of what his colleague 
said, saying his phone is lighting up and things are on the 
downslide. You are fearmongering, that is what you are doing.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Following a review of all outside research contracts awarded 
by the Department of Natural Resources in the last five years, 
we came to some pretty damning conclusions. Our study 
indicates that Quebec research centres and companies got only 
10 per cent of these contracts.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister justify the fact the 
Quebec gets less than half of its fair share of those outside 
research and development contracts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. Obviously, we are not responsible for 
the contracts awarded by the previous Conservative 
government. Obviously, we are not responsible for the funds 
allocated in the last five years.
<P>
	We will of course try to direct our grants on the basis of need. 
For example, a national pulp and paper centre was set up in 
Montreal, because that is where most of the interest and the 
technology in that field can be found. I do not think we will start 
to allocate funds according to regional development. We should 
instead spend the money where the expertise is, such as for 
mining in Abitibi and PAPRICAN in Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again, the Deputy Prime Minister just sold us a bill of goods.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said recently that he could 
not afford to be fair to Quebec in terms of the distribution of his 
department's spending. Are we to understand that the Deputy 
Prime Minister is in the same position and has neither the will

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	The government has legislation ready to be tabled in this 
House that would ban the importation of MMT, a gasoline 
enhancer. The ban is based solely on evidence provided by only 
one of the two vested groups, namely the Motor Vehicles 
Manufacturers' Association.
<P>
	The minister stated in the House on May 5 that ``any cabinet 
decision to move on MMT is supported by all ministers of the 
government''.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	By making this ban, is the minister setting a precedent of bias 
for the process of decision making for all the industries within 
the purview of government, including natural resources?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my supplemental question is for the same minister.
<P>
	By banning MMT her government is supporting the claims 
and data brought forward by only the MVMA. This must mean 
that the contrary scientific data from Ethyl Corporation is false 
and incorrect.
<P>
	What conclusive information does the minister have that 
discredits the data provided by Ethyl Corporation that would 
cause the government to side with the MVMA and thereby 
perhaps place the environment at greater risk?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure whether the hon. member has thought of a 
different use for the product we all buy at the pumps. Perhaps he 
has. I am not sure what it is. The last time I checked, most of it 
goes into motor vehicles.
<P>
	He will know that Canada has benefited very well from the 
fact that there is a very strong continental market in motor 
vehicles. We produce about 17 per cent of the North American 
production and we only consume about 8 per cent. That benefits 
us very directly in terms of jobs and economic growth.
<P>
	The vehicles that are being produced use the product at the 
pumps. It should have come to his attention that the new cars 
require fuel without MMT. If he would like to have his 
constituents purchasing vehicles that either cost a lot more or 
have their diagnostic systems unplugged, then he ought to be in 
support of keeping the MMT in the fuel. But until we find some 
other use for it-and perhaps he breathes it, I do not know-we 
have to have continental standards in fuel.

question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Aboriginal groups have criticized Bill C-68, the minister's 
gun control legislation. As a treaty and First Nations member, 
these criticisms are of great concern to me and I take them very 
seriously.
<P>
	Treaties form the fundamental relationship that exists 
between the First Nations and the Government of Canada. 
Treaty rights are recognized and protected under the Canadian 
Constitution. Will the minister tell the House and assure the 
aboriginal people of Canada that Bill C-68 will not take away, 
abrogate, or derogate these treaty rights?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the intention of 
this government to treat all Canadians fairly in connection with 
this legislation. We also are very much aware that aboriginal 
people have both aboriginal and treaty rights to hunt, and we 
intend to respect them.
<P>
	I learned for myself as I travelled the length and breadth of the 
country last year and visited aboriginal communities how 
firearms are often treated as a tool and how their use is very 
much a part of their way of life.
<P>
	The way we responded to this need is through consultation. 
Just after the action plan was tabled in the House last November 
30, some 690 letters went out with copies of the plan to the 
aboriginal leadership across Canada. We wrote again to those 
same 690 leaders of aboriginal communities early this year. We 
followed up, with the help of about 70 of them, in assembling 
one of the most comprehensive and unprecedented consultation 
processes known to the government. In nine regions of Canada 
we are meeting with representatives of rural, urban, on reserve 
and off reserve aboriginal persons. In the coming months we 
will conclude that very direct and personal discussion process to 
determine how this bill can be implemented in a manner that is 
sensitive to the reality of aboriginal lifestyles, culture, and 
treaty rights. We will then prepare regulations, which will be

<P>
	I must tell the hon. member today, as I have in the past, that 
commitment remains unchanged. We have long recognized the 
need to amend the human rights act as he has suggested, not only 
to add sexual orientation as a ground upon which discrimination 
is prohibited but in a variety of other important ways. This is to 
bring that act up to date to reflect improvements that have been 
introduced in provincial legislation on the same subject, to meet 
the needs identified by the chief commissioner of the Canadian

misspent money, cheques had been forged and the RCMP were

<P>
	North American security is threatened more on the 
environment than on any other front. Now the U.S. clean water 
act and the clean air act are under attack. We learned that the 
U.S. House of Representatives has diluted the clean water act 
making it easier for industry to continue polluting the Great 
Lakes with airborne dioxins and furans.

action is being taken to ensure the Great Lakes water quality 
agreement is upheld?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed the member 
has underlined a very serious concern. If the proposed 
amendments that have passed the House of Representatives 
proceed through the Senate without amendment, they will gut 
the current provisions of an international agreement which 
affects the drinking water of 50 million people on both sides of 
the border.
<P>
	The member will know the single largest international body of 
water is the Great Lakes. We do not intend to allow the Great 
Lakes water quality agreement to be watered down. We have

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been 
over one and one-half years since I was elected as a new member 
to this most important Chamber in the country. I came here full 
of hope and anticipation of what the democratic process would 
be. The breach of privilege of which I speak today is such a 
severe aberration and breach of the most fundamental premises 
of democracy that I am really sorry I have to raise it.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	I also recognize that what I am going to say is important. I 
realize your position, Mr. Speaker, is of tremendous importance 
here. In your office and in your person lies the ability to 
maintain the very basic premise of democracy and the rules 
under which it operates. I am asking today not only for your 
ruling, but also for your guidance because of my deep concerns.
<P>
	I want to specifically give the reasons for my complaint. I was 
a substitute authorized member of the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. I know, Mr. Speaker, you heard one question of 
privilege already and you ruled on that, but my problem is a 
different one and much more serious. It has to do with the 
conducting of a vote in that committee.
<P>
	Specifically, this is what happened. Our party moved an 
amendment. When the chairman of the committee called for the 
vote, we said yea. There was not a single nay heard. The 
chairman ruled that the motion had been defeated. Now that is so 
fundamental it is not even in the rule book. It is assumed in a 
democracy that when everybody who casts a vote says yea and 
the chairman says that it has been defeated that it is a flagrant 
and violent abuse of democracy such as we cannot tolerate if we 
want to maintain our system.
<P>
	The chairman declared that motion defeated and of course I 
immediately challenged the chair. When I did that, the chairman 
of the committee said that his ruling would stand. I objected and 
the chairman then invoked the rules of order which ask for the 
majority of the people in the committee to decide if the ruling of 
the chair stands. The Liberal majority woke up and they 
faithfully fell into line and supported the ruling of the chair. I 
could not accept that.
<P>
	This was such a serious aberration that I told the chairman he 
could not do that. He said he could. I suppose I should have 
apologized at that stage for becoming a little upset, but to me 
this was such a violent attack on the democratic process. I then 
moved to report  this incident to the Speaker because it was my 
understanding that such an issue could not come to you unless it 
was reported by the committee. I may be wrong here and I have 
some reasons for considering that I may be wrong, but that was 
my understanding at the time.
<P>
	I moved the motion that this be reported, but the chairman 
would not accept the motion and ruled it out of order. I told the 
chairman it could not be out of order. He then proceeded to ask if 
the ruling of the chair was sustained and the majority of the 
members present said yes. Now that is unbelievable. I cannot 
accept that.
<P>
	I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, that this be corrected. There 
must be some things the committee does not have 100 per cent 
autonomy to do. It cannot by vote alter the truth. This is a 
democratic tradition that has been upheld for so long that an 
arbitrary rule of a motion defeated when in fact it has passed 
cannot be accepted.
<P>
	If the majority of members were not paying attention and did 
not vote when they should have, just wishing that they would 
have been awake does not give them any justification for using 
their majority to override the previous vote. Only a person who 
voted on the side that won the vote can move a motion to 
reconsider. That was not done in this case. The chairman 
arbitrarily and incorrectly declared the vote lost and the 
members were not paying attention and chimed into his defence.
<P>
	This is so serious, Mr. Speaker, that I appeal to you that some 
corrective action be taken. As I said in my preamble, I do require 
your assistance as well as your ruling because I want to know 
how to handle this. This cannot be accepted by this Parliament, 
the highest court of the land, as such a serious aberration of the 
democratic process.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

Speaker, with great respect for the comments the hon. member 
has made, there is a procedure for dealing with this matter. With 
the greatest respect, I think the hon. member ought to follow that 
accepted procedure.
<P>
	The same point was raised in the House yesterday. Your 
Honour very properly ruled that there was not a question of 
privilege before the House because no report had been received 
from the committee.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is confused, again with great respect 
to him, because I know he is trying to raise a very serious 
concern. He misunderstood the import of Your Honour's ruling 
yesterday, which was that this cannot be brought before the 
House until there is a report from the committee. By that 
statement I think he is inferring that there must be a report on the 
incident from the committee or else he cannot raise the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12847"> 12847 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest that is not what Your Honour ruled or intended and it 
is not in accordance with the practice of the House. I refer the 
hon. member and Your Honour to citation 894 of Beauchesne's 
6th edition. I will read paragraphs (1) and (3) under the citation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Until the report and the <I>Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence</I> have been 
laid upon the Table, it is irregular to refer to them in debate, or to put questions 
in reference to the proceedings of the committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then I will skip to (3).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If alleged irregular proceedings take place in committee but are not referred 
to in the report that the committee presented to the House, then it is not 
competent for the House to go beyond that report to debate this matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member can clearly raise it in the House at the time 
the report comes. Whether it will be debated, he can raise it and 
ask Your Honour to rule. Certainly, there will be some indication 
in a report if there was a vote taken that something happened. 
There will be minutes of the proceedings of the committee 
indicating there was an appeal from the ruling of the chairman. 
That will be reported in the minutes of the committee and that 
will come to the House.
<P>
	All those things will be reported in there. The hon. member 
will be able to debate those and comment on them in the House 
and raise his question of privilege, if indeed there is a question 
of privilege here, when that report has come to the House. Then 
Your Honour will be seized of the matter, we will have the report 
before the House and will be able to make some comment.
<P>
	The difficulty and the reason that Speakers have taken the 
view that the proceedings in committees are not within the 
purview of the Chair is that until a committee has reported, the 
committee is master of its own proceedings. It may change what 
it has done and correct any errors. That is part of the reason for 
the rule. Committees can undo what they have done in certain 
circumstances and redo what they have done and thereby make 
them correct if there has been some error.
<P>
	I suggest it is incumbent upon the hon. member and his 
colleagues on the committee in question to go back to the 
chairman of the committee, raise the issues before the chair and 
seek to have the matter rectified in the committee. I think the 
hon. member knows that there have been efforts made to see that 
this happens.
<P>
	I suggest to him that the proper course to follow under the 
circumstances is to raise the matter with the chairman of the 
committee at another meeting of the committee instead of 
boycotting the meetings of the committee and make an effort to 
resolve the matter. I suggest if that is done it would be 
unnecessary for him to come to the House with a question of 
privilege. He would probably find that perhaps not all, but the 
majority of his concerns would be fully dealt with. He would 
realize the wisdom of the actions of the chair at one point or 
another in the proceedings and we could get the matter  resolved 
there, which with all due respect, is where it should be resolved.
<P>
	I do not want to suggest that this sort of thing has not 
happened before. I was in opposition before. I know how 
committees work. Sometimes things can happen in committees 
that hon. members feel strongly about and they wish had not 
happened. That happens on both sides of the House.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that I know in this case the chairman 
of the committee is eminently reasonable. If the hon. member 
will meet with the chairman in an effort to resolve the matter, I 
think there can be a satisfactory resolution so far as we can 
arrange it before the matter comes back to the House in the 
report. At that time if the member wishes to debate the 
proceedings of the committee, he is free to do so pursuant to the 
standing orders.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will listen to the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East.
<P>
	At this point, it is my interpretation that with what was 
brought up yesterday in the House there seems to be a slight 
variation on the whole thing. May I ask, was the hon. member 
present at the committee?
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will permit an intervention by the hon. 
member but it should deal precisely with this point and not refer 
to any other decision taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to a 
separate incident from the one I brought forward at a previous 
date because of a series of events that continues to happen in the 
committee.
<P>
	The Speaker has asked for us to wait for the report to the 
House. The problem is when incidents such as the one the hon. 
member for Elk Island has mentioned come up in committee and 
we ask it even to be reported to the House we are told it will not 
be reported to the House. We not only cannot debate but we 
cannot introduce amendments, we cannot ask questions of 
witnesses, we cannot in some cases even vote.
<P>
	Then when the votes happen sometimes they are overturned 
by the hammer of the chairman. Then when we raise these issues 
and say could it not be reported to the House we are told no. 
Then they appeal to the committee and the committee says it 
will not report it.
<P>
	We are at wits end. We cannot do any of the democratic roles 
of an opposition. We cannot do any of the things I have 
described, the legitimate role in opposition. When we want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12848"> 12848 </A></B>
<P>
raise it for investigation or for future reference we are told we 
cannot even do that. We cannot do any of the roles given to us, 
privileges as members of Parliament. When we raise points of  
privilege we are told they will not even be reported to the Chair.
<P>
	We are at wits end. We cannot fulfil our job, our duty and our 
responsibility to raise issues of great concern to Canadians. We 
really feel the Chair needs to intervene. This is the second case, I 
realize.
<P>
	The transcripts are in. We could start to go over them. There is 
a serious breach of democratic rights. We must get it addressed 
before this committee continues.
<P>
	To say we refuse now to attend is true. I cannot go to a 
committee in which the chairman says I have no rights and asks 
me to sit down.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will hear from the hon. parliamentary 
secretary first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my only reason for 
intervening is this incident has affected the Standing Committee 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	A Reform member came to bring in a motion that the 
chairman abide by the standing orders because of an incident 
which happened in that committee. I hope the Chair will not start 
intervening in the affairs of individual standing committees.
<P>
	Sometimes the opposition forgets it is in a minority position 
in committees, as it is in the House. There is a steering 
committee to decide the agenda. When something is put to a 
vote, as it was yesterday in our committee, the majority has to 
rule. Sometimes people are not satisfied with what the majority 
has voted on.
<P>
	I hope the Chair will respect the independence of each 
committee and that what goes on in one committee should not be 
brought to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will permit an intervention from the hon. 
House leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Before further intervention by members I would like them to 
stay within the confines of the point of privilege the hon. 
member for Elk Island has brought forth. Please do not go 
outside of these confines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I hesitate now to comment in light of the comments 
you just made. Would you give me permission to very briefly 
answer the concerns made by the parliamentary secretary?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> No. We are having a debate here. I do not want 
to get into debate. I want to stick precisely to the question of 
privilege. I am granting a great deal of leniency and latitude for 
all members.
<P>
	Again, I ask members to speak to the question of privilege. I 
do not want the House to be seized of a debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the issue raised by the hon. member this morning 
may be different from the incident raised yesterday.
<P>
	No doubt it is a parallel one involving the same committee. 
The Speaker's previous ruling on the issue brought by another 
hon. member the day before would be applicable to the case 
before the House this morning.
<P>
	Furthermore, yesterday the committee of procedure and 
House affairs, pursuant to part of the ruling by the Speaker, has 
been doing some preliminary work in the whole area of rules as 
they apply to the work of committees.
<P>
	We adopted a motion proposed by one of the members who 
has at least attempted to rise on a question of privilege this 
morning from the Reform Party to address those very rules.
<P>
	Earlier this morning there were informal negotiations to 
attempt to solve the dispute at hand. I do not want to describe 
them as it would be improper. I am hoping we will continue 
those discussions in the next few minutes to come to some kind 
of consensus by which we can afford the House to function 
properly in its committees.
<P>
	I recognize, as the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
has said, the importance of the work of the opposition in the 
House. The Deputy Prime Minister and I have probably served 
longer in opposition than anyone else in the Chamber. We served 
too long in opposition.
<P>
	In any case, we recognize that situation and we are attempting 
through some of these negotiations to resolve it. I hoped to 
continue with those private negotiations prior to this question of 
privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will go to a final intervention by the hon. 
member for Elk Island if he has new information to bring on my 
ruling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
very important things.
<P>
	First, the incident I reported which grieves me so seriously 
occurred after the member for Frazer Valley East came to you to 
give his intervention yesterday. It happened afterwards. That is 
very significant. It is also of a completely different nature.
<P>
	Second, I was using the instruction as I understood it from 
Standing Order 48(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whenever any matter of privileges arises, it shall be taken into consideration 
immediately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This says to me I have the right to not wait until that 
committee gave me the permission to come here. That is why I 
took the initiative to come.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the points are well taken on both 
sides. I do not come from another venue. I am one of you and I 
can understand many of the frustrations when a member is in 
opposition.
<P>
	I can also understand, having served in government, that the 
government has a right to get on with its legislation. Therefore 
there are two things to be balanced here.
<P>
	Your Speaker is always guided by the rules of the House of 
Commons. He is also guided by the precedents of other Speakers 
and in other Parliaments.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I heard today that in this circumstance one of the committees 
of the House is trying to-I hate to use the word rectify-at least 
ameliorate the situation so all sides can get on with what the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East has said is their job, to represent 
the people of their constituencies.
<P>
	On the specific point of privilege, the Speaker will respond to 
a report from the committee. That is the responsibility of the 
Speaker. However, your Speaker cannot be expected to be in all 
committees, to know precisely what is happening in all 
committees, except through their chairs which the House has 
approved.
<P>
	We now have a circumstance of a committee's carrying out its 
responsibilities. That all members do not agree with what is 
happening in the committee is normal for this place.
<P>
	However, I will wait until I have a report from the committee. 
When the report comes in, whatever is in there, if the hon. 
member at that time chooses to raise a point of privilege, I give 
notice now, as is the precedent of the House, that I will hear the 
point of privilege.
<P>
	Concerning the rules stating a member must make 
intervention as soon as possible, the hon. member has done that. 
He is here now in front of me. Should it be brought up again at a 
future date, when the report of the committee comes out your 
Speaker will entertain such a point of privilege.
<P>
	However, for the time being it is my decision that the 
committees are masters of their own work and that committee 
work must follow procedure and be brought to us here in the 
House. If there is a problem which can only be resolved by the 
House, then the House will become seized of it.
<P>
	However, I rule at this time the hon. member, with all due 
respect, does not have a point of privilege.
<P>

The petitioners ask Parliament to regulate Image Cablesystem

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not normally read the entire petition, 
but in this case I will.
<P>
	I have over 7,706 signatures that I have received from a group 
in my community called Fair Justice, which came into effect 
after a very tragic killing in our community.
<P>
	Their petition reads: In 1990 an average of two Canadian 
women per week were murdered by their husbands or male 
partners. Over the period 1974 to 1992 a married woman was 
nine times more likely to be killed by her spouse than by a 
stranger. Whereas the domestic killer is treated less harshly than 
any other by Canadian courts, the crime is usually defined as 
manslaughter. Killing family is much more likely to involve 
provocation or the heat of passion than killing acquaintances or 
killing for money or sex. While almost 60 per cent of those who 
kill during the commission of another crime are sentenced to life 
imprisonment, only 20 per cent of family killers receive this 
penalty.
<P>
	Therefore, your petitioners pray and request that Parliament 
amend section 236 of the Criminal Code to include a minimum 
sentence of 10 years when a person pleads guilty or is found 
guilty of manslaughter of a spouse or partner.
<P>
	I will therefore table these signatures that number 7,706, as I 
mentioned before.

Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition signed by 
Cariboo-Chilcotin constituents from 100 Mile House, Forest 
Grove, Canim Lake, and Lone Butte, British Columbia.
<P>
	Those who signed the petition are of the opinion that existing 
controls on law-abiding, responsible firearms owners are more 
than enough to ensure public safety. They therefore call upon 
Parliament to support laws that will severely punish all violent 
criminals who use weapons in the commission of a crime; 
support new Criminal Code firearms control provisions that 
recognize and protect the right of law-abiding citizens to own 
and use recreational firearms; and support legislation that will 
repeal or modify existing gun control laws, which have not 
improved public safety or have proven not to be cost effective or 
have proven to be overly complex so as to be ineffective or 
unenforceable.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that 
has been circulating across Canada. This particular petition 
comes from the Calgary, Alberta, area.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession, which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society. They also say that the

families who decide to provide care in the home for preschool

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> No 
consumption data are available for 1990 to 1994. However, 
domestic cigarette sales have always been considered an

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-82, an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege 
to rise again in the House to debate an issue that is of importance 
to Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to begin my intervention by simply stating that 
the intent of Bill C-82 is to establish a new $2 coin for Canada. 
The parliamentary secretary this morning, in introducing the 
bill in the House, gave a fair amount of rationale for it. I will not 
repeat those things, which we obviously agree on. They are 
already on the record. However, I do want to make a number of 
comments about what he said and refer directly to the provisions 
of the bill.
<P>
	One thing I think we ought to understand is that even though 
in his presentation this morning he made rather voluminous 
reference to the changing of other coins-the penny, the nickel, 
the dime and the quarter, which are all being changed in content 
and hence in weight-that has nothing to do with Bill C-82. He 
was merely talking about another initiative, which is done by 
regulation and which apparently is going to proceed whether 
this bill is passed or not.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that if Bill C-82 does not pass and if 
Parliament fails to approve the authorization of the new 
two-dollar coin, then if the other regulations are implemented 
there will be wholesale changes required in order to manage the 
currency of our country by many, many merchants and vendors, 
irrespective of what this bill does.
<P>
	I am not proposing that we ought to change the rules and that 
everything should be done in the House, because we would 
undoubtedly run out of time. I believe there is a proper role for 
setting of regulations that will determine certain aspects.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The introduction of the coin is not terribly controversial. We 
have had very little feedback. That is probably due to the fact 
that this initiative is not yet well known. I doubt whether it will 
generate a great deal of public outcry. It could even be that the 
bill will be passed before the public becomes aware of it. I do not 
think it has sufficient importance that it will grab the attention 
of the media. It looks as if it may be pushed through faster than 
what we can normally communicate via usual communication 
methods to our constituents.
<P>
	In order to keep our options open we in the Reform Party will 
most likely oppose the bill. When I say that immediately the cry 
is: ``They are in opposition; they are against everything''. That 
is not true. In this instance we are doing it with a very open 
mind. In the event that the unanswered questions we have at this 
time receive satisfactory answers, we will have no hesitation to 
show support for the bill.
<P>
	As I understand, the primary motivation for introducing the 
$2 coin is as a cost saving measure for the government. Much is 
made of this point. I cannot help at this stage to talk about the 
very important issue of cost cutting. The government would like 
Canadians to believe that it is cutting costs at every turn. If we 
look at the issue we are down to a very small amount of petty 
change. I say that in relation to the deficit and debt. If members 
opposite listen carefully they will hear in the next few minutes 
what I mean. I am not saying things to evoke a reaction. There is 
empirical, numerical evidence of what I am saying now.
<P>
	We have a tremendous debt and a huge deficit. We commend 
the Liberals for bringing it down; it is better than increasing it. It 
is good that the deficit has been reduced. We ought not to delude 
Canadians into thinking that our debt problem is solved or that 
our debt is decreasing because it is not.
<P>
	Not only does the budget of this year call for total government 
expenditures of $2 billion in excess of what was spent last year, 
but at the end of the fiscal year we will have another $32 billion 
of debt that we did not have when we entered this fiscal year. 
That is the straight fiscal reality. I am merely echoing what was 
reported by the Minister of Finance when he tabled his budget.
<P>
	While I say that it is wonderful to be reducing spending and 
thereby hopefully reducing the rate at which we are going into 
debt, I also need to criticize it. Perhaps I can use a sports 
analogy. It is wonderful for the football team to gain a yard. That 
is better than losing a yard. On the next play it gains another 
yard. However, if only two yards in two plays have been gained 
in Canadian football the ball has to be kicked away. The 
opportunity has been lost.
<P>
	At this time the matter is severe. Even though the government 
is saying this and I will echo it, there is a savings of $254 million 
over the next 20 years. I am not opposed to that savings, but it is 
as though we are gaining another yard and meanwhile the game 
is slipping away from us. We need to be cognizant of that fact. 
We need to address it very seriously.
<P>
	I hesitate to say this. If Canadians hear me say that $254 
million is petty change I will get hammered for it. I do not mean 
it. It is a lot of money, but relative to the total picture what we 
are doing in this measure is barely whittling away at the edge of 
the problem. The problem is so large that it is as if we are trying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12854"> 12854 </A></B>
<P>
to take the water out of the Pacific Ocean with a teaspoon. It will 
never happen.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Let me bring the numbers into perspective. I have shared 
before in the House that mathematics is my game. I have had 
some 31 years of experience teaching the subject. I have loved it 
and have used mathematics since I was a child.
<P>
	In preparing my speech I immediately got out my calculator, 
did some number crunching and thought about what it meant. 
We need to be aware that the mention of savings, which is so 
highly touted by the other side, is extremely mediocre. Let me 
tell members how little the savings really are. I am sorry that we 
are spending time in the House today dealing with this one while 
the big ones are getting away from us.
<P>
	A famous politician one time said: ``I do not have time to be 
shooting rabbits when I should be after bear''. That was a 
quotation of Tommy Douglas. That is what we are doing.
<P>
	I ask the House to listen to the numbers. The $254 million 
savings is over 20 years. Usually when the government wants 
accolades for its savings it says a quarter of a billion dollars, 
which is a wonderfully big number. Then its voice drops when it 
whispers quietly ``over 20 years'' so that nobody notices that it 
is over 20 years.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means $12.7 million in savings per 
year. We are going to deny it but we need to get it into the 
perspective of what it actually means in terms of the taxpayer.
<P>
	I did a couple of side calculations. Here is one of them. 
Because of our massive debt, our interest payments of some $40 
billion per year work out to about $110 million per day. Let us 
remember that I just said this was a cost saving of $12.7 million 
per year. Therefore we will save in this measure $12.7 million 
over the whole year. Meanwhile we are spending $110 million 
per day on interest. In the perspective of how viciously we are 
attacking the budget, this is not the measure.
<P>
	Another way of putting it is that the savings ``to be realized'' 
by the implementation of the $2 coin will pay for our annual 
interest. This savings will account for the interest payment for 
two hours and 47 minutes of the year. That is the big saving.
<P>
	Let us do it but let us recognize that if we are to do it and 
finally bring the debt under control, we will have to take some 
big steps. We will have to stop stepping gingerly. We will have 
to start looking at the big expenditures and at the big savings. 
Otherwise we will lose the game while busily wondering 
whether we made a yard or six inches.
<P>
	I would like to bring it down to the individual because it is 
very appropriate. Not only does it put the savings into 
perspective. It also puts the economics into perspective. I made 
some assumptions because I do not have access to instantaneous 
figures. We are not yet on Internet in the House. It is impossible 
to get that technology going so it is difficult to get up to date 
measures.
<P>
	I made a few assumptions on data that was several years old. It 
was the best I could get. Assuming 29 million Canadians, the 
savings this will produce will amount to the sum of 44 cents per 
year per Canadian. Over the whole year, after we have 
implemented the plan, every Canadian will say: ``I have an extra 
44 cents in my pocket this year''.
<P>
	Let us stop to think about it. The change in coinage will 
probably result in every coin operated machine in the country, 
telephones, food vending machines and lottery machines which 
I do not approve of in any case, having to be changed.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	With the measure Canadians will save 44 cents per person per 
year. If the merchants increase the price on vending machines by 
10 cents to recoup the cost of changing the machinery, any 
individual who uses a machine more than four times a year will 
end up spending more money. That puts the economic 
perspective of the measure into a different light. We need to 
think about these matters. Whether Canadians are paying money 
via their taxes or whether they are paying via the goods and 
services they purchase, it is still money out of their pockets.
<P>
	I did another calculation. There are approximately 13.5 
million Canadians who while filing income tax also pay tax. 
There are approximately six million taxpayers who file to 
receive the refundable tax credits. They are really out of the tax 
picture; they are only doing the paperwork. Those who are 
actually contributing to government income via the tax system 
number around 13.5 million to the best of my knowledge. If we 
forget about the people of Canada and only talk about the 13.5 
million taxpaying Canadians, the savings are quite a bit more 
because there are now fewer people who are sharing the savings. 
The $254 million that will be saved by introducing the $2 coin 
gives every taxpayer a break of about 94 cents per year.
<P>
	As a taxpayer I am sure that I use a coin operated machine 
more than 10 times per year. I am presuming. Maybe they will 
only increase the price by 5 cents. Maybe some of them will not 
increase the price at all, which I doubt, because it is our 
information that to change the coin recognition mechanism of 
machines will cost $500 per machine. That is the smallest 
number I have read about. I believe every coin operated machine 
in the country will increase their prices. I can anticipate a Pepsi 
or a chocolate bar which now costs 90 cents undoubtedly going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12855"> 12855 </A></B>
<P>
up to $1, so it will require a loonie. Maybe the new  machine will 
accept a $2 coin and give a loonie back, so people will have 
almost exactly the same money in their pocket in terms of 
weight as before.
<P>
	It has been mentioned that one of the reasons for doing this is 
that $2 bills do not last. That is also true. I know I cannot use 
props; I really know the rules around here. I cannot haul out a $2 
bill, but I looked at one before I came here that was worn. The $2 
bills get a lot of mileage. It reminds me a bit about the way the 
Canadian government handles grain. The government likes to 
put it on trains and give it a joy ride before it arrives at its 
destination. We do that with our currency as well.
<P>
	The $2 bill undoubtedly does a lot of travelling. Statistics tell 
us that on average the $2 bill we have been using extensively 
since the $1 bill was discontinued lasts only a year and then it 
must be reprinted at a cost of 6 cents. It costs 6 cents every year 
for every $2 bill in circulation.
<P>
	The coin, because it will last for 20 years, will not have that 
cost. It will cost approximately 16 cents to produce, but as we all 
know coins last for a very long time. To show that I am a true 
Reformer, when I was walking down the sidewalk the other day I 
saw a penny and I stopped to pick it up, as Reformers would be 
wont to do. I was amazed to see that the penny was almost as old 
as I am. Somebody had just dropped it. It was not quite as old as I 
am. The date on it as I recall was 1945 and I am six years older 
than that. But I thought it was really significant that that coin 
could last as long as I have. I assure you that no bill in 
circulation would last that long.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I have stated the cost per taxpayer and the saving per 
Canadian of 44 cents per year as a counterbalance to the 
statement of the parliamentary secretary. I think I wrote down 
the quotation correctly. He said: ``This will be a big load off the 
debt''. With all due respect, I think not.
<P>
	I will indicate some other reasons for the temporary statement 
that we are going to be resisting the bill. I have already indicated 
that to the individual Canadian it may not be nearly as big a 
saving as is being touted. I want to find out before I vote in 
favour of the bill whether it actually is economically feasible. I 
am not certain. I have not had sufficient data on it to convince 
me.
<P>
	Also I somehow feel that we ought to be presenting Canadians 
with more than just this option. We now have a $1 coin and we 
are jumping now to a $2 coin and then a $5 coin. The $2 coin is 
the one in question.
<P>
	To my knowledge no studies have been done on the viability 
and feasibility of dropping the $2 bill and going from the $1 to 
the $5. I cannot use props here, but I could hold up four coins and 
show that those four loonies would represent two $2 bills. After 
we pass the $4 dollar mark we could then use a $5 bill. You do 
not ever need more than two $2 bills. That means we would 
never need more than two $2 coins. Which means that if  we did 
not have a $2 coin we would have to have up to four loonies.
<P>
	I looked at the spec sheet. The loonie weighs 7 grams. The 
new proposed $2 coin is going to weigh 7.3 grams, just slightly 
heavier. Canadians are going to say: ``If I have to have yet 
another coin, then there is going to more weight in my pocket''. 
Well, this is what it is: four loonies weigh 28 grams. My 
generation likes to hear it in the old British system, which is 
about an ounce. If you had two $2 coins they would weigh 14.6 
grams, which for all intents and purposes is about half an ounce.
<P>
	We are asking Canadians to approve the introduction of a new 
$2 coin with huge costs to all the vending industries and all the 
coin operated machines in order to save, at maximum, the 
necessity of carrying an extra one-half ounce in their pockets. I 
suppose that could be justified. I am interested in studying it 
further. I am certainly interested in hearing from Canadians to 
find out whether they are really going to say: ``Yes, let us go for 
the $2 coin because I walk lopsided if I have an extra half ounce 
on that side''. I am being facetious. My apologizes. That was 
supposed to be a joke to wake up members opposite.
<P>
	Too many questions of this type remain unanswered. In fact, 
there are some problems with the bill itself. Consequently, our 
initial response is that we respectfully submit that we are going 
to oppose the bill, with the option that if proper answers are 
given to our questions, then we will show that we are willing to 
support the bill.
<P>
	One thing the government has done based on the data we 
received from it, was a poll which found that Canadians support 
the $2 coin. We actually question the accuracy of the poll. The 
difficulty with the poll is that the only option given was whether 
they liked the $2 coin or not. They were not given the option of 
not having the $2 denomination at all. Therefore, Canadians 
were not given a number of choices, but a very narrow choice.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I was also told, and I hope this is correct, that the first poll 
taken was not supportive. The question was changed in order to 
get a positive poll so that the proposal for the $2 coin could be 
advertised as having the support of Canadians. When I found out 
that this was done, I wondered about the motivation behind it.
<P>
	Another question we definitely want answered is: Who will 
actually benefit from the introduction of the coin? I am making 
no allegations, but it is a question which we will always and 
carefully ask on this side of the House. I am not going to say 
which Liberal supporter, but we will ask who is going to benefit 
from this. Who has the contract? Which are the businesses that 
change the machines? If there are any problems with that, we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12856"> 12856 </A></B>
<P>
going to try to find that out and make sure that the motivations 
are all above board.
<P>
	I will also talk a little bit about the retailers. I am sure a lot of 
Canadians are not aware that when a purchase is made with 
currency there is almost always change. Very seldom does the 
customer present the exact change. In any case, every merchant 
has the option of having the facility to accept a credit card. We 
understand that a great deal of merchandising is done via credit 
cards. The mechanism for processing credit card and debit card 
purchases has been refined to a great extent. That system is 
fairly efficient, but we still have a coinage system. We still have 
the rules of currency and legal tender. Therefore, the merchants 
are required to have change.
<P>
	If you were ever to look into the till, you would see that there 
are different compartments for pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters 
and loonies. We have very few 50-cent pieces in circulation; I 
think most of them are hoarded by collectors. With the 
introduction of a new coin, every tray in every till in the whole 
country is going to be put on the garbage heap and replaced with 
a new tray with an extra compartment because of the new coin.
<P>
	Another aspect to that which was indicated by the 
parliamentary secretary is when the $2 coin was introduced, the 
government said it was going to do the vendors a favour by 
changing the metal content and hence the weights of the other 
coins at the same time. The vendors could then build new coin 
recognition systems and do that change only once.
<P>
	That is commendable, but the government is not going to 
instantly take all of the old coins out of circulation. Therefore, 
the job for the coin vendors is to have a coin recognition system 
that no longer recognizes nickels, dimes, quarters and loonies, 
which is a total of four coins, but they are going to need a total of 
eight coins recognized. There will be two different kinds of 
nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies and the $2 coin, doubloonies, I 
guess we will call it.
<P>
	When that happens the mechanism is going to have to be much 
more sophisticated and undoubtedly more expensive. I read an 
estimate that the vending machine industry is probably going to 
have to lay out approximately $25 million to change the 
machines. Remember I did the division by 20 on the projected 
savings. I said that if the saving is $254 million in 20 years, it is 
$12.7 million in one year. By the lowest estimates, we will be 
spending twice the annual savings of the government in order to 
change the machines when we start out.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Hopefully if there is some stability to our currency system, 
that change should not have to be made again soon. It is 
interesting to note it was approximately eight years ago when all 
the machines in the country had to be changed. I do submit one 
of the things we would call for is a longer period to guarantee 
Canadian businessmen the coinage will not change. Eight years 
is really much too short a period.
<P>
	I would also like answers to questions like these: What are the 
actual total costs to industry? What are the total costs to 
Canadians?
<P>
	It would also be appropriate to talk about seigniorage, which 
is the difference between the value of the coin and what it costs 
to produce it. We are told that based on this component, we 
expect to have an input into the Canadian government coffers of 
$449 million in two and one-half years. I will admit I am a 
mathematician but I am not an economist, so I do not fully 
understand how that accrues to actual value to the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	I stand to be corrected but it seems to me that if we can 
actually bring in $500 million in two and one-half years to the 
Canadian government wealth and if it is real wealth, not 
inflationary wealth, because of the introduction of the new 
currency-and I understand that part-we will presumably be 
taking the $2 bills out of circulation when we bring in the $2 
coin. If there is an actual accrual to the government of $449 
million of added value, then I ask a very elementary question: 
Why do we not just greatly increase the number of $1 and $2 
coins? Let us produce them in sufficient numbers to pay off the 
debt. If it really works then we should do that.
<P>
	Now I think I know enough about economics to know that 
would not work. Unfortunately that is not the kind of economic 
policy that would keep us as a country in good light with all of 
the other trading partners. Our currency would undoubtedly be 
devalued by that.
<P>
	Another aspect of this is profit to the mint. I like the fact that 
our mint is a money maker. I am sure many people are aware that 
the Canadian mint not only produces Canadian currency, but 
also provides a sizeable import of dollars by producing and 
shipping coins to other countries.
<P>
	I understand it is definitely economical for the mint to tool up 
to produce a new $2 coin. Like a car manufacturer tooling up to 
make a new model of car, it is always economical because that 
will be recouped in sales. It is undoubtedly correct for the mint 
to do this.
<P>
	I would like to know the details of the mint's cash flow. How 
is this actually going to work out? We also need to recognize 
there are ramifications to moving from the printing of paper 
currency to the production of the coins. Initially there will be a 
large flurry of activity in producing the new coins, but what 
happens to productivity once we have saturated the Canadian 
currency with the required number of $2 coins? Those are 
simple questions.
<P>
	With respect to the bill itself there needs to be a long term plan 
which is not present in this very short bill. All it says is that we 
are going to make a new $2 coin. That is basically all it says in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12857"> 12857 </A></B>
<P>
layman's language. What we really should have is some sort of 
coherent, long term currency plan Canadians can count on.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	There is a really serious question we ought to be asking, 
whether we should keep the penny. The penny costs about 70 per 
cent more to produce than what it is worth. It costs about 1.7 
cents to manufacture a penny. It does not make a great deal of 
sense to keep manufacturing pennies. Think of the savings we 
could incur if we stop doing that. We could presumably go for 
many years utilizing the pennies out there now because their rate 
of replacement is not great. They are very sturdy coins.
<P>
	Has there been any study on replacing the $5 bill with a $5 
coin? If it is so good for the two, could it also be done for the 
five? Should it be done at the same time? Obviously if we are to 
make a change, to do it at the same time makes a great deal more 
sense than making this change now and then five or eight years 
down the road saying introduce a new $5 coin requiring all the 
vendors and all of the businesses once again to adjust.
<P>
	These are some of the questions I want to have answered 
before I can support this bill. It could be that we are missing an 
opportunity of being very efficient if that is the long term 
direction we are to go. We need to have studies. We need to have 
answers to those questions.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to be able to address this 
question. Obviously in my limited knowledge I will not have 
explored all aspects of it. Undoubtedly there are other things we 
must also take into account. We will certainly be watching and 
participating eagerly in the House and in committee, provided 
we are allowed to vote in our committee and other things.
<P>
	We will pay close attention in committee and we will be 
eagerly asking for the answers to these questions. I want to 
reiterate the bottom line for us is not a saving to government but 
a saving to the taxpayer. If the taxpayer in total is to land up with 
a higher expense then we will be opposed to this bill.
<P>
	I seriously doubt, based on the numbers I gave at the 
beginning of my intervention, the added costs of making the 
changes to the commodities sold through vending machines 
primarily will eat up the pockets of the taxpayers more than 
what will be saved for those taxpayers through this avenue of 
government.
<P>
	I also want to make sure that before we give consent to this 
bill all of the costs have been anticipated. Too often in 
government we start on a project and hear the estimates. How 
often have we heard of overruns? Over and over; it happens with 
great frequency. We want to make sure there are very precise 
accounting and estimates of the total anticipated costs to the 
taxpayers. I want to make sure we have an open and honest 
discussion.
<P>
	In my first year and a half in the House there have been times 
when I have really enjoyed the work. I have felt what I have been 
contributing has been very helpful to the Canadians I was sent 
here to represent, broader than the Elk Island constituency, all 
Canadians from sea to sea.
<P>
	I hope in this bill, which is such an innocuous bill, we will be 
able to embark on a debate, a study in committee free from the 
acrimony and the bull headedness that has been displayed in 
some of the committees, particularly in the past several days.
<P>
	It is so important that we as parliamentarians-in the 
committee we are backbenchers-have, as the Liberal Party 
promised in its red book, a more meaningful role. That role will 
have to be found in committee because of the sheer numbers.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Not many members have the privilege I have today to make a 
40 minute speech. Members on the Liberal side almost never get 
that opportunity. When a bill is introduced either the minister or 
the parliamentary secretary takes that opportunity. All of the 
other backbenchers really do not have a role.
<P>
	In committee we can have a real role provided it is permitted, 
encouraged and acknowledged and that there is a genuine and 
honest recognition that the recommendations of the committee 
are to be taken seriously. I look forward to working on this bill in 
the committee. Provided our answers can be forthcoming very 
quickly I am sure we can come up with a solution to this 
problem.
<P>
	It is not a big problem for Canadians. It is a problem of some 
significance. We can come up with a solution that will be best 
for all Canadians. I am thinking of those ordinary Canadians 
who work from day to day struggling to pay their bills, 
struggling to pay their taxes. Those are the people we want to 
represent. We want to make sure they get very best possible 
shake out of this legislation and other legislation like it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague from Elk Island finished stating not very 
many backbenchers have the opportunity to speak for 40 
minutes on any bill. That is a very pithy comment.
<P>
	Many people would have a great deal of difficulty trying to 
figure how one could speak for 40 minutes on Bill C-82, which 
is a major struggle. How on earth does one go about speaking for 
40 minutes on a debate on the introduction of a $2 coin?
<P>
	A few minutes ago I was told we need to keep this debate 
going for another 10 minutes and do I have something to say 
about this. I thought sure. The automatic response was who 
needs a $2 coin? I have travelled extensively in the United States 
and I have never seen a $2 bill. Why replace the $2 bill? If we do  

<P>

<B><A NAME="12858"> 12858 </A></B>
<P>
not want to have it, we should get rid of it. If we do not need it, 
we do not need it.
<P>
	That is a question that will be answered in committee where 
wiser minds than mine will be debating this important 
consideration of the day. With a $2 coin if we start trying to 
figure out how much our country will be in debt on a daily basis, 
it would only be $60 million $2 coins rather than 120 million 
loonies. We could divide it that way and perhaps it does not seem 
that much.
<P>
	There are some really important considerations in this bill. 
For those watching this debate, the country is into debt at $120 
million a day. We have Bill C-68, the firearms bill. We have 
looming on the horizon the most important question facing our 
country outside of the debt, our relationship with Quebec and 
how we will deal with and get past this hurdle. We will get past it 
and it is my desire we will do it together. Here we are using up 
the potential of five hours of debating time to talk about the 
introduction of a $2 coin. We already have a $1 coin.
<P>
	Some hon. members opposite said we are wasting our time. 
How can we argue with that? Some things do not require the 
same amount of consideration except if one happens to be in the 
vending machine business. Everything we do in the House 
affects someone somewhere. While it may not affect all of us to 
the same degree all the time, it affects someone substantially 
some of the time.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	If I were in the vending machine business now and a member 
of Parliament asked what I thought of the debate on the $2 coin, I 
would say it could very well be the difference between my 
staying in business or going out of business. Think of the huge 
cost to the vending machine business with the introduction of 
the loonie a few years ago. It important we in the House have 
some consideration of the effects of what we do on others 
outside the House.
<P>
	We all recall what happened with the introduction of the 
loonie. What happened to the cost of newspapers from vending 
machines? By and large there was an increase from $75 cents to 
a loonie. The vending industry raised prices from 25 cents to 50 
cents to 75 cents to a loonie. It was not taking advantage of a 
situation. If it has to make mechanical changes it might as well 
make them to last.
<P>
	What will happen if we introduce a doubloonie, a $2 coin? A 
vast number of ideas have come forward about what to call the 
new coin. Ideas came from the west saying we should put a 
picture of a deer on either side and call it the two buck coin. 
Another member said we could put a picture of the leader of the 
Reform Party on one side, the Leader of the Opposition on the 
other and say flip a coin.
<P>
	There is a substantial cost, particularly to the vending 
machine business. As we make decisions and changes for the 
nation, things that seem pretty simple and  straightforward very 
often have a result that extends far beyond what we are doing 
here.
<P>
	I have two $2 bills in my pocket and a loonie. One thing 
brought to my attention the other day was if we get rid of the $2 
bill, what will happen to the amount of change we carry in our 
pockets. I have a loonie and some quarters. I am trying to stretch 
this out. I suppose we are looking at effects this will have down 
the road, beyond the vending machine industry and beyond 
inflation. I suppose to some people the amount of coins they 
would have to carry in their pocket would be something of a 
consideration. Without a $2 bill and because we do not have a $1 
bill, we would have to carry around a whole lot more loonies or 
doubloonies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It would make the tailors happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> While it might upset the vending industry, 
it would certainly make the tailoring industry happy since 
people would be walking around with holes in their pockets or 
their purses. However, it would be something of a problem.
<P>
	As the debate winds to a conclusion I hope some of these 
points will be considered. In my opinion we do not need another 
coin. If we are to get rid of the $2 bill, let us get rid of it and 
make do with our happy little loonies.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-313, an act to provide for the resumption and 
continuance of the operations at ADM Agri-Industries Ltd., be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce Bill C-313 
in the House today. However, I regret the fact that this 
legislation is necessary to put an end to the dispute at ADM 
Agri-Industries Ltd. The events leading up to Bill C-313 are as 
follows: a labour dispute between ADM Agri-Industries Ltd. 
and the National Syndicate of Employees of Ogilvie Flour Mills 
Company Ltd. has affected about 150 employees involved in 
production.
<P>
	The parties started negotiations on the renewal of the 
collective agreement that expired on January 31, 1992. A 
conciliator and then a mediator were appointed to help the 
parties settle their differences. Unfortunately, very little 
progress was made. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12859"> 12859 </A></B>
<P>
The union called a legal general strike on June 6, 1994. This 
strike, which has been going on for 11 months, has not prevented 
the employer from continuing operations, since the employer 
hired replacement workers, which has undermined the 
bargaining position of ADM's regular employees.
<P>
	Bill C-313 proposes final offer selection as a way to settle the 
dispute. Within 30 days after being appointed, or within such 
greater period as will be specified by the Minister, the arbitrator 
shall, first of all, determine the matters on which the employer 
and the union were in agreement at cut-off time; second, 
determine the matters remaining in dispute at cut-off time; 
third, select, in order to resolve the matters remaining in 
dispute, either the final offer submitted by the employer or the 
final offer submitted by the union; fourth, determine a back to 
work protocol.
<P>
	Meanwhile, employees would go back to work in accordance 
with the provisions of the protocol. The bill would contain 
provisions obliging the parties to abide by the back to work 
protocol and resume operations. The bill's enforcement 
provisions include fines in the case of an individual who 
contravenes a provision of this legislation. Bill C-313 is not 
anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to deal with a specific situation that 
currently exists at ADM. Many of my constituents have worked 
for ADM for more than 20 years. Today, they are out of work and 
have little hope of getting back their jobs. They want to go back 
to work, and they want to negotiate. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I said the 
employees' union wants to negotiate.
<P>
	On April 26, following promises from the company that it 
would go back to the bargaining table and because there was 
some hope of obtaining a negotiated agreement, the National 
Syndicate of Employees of Ogilvie Flour Mills Company Ltd. 
sent me a fax in which they asked me to withdraw this bill.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	On May 1, the union met with the company, and by May 2, 
before the bill could even be withdrawn, yet again, the union 
sent me another fax saying: ``Since our letter of April 26, we 
have been to two mediation sessions with Warren Edmunston 
and Rock St-Hilaire. The attitude of ADM Ltd. at those 
sessions, despite the fact that the strike has dragged on for 11 
months now, has made us reconsider our position regarding the 
bill that you tabled. Effectively, on the critical issues, ADM's 
vice-president has said that there was no reason for 
compromise''.
<P>
	``Do you know what that means? That means that there is no 
reason for them to compromise. Needless to say, the hope of 
reaching a negotiated settlement has never been so dim''.
<P>
	``That is why we are now asking you to bring Bill C-313 
before the tripartite committee of the House of Commons. Of 
course, when the time comes, we would like to be heard with 
regard to this bill, because we could suggest a few 
amendments''.
<P>
	``Nevertheless, in principle, the bill is an acceptable mid term 
solution and will at least guarantee that the workers at the 
Ogilvie flour mill will have a decent future and that they can 
return to work their pride intact''.
<P>
	``It is certain that a negotiated settlement would be the 
preferred solution. However, this cannot end up being a settling 
of accounts in which one party squarely comes out the winner. 
That is why we believe that this bill could very well be the 
preferred solution to the stalemate in which we dread we will 
find ourselves''.
<P>
	``I hope to hear from you soon and would like to thank you for 
the interest you have shown in the workers I represent''.
<P>
	The letter was signed Claude Tremblay, president of the 
National Syndicate of Employees of Ogilvie Flour Mills Co. 
Ltd.
<P>
	I am convinced that it was very difficult for them to reverse 
their decision about having the bill withdrawn. As some of you 
already know, ADM Ltd.'s factory at Candiac and the union 
came to an agreement very quickly. There is, however, a major 
difference between the Candiac factory and the one in Montreal, 
located in my riding. The difference is as follows: the Candiac 
plant processes flour and is under the control of the provincial 
government. It is covered by anti-strikebreaking legislation, 
and the union could have halted ADM's activities there.
<P>
	In Montreal, however, the ADM mills come under federal 
legislation, which permits the hiring of replacement workers. As 
we say, ``the company has the big end of the stick''. It can say to 
the union, through its vice-president: ``We have no reasons for 
compromise''.
<P>
	This is no way to treat people. Faithful employees, who have 
given twenty years of service or more to this company are now, 
after an eleven month strike, in debt, without hope and unable to 
feed their family.
<P>
	Workers have pride too and are happy to earn their living. As 
the Prime Minister put it in one his speeches, a father is proud to 
earn a living in order to be able to put food on the table for his 
children. When they came to see me at my office, they were not 
looking for handouts. They simply wanted to be able to bargain 
in good faith and to return to their jobs, which have been given to 
replacement workers.
<P>
	As we know, whenever a company has the upper hand, it is 
forever critical of the people who have given their life for it. 
People may have worked 30 years of their life for a company and 
have it say today: ``No, not a chance. You will be out in the street 
with no chance of renegotiating your seniority''. The employees 
of ADM are not asking for a salary increase; they earn between 
$17 and $19 an hour. They are proud of what they earn. All they 
want is recognition of their seniority. The owner, Dwayne 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12860"> 12860 </A></B>
<P>
Andrew, a multimillionaire, does not want to negotiate with 
ADM.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I therefore request the unanimous consent of this House to 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-313 be declared a votable item, pursuant to Standing Order 93.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion of our colleague for 
Verdun-Saint-Paul?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-313, which was tabled in this House by the hon. member 
for Verdun-Saint-Paul, who is a government member.
<P>
	One can see that, while Ogilvie's may be experiencing 
problems, this is also the case on the other side of this House. 
Indeed, there seems to be a disagreement regarding the taking of 
a vote on this bill. Some day, we may find out exactly why. In the 
meantime, I want to make some comments on the legislation as 
such. I will take a few moments to relate the chronology of this 
dispute at Ogilvie Mills Ltd., which is located in Montreal, in 
the riding of Verdun-Saint-Paul.
<P>
	The collective agreement in effect at Ogilvie's expired in 
January 1992, and the company was sold in June of that year by 
its owners, Labatt, to an American multinational, Archers 
Daniel Midland.
<P>
	After the change of ownership, bargaining became very 
difficult. The new employer behaved somewhat as if it were in a 
banana republic, brazenly trying to impose its rules and not 
caring one bit about our traditional ways of bargaining. It 
showed contempt towards the men and women who work for 
Ogilvie's. Consequently, on June 6, 1994, the workers voted 97 
per cent in favour of a strike.
<P>
	Why did they make that decision? Contrary to what several 
may think, particularly on the management side, people who 
hold a regular, well paid job allowing them a decent quality of 
life never decide gladly to do without their income and to go on 
strike. Such a decision is never made for the fun of it but, rather, 
for serious reasons.
<P>
	This was the case at Ogilvie's, since the demands made by the 
new management were utterly excessive in the eyes of any 
objective observer.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Since then, for close to a year now, the employees have been 
out on the street, without any hope for a settlement, since the 
company, taking advantage of the fact that it is federally 
incorporated and that there is no federal anti-scab legislation, 
has hired substitute workers and is operating as if nothing had 
happened, while the real employees, those who worked for the 
flour mill for over 20 years, are still out on the street and might 
stay there for quite a while yet.
<P>
	My colleague for Verdun-Saint-Paul insisted earlier on the 
fact that this private member's bill is not an anti-scab bill. He is 
right this bill has nothing in common with an anti-scab bill, but 
this shows the lack of responsibility on the part of the 
government which, despite the official opposition's repeated 
requests over the years and especially recently, has refused to 
pass anti-scab legislation in this House, which, I am convinced, 
would have led to a quicker settlement.
<P>
	Across Canada, 75 per cent of employees working for 
provincially incorporated companies are protected by anti-scab 
legislation. This means that, in all the companies governed by 
provincial laws, in Quebec, Ontario or British Columbia, 
employees can go through the collective bargaining process, 
then go out on strike in a civilized and orderly manner, thus 
establishing a real balance of power. The federal government 
still refuses to pass such legislation which, as I said, would 
certainly have solved the problem in this particular case.
<P>
	I only have a few minutes left, but I want to stress that point, 
because it is not the first time that we are confronted with this 
kind of situation, which is likely to occur again many times in 
the future. The government must realize anti-scab legislation is 
a necessity. Members opposite seem to want to make absolutely 
sure that this legislation is not passed in this House, so as not to 
apply to federally registered companies.
<P>
	The official opposition supports Bill C-313, which deals with 
what is called the final offer selection. This is better than 
nothing. It is reluctantly that the official opposition supports 
such a measure since, in the context of labour negotiations, the 
final offer is truly a last resort. Such a solution is often used 
when every other avenue has been explored, and when workers 
are at the end of their rope. I know that Ogilvie workers and their 
representatives hope, after a work stoppage of almost a year, to 
see such provisions come into effect.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Again, as far as the official opposition is concerned, we 
unanimously support this approach. We would have liked a vote 
on this bill, which would have given every member of this House 
an opportunity to express his or her views by voting for or 
against it. We already know, however, that there are deep 
divisions on this issue within the government majority, within 
the Liberal Party. That is regrettable since, as I said earlier, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12861"> 12861 </A></B>
<P>
are discussing the fate of men and women who have been on the 
street  without any income for nearly a year. They have children 
to support, mortgages and rents to pay. An agreement must be 
negotiated as soon as possible.
<P>
	I hope that, once this bill is passed, once these employees 
have gone back to work, they can resume their activities in 
acceptable conditions, in a climate that is not too hostile.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that the government will think about, 
really think about, introducing in this House an anti-scab bill 
that would benefit all workers subject to the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the bill sponsored by the 
hon. member for Verdun-Saint-Paul.
<P>
	The bill proposes that the government implement final offer 
selection as a mechanism for resolving the year long labour 
dispute at ADM Agri-Industries, otherwise known as Ogilvie 
Flour Mills.
<P>
	I was a bit surprised that a member from the government side 
would sponsor the bill. When the hon. member for Lethbridge 
was seeking support for his final offer arbitration in Bill C-262, 
which called for basically the same as the bill today only it 
applied to grain handling disputes, government members did not 
want any part of it.
<P>
	If the hon. member from Verdun and perhaps the rest of his 
caucus truly believed in the concept they would have spoken in 
support of Bill C-262 at the time it was debated in the House.
<P>
	How can he promote final offer selection or arbitration in one 
case and oppose it in others? Since flour mill workers are 
grouped into the same category as grain elevator operators they 
fall under federal jurisdiction. If the hon. member and his 
colleagues were really concerned about the workers at Ogilvie 
Mills, they would have got the ball rolling on March 20 by 
supporting the bill of the member for Lethbridge on final offer 
arbitration in grain handling disputes.
<P>
	We know the government runs hot and cold. The fact the 
member could not get unanimous consent for his bill is a perfect 
example as far as final offer arbitration is concerned. They did 
not like Bill C-262 and they came out in force to ensure that it 
did not survive.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development in a news 
release announcing that royal assent had been given to the West 
Coast Ports Operations Act was quoted as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The imposition of the final offer selection procedure in this particular 
legislation should encourage the two sides to demonstrate a strong sense of 
rationality in deciding on the positions they place before the arbitrator.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we said in Bill C-262, that it was a tool that could 
be used by either side in a dispute.
<P>
	The transport committee in its recently released national 
marine strategy recommended a final offer selection mechanism 
for settlement of all disputes between pilots and their customers. 
It seems to work in some areas. As the mover of the bill 
mentioned, it is not something union people are objecting to. 
There seems to be growing popularity for the concept of final 
offer arbitration.
<P>
	The committee also recommended that the new Marine 
Transportation Act should provide for final offer selection for 
the settlement of all disputes between the new not for profit 
Seaway Corporation and its employees. The chairman of the 
committee spoke on final offer arbitration during the debate on 
Bill C-262. He spoke at length about the need to maintain 
essential services. He also said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Employees either have the right to strike or not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have to roll with the change. I do not feel the way to begin a positive and 
co-operative renewal of labour relations is by introducing legislation which 
begins to erode what labour considers a basic right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are getting mixed signals from the government.
<P>
	Last week in the human resources development committee I 
had an opportunity to ask the Minister of Labour if she would 
consider implementing final offer arbitration as a solution to 
ending disputes involving essential services. She conceded that 
it might be an interesting concept but that it would be difficult to 
use as a method of settling disputes, especially complicated 
disputes like this one. I got the distinct feeling that she would 
not support that sort of move. I am not surprised my hon. friend 
could not get unanimous consent to make his motion votable.
<P>
	Obviously he has one other colleague in his caucus that feels 
the same as he does. The member for Vaudreuil introduced 
exactly the same bill but it has apparently been withdrawn. I am 
sure they both thought there would be no repercussions since the 
government employed final offer selection as a way out of its 
problems with the west coast ports.
<P>
	My friend from Verdun-Saint-Paul is probably thankful in 
some ways that it is not votable because if it were he would have 
to vote in favour of it and we have seen the government 
sometimes punish people who vote for their constituents.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in the bargaining process. We do 
not want to interfere in the process of two parties coming to an 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12862"> 12862 </A></B>
<P>
agreement. We see final offer arbitration as tool that is useful to 
both labour and management.  Certainly my friend across the 
way has alluded to having support of the union in this case.
<P>
	We on this side are concerned about the impacts that strikes 
and lockouts have on workers, employers and Canadians who 
most often have to bear the brunt of the costs and 
inconveniences when the services of monopolistic industries are 
withdrawn. When all efforts to solve the disputes through the 
regular collective bargaining process have been exhausted, final 
offer arbitration should be available to all parties.
<P>
	The recent strikes in the railway helped to underline the 
weakness inherent in the Canada Labour Code from preventing a 
shutdown to essential services. The federal government has a 
responsibility in this area to act in the best interest of Canadians. 
Transportation and communication services are essential to the 
daily movement of people, goods and services.
<P>
	Canada's competitive advantage is determined by the 
efficiency and reliability of the transportation and 
communication network that it relies on. We cannot afford any 
major shutdowns in the network that links the country together. 
A case in point was the recent railway strike that is estimated to 
have cost the Canadian economy in the neighbourhood of $3 
billion.
<P>
	Final offer arbitration is the most effective and impartial 
means of obtaining a solution to the concerns of labour and 
management where an impasse occurs that inflicts significant 
damage on Canadians. It requires both parties to negotiate in 
good faith and quickly, while keeping in mind their overall 
interest as an organization.
<P>
	There is nothing to prevent both sides from achieving their 
deal providing they are being fair, open and expedient with each 
other. Tremendous pressure is put on both sides to reach an 
agreement if the arbitrator is in a position to adopt all of one or 
all of the other side's proposals.
<P>
	The threat of arbitration should be enough for both sides to 
reach agreement if the arbitrator is in a position to adopt either 
side's proposals. The threat of arbitration should be enough for 
both sides if they want to reach an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	In cases where fundamental issues are at stake, such as 
employment security, an agreement may never occur through 
the collective bargaining process. A strike or lockout only 
makes matters worse and nobody wins in those situations. The 
best solution is for someone respected by both sides to make a 
decision on the fairness of one proposal and for the process to be 
viewed as legitimate by both sides.
<P>
	Section 57 of the Canada Labour Code contains a provision 
for final settlement by an arbitrator for disputes that occur 
during the life of a collective agreement. The parliamentary 
secretary from York North referred to this provision on March 2 
when he said: ``Our system of compulsory collective agreement 
settlement through arbitration or some other peaceful means 
contributes to a high degree of stability in our industrial 
relations system''. The message government is sending on this 
issue is one of confusion. Government is for it in some instances 
and not for it in other instances.
<P>
	I am certainly not trying to circumvent the collective 
agreement process. I do want to ensure that in areas of essential 
services Canadian people are protected from costly disruptive 
work stoppages that could affect their safety and their 
livelihood. We need an amendment to the Canada Labour Code 
which would expand the provisions contained in section 27 to 
include final offer arbitration in work stoppages in essential 
services as soon as the existing agreements expire.
<P>
	The Ogilvie workers and their employers have been involved 
in a bitter labour dispute as has been mentioned, for almost a 
year. Those people would certainly like to get back to work. It is 
unfortunate that this bill is not a votable one. If it were, I would 
be suggesting to our caucus that we should support it.
<P>
	I encourage the government to come forth with legislation 
considerably similar to this that would work as a long term 
solution and not a piecemeal approach to the problems.

time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak on Bill C-313 which is an act to 
provide for the resumption and continuance of operations at 
ADM Agri-Industries Ltd.
<P>
	In short, the bill uses final offer selection as a dispute 
settlement mechanism. It would empower the minister to 
appoint an arbitrator to select the final offer submitted either by 
the employer or the union. In effect, the bill calls upon the 
federal government to impose a settlement process on the two 
parties.
<P>
	On the face of it, the proposal sounds reasonable. However, I 
am a firm believer in the free collective bargaining process and 
the long term interest of collective bargaining would not be 
served otherwise. Having said that, I want to express to the 
member for Verdun-Saint-Paul that I share his concerns about 
the dispute.
<P>
	On June 6, less than a month from now, the strike will be a 
year old. Surely in today's highly competitive economic 
environment it is reasonable to expect the parties to a labour 
management dispute to reconcile their differences in far less 
time.
<P>
	It is noteworthy that one of the parties, the employer, is owned 
by Archer Daniels Midland, a very large U.S. based 
transnational corporation. To be frank, I wonder how aware the 
employer is that the industrial relations culture in this country is 
different from the industrial relations culture that exists south of 
the border.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	Without overstating the differences between the two 
countries, I think it is fair to say that generally, employers and 
managers in this country possess a greater willingness and 
ability to work with labour unions. They tend to avoid the kind 
of power bargaining that seems to predominate in the U.S.
<P>
	Dr. Pradeep Kumar, associate director of the Industrial 
Relations Centre at Queens University, pointed out in his study 
of industrial relations in Canada and the United States that: 
``While U.S. employers have become increasingly hostile to 
unions, practising a wide range of union substitution and union 
avoidance activities in pursuit of lower cost and greater 
flexibility in compensation and work arrangements, Canadian 
managers appear to have shown greater willingness to work 
together with unions to facilitate adjustment and  adaptation to 
changing markets and technology. The growing U.S. trend 
toward a union free environment is less evident in Canada''.
<P>
	Dr. Kumar goes on to say: ``Unlike U.S. employers who have 
vigorously demanded concessions and forced unions into 
submission using their enhanced bargaining strength, Canadian 
managers, while jealously guarding their right to manage the 
workplace free of influence of organized labour whenever 
feasible, have been more accommodating and receptive to union 
goals and objectives and have attempted to find consensus on 
areas of mutual concern''.
<P>
	Also, I think Canadian unions rely more and place a higher 
value on the collective bargaining process. They certainly enjoy 
greater public support as evidenced by the fact that the 
percentage of unionized workers in the U.S. is about half of what 
it is in Canada.
<P>
	Professor Kumar and others have also noted that Canadian 
labour legislation differs markedly from U.S. legislation in 
many respects.
<P>
	For example, Canadian collective bargaining legislation 
provides a relatively simple procedure by which trade unions 
can acquire collective bargaining rights. In most Canadian 
jurisdictions a union can be certified without a vote upon 
evidence that 51 to 60 per cent of employees in the bargaining 
unit wish to be represented by the union. In the U.S. all 
applications for certification are contested, requiring a vote to 
establish that a union represent a majority of employees.
<P>
	No Canadian jurisdiction has right to work laws, but 21 states 
in the United States of America have such legislation. Canadian 
labour legislation permits all forms of union security, closed 
shop as well as union shop. Dues check off is a common 
provision.
<P>
	Most Canadian jurisdictions have successor right provisions, 
providing that where a business is sold the successor employer 
acquires all the rights, privileges and obligations of the 
predecessor. The successor is bound by any collective 
agreement in force. In the U.S. the effective change in 
ownership on the union and the collective agreement is 
uncertain, depending on various factors.
<P>
	A number of Canadian jurisdictions provide for advance 
notice and consultation on technological change. This provision 
is not found in the U.S. legislation.
<P>
	First contract arbitration is available in the federal 
jurisdiction, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. 
There is no such provision in the United States.
<P>
	The use of replacement workers during a strike is prohibited 
in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. In the U.S. if em-
<P>

<B><A NAME="12864"> 12864 </A></B>
<P>
ployees choose to go on strike, their employer can immediately 
and permanently replace them.
<P>
	As Paul Weiler, professor of labour law at Harvard University 
put it: ``For employees who may have spent 20 years with the 
company building up a stake of experience and seniority that can 
rarely be duplicated elsewhere, the stark reality is that if they do 
go on strike, they can be replaced by the company with people 
who in less than 20 minutes on the job gain permanent priority 
over the striking veterans''.
<P>
	Labour standards and occupational safety and health 
legislation in the United States is also very different from such 
legislation here in Canada. For example, U.S. legislation, unlike 
Canadian legislation, does not require the establishment of a 
joint health and safety committee, nor does it contain a right to 
refuse unsafe work. The right to refuse unsafe work by health 
and safety committees exists in every single jurisdiction in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	While all Canadian jurisdictions have mandatory maternity 
and paternity leave provisions, with the right to return to former 
jobs and the continuation of benefits, very few jurisdictions in 
the United States require employers to provide pregnancy leave.
<P>
	There are no individual standards for notice of termination or 
any severance pay legislation in the United States. In Canada, on 
the other hand, all jurisdictions require an employer to give 
notification to an individual being terminated, and Ontario and 
the federal jurisdiction provide for mandatory severance pay.
<P>
	In Canada most jurisdictions require advance notice of plant 
closures involving 50 or more workers. Recent U.S. law sets 
minimum notice requirements for plant closures and mass 
lay-offs by employers of more than 100 employees, but there is 
no provision for consultation with the unions similar to that 
found in many Canadian jurisdictions.
<P>
	My point is to show that the industrial relations climate or 
culture in Canada differs in significant ways from that in the 
United States.
<P>
	In the dispute we are talking about today we have a relatively 
new employer, perhaps used to another way of doing things and 
having attitudes and assumptions not yet aligned with the 
Canadian attitudes and assumptions, and perhaps too ready to 
adopt a hard bargaining strategy. In this dispute the employer 
has chosen to use replacement workers, a decision which, not 
surprisingly, has greatly angered the workers. In their view, the 
use of replacement workers is the reason the dispute has lasted 
so long.
<P>
	As members of the House know, the federal government has 
been examining the Canada Labour Code very intensively. It has 
been consulting with representatives from business, labour, and 
other interested parties. One of the issues being studied is 
whether the federal government ought to follow the examples 
set by Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia in their legislation 
to prohibit or restrict the use of replacement workers. Those who 
favour restrictions on  the use of replacements argue that when 
an employer continues to operate during a strike the collective 
bargaining process is frustrated and the employer's incentive to 
negotiate is removed, work stoppages are lengthened, and picket 
line violence is often inevitable.
<P>
	It is also argued that the use of replacements serves as a 
disincentive for employees to join unions. Workers who know 
they can be replaced easily during a strike will wonder about 
union effectiveness and will be less likely to opt for 
unionization.
<P>
	Those who oppose restrictions on the use of replacement 
workers say that such a move would tilt the balance of power 
toward labour, inevitably resulting in higher labour costs. They 
claim that it would deter new investment. The point is also made 
that most federally regulated industries are infrastructure 
industries. If they are completely shut down the entire economy 
would suffer.
<P>
	The issue is complex and divisive. The arguments on both 
sides are persuasive. Also persuasive is the fact that 75 per cent 
of the workforce under provincial jurisdiction is governed by 
legislation prohibiting the use of replacement workers.
<P>
	I will end my remarks by reiterating that I cannot support this 
bill because I believe firmly in free collective bargaining. The 
state has no business intervening in what are essentially private 
disputes.
<P>
	At the same time, I have concerns about the heavy handed and 
less than accommodating attitude of the company. Like many 
others, I whether the impasse would have lasted so long had 
there been restrictions on the use of replacement workers in the 
Canada Labour Code.
