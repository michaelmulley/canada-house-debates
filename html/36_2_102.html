<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX ACT

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 30 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment) be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There have been 
consultations among representatives of all the parties, and I 
seek unanimous consent for the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, at the conclusion of today's debate on the motion for the 
second reading of Bill C-205, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required 
in employment), all questions necessary to dispose of the said 
motion shall be deemed put and a recorded division deemed 
requested and deferred until Tuesday, May 30, 2000, at the expiry 
of the time provided for Government Orders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that there have been consultations among the 
leaders of all the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
unanimous consent to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is it the pleasure of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this bill presented by my friend and 
colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague has pointed out in his press releases, as well 
as in his speeches, this is a non-partisan bill.  Too often in 
this House we have to debate bills on which our party line 
obliges us to take a given position rather than another.  Here, 
we are dealing with a bill that directly affects taxpayers, 
their budgets and their wallets or purses.  It affects 
Quebecers, and it affects Canadians, equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in question is Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act (deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools 
required in employment). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the summary of the bill for the information of our 
audience as well as those MPs who have not yet reached a 
decision and who will, we hope, be favourable in a vote free of 
party lines—this not being a highly controversial subject: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to permit mechanics to deduct 
the cost of providing tools for their employment if they are 
required to do so by the terms of the employment. The deduction 
encompasses maintenance, rental and insurance costs, the full 
cost of tools under $250 or such inflation-adjusted limit as is 
set by regulation, and the capital cost allowance of tools over 
$250, set by regulation. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say “Yes, but mechanics will be able pull a fast 
one”. First, who is a mechanic?  Are all of those who tinker a bit 
with their cars in their garage mechanics?  Are those of us who 
can do a bit of maintenance on our cars from time to time 
mechanics?  Is this going to be a bit difficult to manage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not really, because a precedent exists in the federal 
government's Income Tax Act.  My colleague, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, is not proposing 
to create a precedent in the Income Tax Act. 
A precedent exists in the case of forest workers, musicians, 
doctors, dentists and certain businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a young person decides to become a mechanic—a trade in 
which there is a shortage at the moment, but one that is vital 
to Quebec and Canada where the number of family cars keeps 
growing and maintenance is necessary for environmental and 
financial reasons.  They decide after finishing technical 
training or high school to go and work as a mechanic in a 
garage. The day after earning their diploma they have to pay out 
somewhere between $15,000 and $40,000 in order to practice their 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few young people have between $15,000 and $40,000 to spend 
on equipment for their work.  However, as a musician or a 
dentist, I can buy equipment, and the government will give me a 
tax credit when I buy the equipment I need for my work.  As a 
mechanic, I cannot.  Often these young people, and the not so 
young, are asked to spend considerable amounts in order to be 
able to do their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in terms of the complexity of applying the law, there is 
already a precedent.  In financial terms, do we have the money? 
How much will it cost and do we have the funds to enable these 
young and not so young people to exercise their profession and 
to get tax relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told, to the thunderous applause of the Liberal 
Party, that there will be a $95 billion surplus for the next 
five years. 
If we have such surpluses, we should not spend all our time 
debating bills on endangered species, not because such bills are 
not important, but because we must also deal with other issues 
and take concrete measures for people in our communities. As I 
said earlier, a bill such as this one can have a direct bearing 
on people in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds are available. In fact, the Minister of Industry even 
wanted to use it in a preposterous fashion by offering owners of 
professional hockey teams financial compensation to help them 
remain in Canada, to help them increase their share of the 
market. The minister's idea was so ludicrous that, for the first 
time, we saw a minister backtrack within 24 or 48 hours and 
withdraw his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are funds available in the government's coffers and 
they must be appropriately invested, spent and earmarked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-205 would allow each and every member of this House to do 
something concrete for an important group of workers in their 
communities, regions, ridings and cities, particularly since 
these workers are often not among the most well-off. The average 
hourly rate for mechanics is around $15 an hour. This may come 
as a surprise, since it often costs us a little more than that 
when we bring in our vehicle for repairs. Still, the hourly rate 
for mechanics is around $15 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill which, and this is rare, would show the public 
the concrete nature of our work in this place. 
The public would see that we do not only ponder abstract 
concepts, as it often believes is the case, but that we also 
make decisions which, as was the case with forestry workers, 
doctors, dentists and musicians, have a direct and personal 
impact on people. I hope that the party line will not come into 
play regarding this issue—although I do not know whether or not 
this will be the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans has 
asked that the division be deferred until tomorrow evening.  I 
hope that on something such as this, which does not involve 
sovereignty or federalism, whether of Quebec or of Canada, or 
globalization or any other such matter, but is nothing more than 
an attempt to help honest folk enter the job market or prosper 
there, we will not see party lines imposed on certain parties 
and have unanimous voting against this non-partisan bill. 
Naturally, if members were to vote unanimously in favour of this 
bill, there would be no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of Bill C-205 would encourage the creation of jobs in the 
automobile industry.  It is clear from the number of high school 
graduates, especially in trades programs, that there is a 
serious shortage in this sector right now.  Passing this bill is 
one way of helping this important sector of economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the prospect of a tax break, young people might be more 
tempted to go into automobile mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several Bloc Quebecois members attended a reception hosted by 
the National Automotive Trades Association of Canada and, to our 
great surprise, we were, if I am not mistaken, the only party 
represented at this event, which was intended to bring this 
issue home to MPs, who hold the fate of the bill in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support this bill.  I invite those who did not 
attend this information session on the various aspects of such 
legislation and hear the arguments put forward by the 
association to take a hard look at the bill and its implications 
for their respective communities before voting, I hope, in 
favour of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this private member's bill. 
I commend my colleague from the Bloc for bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced in the last session by the member for 
Lakeland.  He did a lot of work on the background of this and I 
am glad to see that it has been carried forward.  The last time 
it was debated it was a non-votable.  This time it is votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is an issue of which everyone in the House is 
aware.  It has been brought to their attention that this is an 
inequity in our tax laws that needs to be addressed.  At a time 
when we are seeing surpluses in our revenues, the government 
needs to take a look at our tax laws and change the areas that 
need to be changed, address the inequities and recognize a trade 
that has been singled out to not receive the same treatment as 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the bill is before the House and that it is votable. I 
hope all members in the House will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is clear.  The member for Lakeland has received 
7,000 letters from mechanics from across the country who have 
pointed out the shortcomings of this part of the tax laws and 
that in this day of changing technologies it is becoming more and 
more onerous, because of the amount of money it takes to buy the 
tools, to get into the trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade is changing rapidly.  The technology and equipment 
these people have to repair, whether it is heavy-duty tractors, 
large machinery, automobiles or whatever, is changing.  It is 
computerized now.  There are fewer people who can even look under 
the hood of a vehicle and do anything with it.  It takes 
specialized people and specialized equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some mechanics estimate they need to invest $20,000 to $30,000 
into equipment just to do their jobs.  Having their own tools is 
one of the conditions of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as two weeks ago, I visited a young man in a shop in 
my riding.  He informed me that it was necessary for him to 
supply $5,000 to $10,000 worth of tools to move into a 
journeyman position.  He told me that was a big hurdle to 
overcome and that he may not be able to do that.  This is an 
example of a trained and eager young man who is interested in 
getting into the workforce but because of the amount of money it 
will take for him to invest he may not be able to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to look at the fact that this is happening. 
It needs to offer these people a tax credit for the tools they 
have to purchase as a condition of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time this bill was brought forward there were a number 
of issues raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Finance 
Minister and some of the statements need to be clarified or 
argued with.  One statement that he made was that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—mechanics are not the only occupation that incurs substantial 
expenses as a requirement of employment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course not.  There are many.  However they are the ones who 
cannot use this purchase of equipment as a deduction in their 
business.  What we are saying is that farmers and other 
businessmen, as well as artists, musicians and chainsaw 
operators, incur substantial expenses as a requirement of 
employment but they are able to deduct these costs.  Why can 
mechanics not also be added to this group?  The government could 
then ensure that other groups that incur expenses as a 
requirement of employment will be treated fairly by the tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a position where we can step back and have a look 
at our tax system to see where we could improve it.  There are 
many ways to improve our tax system and mechanics' tools is one 
area that needs to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy is supported by the all party House of Commons 
finance committee.  In its last report it stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommends that the government provide targeted tax 
relief for all those who must bear large expenses as a condition 
of employment, such as is the case with mechanics' tools. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All opposition parties are supportive, and I hope members of the 
government, when it comes time to stand to vote on this issue, 
will support it as well.  I am sure they are aware that this 
situation exists and that it needs to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill would also provide tax relief to all 
mechanics irrespective of the size of their expenditures instead 
of targeting relief to those incurring extraordinary expenses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty poor statement.  As we know, businessmen, 
farmers, all people who are involved in a business, are able to 
deduct their expenditures so why should mechanics be treated 
differently?  Not being compensated for small expenditures, 
whatever the level, is a matter for regulation that could be 
sorted out rather easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also stated that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provisions would need to be developed to ensure that tax 
relief is provided only for those items genuinely required as a 
condition of employment and not for those purchased for personal 
use. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That applies everywhere.  If we are buying something to carry on 
our business, that is separate from our personal lives.  That is 
minute nitpicking.  The true issue is that we have people who are 
putting out tens of thousands of dollars to get started and then 
supplementing that every year by $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 per year 
in purchases of specialized equipment to keep their jobs and they 
are not able to deduct that expense. That is totally unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was brought forward in 1998 by the member for 
Lakeland it received overwhelming support from people in the 
industry.  I have quotes from mechanics, people who hire 
mechanics and general managers of automotive dealerships who say 
that this is something that would go a long way in helping to 
improve the ability of their people to do a decent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minor change in Bill C-205 from the previous bill is that 
the amount of the deduction be changed to $250 from $200.  It is 
just a minor tweaking to bring it back.  This time it was brought 
back as a votable bill which will give it more debate in the 
House and more time for people to put their ideas forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a private member's bill drawn last week, thank goodness. 
It is like winning a lottery.  The whole scheme of things here is 
to get a private member's bill drawn and to have it made votable. 
To bring it to the House to make members stand on the issue is 
important.  This bill has made that one hurdle and has gone that 
one step further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting this initiative by the member. 
We believe it is an inequity that needs to be addressed.  The 
overwhelming positive response by people in the industry to this 
bill is a clear indication that it is needed.  I hope that 
government members of the House, when the bill comes to a vote, 
will realize that, will listen to the people and will support the 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today to Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. 
It is time this House reached a final decision in order to help 
out the mechanics of this country, the workers, by reducing 
their expenses when they start working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin a career as a mechanic, a person has to go to trade 
school, to community college, in order to learn his trade.  He 
graduates with a debt load.  Then, when he arrives at his first 
job, the first thing he needs is a tool set.  He needs a great 
many tools to do his job; otherwise he will not be hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are starting up a new company meet with government 
representatives and tell them “We are prepared to create x 
number of jobs”.  As hon. members are aware, this involves the 
transitional fund or some other such fund.  Mention of this 
brings out some nervous smiles in the House, but transitional 
funds are necessary tools for economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing here.  A mechanic who wants to work needs a 
tool box and tools, and these are very expensive.  It would not 
be the end of the world if a mechanic were entitled to a tax 
reduction.  For example, a woodsman who needs a chain saw in the 
spring in order to go out and work in the bush can get an income 
tax reduction for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are getting it on all sides.  We have seen how much 
this all costs.  We are talking several thousands.  I know, 
because I have worked with mechanics myself, and they were 
constantly having to purchase tools. 
When we changed from the British system of weights and measures 
to the metric system, two types of tools were needed, doubling 
the costs.  Because of changes in Canada, it cost them double. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics have asked me “Why are we as workers not entitled to a 
tax credit for our tools?  We pay taxes when we work.  If we 
need a tool for our work, why are we not entitled to tax 
relief?”  When companies have costs, they get tax breaks. 
Workers pay their taxes but want help with the cost of their 
tools, because they are expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to tell members about an experience I had last week. 
I took my car to the dealer's for repairs.  Two days ago, we 
found two of their tools in the car as we were washing it. 
We know where our car was, so we will return the tools to the 
mechanic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How often, however, with the number of tools they use in 
repairing people's cars, do mechanics leave their tools in cars, 
not because they want to leave them there of course, but because 
there are a lot of tools and a person can forget them.  Someone 
working on an engine can forget a tool.  That costs a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not once in a lifetime purchases.  A person does not 
just buy a wrench to use forevermore.  Regularly during the year 
other tools have to be bought.  They have to be bought all the 
time, because they get lost or are not the right tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will always need mechanics.  I have a car, I am sure 
you have a car, Madam Speaker, everyone has a car. 
If we are going to help the mechanics we need in this country, 
this would be the way to go about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for reductions on the price of their tools, 
but that the government at least give them tax deductions. It is 
normal for certain trades to get tax deductions. For example, 
fishers are entitled to certain deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tools cost a lot of money, and mechanics lose many through no 
fault of theirs. Let me give you the example of mechanics who 
work underground, in mines. There is rock, water and mud. They 
sometimes lose tools without even noticing it. They will never 
see these tools again. Each year, these mechanics lose many 
tools like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the conversion to the metric system. 
For our mechanics—I am repeating myself, but it is important to 
stress that point—that change means that their costs have 
doubled, since they now need two sets of tools: one for the 
British system and another for the metric system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people who must spend between $10,000 and 
$15,000 for their tools, depending on what type they need. 
Mechanics need these tools, otherwise they cannot work. 
Nowadays, companies that get started do not say “we will hire 
people and pay for their tools”. It is a known fact that, in 
Canada, mechanics must pay for their own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will certainly support this bill. There are mechanics 
in every riding represented in this House, whether it is by 
Liberal, Bloc Quebecois, Conservative, NDP or Canadian Alliance 
members. 
Service stations, mines or industry—they all have mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian Alliance member said earlier, thousands of 
people have signed petitions calling for a tax break for 
mechanics.  The government has surpluses right now.  It is time 
to help workers in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, there is no need to worry about 
companies.  If something breaks or they need new equipment, 
sometimes they do not even have to ask for help because the 
government is only too quick to suggest one of its programs.  I 
do not know whether public servants need to hang on to their 
jobs, but they are going after these companies and telling them: 
“We have one program here and another there.  We will work on 
this program and we will be able to help you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans.  His bill is truly 
important because it concerns a problem affecting all of Canada. 
There are mechanics everywhere.  These are not isolated jobs in 
one part of the country.  They are everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that government members, and all members, 
regardless of their party affiliation, take a stand and do the 
right thing, in order to show that we believe in our workers and 
that we can help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young graduates have had to spend a lot on their training.  Many 
of them work in service stations at minimum wage.  They work for 
$5.75 an hour.  In some provinces, they work for $7, $8, or $10 
an hour until they get their mechanic's licence, and that takes 
four years.  But while waiting to get their licence, they need 
their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I urge members to vote tomorrow evening in favour of 
the bill introduced by the Bloc Quebecois member, because it is 
important for our Canadian mechanics.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I stand today on behalf of our finance critic, the hon. 
member for Kings—Hants.  I know that he has spoken passionately 
on this issue.  We support Bill C-205, which would amend the 
Income Tax Act to allow the deduction of expenses incurred by a 
mechanic for tools required in employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax system is very unfair to mechanics.  As we well know, 
many professionals can deduct the cost of the tools required to 
perform their work.  One of the exceptions is mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are being supported by members on this side of the 
House as well as by many members on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been around for a long time.  Ten years ago, when 
I was sitting on that side of the House, I was approached by 
mechanics.  It was waved in front of the government then.  Much 
to my displeasure, the government which I represented at that 
time did not give this issue the attention it deserved.  It is 
time the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politics of this issue are the politics of governing. 
Governments are very reluctant to introduce tax measures which 
would appear to cost the government revenue.  Most of us would 
argue that is not the case.  If the economy is to grow and if we 
are encouraging people to work, they must have some breaks along 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that representatives of the Canadian 
Automobile Dealers Association support this move.  They appeared 
before the finance committee on behalf of mechanics to seek tax 
deductibility of technicians' tools.  They have appeared before 
the committee many times.  Since 1992 they have been onside. 
They made this public and appeared before the finance committee 
for the first time in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee stated in its 1997 pre-budget report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee recommends that the government provide targeted tax 
relief for all those who must bear large expenses as a condition 
of employment, such as is the case with mechanic's tools. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1996 pre-budget report the committee stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee recommends that the Government consider measures to 
provide targeted tax relief for large expenses incurred as a 
condition of employment, such as mechanic's tools. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically it is saying the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee, which is an all parliamentary committee, 
supports the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 115,000 mechanics in this country who could 
benefit from such a measure; the measure being tax relief for 
those who have to buy their tools in order to work.  The average 
mechanic spends approximately $15,000 on tools once they have 
received their training just to begin working in the profession. 
Some invest up to $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we well know, mechanics need to replace worn out equipment, 
and they must replace it at great expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting statistic, from the point of view of public 
sympathy, is that the average wage of a mechanic is only $29,000 
per annum.  What would be the cost to the Government of Canada if 
it were to do this?

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost would not be high in the grant scheme of things, but it 
would send a signal to our young professionals, and mechanics are 
professionals and that we care about them, that we think their 
services are important.  They should be able to deduct the cost 
of their tools as many other professional people can.  This is a 
case of fairness, and we want to see that fairness exercised by 
the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving politics behind, I remind the House that this issue has 
been before the House for at least 10 years.  Given the fact that 
the all party parliamentary committee and automobile dealers 
across the country can agree, surely to goodness the Government 
of Canada can do something to give our mechanics the tax relief 
they deserve. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise to speak to Bill C-205, introduced by my colleague, the 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
and intended to enable mechanics to deduct the cost of 
purchasing or replacing tools from their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fortunate enough to work as a mechanic for 15 years with a 
North Shore mining company, IOC, in Sept-Îles.  Fortunately, this 
company sometimes replaced lost tools.  If we had had to pay for 
them out of our pocket, it would have been hard.  Those not 
familiar with the job of mechanic, especially, that of heavy 
engineering, have no idea of the costs involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, a vernier used in measuring diameters cost a minimum of 
$150.  With inflation and the rise in costs of all sorts, I am 
pretty sure that today it would cost $250.  A mechanic's tool 
box has several such tools in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not always through negligence, sometimes through misfortune, 
because of the location of the work and the conditions, tools, 
which are vulnerable, can get lost.  I worked on a ship loader, 
on ocean going vessels, some 200 feet or 60 metres above the 
water and I have dropped tools into the water.  At the time it 
represented several hundred dollars.  It was accidental. 
Fortunately, this company, which I have always respected and 
which I was proud to work for for 15 years, replaced our tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst had to say about 
cleaning his car after it had been repaired and finding two 
mechanic's tools.  I had the same experience last year.  When we 
are talking about Snap-On tools, they are quality tools, but I 
have seen screwdrivers cut in two by the spark produced when a 
mechanic touched two terminals, thus joining negative and 
positive.  There went $15.  That may not seem like much, but it 
adds up when the same thing happens a number of times in a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it is doing justice to blue collar workers, to 
people who work with their hands, to recognize certain rights 
for them, the right to replace their tools and the right to 
acquire tools in order to get a job.  This is doing them justice 
when other professionals of all kinds have obtained the right to 
replace or upgrade their equipment without having to ask for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was made earlier to dentists.  There are a number of 
different self-employed workers and professionals who have to 
replace their tools.  When I was a notary, I bought pencils by 
the case.  I did not have to fight to get them included in my 
operating expenses.  This was taken for granted and no one 
disputed it.  In my case, it is just about the only thing that 
was not disputed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the mechanic, for whom the toolkit represents a major 
investment, all the more so because the tools are subject to 
loss or breakage, he is not entitled to this deduction, although 
he is probably a long way down on the scale of earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans is showing respect 
for workers.  I believe his bill must be supported.  I am 
delighted that it was introduced here by one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more delighted that the other parties, those in 
opposition at least, seem prepared to espouse my colleague's 
cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Considering that the debate will conclude in about four minutes, 
as the sponsor of this bill, which will be voted on tomorrow, I 
am asking for the unanimous consent of the House to conclude my 
remarks, for a maximum of four minutes. I need the unanimous 
consent of the House, since I already spoke on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to conclude the debate in 
five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank members from all parties for agreeing to give 
me the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to inform this House and those who are 
listening to us that this bill transcends party lines. It is not 
about diverging political options or diverging views on 
Quebec-Canada relations, not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of their parliamentary activities in their 
ridings, all 301 members of this House have opportunities to 
visit car dealerships and to meet with mechanics in their riding 
offices. We are already aware of this issue of deducting the 
cost of providing tools for their employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister said, we are perhaps 12 or 15 months away 
from the next election.  All members of parliament who decide to 
run again will have to visit automobile dealers and will be 
questioned on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore appealing to their common sense.  Judging by the 
three hours of debate, Canadian Alliance, Bloc Quebecois of 
course, NDP and Progressive Conservative members are all in 
favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the Liberal majority.  The Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance—perhaps he was expressing a personal 
opinion—did not seem too inclined to vote in favour of the bill. 
But I appeal to the Liberal members. 
This will not be a vote along party lines, but what is called a 
free vote.  I am certain that they will follow their conscience 
and vote in favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I remind the House that, in 1997, the Standing 
Committee on Finance, composed of a majority of Liberal members, 
made the following recommendation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommends that the Government consider measures 
to provide targeted tax relief for large expenses incurred as a 
condition of employment, such as mechanic's tools.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my Liberal colleague from Vaughan—King—Aurora, who 
was the committee chair, that he voted for the recommendation. 
My Liberal colleague from Gatineau, my colleagues from 
Sarnia—Lambton, Provencher, Niagara Falls, Kitchener Centre, 
Mississauga South and Stoney Creek, who were on the Standing 
Committee on Finance representing the Liberal majority, that 
they voted in favour of the recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that automobile technicians expect us as 
parliamentarians to recognize finally the importance of their 
profession to society and to give it its true worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply a matter of establishing some balance in relation 
to other job categories that can deduct the cost of their tools. 
It is also a matter of encouraging our young people who might be 
tempted to join this profession, if we gave them a tax break. It 
is also a matter of young men and women seeing that the 
government is listening to their concerns and promoting the 
development of this profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Pursuant to the order made 
earlier today, every question necessary to dispose of the motion

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 17 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to be able to take part in the debate surrounding Bill 
C-16, our last and final opportunity to debate the bill before it 
proceeds to its final vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus feels strongly that Bill C-16 has merit and does 
meet the needs of Canadian citizens.  We are comfortable and 
satisfied that the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration listened to numerous representations.  In fact 37 
groups and organizations came before the committee.  We are 
satisfied that the concerns brought forward by the experts in the 
field and by the many advocates who made representations were 
incorporated into the final bill.  In other words the committee 
heard Canadians.  The committee listened to them and the 
committee instilled what it heard into what we now know as Bill 
C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill started out in its first incarnation as Bill C-63.  It 
was dealt with, at length, under that name.  We brought forward 
many concerns and recommended amendments at committee stage. We 
are pleased to say that the government when it reintroduced the 
bill as Bill C-16 took into consideration many of the 
shortcomings we pointed out with respect to the original bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 37 presentations to the committee is an indication of the 
broad interest in this subject.  I have sat on other committees 
and dealt with other pieces of legislation when we did not have 
nearly as many groups coming forward.  People feel strongly about 
the issue of citizenship.  Canadian citizenship is to be valued. 
Canadian citizenship is to be treasured.  Most of us feel very 
passionate because most Canadians are fiercely proud Canadian 
nationalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the particular bill generated so much interest is 
that many of us are looking at citizenship in a whole new light, 
given the global economy we currently live in.  We have been 
forced to re-evaluate and revisit the whole concept of 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the globalization of capital we are seeing borders 
disappear.  Many say we are probably witnessing the beginning of 
the end of the concept of a nation state.  Free movement of 
goods, services, investment and capital does not pay attention to 
international borders.  These things are happening all around us. 
The only way we can define ourselves and maintain our identity as 
Canadian is to ensure that the nation state of Canada survives as 
a entity and that the personification of that or the way it 
affects citizens is by virtue of our citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned when we see international trade agreements 
that do not recognize nation state boundaries.  For instance, we 
saw the MAI, the multilateral agreement on investment, which 
recently failed.  The people of the world voted that idea down. 
The people who were promoting the MAI were actually quoted as 
saying that there was a surplus of democracy in the world which 
was interfering with the free movement of capital, meaning that 
freely elected governments were getting in the way of what 
businesses wanted to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I raise the issue that people are concerned about 
the concept of citizenship.  They are concerned about the concept 
of the nation state and ultimately about the future of democracy 
if we have corporate leaders of the world saying that there is a 
surplus of democracy in the world that is interfering with the 
movement of capital.  It makes us wonder what is the next step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the reasons people are concerned with the idea 
of citizenship and why we had so many groups come forward to the 
committee.  It is not just about the practical aspects of how one 
achieves citizenship in Canada or how citizenship can be revoked 
within the country.   Those are the technical elements.  There is 
a larger more philosophical issue regarding the very concept and 
nature of citizenship.  Many of the groups that came forward and 
made representations dealt with the much bigger picture of what 
it means to be a citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In being a citizen of Canada I believe the whole is greater than 
the sum of its parts in many senses.  It is a feeling of 
camaraderie.  It is a feeling of togetherness that Canadians 
enjoy, being part of the greatest country in the world.  It is 
something we treasure and value but we take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take note that citizenship is not a right.  It is a 
privilege.  With citizenship comes responsibilities.  With 
citizenship comes many benefits, but it also carries with it the 
burden of responsibilities.  We have to conduct ourselves in a 
certain way or frankly our citizenship can be revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are parts of Bill C-16 that deal with the revocation of 
citizenship.  Some of those who made representation to the 
committee felt very strongly that it gave the minister far too 
much power in terms of the revocation of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is satisfied that on that subject Bill C-16 is balanced, 
in that there are options for appeal at every stage of the 
revocation of citizenship.  This can ultimately wind up in the 
highest court of the land and we do not believe anyone needs any 
more avenue of recourse than that.  I am glad to see we have 
broad acceptance of that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are comfortable that Bill C-16 gives the avenue of recourse 
of appeal to the federal courts.  We are satisfied that Bill C-16 
is not too heavy handed in dealing with the revocation of 
citizenship.  We are comfortable now that the terms of gaining 
citizenship are clarified.  Some of the changes we asked for in 
the early stages of Bill C-63 have been incorporated in Bill 
C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found great fault with a change which recommended that when 
people take their citizenship tests they would have to know one 
of the official languages of the country.  They would not have 
access to translators.  They would have no access to 
interpretation.  We did not think that knowledge of one of the 
official languages and any kind of a test for what kind of a good 
citizen a person would be related whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to see that under the current incarnation of the 
bill people will be allowed access to translation services if 
their working knowledge of either of the official languages is 
inadequate to carry them through what can be a very complicated 
test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue we commented on and brought forward at the early 
stages of Bill C-63 was the concept of being physically present 
for a certain period of time in order to qualify for citizenship. 
We pointed out that many landed immigrants, many new Canadians 
who come here, still have interests offshore.  Some may be 
business people.  We can use the example of a new Canadian from 
Asia who may have a number of different business ventures 
throughout that region.  That person would have to travel to take 
care of those interests.  We also do not believe that physical 
presence in the country is any kind of a test or an indication of 
what kind of citizen the person will ultimately be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt it was being unnecessarily rigid to demand that a person 
be physically present for <I>x</I> number of days within a certain 
timeframe in order to qualify for citizenship.  We are 
comfortable that the government listened to these concerns and 
tempered those measures somewhat along the lines we asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of groups came forward and spoke about citizenship 
rules as they pertain to disqualification due to criminal 
activity.  We believe we should not be providing safe refuge or 
sanctuary for international criminals. 
We have every right.  We do not believe it is a violation of any 
of our international obligations under human rights conventions 
of the United Nations to say to some people that we will not 
allow them to be citizens of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We value our citizenship too much and it trivializes my 
citizenship to allow people into this country who would abuse the 
system or who would take refuge and sanctuary in order to carry 
on criminal activity.  We will not tolerate it.  Canadians want 
tough rules to make that abundantly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are incredibly tolerant in terms of their attitude 
toward immigration per se.  We want the front doors opened even 
wider when it comes to inviting new Canadians to come to this 
country, but we also want the back doors shut soundly so that we 
are not allowing any undesirables, international criminals, 
terrorists or people of that type to take sanctuary or refuge in 
Canada.  We do not need them and we do not want them here.  Bill 
C-16 in a very soft way speaks to that somewhat when it deals 
with the revocation of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party caucus is comfortable that Bill C-16 
meets the needs of Canadians in terms of acquiring citizenship. 
It sets fair rules for both the acquiring of citizenship and the 
revocation of citizenship in the unlikely event that it becomes 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are comfortable that the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration listened to the concerns brought forward by a 
number of Canadians, by some 37 groups that made representations, 
and by members of the committee like myself who moved amendments 
at committee stage.  We are satisfied now that those concerns 
have been addressed under Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be looking forward to voting in favour of the bill to 
move it through the House so that we can spend more time 
addressing the larger issue of immigration and refugee protection 
found under Bill C-31, another citizenship and immigration bill 
that deals more with the meat and potatoes of the immigration 
rules and how we attract and retain more people to come to Canada 
to help us grow the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking forward to moving on from Bill C-16 satisfied 
that it is adequate and to getting into the much larger debate of 
immigration and refugee protection under Bill C-31.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, could the member tell us one of the many groups that 
made presentations on revocation of citizenship which was 
satisfied with not having a right to appeal a decision of one 
federal court judge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, people are satisfied that it 
has been illustrated and demonstrated quite clearly that there is 
a right to appeal at every stage of the revocation of 
citizenship, all the way to the highest court in the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated that people are satisfied and comfortable with that. 
When it came forward that there may be an alteration in Bill 
C-16, or an amendment to the act that would change the access to 
the appeal process, a number of groups were concerned. The issue 
was raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clarified by the department heads of citizenship and 
immigration that nothing in Bill C-16 threatened the right to 
appeal in the case of revocation of citizenship.  In fact there 
is a right to appeal at every stage of the process.  It is an 
exhaustive, some would say even ponderous, appeal process that 
can take years.  As we well know, there are classic cases in 
Canada that went on five, seven or nine years before people were 
ultimately issued a deportation order or had their citizenship 
revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked at the charts, graphs and tables of how the appeal 
process would take place, we are comfortable that there is an 
exhaustive appeal mechanism inherent in Bill C-16 and inherent in 
the citizenship and immigration acts.  I do not think there is 
any cause for concern.  Those groups that did come forward with 
those concerns have had them allayed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will begin by saying that it is a great honour to speak today 
to Bill C-16 and what it means not only for the country but 
especially people who want to make Canada their country, and 
certainly those who have been here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre.  He made many valid points.  Certainly the one which I 
wanted to echo was that the committee, having listened to and 
heard witnesses, has now been able to make decisions which are 
appropriate to the matter at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship, as all members of the House and all Canadians know, 
is of great value to individuals and their families.  It bestows 
upon them great honour and responsibility as well as rights which 
are inherent under the charter and the constitution of this great 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to my great-great-grandparents.  They came to this 
country in 1827 via Bucks County, Pennsylvania having first come 
from Europe.  Over the years we have cherished those things which 
we hold near and dear, that is, being citizens of this great 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of history it is amazing to think that prior to 1947 
Canadians were still not Canadians as we know them but rather 
were British subjects.  It is interesting that the Prime Minister 
himself was 12 years old before he actually had Canadian 
citizenship given to him.  We were British subjects until that 
point.  Having said that, citizenship and all that goes with it 
is something which Canadians now value greatly in terms of what 
it means to be a Canadian. It is important that we celebrate and 
cherish that which we hold near and dear to us. In 1947 the 
Liberal government of the day under Prime Minister Mackenzie King 
ensured that Canadians would have a status which we cherish to 
this day, being a citizen of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is a concept in our culture which goes back to the 
city states of the ancient Greeks.  For them the life of a 
citizen meant deep involvement in the life of a city.  It meant 
the widest possible rights and privileges. It was also a very 
restrictive status, something which we no longer have.  For 
example, no woman or newcomer could hope to be a citizen in those 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that restrictive status continued over the centuries, it 
has finally been washed away.  In a sense we still see it today 
in countries which restrict their citizenship and those people 
who are part of a traditional ethnic group. Unlike Canada there 
are many countries where citizenship is not an opportunity to 
welcome people.  It is not an opportunity for newcomers to 
declare that they are ready and willing to become a full part of 
their communities as citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is clear that Canada has been different in that 
regard.  We welcome newcomers.  We grant full citizenship to all 
our people in a manner consistent with the charter and the 
constitutional prerogatives, as well as the rights that Canadian 
citizens no matter where they live in this great country of ours 
have come to expect and deservedly so.  It is important that we 
keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians travel abroad it becomes apparent how great our 
citizenship is and what a great country Canada is.  It is 
important that we value and cherish all that goes along with what 
it means to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear in terms of what that 1947 act did.  I offer 
that by way of background because it is important. That act 
treated men and women differently when it came to issues such as 
marrying a non-Canadian and keeping Canadian citizenship if they 
lived abroad, passing citizenship to their children if they lived 
abroad, and finally, how soon the spouses of men and women could 
become citizens. That was part and parcel of the 1947 act, yet 
for all the faults we have seen in retrospect, that act was an 
important starting point.  It set us on the course which had led 
us to where we are today with Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that what has never changed is a sense 
that citizenship is about joining the Canadian family, and a 
great family it is.  It is about sharing in the values, 
traditions and institutions which define us as a people and unite 
us as a nation and which have made us the finest country in the 
world according to the United Nations Human Development Report 
for six years in a row. 
That is no coincidence.  It is because of who we are and what we 
represent and the citizenship of Canadians is part of that 
greatness that is ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When new Canadians take the oath of citizenship outlined in the 
bill, they will speak about what it means to be Canadian. They 
will pledge their loyalty and allegiance to Canada and to our 
Queen. They will promise to respect Canada's rights and freedoms 
and uphold the constitution.  They will vow to uphold the 
democratic values that allow us to debate some very important 
issues in the spirit of openness, transparency and accountability 
which we do in this great democratic system of ours in Canada. 
They will promise to do what we should do, to observe our laws 
and fulfil the duties and obligations of what it means to be a 
true citizen of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just words.  Those words get to the heart of what 
citizenship is all about.  They are about agreeing to accept the 
basic rules of how our society operates.  They are about agreeing 
to play a full role in the life of our society in terms of what 
it means to help others to care and to share and to use the kinds 
of values in a meaningful way for Canadians wherever they are in 
this country. It also means acting at the ballot box, on a jury 
or just in the day to day debate among fellow citizens.  It means 
ensuring that we vote, that we fulfil our duties as citizens in 
meaningful and tangible ways and in a way consistent with the 
values that are part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, at this point I want to indicate that I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Cambridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countries in the world that essentially sell their 
citizenship.  People in parts of the world actually do that for 
money.  They buy passports which can be used to go elsewhere. 
Some travel documents might be part of that as well.  It is 
selling hope, false hope in many cases, in volatile parts of the 
world, and it is most unfortunate.  But it will never, never give 
a person what Canadian citizenship does, and that is what we have 
here.  Those passports of convenience that are sold never 
announce to the world that a person is part of a great family the 
way our citizenship does.  A person is never linked to the men 
and women from all over the world who regardless of birth share 
in the pride of being citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what citizenship is all about.  That is what it means to 
be Canadian.  That is what it means to have the kinds of values 
that unite us as a people in that sense and ensure that we carry 
on in a meaningful way consistent with that which our forefathers 
and foremothers did, including that which newcomers to this 
country also add.  That is important so we can build on the 
foundations of the past with vision, insight and foresight.  We 
project into the future with confidence knowing that we have one 
of the finest, and I would argue the finest, country in the 
world. We need to celebrate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I state simply that Bill C-16 helps to reinforce that 
which we take for granted so many times in this great country of 
ours and especially our citizenship. Having said that, I move:

Speaker, the question I have is why would the hon. member pull 
such a sneaky manoeuvre to try to ride over the former 
parliamentary secretary of this particular portfolio? 
The former parliamentary secretary put his position on the line 
because he took a stand on principle.  The government, by going 
ahead and trying to pull some of the sneaky manoeuvres as it has 
done, is punishing and restricting his ability to do the duty 
that his constituents have given him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to tell us why he is sticking a 
knife in the back of the former parliamentary secretary who has 
been working very hard on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I need not take lessons from the 
member opposite when it comes to being sneaky and sticking knives 
into backs.  He is the expert on the reformed alliance side of 
the House. He is part and parcel of what those people over there 
repeatedly do in terms of the kinds of things they are prepared 
to do every which way.  I am speaking of some of the egregious 
things that I have witnessed the hon. member do.  I think of the 
debate about Mr. Thompson and the Senate when the member was 
leading members of his party with mariachi bands and sombreros 
and tacos were dripping in the marble halls of this great 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to those kinds of things, I need not take a lesson 
from the member opposite. He should hang his head in shame, quite 
frankly, in terms of the kinds of things he has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the normal process in terms of the kinds of things we 
are doing to expedite the government and what we need to do in 
the great Parliament of Canada.  We are moving the government 
agenda along and I am pleased to be part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out 
that any of the commentary I have done in the past with regard to 
the Senate is party policy and something which a lot of Canadians 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has in a sense violated the privileges of a 
member of this place, a member of his own party, someone who 
stood up on a point of principle, someone who for the sake of his 
constituents did what he thought was right in resigning his 
position as parliamentary secretary.  He is trying to do the best 
he can for his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has gone ahead and done something to deprive the 
former parliamentary secretary of acting on the will of his 
constituents.  This is one of the most lowdown, dishonourable 
things the member could do. He deprived one of the members of 
this place who has lost a position because of his stand on 
principle the opportunity to put forward a question on this 
issue. The member across the way can go ahead and make aspersions 
on me, but how he can justify backstabbing one of his own on 
something he has personally suffered for in order to advance the 
cause of his constituents, is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is quite 
simply wrong.  There has been no violation in terms of what the 
process is here today.  It is a standard process.  We are moving 
along to expedite a very important bill that Canadians wherever 
they live in this great country of ours feel strongly about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the reformed alliance people, those extremists 
who sit opposite, they stir the pot and stab each other in the 
back.  Look at what is happening in the leadership race and the 
extremist positions they are taking and the monkey business in 
terms of voting and stacking votes.  Look at what happened at 
their convention not so long ago.  I think 1,200 people were 
registered yet 1,600 people voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to lowdown tricks, when it comes to egregious 
mechanisms, those people opposite, those extremists, those 
reformed alliance people, have not only written the book, but 
they have kept chapter after chapter going for the rest of us. 
Only they know the kinds of things they do repeatedly. It is 
outrageous what they do and Canadians see through it every time. 
Canadians see through those extremists for who they are and for 
what they represent.

watching in their offices will hang their heads in shame.  I hope 
the former parliamentary secretary has a chance to make his case 
before caucus and that he is able to sway some opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship.  Bill C-16 does not constitute a major or modern 
reform as it says it does.  It falls short and that is 
unfortunate.  Its critical areas have been neglected, while 
others have been altered in a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister received recommendations from the government 
dominated Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in 
1994 and the government has taken over five years to prepare 
legislation which still does not address the committee's key 
recommendations.  Once again we have a case of the government 
writing the recommended reforms and not carrying them forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas I would like to deal with specifically is that 
of citizenship at birth, which is referenced in subclauses 4(1) 
through 4(4). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is setting itself up for a problem.  We have a provision 
which allows citizenship at birth, which makes sense for people 
who are born here of Canadian citizens.  However, that provision 
also applies to people who are visiting our country, landed 
immigrants and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia has noted this problem.  Because of this incentive 
structure, parents who are not Canadian citizens will bear a 
child in Canada and that child will become a Canadian citizen. 
Then the child is, in a sense, used as a bargaining chip for that 
family to remain in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States people cross the border from Mexico to 
Texas via the Rio Grande.  Pregnant women muster themselves as 
best they can to cross the border because they know that if they 
can make it across, even if they hurt themselves in some way, if 
they bear their child within the boundaries of the United States 
it will become an American citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, with all the boats carrying migrants that we are 
expecting to receive on our shores this summer, is creating the 
same scenario.  Women from other countries will make the 
assumption, because of this part of our law, that by hook or by 
crook they will make their way, whether it is good for their 
health or not, in rusty buckets of boats so they will have the 
chance to bear a child on Canadian soil.  That would give the 
child Canadian citizenship and, therefore, it would give the 
mother a bargaining chip to remain in Canada.  The sick thing is, 
that provides an incentive for pregnant women to make that 
arduous journey in the worst of circumstances. 
It is poor public policy for the government to set up an 
incentive whereby pregnant women will put themselves and their 
children at risk so the child may be born on Canadian soil.  I 
say shame on the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia was responsible enough when it made changes to its 
law.  It deemed that at least one parent had to be a citizen of 
Australia.  As a result, there was not this use of children as 
bargaining chips for the sake of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has dealt with conditions for granting citizenship on 
presence in Canada.  Once upon a time, in and around 1977, a 
residency period of five years was necessary to gain Canadian 
citizenship.  Then the Liberal government of the day reduced it 
to three years.  It used to be three years out of five.  However, 
the government has determined in its wisdom, even with all the 
problems we have with refugee status, with people claiming things 
illegally, with sham marriages and all the numerous things that 
are problems with our immigration system, to move it to three 
years out of six to make it that much easier for people to 
qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, there is no stipulation for what is residency. 
In the law there is a provision which says that it is based on 
physical presence in Canada.  However, the problem is that it 
does not provide any mechanism for determining when applicants 
arrive in Canada and when they leave, and there is no plan to 
develop one.  There is no ability to check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, people will come to Canada and say “I am now 
qualifying for my residency with my physical presence in 
Canada”.  They are then able to leave through one of the 
unmanned border posts, catch a flight from Seattle to wherever 
they are from and stay in that country.  Meanwhile, Canadian 
records report them as having been here.  They can return, at 
their convenience, after having lived abroad for a few years, at 
which time they may automatically be granted Canadian 
citizenship, even though they were not actually physically 
present.  The government says there is a provision for physical 
presence, but in terms of actually delivering, there is not.  It 
does not have any way of checking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of, for example, Koreans flying out of Seattle 
because of unmanned border posts.  They come to Canada, apply for 
citizenship, the residency clock starts to tick, they leave 
through an unmanned border post, go to Seattle, fly back to Asia, 
do business, continue to conduct their affairs over there, many 
times evading Canadian tax, and then come back at their own 
leisure.  After a couple of years, even though they are working 
abroad, they are granted Canadian citizenship.  That is a serious 
problem which the government has done nothing to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to clause 8 of the bill, concerning adoption outside 
Canada, once upon a time if people were coming to Canada they 
would have to undergo a medical.  The government is watering down 
this whole provision of giving medicals to people coming to the 
country.  As a result, people will be able to adopt children with 
all sorts of ailments and illnesses, things that previously would 
have been screened in medicals.  Who pays for it?   The Canadian 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has opened Canada to more problems, 
despite the fact that it has seen all of the problems we have 
been dealing with so far and for which it has been taking a lot 
of heat.  What does it do?  Rather than fix the problems it opens 
us up to more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is blatant patronage in the bill.  Clauses 31 and 32 deal 
with citizenship judges and citizenship commissioners.  The sad 
thing is that patronage appointments were the problem when the 
last changes were made.  When Barbara McDougall was minister the 
Progressive Conservatives created citizenship judges.  Of course, 
all sorts of loyal party hacks got these jobs and got paid good 
money to sing the Canadian national anthem and have people take 
the oath of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals recognized there was a problem.  Parliamentary 
committees reported that lack of merit in these positions was a 
problem, so the government just changed the name.  It is almost 
like big brother 1984.  Instead of calling them citizenship 
judges, they will now be called citizenship commissioners.  It is 
still the same thing.  The same party hacks are going to get the 
jobs.  Those patronage positions are still there.  It was 
probably just too juicy a plum to leave alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 concerns the language requirements to gain citizenship. 
Once again there has been a watering down of the language 
requirements.  The government only requires that people have an 
adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada. 
What is an adequate knowledge?  It is very vague.  The government 
knows exactly what it is doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a recently published book by Charles M. 
Campbell, entitled <I>Betrayal & Deceit:  the Politics of 
Canadian Immigration</I>.  Mr. Campbell was a vice-chairman of the 
Immigration Appeal Board for a number of years.  He points out 
that Australia had the political courage to deal with a number of 
these situations and made the necessary changes.  The Australians 
recognized that there were people who were engaging in sham 
marriages, who had poor employment prospects, and all the rest of 
these things, just as we have in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were some of the provisions that Australia implemented? 
One was that in order for someone to be deemed effective in the English 
language they had to be able to demonstrate four things: 
they had to be able to read English, speak English, understand English 
and write English.  Of course, in Canada that would apply 
to both English and French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-16 the government has stipulated that people should 
have an adequate understanding, an adequate knowledge.  Adequate 
in no way implies that they be able to read one of the official 
languages, be able to speak one of the official languages, be 
able to understand one of the official languages, or be able to 
write in one of the official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australians knew they had a problem to fix.  In Canada we have 
not fixed it.  As a result, we are spending all sorts of money to 
teach people the language once they come here.  That puts a 
burden on Canadian taxpayers.  It is something that could have 
easily been remedied by actually having provisions for those four 
skills with regard to understanding the official languages, but 
the government failed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things which Australia had the courage to deal 
with which this government did not.  The Australians also had the 
skill level restricted to those occupations that require a trade 
certificate, a degree, a diploma or an associate diploma.  As 
well, the qualifications must have been obtained at least three 
years before the application to immigrate was filed.  That is 
very pertinent.  In Canada we have a lot of people who are 
immigrating who have particular skill sets, but when they come to 
Canada, because they do not meet the qualifications here, they 
cannot work in their area of expertise.  As a result, we have a 
number of well educated people driving cabs.  That is part of the 
problem with what the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia also dealt with age.  We all know that we have a huge 
aging population.  We have a demographic bubble that is going to 
burst in 2017, which will probably bankrupt and destroy the 
Canada pension plan.  Nonetheless, this government is continuing 
to allow itself to take on more and more unfunded liabilities and 
responsibilities with regard to social programs and pensions for 
people who immigrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia had the courage to say that the ideal age criteria for 
a new immigrant were people who were over the age of 21 and under 
the age of 35.  People over the age of 45 would not be 
acceptable.  Australia recognized that the pension and health 
care obligations would be too burdensome.  The Australians 
recognized that it would be a burden to allow people from other 
countries to immigrate without pension and health care systems 
such as we have in Canada.  It would a burden for them to enter 
under an easy guise and receive those benefits without actually 
having provided much of a benefit to the country in terms of 
having worked there productively during their prime earning 
years.  Australia had the courage to deal with these things. 
However, once again this government totally shied away from any 
of those important considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I would support an immigration and citizenship 
policy that would require children born in Canada to take the 
citizenship of their parents.  Children born in Canada to landed 
immigrants, therefore, would assume Canadian citizenship. 
However, people who come here, putting their child and themselves 
at risk in order to bear their child in Canada, should not be 
given citizenship.  We are creating an incentive for those women 
to put themselves at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizenship oath, clause 34, had very little public input. 
The minister, in a sense, prepared this oath on her own.  There 
was no debate and the citizens were not involved in creating the 
new oath of citizenship.  It would have been an ideal opportunity 
for a nationwide patriotic debate on the matter but that was not 
done.  The minister decided to develop this on her own behind 
closed doors.  Now we will have whatever the minister deems fit 
as a citizenship oath rather than what the country could have 
decided.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I reiterate that there were many things the 
government could have done and failed to do.  For example, with 
regard to spousal considerations, spouse will be a very loose 
term.  As a result, spouse will include not the idea of just a 
marriage between one man and one woman but it will also include 
common law relationships.  Goodness knows, we have sham marriages 
that are arranged already, but imagine if we allow people in on 
common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets even better.  There is the allowance for the whole idea 
of same sex provisions.  For example, a person could pick up a 
lover some place where they do not have the same type of medicare 
provisions for AIDS research and whatnot.  They could bring those 
people back here and because they would be considered a same sex 
partner they will be able to charge those medical bills to the 
Canadian medicare system.  When does the silliness end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to wrap up with what I consider to be basically the 
summation of the points.  We used to have citizenship based on 
five years of actually living in the country.  It has now been 
whittled down to three out of six.  There is no provision 
whatsoever for checking on whether or not they are physically 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, it took the government five years to come up 
with what it has, which is very little compared to what it could 
have had, and it was done behind closed doors.  It kept in all 
the provisions that dealt with patronage and continues to violate 
the recommendations that were put forward by its own standing 
committee and the recommendations that were put forward by the 
CIC department, the official opposition and what many Canadians 
themselves would support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a final point, I want to let the House know that as a result 
of these things and because of what the former parliamentary 
secretary was attempting to do with the bill, he believes, as do 
many, that the government should not be acting as a prosecutor. 
Right now we have people who are going before a political court, 
that being the governor in council, and are being stripped of 
their Canadian citizenship despite the fact that they have been 
in the country 20, 30, sometimes 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to table the following amendment, “That after the word 
“that” the following be substituted therefor:  Bill C-16, an 
act respecting Canadian citizenship be not now read a third time 
but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration for the purposes of reconsidering clauses 16 and 17 
with due regard for the fact that Bill C-16 continues the current 
system of revocation which has been in place since 1920, allowing 
the governor in council on a report by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration to revoke a person's citizenship and, 
the arguments put forward by groups and individuals, such as the 
German Canadian Congress, the B'nai Brith Canada and the 
former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, that citizenship should be a decision of the courts 
and not be decided by politicians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a subamendment will be coming forward as well.  The 
amendment basically deals with the whole idea that the government 
can act as prosecutor against people who have been in the country 
for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we want to be able to deal with these things 
expeditiously, we cannot have the cabinet acting as the judge and 
stripping people of citizenship despite the fact that they have 
been here 10, 20, 30 or 40 years.  That is not fair to them and 
it is not fair to their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Madam Speaker, you can hear the catcalling across the 
way.  The Liberals know they have back-stabbed their 
parliamentary secretary and I am sure are feeling guilty about 
it, as they should.  I have seen some rather dastardly things 
pulled here today.  Hopefully, they will take that into 
consideration and in their caucus meeting on Wednesday they will 
be able to debate it and figure out the right thing to do so they 
are not depriving people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask for unanimous consent to replace the motion by the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington, which is now before the House, 
with the following amendment, “That the motion be amended by 
deleting all the words after the word “that” and substituting 
the following therefor:  Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship be not now read a third time but be referred back to 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration for the 
purposes of reconsidering clauses 16, 17 and 18 with due regard 
for the fact that Bill C-16 continues the current system of 
revocation, which has been in place since 1920, allowing the

Immigration, to revoke a person's citizenship, and the arguments 
put forward by groups and individuals, such as the Canadians 
Alliance, German Canadian Congress, B'nai Brith Canada and the 
former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, that citizenship should not be a decision of 
cabinet, and those threatened with revocation of citizenship 
should have access to full judicial appeal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it seems to me that every group that appeared before the 
committee and spoke on the issue of revocation of citizenship 
said that there should be a right to appeal the decision of the 
federal court judge, trial division.  The problem with the way we 
have set it up is that the federal court judge who makes that 
very important decision is not accountable for his finding to any 
other court.  The bill does not touch on the judicial review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure I heard every witness and I read all the submissions. 
Every group that made a comment said that there has to be a right 
to appeal.  The way it is puts the judicial process in disrepute. 
Could the member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, the former parliamentary 
secretary is right.  Every group that appeared before the 
committee cited problems with citizenship revocation and 
recognized that allowing this to be a decision by the cabinet 
would put it in political hands.  They did not feel it was fair 
that people who had been here for 20, 30 or 40 years could have 
their citizenship stripped without what they considered to be a 
fair process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary listened well to all those people 
who appeared before the committee.  I know he has put a lot on 
the line by going ahead and standing up for what he believes is 
right in this case.  He has listened to the will of his 
constituents on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had many groups appear before the committee. The Canadian 
Alliance had representatives on the standing committee. We had 
the former parliamentary secretary who has lost his position as a 
result of his stand on this.  I am sure his own constituents and 
many people across the country have cited problems with the 
citizenship revocation provisions in Bill C-16 which would go 
ahead and unfairly strip citizenship from people who have been in 
this country 20, 30 or 40 years without due process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it would appear that we are having the real debate on 
this legislation when it is too late to make substantial changes, 
at least in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member on his speech.  He pointed out 
some very important things with respect to the bill.  He also 
touched very briefly on the oath of citizenship and the fact that 
the amended version of the oath in the legislation was created by 
the minister herself or some bureaucrat in her ministry. 
However, he made an error in his presentation.  He said that 
there had been no public debate about the content that a new oath 
of citizenship could take.  He is wrong about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration considered 
the citizenship bill in 1993 and 1994.  I was part of that 
committee at that time.  We heard extensively from citizens and 
new Canadians who wanted to talk about how wonderful it was to 
come to this country and become a Canadian, and how they felt 
very strongly that there should be some kind of declaration of 
citizenship which expressed the values of being a Canadian and 
the values of Canada in some manner that was more eloquent than 
what exists in the present oath.  They talked of values like 
democracy, freedom of speech, equality of opportunity and the 
rule of law, things that do not exist their countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened, despite all that input, is that we now have 
in Bill C-16 a revised oath and none of us know who wrote it or 
where it comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member opposite not feel awkward, as I will feel 
awkward, to see new Canadians taking a new oath of citizenship 
for which this parliament has had no debate?  There has been no 
debate in the standing committee about the content of the oath of 
citizenship that is now before the House and to which new 
Canadians will be required to swear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of country is it that would leave something so 
important and so sacred as the oath of citizenship to some 
unidentifiable bureaucrat and not have the courage to stand up in 
the House and create a version of the oath of citizenship that 
belongs to this House and this nation, and not to some contracted 
out, invisible person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, like the hon. member 
across the way who just spoke, I think it is a shame that we have 
not been able to debate more of these things in depth.  We were 
not given the opportunity as Canadians to have a vote on this. 
There was no great patriotic debate across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member cares deeply about the oath of 
citizenship and had his own thoughts on the matter. 
Unfortunately, some members in his own party have pulled some 
sneaky manoeuvres to go ahead and stifle the amount of debate on 
this particular topic and the ability of the former parliamentary 
secretary to make amendments as best as he could so that he could 
try to make positive changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad day when we cannot have a fair debate on an oath of 
citizenship and the revocation of citizenship.  A nation that 
does not control its borders and cannot have a serious debate on 
who and who is not a citizen and what that requires, where is 
that nation headed?  That is a nation in big trouble.  It is a 
real shame when things like that are left to the bureaucrats 
without any fair public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to once again mention that I am splitting my time with 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre.  Did I mention that before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that the 
hon. member has spoken for much longer than 10 minutes.  There is 
no question at this point of splitting his time.  Right now we 
are in the 10 minute question and comment period and 8 minutes 
have already passed.  There are two minutes remaining for 
questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby,

the way what is sometimes more a concern about the unseemly 
internal Liberal manoeuvres than what really may be needed in the 
country.  Instead of what Liberals want, what do Canadians want? 
What about a real political mandate to act?  The parameters of 
citizenship go to the heart of how Canadians define themselves as 
a country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A question was just asked about what kind of a country Canada 
is. In many respects it is a Liberal ruled country whose 
governance is quite out of date in attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about citizenship, immigration and those kinds of 
things in general in my riding there is not a lot of confidence 
in the system.  People just wag their heads in disgust.  They 
throw their hands in the air and ask what can be done because it 
is a bureaucratic system that is detached and out of touch with 
how they would define their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking today to restore some basic confidence in the 
system that someone is minding the store.  When people in the 
community say they are immigrants, it should immediately bring 
elements of respect because we know of the good system of credits 
and merits they have come through.  That attracts confidence in 
the system rather than the direct opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that we speak today of some points on how we can be 
positive in fixing the system instead of always defending the old 
status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a fitting comment to 
wrap this up and say that there is no better example of how out 
of touch the Liberal government is.  It will not allow a debate 
on the oath of citizenship.  It will not allow a debate on 
citizenship revocation.  It will not allow its own parliamentary 
secretary, who sacrificed his job in order to stand up for his 
constituents, to address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so fearful of having public debate and even 
scrutiny by some wise members on its own benches that it will 
leave it all up to the bureaucrats, cover it over and hope it 
just goes away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me say to members of the House that the debate is 
not over.  The debate has just started.  The issue is that the 
government can put the bill through and probably will, but the 
debate has started across the country within groups of Canadians 
who are citizens by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talk to them about this issue.  I am already getting some 
complaints from members on this side.  They are not very happy. 
We have started a petition which is addressed to the House of 
Commons.  We will come back here with many petitions.  I also 
have a website set up under www.telegdi.org. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next year we will be having an election.  I said to all 
my colleagues in the House that before they vote on the report 
stage amendments they should think of people close to them who 
were not born in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should ask themselves if they would want them to have the 
due process of law with the right to appeal.  Would they want 
them to have that right?  Do they not believe it is the courts 
rather than politicians who are in the best position to make that 
determination?”  I tell all my colleagues that they will be 
asked those questions.  Maybe at that point in time they will get 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received many calls from people across Canada.  I think 
it is proper to put some of those communications on record.  The 
first one I received was from the Aboriginal People's Commission 
of British Columbia which wrote to the Prime Minister with copies 
to members of the citizenship and immigration committees as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Aboriginal People's Commission of British Columbia has grave 
concerns regarding the revocation of citizenship sections of the 
proposed Citizenship Act, Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of Nations throughout Canada who trace their ancestry 
to the creation of this land, we feel our generational 
acceptance, welcoming and assistance to immigrants to our 
respective homelands gives particular weight to our deliberations 
and conclusions.  We therefore respectfully submit the following 
motion passed unanimously by the Executive of the Aboriginal 
People's Commission in B.C. at our May 25, 2000 meeting: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“That we call upon Parliament to amend the proposed Citizenship 
Act to guarantee that the courts, not politicians, will decide 
revocation of citizenship, and; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That there is a provision for appeals from a decision of the 
Federal Court Trial Division to the Federal Court of Appeal 
and/or the Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of those 
courts, in both existing and new cases involving revocation of 
citizenship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As descendants of the First People of this land who welcomed and 
aided the ancestors of a majority of Canadian, and as Liberals we 
pray that you will guide your members to revisit the clauses in 
Bill C-16 with the same spirit and hope that founded this 
Country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was signed by Kim Recalma-Clutesi, president of the 
Aboriginal People's Commission of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already received communications from the Liberal Party of 
Nanaimo—Alberni saying similar things.  It is signed by Mr. Joe 
Dodd, a Canadian citizen by choice.  I have further received 
communications from other Liberal members out west who say that 
like me they are immigrants.  The idea of not having the right to 
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada if their citizenship were 
challenged is, to say the least, frightening.  They are dismayed 
and disappointed that the government would take such a step.  No 
doubt this decision will haunt the Liberals in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of information I get goes on and on and on.  I can 
tell members that this issue will not die with the passing of 
this act because we are entering the new millennium with second 
class citizens in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One communication I received, and I have received numerous, was 
from people who were in concentration camps and had been deported 
from their countries.  Members should think about a Sikh Hindu 
living in Pakistan.  Many of them were deported to India.  They 
came here from there.  Members should think about all the 
displaced persons after the war.  They were shuffled out of 
various countries in the world and came to this country.  They 
take their citizenship rights very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my mother's family moved from Germany to Hungary about 
500 years ago.  My natural father was Hungarian.  My stepfather 
who adopted my brother and I was born in May 1919. He is a Jew. 
The day he was born Hungary was passed over to Romania because of 
the Versailles Treaty so he had a jump in his citizenship. 
Surviving for a Jew in Transylvania in Nazi occupied Europe was a 
horror, but survive he did.  Since he was a Jew he could not 
attend university in Romania.  He went to the University of Paris 
where he obtained a degree in architecture and town planning.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He changed his name.  I only found this out a couple of years 
ago because I do not have a whole lot of family.  I received an 
e-mail from Texas giving the same last name as mine and wanting 
to know if we were related.  I quite excitedly phoned him to talk 
to him about it.  Then he told me the story.  He changed his name 
because he wanted to survive Nazi dominated Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sister, who is in the gallery with us today, did not know 
that 
she was part Jewish until she was 12 years old.  We came out of 
Hungary as refugees.  We stayed in a refugee camp for Jews 
because of the anti-Semitism that existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On my mother's side they suffered terribly under Soviet 
occupation, as did my father.  Things happened in Europe that 
were just horrid.  If there is any person who is guilty of war 
crimes or crime against humanity, I want to be right there to 
make sure he or she is brought to justice.  It is wrong for us to 
exclude more than five million Canadians from the benefits of the 
charter of rights and freedoms or the due process of law in 
defending something that is very valuable to them such as their 
citizenship.  It is something that will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed in my colleagues in the New Democratic Party. 
The New Democratic Party, its predecessor and the labour members 
of the Winnipeg council led the fight to stop massive 
deportations from the country for people who were not guilty of 
anything more of a crime than being unemployed during the 
depression or perhaps being involved in organized labour.  The 
process is called D and D: denaturalize and then deport.  We have 
done this to tens of thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unveiling of the tomb of the unknown soldier yesterday 
represents so much that many immigrants to this country come to 
find.  I read Mark Bonokoski's column the other day.  He asked us 
to imagine who the person could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if members of the House know that we had soldiers 
in the first world war who were immigrants.  They came back 
wounded to this country and needed care in hospitals.  Many of 
them were deported because they were on relief.  Let us think 
about it.  Many soldiers that fought for this country in the 
first world war came back wounded and were deported because they 
needed relief and hospitalization. 
No wonder the veterans associations are very active in trying to 
stop these deportations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the dark period in our immigration history.  I 
recommend that all my colleagues read the book <I>Whence They 
Came</I> written by Barbara Roberts which deals with deportation 
from Canada.  It contains a wonderful foreword by Irving Abella 
He talks about how the department of immigration was controlled. 
He talks about a small group of government officials who 
desperately strove to send off offensive people operating to a 
large extent outside the control of parliament and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sympathy with what my colleagues are putting forth with 
regard to Bill C-16. It would have been a great millennium 
project to have had contests in communities and schools across 
the country to come up with an oath that we could truly call 
Canadian versus having it done in the shadows by bureaucrats and 
consultants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill came out of the bureaucracy.  If we think about it, it 
is trying to wrest back control.  How?  The citizenship court 
judges I know have done a fantastic job.  I am thinking of Mr. 
Somerville, a present judge, and Lorna van Mossel, a former 
judge.  The judges do a fantastic job but they are a problem to 
the bureaucracy.  They are independent and the bureaucracy does 
not want too much independence given to judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government got suckered when we came into this place 
in 1993.  Sergio Marchi, the minister at the time decided to get 
rid of citizenship court judges. It was a big mistake. The judges 
were replaced by the downgraded position of commissioner. I 
suggested that perhaps they should be magistrates to give more 
pomp and ceremony to the office, but that was turned down.  This 
was totally, completely, utterly driven by the bureaucracy, the 
same bureaucracy that has fought any meaningful answer to 
parliament and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 would not only take away the citizenship of the person 
who arrived here fraudulently, but also the citizenship of the 
person's dependants.  Consider my case had that bill passed.  My 
mother is dead so I do not know what anyone could find on her, 
but let us suppose that she arrived here fraudulently. At 54 
years of age I could be deported.  Think about that.  My wife and 
daughter were born in Canada.  They have no great inclination to 
go to Hungary, if Hungary would take me, German being part of my 
ancestry.  Think about what this does to families.  That was 
another area where the bureaucrats tried to extend their clutch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 18 a person's citizenship can be annulled without 
an appearance before a judge.  It is bogus and not right. Clauses 
16 and 17 are a disgrace and I believe they bring our sense of 
justice in Canada into disrepute.

that is so valuable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admired the Progressive Conservative Party particularly under 
John Diefenbaker and his bill of rights.  I am surprised at how 
the party voted on this issue. I am greatly disappointed in the 
New Democrats.  I am disappointed, because of my earlier

hear the member from Winnipeg, the party's critic, stand and 
defend the right not to have appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the committee to hear all the witnesses and I read and 
reread all their submissions.  Every person said there needed to 
be a right to appeal. There needs to be a right to appeal because 
Canadian citizenship is important enough that we do not want to 
rely on one judge who is not infallible, one judge who is not 
judicially accountable. We certainly do not want revocation of 
citizenship to continue in the star chamber of cabinet where the 
people are not judges.  The Prime Minister is not a judge; he is 
a lawyer, but he is not a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it.  A refugee claimant in our country has the 
protection of the charter.  A visitor to our country who commits 
a serious crime has the protection of due process all the way to 
the supreme court.  But for Canadians by choice those options are 
not available.  This will go into the streets.  It will go across 
the country and many people will demand a change to this archaic 
and draconian law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member for Waterloo—Wellington and I resonate on 
this issue because my concern with respect to Bill C-16 is the 
fact that the oath of citizenship has essentially failed to meet 
its obligation to describe what it is to be Canadian.  I proposed 
as a result of input received from new Canadians to the standing 
committee in 1993-94 that we incorporate in a citizenship oath or 
a citizenship declaration the five principles of the charter of 
rights, one of which was to uphold basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the member of Waterloo—Wellington and I have to whine 
about when we have a citizenship oath before the House now that 
simply tells us to obey the laws of Canada and to faithfully 
fulfil the duties of being Canadian but talks of nothing about 
basic human rights or upholding them?  It seems to me that we are 
on the same wavelength because we have a situation, and it is not 
just government, it is parliament, where we are missing an 
absolute opportunity to say that as Canadians we are not about 
simply obeying the law, whether it is a traffic law or the 
criminal code, we are about upholding basic principles of human 
rights, which is what the member for Waterloo—Wellington is 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we do not say that.  We say Canadians are simply people who 
obey the law.  I say to the member for Waterloo—Wellington the 
government has decided that the law will be such and such, that 
it will not provide an appeal process. With the oath that is in 
Bill C-16, one can be a good Canadian and obey a bad law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Madam Speaker, I ask my hon. 
colleague not to do me the dishonour of calling me the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member just said is really the essence of what a 
citizenship bill should be about.  He talked about this country 
being governed by law.  About a week and a half ago, the Prime 
Minister was in one of the neighbouring ridings to mine.  He was 
quoted in the newspaper as saying that the one key thing in the 
life of a nation is to make sure that the rights of its citizens 
are protected by the courts in the land and not subject to the 
capricious elected. It was the recognition by the Prime Minister 
that if a person is charged with an offence he or she would not 
be judged by politicians but would have the due process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say to my colleague that many new Canadians and Canadians 
born here have a problem with this bill.  The biggest problem 
with the bill is the process that got it here.  It is the closed 
process that has operated in the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration for decades.  It has got more restrictive.  Parts in 
the bill make revocation easier. Parts have been put into the 
bill which will remove interference by such people as the 
citizenship court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the hon. member about a citizenship court judge a 
number of years ago when I was on city council and president of 
the multicultural centre in my community.  We tried to have a 
citizenship ceremony on Canada Day.  We could not have it because 
it happened to fall on a long weekend and the bureaucrats in the 
department did not want to break up their long weekend.  On 
Canada Day there should be citizenship ceremonies right across 
the country.  We should tell new citizens that we value their 
citizenship enough that if anyone tries to remove it they have 
the protection of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
they have the protection of the courts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I could not help but notice that the hon. member 
made reference to the disconnect between the bill and what went 
on in the committee process.  I am reminded of committees I have 
been involved with, the joint Senate-Commons committee on custody 
and access, the committee that was launched by the finance 
minister on fair family taxation, and other committees that bring 
forward a suite of pretty good recommendations.  There is a 
consensus among members in the House, witnesses are heard and 
recommendations come forth.  Yet we see either no action, as in 
the case of custody and access, or policies that ignore the 
recommendations based on the fair family taxation committee. This 
seems to be what happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not have the privilege of sitting on the committee that 
examined this bill, but I am on a number of other committees. 
When I look at the bill and read the short version of what came out 
of the committee there seems to be a real disconnect. Would the 
hon. member speak to the differences between what went on in 
committee and how well this bill reflects the witness 
presentations at committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is sad for me to 
say that on many occasions the recommendations of the witnesses 
were not incorporated.  The most telling one was on the right to 
appeal.  Not one person said that the status quo should be 
maintained. 
Everybody appearing before us wanted to put in their right to 
appeal because they believed that would increase the value of 
citizenship for people like myself and other Canadians by choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, with 
only a minute left I will not ask a question of the hon. member 
for Kitchener—Waterloo.  I will take this opportunity to commend 
my colleague.  Both he and I are so-called newcomers to this 
country.  As well as having similar pasts, being almost former 
neighbours from Europe, we are neighbours now in the Waterloo 
region.  I want to commend him for his courageous stand, his 
principles and his beliefs.  I have been honoured to work with 
him very closely on this important issue which is very close to 
both of us as well as to over five million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I am disappointed that one of our colleagues, 
whom I should call the delivery boy, would take that kind of 
stand and position and talk in the House when he has no clue what 
it means to be a new Canadian and what it means to get Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague and I 
share many of the same views on this.  I have often attended 
citizenship courts.  Having realized what this bill is about, I 
go less often now because I do not want to stand up and tell 
people that they are now third class Canadians and that in five 
years they will be second class Canadians for the rest of their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I did attend citizenship court and saw people from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina coming to get their citizenship, there would 
be Croatians, Serbs and Muslims.  What I always said to them was 
“Please, for God's sake, bring the best you have but do not 
bring over your centuries' old grievances because Canada needs 
the best you have.  We cannot handle your strife”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the earlier presentations of the 
speaker opposite.  He made a very impassioned and well 
articulated commentary on the flaws in the bill.  Even as well as 
he did that, he could have gone further when we reflect on the 
impact that the bill could have if it were used inappropriately 
by the bureaucracy and those in positions of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, Bill C-16, will repeal and replace the current 
Citizenship Act passed in 1977.  The legislation makes several 
changes to the current act with the intention of providing more 
clearly defined guidelines, supposedly updating sections, 
replacing current procedures with new administrative structures 
and increasing the minister's power to deny citizenship.  I think 
that is the crux of what was spoken to in the previous speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 is touted as being “the first major reform with 
respect to citizenship in more than 20 years—an attempt to 
modernize the act in order that it might better reflect the true 
value of Canadian citizenship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while some parts are more clearly defined than in the 
previous act, Bill C-16 does not constitute a major modern reform 
as they say it does. Critical areas have been neglected while 
others have been altered in a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister received the recommendations of the 
government-dominated Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration in 1994.  The government has taken over five years to 
prepare this legislation which still, as we just heard from the 
previous speaker, does not address the committee's key 
recommendations.  The government took five years to put it in and 
it still ignored the committee's recommendations.  Tragic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of interesting provisions in Bill C-16.  The 
first provision I want to spend some time on is in clause 8 which 
has to do with adoption outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 will reduce the distinction between a foreign child 
adopted by a Canadian citizen and a child born in Canada. 
Currently a foreign child adopted by a Canadian citizen must 
first be admitted to Canada as a permanent resident before 
citizenship can be granted.  The new legislation will make it 
easier for adoptive parents to gain Canadian citizenship for the 
child if adoption occurs outside Canada.  This provision is of 
particular interest to me as I recently had a private member's 
bill of my own drawn for debate.  It also has to do with 
adoption, both domestic and international. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Bill C-289 proposes to extend a tax deduction of up to $7,000 
for the expenses relating to the adoption of a child.  Adoption 
is a gentle option that is under-appreciated and under-utilized 
in this country.  Couples who adopt from other countries face 
extremely high out-of-pocket expenses.  My bill would go a long 
way in helping couples who want to offer a loving home to 
children in need of parents.  I look forward to obtaining the 
support of all members of the House for this legislative 
initiative.  I believe we should encourage couples who wish to 
adopt.  In fact, in Canada many people are on waiting lists to 
adopt.  They go through considerable expense in order to adopt 
and care for a child in need but we offer them no assistance. 
They do it all on their own.  When we consider the incredible 
social contribution these couples are prepared to make, we should 
recognize it and make easier not harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next provision in Bill C-16 I want to spend some time 
discussing is clause 43.  Clause 43 is, I suggest, the most 
disrespectful to this parliament and to Canadians.  It would 
essentially give the minister the power to define what a family 
is in whatever manner the minister happens think on any 
particular day.  Under this clause, Bill C-16 grants the minister 
power without any oversight or any guidelines.  It basically 
grants the minister the power to decide who may make an 
application under this act on behalf of a minor.  It is solely up 
to the minister as to who may to make application for a minor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill allows the minister to define what constitutes 
a relationship of parent and child for the purposes of 
determining entitlement to citizenship under any provision of 
this act.  That is directly from the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world should the minister now be meddling in what 
constitutes a relationship of a parent and child?  Are we to 
believe that parliament cannot or should not spell this out for 
clarity, consistency or just plain common sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, rather than having parliament define what should be 
obvious what a parent and child relationship is in legislation, 
the minister feels she knows better and should unilaterally 
decide whether people are father, mother, son or daughter.  It 
does not make sense.  It is the duty of the government to draft 
legislation that is clear.  It is the duty of parliament to 
ensure that legislation is well structured and will stand the 
test of time so that it can serve as a clear guide to those 
tasked with implementing what is passed by this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is insulting this place by putting forward such 
muddled legislation which, by definition, will not be 
consistently applied.  One day she decides this is familial and 
the next day something else.  There is no guideline.  It is 
totally left to the discretion of bureaucrats in the minister's 
office. This is unacceptable.  These provisions in the bill need 
to be revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the ability to define a genuine parent-child 
relationship, the member for Scarborough East, a Liberal on the 
other side, on May 13, 1999 during a committee meeting, said “It 
is a bit of an unusual circumstance where a regulation 
is—allowing a definition of a concept—and, in particular, 
going over the edge from a regulatory idea to a legislative idea. 
I think, frankly, it is out of order, that it is in fact not 
within the purview of a governor in council, or the minister or 
the minister's officials, to define what constitutes a parent or 
a child”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are, in technical language, ultra vires of a 
minister, ultra vires certainly of the minister's staff, ultra 
vires of the governor in council, and clearly show a willingness 
on the part of the government to defer issues to areas where they 
should not be deferred. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member pointed out a particular flaw in the 
legislation that I am also concerned about.  He said “There are 
several on the issue who felt that it is the prerogative of 
parliament to enter into these definitions”. I would agree with 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated “In my view, the only way in which these 
things can be acceptable is if they are deleted so that the 
ministry, the minister and the governor in council are bound by 
the definitions that currently exist in law and in legislation. 
There can be no freelancing on the part of the minister or 
governor in council or staff officials to expand definitions of 
spouse or parent or child beyond what currently exists in 
legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are wise words.  There should be no freelancing but what 
do we have?  We have complete freelancing and deferral to the 
bureaucracy and the minister's office to determine what is a 
familial relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can rightly take issue with delegating such immense powers to 
the minister alone.  We can think of some other issues that have 
given Canadians a great deal of unrest.  The billion dollar 
boondoggle, for example, in the Human Resource Development 
Department, has given Canadians ample understanding of why we 
should not just put total blind faith in any minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we saw a bungling of epidemic proportions.  Public money 
was given out without any application on file and 80% of the 
files showed no evidence of financial monitoring.  Two-thirds of 
the files did not even have a rationale for recommending the 
project. Money was spent on things such as fountains in the Prime 
Minister's riding, and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all that broke and after the public outrage at the 
incompetence of this particular ministry and minister for the way 
it was handled, the Prime Minister turned a blind eye and that 
minister is still sitting in cabinet.  There has been no change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, when the Prime Minister was in opposition, he said 
“You take the blame when something is wrong and you do not 
finger anybody else but yourself.  That is what a person of 
dignity does”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him, but it has not happened on that particular 
issue, and I wonder if it will happen on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this bill, let me say that Bill C-16 has 
numerous insupportable elements that we are concerned about.  I 
briefly mentioned that it is far too reliant on regulations which 
we have not seen.  The regulations that will determine how this 
bill is implemented have been drafted by bureaucrats with little 
input from the House or the public and they can be changed 
without consultations.  As was so eloquently argued by members on 
the opposite side of the House, the changes will affect people's 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding have come to me concerned about this bill 
and how it will drastically affect their personal lives.  When 
their citizenship in a country they hold up as their nation of 
connection and speaks to who they are is cut out from under them, 
it is very disconcerting for a number of very legitimate reasons. 
We have left all that in the hands of regulation drafters with 
no oversight by the people's representatives in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Bill C-16 allows too much discretionary unaccountable 
power to be left in the hands of government.  Even the Liberal 
parliamentary secretary has spoken out against clauses 16 and 17 
which deal with the revocation of citizenship.  The legislation 
as introduced does not provide individuals, who had been granted 
Canadian citizenship, full access to the legal system if their 
right to citizenship is challenged.  Hon. members should think 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden our right to citizenship is challenged and we 
are no longer Canadian citizens.  In light of that, we do not 
have access to full legal redress, an appeal process and the 
proper due process of law to clarify.  Even if there is some 
mistake, we are cut out from that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very disconcerting to many of us in the House. 
Although departmental officials insisted that this clause was not 
a serious concern, the issue caused great concern to members of 
the committee and to the vast majority of witnesses, all ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance agree that once citizenship is 
granted it must be assumed to be genuine.  The revocation of 
citizenship is not something to be taken lightly and must be done 
only under the complete and thorough scrutiny of a fair and legal 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Kitchener—Waterloo made his opinion 
quite clear during the standing committee proceedings, during 
report stage debate in the House, and most recently in the media. 
He actually resigned his position as Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration because he felt so 
strongly about his own party's unwillingness to listen to his 
recommendations.  Who is driving the ship over there?  Is it the 
elected minister and MPs, or is it the bureaucracy?  The approach 
to the legislation is telling Canadians who is really driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He believes the power to revoke citizenship should not be left 
in the hands of the governor in council as it stands in the 
legislation.  The Canadian Alliance agrees.  We commend the 
member for Kitchener—Waterloo for his stance on the issue.  This 
goes beyond partisanship.  This goes to what is right for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing new to see the Liberal cabinet not listening to 
one of its backbenchers.  We have seen that repeatedly.  If the 
Liberal cabinet had been listening to her backbenchers, I wonder 
if the possession of child pornography, for example, would still 
be legal in B.C.  It has been almost a year and a half since the 
courts in B.C. struck down the section of the criminal code which 
prohibited the possession of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember well that after the initial position, to their 
credit, 79 Liberal MPs and senators wrote to the Prime Minister 
urging him “not to wait for the appeal of the B.C. decision to 
be heard but immediately act in defence of Canada's children and 
consider the use of the notwithstanding clause to send a clear 
message that Canada's charter of rights and freedoms will never 
again be used to defend the sexual abuse of Canada's children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members in the Liberal backbench signed that 
document.  We were glad to see it, but what happened? It is 
something like what we are seeing with Bill C-16.  It is being 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition gave the government a chance to 
act, to protect our most vulnerable with a parliamentary motion 
last year to do exactly what the 79 Liberals had called upon the 
Prime Minister to do.  We put forward that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backbenchers unfortunately wilted under the pressure exerted 
I guess from the Prime Minister's Office to step away from it on 
the promise that a federal government appeal would solve it 
within two months and that it would all be put back in place. How 
long has it been now?  A year and a half, and we still have not 
heard a decision on that issue.  Those who possess child 
pornography in B.C. today will face no penalty.  It is impacting 
on cases across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing on that issue, the same Liberal backbenchers voted 
against our motion that would have enacted exactly what they 
called for in their letter.  Unfortunately they did not follow 
through on their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the revocation of citizenship issue, the Canadian 
Alliance critic for citizenship and immigration put forward an 
amendment that would have changed this clause during committee. 
We have heard some commentary from members opposite.  He put 
forward an amendment that would have addressed the shortcomings 
of the revocation of citizenship issue but the Liberals on the 
committee voted against it. 
Unfortunately we did not see the changes that many of the 
witnesses wanted to see and some of the members opposite wanted 
to see.  While elements of the bill have potential and could 
ultimately be beneficial to Canada, the flaws are so numerous 
that the Canadian Alliance cannot possibly support the 
legislation as it stands.

have.  I have frequently had the honour of attending citizenship 
hearings for new citizens in my riding.  There is such joy at 
those ceremonies.  People from all over the world are ecstatic. 
There are smiles from ear to ear on the children, the mothers, 
the fathers and whole families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have come from another nation, another history and another 
personal set of experiences.  They put it all aside to make 
Canada their home.  They go through the instruction and tests. 
They are prepared to say “I am a Canadian”.  When they go 
through the process in Calgary, at the end we all say in unison 
“I am a Canadian”.  There are grins from ear to ear.  It is 
very meaningful to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strong feelings I have about Canadian citizenship and my 
love for this country were part of the motivation that caused me 
to run as a member of parliament.  It is a privilege to take part 
in the debate on this bill in this special place.  It is an 
important topic.  I hope we have the collective wisdom to hear 
what has been said in debate today and to reflect our concerns 
when the vote on Bill C-16 comes to the floor.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, once again I should like to ask a question of the hon. 
member and raise the whole situation with regard to knowledge of 
an official language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 would basically stipulate that people should have an 
adequate knowledge of one of the official languages.  It strikes 
me as awfully unusual that the bill lays out that people should 
have an adequate knowledge of an official language but also goes 
on to say that they would be able to have the use of interpreters 
for part of their review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people require an interpreters to understand questions about 
Canada and respond to them, whether they be in English or in 
French, the fact that they are given interpreters paid for by 
Canadian taxpayers, or are allowed to use them, implies to me 
that they do not have what I would deem to be adequate knowledge 
of either language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Australians have dealt with this issue by saying that 
immigrants require four different things.  They have to be able 
to read the official language, able to write the official 
language, able to speak the official language and able to 
understand the official language.  If someone can read, write, 
speak and understand there is no need for an interpreter.  Yet 
the bill still has a provision for the use of interpreters. 
How is the use of an interpreter an adequate understanding of one 
of the official languages?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Calgary West asked a question about how the interpreter fits into 
the equation of adequate knowledge of official languages.  That 
is just one question of many to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill simply says that an applicant must have an adequate 
knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada.  The flaw 
is that it does not provide any provision on how it is to be 
judged, by whom, on what criteria, or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague for Calgary West asks a very astute question. 
What does this mean?  There are no criteria.  It is all deferred 
to the bureaucracy, whoever is sitting in the chair that day, and 
whatever the interpreter is allowed to do.  A person could 
effectively come into Canada, get Canadian citizenship, and not 
be able to speak, read, write or understand a word of French or 
English.  That is a problem.  It needs to be much more clearly 
defined in the bill, and they have missed it by a country mile.

Speaker, I was rather impressed with my colleague who just spoke 
and the ex-parliamentary secretary who spoke before him.  These 
gentlemen portrayed rather eloquently some of the shortcomings of 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Calgary Centre declare what exactly it 
means to him to be a citizen of Canada?  Is it something so 
arbitrary that it can actually be determined by a judge?  Is it 
something so arbitrary that someone with unique political power, 
political will or political ability can determine who is and who 
is not a Canadian citizen regardless of what the Parliament of 
Canada might think?  Does the legislation actually permit this 
kind of almost arbitrary— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the member for Calgary Centre to give 
us a brief answer or, if he would prefer, since there are six 
minutes remaining he could think a bit more about his answer and 
give it following Oral Question Period.  What is the choice?

this decade in collaboration with the World Health Organization

officially endorsed the decade but Canada is not one of them. 
Fortunately however, Canada has put into place a national action 
network which includes 18 organizations that are working on the 
promotion of this issue.  The Arthritis Society of Canada and the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research are both supportive of and 
taking part in this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to bring attention to this

part of the efforts in Canada.

of sitting in the House.

proposed my candidacy and the President of the Hellenic Republic, 
a great statesman, respected domestically and internationally, for

in the world as their second homeland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

database has collected Canadians' most private details.  It has 
information on family status, employment history, social 
assistance information, immigration records. You name it, Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, after a cross-country uproar from the opposition and 
Canadians, this minister has now turned tail and announced she 
will dismantle her database. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it take constant hounding from Canadians before this 
minister will do the right thing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier today I announced the dismantling 
of the longitudinal labour force file.  It comes less than two 
weeks after the privacy commissioner tabled his last advice on 
this file.  At that time I indicated that I wanted to work with 
him co-operatively to deal with our shared concerns.  The 
announcement today is an outcome of this very co-operative 
working relationship and I would note that he fully supports our 
undertakings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say it is an outcome of 
getting caught.  Day after day in the House the minister has 
stood to assure Canadians that the big brother database was just 
fine and dandy.  In fact, she said it was totally legitimate.  In 
fact, she said it was encrypted.  Now, after enormous public 
outrage, she has decided to scrap the whole thing, and the 
minister gives her little hand for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was her database essential last week but it is a security 
risk this week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the opposition is just 
fearmongering.  Let us remember what the privacy commissioner 
said last week.  He indicated that all laws had been abided.  He 
indicated that there had been no breaches of information, but he 
identified a concern for the future.  With the changing 
technology and with the rapid advancements, I too am concerned 
about that.  That is why we have taken the prudent measure of 
dismantling the longitudinal labour force file. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone buys that.  In 
fact, I do not think they trust the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her news release says that her department has returned the big 
brother database information to the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency and that department will maintain all the information in 
the future.  However, the news release says “authorization of 
future linkages with HRDC held data will be considered case by 
case”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That begs the question, just what kind of cases will trigger the 
recreation of the big brother database? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us look at what the privacy 
commissioner said.  He said in a letter to the deputy minister on 
May 27:  “We accept and support these measures.  They satisfy 
all the recommendations and observations that were outlined in my 
1999-2000 Annual Report”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians were rightly outraged when they learned of 
this government's big brother database.  In the last week, 
because of a lack of trust in this HRDC minister, over 30,000 
Canadians have written asking for their own personal files, files 
which they have every legal right to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the dismantling of the minister's database affect those 
30,000 requests for Canadians' personal information? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will respond to the requests of 
Canadians who have asked for this information.  Clearly the file 
has been dismantled, but we will facilitate the gathering of that 
information from its separate sources so that Canadians who wish 
it can have it.

ensure that highly sensitive and personal information about every

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

explaining to us that its existence was essential to the

this file, yet today, unexpectedly, it is no more.

understand the importance of good information so that we can 
create good public policy.  Along with the privacy commissioner 
we understand that the privacy of Canadians has to be paramount. 
Together we looked at the future of this file.  We saw it coming 
to its limit.  Rather than add more information, the prudent 
thing was to take it apart and create a regime of protocol so 
that we can continue to access the information as needed, as 
defined and as reviewed.  This includes a review by the privacy 
commissioner, so that we can not only continue to have effective 
management of files, but also ensure the privacy of information.

made confidentially, this was of no importance.  Now that it has 
become public, it has become very important.  Now we understand 
it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future, does the minister commit, before gathering any 
information on any citizen, before using any information of any 
kind on any citizen, to obtain permission, as is done on our 
income tax returns, when we are asked for permission to use our 
names for the voters' list?  Does she commit to asking

Canadians believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of issues around visibility, we will continue to

the privacy commissioner made a reference in that regard.

there had been no breaches of information.

want to celebrate their cultural heritage, we will celebrate it

Mr. Speaker, today the CBC board announced that it will cut back

wish to extend my most sincere condolences to the family and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay tribute to this proud French Canadian who 
inspired generations to surpass themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true that some people are born to do a specific type of 
work, then Maurice Richard was born to play hockey. But talent 
alone would not have been enough to make him one of the best, if 
not the greatest hockey player in history.

displayed by Number 9 on each shift on the ice. These are also 
qualities that Maurice Richard, the man, displayed throughout his 
life. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember sitting with my friends around a makeshift radio in 
the college dormitory on Saturday nights and hearing the 
descriptions of Maurice Richard as he skated to the net, being 
pushed and shoved, being thrown on the ice, and he kept going. 
He got back up and gave it everything he had non-stop until the 
puck was behind the goalie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one ever wanted to win more than he did.  That is what made 
him great.  That is what all Canadians will always remember about 
him. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maurice Richard was a fierce competitor, but he was also an 
unassuming man who did not like great honours and endless 
tributes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I will only add, to conclude, thank you, Maurice. We 
will never forget you. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am always moved too when I see the 
amazing passion we Canadians share for the great game of hockey. 
I see it in the House of Commons today.  Certainly we witnessed 
it across the country this weekend with the passing of Maurice 
Richard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are reflecting upon and paying tribute to perhaps the 
greatest player that ever donned a Montreal Canadiens uniform, 
Maurice “The Rocket” Richard.   There is no question that the 
Montreal Canadiens, the Habs, is one of the greatest hockey 
franchises Canada has ever produced.  It is still the most 
championship winning team in any professional sport and as an 
avid Edmonton Oilers fan, that is tough for me to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of a player who epitomizes that championship spirit 
more than anyone else, I think of Rocket Richard. I must admit 
that I can be passionate about very many things, especially 
hockey, but I have always felt that my French Canadian brothers 
and sisters can put me to shame with their passion, zest and 
enthusiasm for hockey and Maurice Richard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rocket was an unparalleled legend in playing the game he 
loved.  His fiery eyes, his blazing speed, his stamina, his 
determination and that barely controlled temper just beneath the 
surface demonstrated that passion for the game he loved.  “No, 
Rocket, you are not supposed to hit the linesmen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there will ever be another player just like him. 
He is a one of a kind legend, a unique hero.  In 1944-45 he was 
the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games and it would be 
another 37 seasons before anyone would do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to him today on behalf of all of my colleagues.  I 
extend our sincere condolences to his entire family. I want to 
thank them for sharing him with all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hockey and politics are a lot alike.  When we have given it our 
best shot, when we have scored our best goals, when we have taken 
our penalties, hopefully we can all do what the Rocket did. That 
would be to shake hands and say that hockey is a better game, or 
politics is a better occupation, or life is a better experience 
because we have all played well.  We owe this to the name and the 
memory of Maurice Richard.

Quebec, of Canada even. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maurice Richard was not the fastest skater.  He did not have the

winning.  He concentrated all his energy, strength, skill and 
determination on winning.  He taught his generation that it was 
possible to reach the top.  He showed future generations that 
they had to set their sights high, to aim at perfection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw Maurice Richard play at the Forum, and of course on 
television.  Those are moments that will remain etched in my 
memory.  When he skated full-out, we were there skating with him. 
When he flew down the ice with the puck, we were with him. 
When he scored, it was a goal for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has left us the example of a simple and generous man who felt 
that success could be achieved only by doing one's utmost, by 
surpassing oneself.  For that alone, thank you Maurice Richard.

a hero for all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, to show his longtime adoration, admiration and even 
friendship for Maurice Richard, a constituent of mine who lives 
in Pense has a licence plate that simply reads “NHL-9”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was considered a second class player during the second world 
war, and sceptics were saying “Let's wait for our real stars to 
come back home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But during the next decade, not only did Richard break Nels 
Stewart's record, but he exceeded it by more than 200 goals. As 
others mentioned earlier, Richard was one of the greatest hockey 
players in history. His opponents always talked about his glare, 
especially from the blue line to the net. 
The Rocket always insisted on saying that he was just another 
hockey player. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his father's death on Saturday night Maurice Richard Jr. 
said, “My father was a simple man”.  That may be true, but for

</I></B></P><P align=left>Born on August 4, 1921 and throughout his 78 glorious years, 
Maurice Richard was a symbol of excellence and a source of 
inspiration for many generations of Quebecois and Canadians. The 
Rocket will go down in history as more than a hockey legend. He 
was truly a great Canadian whose on ice skills inspired a 
generation of hockey fans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although he was not deemed the most physically gifted athlete, 
it was his will to win that set him apart from all others.  His 
sheer force of will was something to behold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nicknamed “The Rocket” for his blazing speed and hard shot, 
Richard developed a reputation as an electrifying player from the 
blue line in.  Wearing the number 9 jersey the Rocket dominated 
the NHL for 18 magnificent years as the centrepiece of 
professional sports' most successful franchise.  His storied 
career stats combining regular season and playoff goals include 
626 goals, 465 assists and 1,091 total points.  He was also the 
first player, as mentioned, to score 50 goals in 50 games in the 
1944-45 season, a feat not duplicated until the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it was his performance in clutch situations and his ability 
to respond in the big games that really distinguished him from 
those who have played the game of hockey.  During his stellar 
career Richard led the Montreal Canadiens to eight Stanley Cups, 
including five in a row between 1956 and 1960. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his career his popularity and legend grew. He continued to 
be one of the most recognized and beloved figures in Canada. As 
his health began to decline, the NHL recognized his contributions 
to the game by creating the Rocket Richard trophy given annually 
to the league's top scorer, a fitting tribute.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TABLING OF PETITIONS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to draw the House's attention to something that concerns the 
tabling of petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often individuals or lobby groups signing petitions forward 
them to us for tabling here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in today's context, with the development of new means 
of communication, petitions may come in different forms.  This 
has happened with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One individual has presented an electronic petition, on CD-ROM, 
with over 17,000 names. 
Mr. Goyette, a resident of Montreal, in Quebec, collected, 
through electronic means, 17,000 signatures. That petition, like 
the one I tabled earlier, asks the government to take action 
regarding the gasoline pricing issue. This type of petition does 
not quite comply with the current rules of the House, more 
specifically with Standing Order 36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Chair whether it would be possible to get a very 
broad interpretation of this provision of the standing orders or, 
if it is deemed more appropriate, to have the standing orders 
amended or updated so that in the future Canadians can use such 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some ways an electronic petition is better than a 
traditional one. It is much easier for the person who is 
collecting signatures to make sure that someone did not sign the 
petition more than once. By using an electronic address, it is 
possible to limit the number of signatures. In any case, an 
increasing number of people have an electronic address. We are 
likely to see others follow the example of Mr. Goyette who, to my 
knowledge in the first one to submit a petition in this format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also advantages in terms of the storing of archival 
information. This simple CD-ROM has 17,000 signatures but it 
could have 50 times more. Storage capability for petitions would 
be greatly enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that people can now file their personal income tax 
return by using the Internet, it seems to me that the House of 
Commons should review its standing orders to make it possible to 
table petitions in that format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit this issue to your attention and I am 
anxiously awaiting your ruling.

topic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As the hon. member for Témiscamingue 
pointed out, the Standing Orders are fairly clear on this point. 
I refer to Standing Order 36(2)(<I>f</I>), which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>36. (2) In order to be certified, pursuant to section (1) of 
this Standing Order, every petition shall:... 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>f</I>) contain only original signatures and addresses written 
directly onto the petition and not pasted thereon or otherwise 
transferred to it; and 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the Chair to do 
other than insist that petitions be presented in the form 
required under the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the hon. member himself, or through his colleagues 
who are members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, wishes to raise the matter with the committee, perhaps 
it can recommend changes to the standing orders which can be 
passed by the House, thus helping the hon. member with the 
problem he has so ably described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the hon. member for Témiscamingue to find a way to raise 
this issue with the committee I have mentioned.  I am sure that 
the committee chair, who is now in the House, has listened 
carefully to the point raised and to the Speaker's ruling under 
the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
While we are waiting for the House of Commons to enter the new 
millennium with respect to electronic petitions, is there 
unanimous consent to allow the member for Témiscamingue to table 
this CD-ROM with 17,000 signatures on this issue, particularly 
since he had tabled a duly completed petition on the same issue 
before setting out to table the CD-ROM? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to allow the hon. 
member to table this petition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

<A NAME="LINK212">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-16, an 
act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read the third time and 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period the hon. member for Calgary Centre had the floor.  He has 
six minutes remaining in the time available to him for questions 
and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before question period I was responding to a question 
which had to do with what it meant to me and others in my riding 
to be a Canadian and how Bill C-16 addresses that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can quickly say that the meaning of being a Canadian cannot be 
captured in a brief comment.  For me it means that I have to 
respect the laws of the land.  I have to participate as a 
citizen.  There are a tremendous number of rights, but there are 
also a tremendous number of responsibilities which we have as 
citizens, to work to improve our country, to represent our 
country and to obey the laws of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern about some aspects of this bill is that although it 
deals with citizenship, it appears to move us in the wrong 
direction.  It does not make it clear, in my estimation and in 
that of many members of the committee, as to exactly who 
qualifies.  That seems to be watered down and left to regulation 
and bureaucrats to determine. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language requirement is not clear as to how proficient a new 
citizen needs to be in either or both of the official languages. 
It is very unclear.  In fact, one could argue that a new citizen 
under this bill might not even need to understand much, if any, of 
either languages, because it allows for interpretation 
assistance, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under citizenship-type certifications and assessments with 
regard to family, it is unclear who qualifies under familial 
relationships, whereas it is clear in Canadian law.  This bill 
moves in a different direction and leaves total discretion to the 
minister and her bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the very grievous concern about potentially 
revoking citizenship for those who have chosen to be Canadian 
citizens, leaving them to appeal.  There is no real appeal 
process available through the bill for those who may have had 
their citizenship challenged.  Of course, the citizenship judges 
have been gutted of any real responsibility and are really window 
dressing.  We have again deferred to the bureaucracy to make 
assessments on people's lives, who they are, their nationality 
and their citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it means a lot to be a Canadian citizen.  Unfortunately, 
this bill moves a lot of the significance, the administration and 
the firm statements as to how important it is out of law and into 
the hands of the whims of a bureaucracy and regulation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, certainly defining who is a Canadian when we are so 
diverse as a people would be a very complicated task.  But on the 
face of it, and allowing for the fact that just in the question 
and comment period the hon. member will not have a lot of time to 
think of his response to the question I am going to put, 
nevertheless, would he not feel, though, that the one thing that 
does unite us all as Canadians, no matter where we are from, 
whether we are new Canadians or Canadians here by birth, is a 
mutual respect for the principles of the charter of rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say that is 
accurate.  I think the hon. member has done some work in this 
regard and I think that is accurate.  Where there might be need 
for a greater discussion is how those principles are applied and 
administrated in the land.  However, in general I would say yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased and honoured today to speak to Bill C-16, an act 
respecting Canadian citizenship.  There is a handful of members 
in the House who could probably share the same life experience as 
myself and the hon. member for Kitchener—Waterloo.  This issue 
is very close to me and I would like to share my experience with 
my hon. colleagues and the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young boy in Croatia I dreamed about Canada.  I dreamed 
about a huge country.  In 1968, in Vienna, when I applied and 
went through the process to come to this country, I was honoured 
and I was privileged.  I was only 18 and a half years old at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chose this country.  I came by myself, on my own.  Three years 
later I applied for Canadian citizenship and I received Canadian 
citizenship two years after that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In that citizenship courtroom in Waterloo, which was held in an 
old post office building on King Street, I still remember 
watching the faces of many people similar to myself, their 
special feelings and the smiles on their faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to citizenship courts today as an elected member of 
parliament the judge usually asks me to make comments.  When I 
make these comments I tell new Canadians that they are equal 
members of the greatest society, the Canadian family, and equal 
to anybody who was born here or those families who came 300 or 
400 years before them.  Just recently, I found out that I was 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I could go again to that same citizenship court 
and tell new Canadians that they are equal.  According to Bill 
C-16, they are not, which is really sad.  It is really sad that I 
am not as equal a member of Canadian society as my own children. 
Over five million Canadians are in the same position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government and the Canadian parliament promote 
equality, especially abroad.  Under this legislation there is no 
equality.  Under this legislation I am treated as a second class 
citizen.  In no other department does the minister have the right 
and the power to overrule the Supreme Court of Canada, but this 
legislation would provide that power.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many new Canadians who probably did not tell the whole 
truth for many reasons.  Perhaps they came from a country where 
their lives and their freedom was not protected by the laws of 
that country, so they used every means available to get out and 
become members of the greatest family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a party to the international convention on civil and 
political rights adopted by the UN general assembly on December 
16, 1966.  This United Nations covenant says that a person who 
has lived in Canada for 20 years or more, whether or not he or 
she is a citizen of Canada, can consider Canada to be his or her 
own country.  For the purposes of articles 12(4) and 13 of the 
covenant, such a person cannot be expelled from Canada.  If the 
person leaves the country on vacation, he or she cannot be 
prevented from re-entering.  It is clearly stated in these 
articles that even non-citizens under the UN convention have more 
rights than what is proposed in Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that a person, of whatever nationality, somewhere in 
Moscow, is stepping on the property of the Canadian embassy, and 
someone else is stepping on the property of the Canadian embassy 
in Beijing.  Those two individuals are protected by the charter 
of rights. 
They are not even landed immigrants and they are not even 
citizens, but Canadian citizens under Bill C-16 are not equal 
members of Canadian society.  That is wrong.

the minister when I say that all of us who are elected members of

the minister, I am not content to leave with him the right to 
have the last word.  We suggest for the earnest consideration of 
the minister, partly as a safeguard for himself and partly as a 
safeguard for those who might be accused, that the individual 
should have a final right of appeal to the Supreme Court of 
Canada...That court is impartial.  Let that court decide whether 
or not the individual should suffer the most grievous penalty of 
losing his citizenship.  Were we to do that, then I think we 
would be restoring some of that equality for all which we desire.

earnest consideration.

Mr. Speaker, first let me commend the hon. member on his speech. 
I also want to commend the hon. member for Kitchener—Waterloo on 
his commitment to honesty, transparency and to ensuring that we 
are treated as equal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today has been a very educational day for me.  I did not realize 
that the legislation would create two classes of Canadians.  I 
like my former colleagues who have spoken have chosen this 
country as my homeland.  I have been here for 45 years.  Little 
did I realize that all of a sudden we are at the brink of the 
possibility that I will no longer be a first class Canadian like 
the rest of my colleagues who were born and raised in this 
country.  If what I hear is true then I believe the government 
needs to examine the legislation a lot closer and to ensure that 
Canadians across this great land are not divided, whether they 
were born here or immigrated here by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for my hon. colleague.  If amendments are not 
made to the bill, does he anticipate any backlash to the 
legislation from Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member as well as 
other members in the House and I who chose Canada feel the same 
way as any of the five to six million Canadians.  It is a sad day 
for us because we are not as equal as our own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to strive to improve that and to create legislation that 
will unite us as Canadians regardless of what seniority we have, 
whether it be five days or 500 years.  If we want to create an 
even stronger and better society we have to be treated as equal 
members of our family.

Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments of my colleague.  He 
expressed his sincere sentiments and I congratulate him for that. 
It is indeed a tribute to our democracy in the country, 
epitomized in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about second class citizenship because of his feeling 
that there is not enough of a judicial role when citizenship may 
be revoked.  Let me remind my colleague that citizenship at birth 
may not be revoked. 
Therefore we cannot compare citizenship by birth with citizenship 
acquired.  By definition, what is given may be taken when the 
basis for it being given is proven to be false, fraud or illegal 
under the laws of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason citizenship by birth may not be revoked is that he or 
she is not a citizen of any other country.  The naturalized 
citizens of Canada who have been shown, on investigation or 
determination by the Federal Court of Canada on the 
recommendation of the minister, to have violated the very laws of 
our country may have their citizenship revoked because there was 
no basis to grant it to begin with.  It was done under false 
representation and under fraud.  We must not lose sight of the 
presumption and the basic tenet of revocation that is based on 
fraud and false representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot say that it is second class only because the process 
starts with the recommendation of the minister.  I am a 
naturalized citizen of Canada and I thank Canada for the benefits 
given to me personally and to my family.  I have four sons with 
my wife and they are all Canadian citizens by birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to consider this and comment on the 
fact that there is a distinction between citizenship by birth and 
citizenship that is acquired.  In terms of treatment by the court 
system, the leave to appeal should be available right up to the 
level of the Supreme Court of Canada.  It is a question of trust 
and I will not belittle the noble calling of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is right 
when he says that we should have the right to appeal.  I do not 
see that in Bill C-16.  That is the problem with the bill.  I 
would be the first one to deport those who obtain citizenship 
under false statements or by hiding some criminal history, but we 
should let the individual have the right to appeal the process 
directly to the supreme court.  We should not leave that in the 
minister's hands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul for his 
intervention dealing with the issue of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should actually be a celebration.  I am vice-chair of the 
committee and sat on the committee when we dealt with the 
controversial Bill C-63.  A lot of people appeared and talked to 
us about their concerns.  All issues were raised and put on the 
floor.  Unfortunately the bill was ready to go as Bill C-63 when 
the House prorogued and it fell off the agenda.  When the House 
came back the bill was brought back in as Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be a celebration of the fact that the committee had 
tremendous input and impact with the minister and the ministry to 
convince them that there are some things which should be done to 
increase the value of Canadian citizenship.  Instead of 
celebrating we find ourselves embroiled in a debate over the 
issue of supposedly creating two classes of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I absolutely respect the passion and the strongly held views of 
my colleagues, but the danger is that we are sending a message to 
the new Canadian community, to immigrants.  When they stand in a 
citizenship court along with their families, let us say on Canada 
Day, not too far in the future, and receive their Canadian 
citizenship which they believe is of tremendous value, we are 
sending a message that somehow it is devalued compared to someone 
like me who was born in this country. 
It is not fair to send that kind of negative, frightening message 
to people who look forward to celebrating what is for many a 
rebirth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard that earlier today statements were made in this place 
that people cannot know what this is about unless they are 
immigrants to this country. The implication is that those born in 
this country do not understand the value of Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a former life I stood as a parliamentary delegate to monitor 
free elections in Croatia for the first time since the war.  I 
saw people with tears in their eyes lining up on the streets to 
cast their ballots.  I could feel their pain.  I could feel their 
enthusiasm, their excitement.  I could feel their fear that 
somehow by the time they got to the ballot box the right would be 
stripped away, that Tito would jump down from the picture over 
the ballot box or that the soldier with a gun would prevent them 
from casting that ballot.  The right to vote is one of the 
benefits of citizenship. I saw firsthand how important it was to 
those people who had gone through war and terror and hate.  I 
think I can understand that, even though I happen to have been 
lucky enough to have been born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife is an immigrant who came to this country from England. 
It was not under duress, although she might say she was trying to 
get away from her parents. She came 
here to seek a better life.  She came here as an 18 year old 
girl, wide eyed and excited about coming to this great country 
she had heard about.  She became a Canadian citizen by choice. 
If anything, people who choose this country are more special. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about two classes of citizens, it is a little 
like the statement parents make to their adopted children when 
they find out that mom and dad are not their biological mom and 
dad.  The statement is always “We chose you.  You are very 
special”.   To new Canadians coming to this country, whether 
from wartorn societies or from places like the U.K., I say thank 
you for choosing Canada.  It is what has built this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says that those who come here under false pretences, 
those who lie, those who knowingly withhold information to whom 
we in Canada have given this citizenship right, our appreciation 
of its acceptance and the help to build our society, if we are 
deceived we must have a mechanism to take back what we consider 
to be a document and a place in the world of utmost importance 
and value.  Is that a double standard?   As my friend has 
mentioned, we cannot take away a right of birth.  To compare the 
two is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some horrible people.  Think about it. Paul Bernardo 
is still a Canadian citizen.  Who would not want to strip that 
evil person, if we had the power to do so, of Canadian 
citizenship?  But we cannot because he was born here. There are 
countless others such as Clifford Olson, and we could go on. 
There are countless people who are bad people and who remain 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only option we have is if someone arrives here who it turns 
out was a war criminal or had committed crimes against humanity. 
I can imagine the outcry of the Canadian public if the government 
were held powerless to revoke that person's citizenship, if the 
government had to rely on a judge to make the decision instead of 
the duly elected people who represent the people who bestowed 
Canadian citizenship on the individual in the first place. 
Canadians give citizenship.  Canadians must have the ability, if 
they have been cheated, to revoke that citizenship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that is unfair and which sends a frightening 
message to the immigrant community and to those applying for 
Canadian citizenship is the idea that there is no appeal. Let us 
be clear.  The process has five different steps and provides at 
least three opportunities to ask the federal court to judicially 
review the decisions being taken during these steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to play semantics but a judicial review is 
different from an appeal. Here is how it works.  The minister 
issues a letter because the minister has evidence and is 
satisfied with that evidence that the person has fraudulently 
obtained Canadian citizenship.  The minister will serve notice on 
the individual.  That individual then has an immediate right to 
ask the federal court trial division to appeal the minister's 
letter.  That court will call witnesses.  That court will listen 
to evidence.  That court will not just look at whether or not the 
minister has erred in some legal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the difference.  Judicial review tends to look at the 
process and the specifics of the process, whether or not there 
was an error in law, whereas one could argue that an appeal 
basically appeals a decision, making it wide open, introducing 
new evidence and everything else. Clearly when the federal court 
trial division holds a judicial review of the minister's letter 
and notice to the individual, it must and will call witnesses, 
look at all the evidence and attempt to decide whether or not the 
decision is a fair one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very interesting because if the court decides that the 
letter should not have been sent and that there is no problem 
with the individual, in other words if it finds that the 
individual did not commit fraud, then the process is over.  I 
hear members opposite and a few on this side saying that is not 
fair either and that the government should have the right to 
appeal.  We want to walk both sides of the street on this deal. 
If the government continues to have the right to appeal, there 
could be a very strong case for harassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just do not understand how one can argue on the one hand that 
one wants to protect humanitarian rights, and I will come to the 
humanitarian and compassionate issue, and then on the other hand 
that we should give the big bad government the right to appeal 
the decision of a judicial review by the federal court trial 
division that says there was no fraud.  If that happens it is 
case over, door shut and that person stays as a citizen.  It 
seems to me that is protecting the rights of that individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it more interesting to have the alliance reform party, or 
whatever it is called, in opposition to this for these stated 
reasons.  Its members think the power belongs more appropriately 
in the hands of the judges and not the politicians. We all know 
that when one wants to denigrate a particular issue the best 
place to start is by denigrating those who are politicians.  We 
are all a bad lot.  We all make decisions with ulterior motives 
and we cannot be trusted.  We hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I ask those members, what was the position of the opposition 
in this place when the supreme court in B.C. ruled in favour of 
that individual who was promoting child pornography?  My 
goodness, how could a judge make such a decision? 
How could a judge make such a decision? What is their solution? 
Their solution is simply to invoke the notwithstanding clause, 
smack the judge over the hand and reverse the decision. By the 
way, none of us like that decision.  In fact we decided to appeal 
that to the Supreme Court of Canada.

for the positive benefits of Bill C-16 to be put forward to the 
Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no one is asking for anything special.  What is being 
asked for is the protection of the charter, for the right to 
defend one's citizenship. What is being asked for is the due 
process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend may not like it but the due process of law is having 
the right to appeal a finding of fact to the supreme court. It 
happens in our courts each and every day. The problem with the 
bill is it denies Canadians by choice the charter.  It denies 
them the due process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want political decisions on citizenship revocation. We 
want the courts to make those decisions because they are not a 
political body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week and a half ago the Prime Minister was visiting a 
neighbouring riding to my own. He said that the one key thing in 
the life of our nation is to make sure that the rights of the 
citizens are protected by the court in our land and not subject 
to the capricious elected.  The Prime Minister had it right.  The 
principle being referred to was holding the judges politically 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone's rights are involved it should not be a popularity 
contest because justice is blind.  That is how the law is 
applied. It is not how powerful one is, how weak one is, but we 
try to treat everyone equally as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every legal group that came before us, including the B'nai 
Brith, including Mr. Narvey from the coalition of synagogues from 
Montreal, concerned about war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
the Holocaust, said that there should be a right to appeal.  Is 
my friend saying to me that he is going to tell Canadians by 
choice that they do not have a right to appeal the judicial 
decision?  That is exactly what he is saying.  If he does not 
know the difference between judicial appeal and the review of 
that decision, then he has a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a memo in my friend's office from Mr. Kenneth Narvey 
taking the six reasons that have been given by the government and 
debunking each one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely to God the member does not want to deny the due process 
of law and the charter of rights protection to people who are 
citizens by choice.  If he does, let me tell him I will debate 
with him in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the most 
disgusting threat I have ever received.  If the member wants to 
come to my riding any time, any place, anywhere and debate me on 
anything, I would be delighted to have him do so. This should not 
be about personal attacks, that member trying to intimidate or 
threaten me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did receive Mr. Narvey's memo but I did not receive it from 
Mr. Narvey. I received it from the member for Kitchener—Waterloo 
telling me that I should simply agree with everything Mr. Narvey 
said.  Well, I have read it and I do not agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say these are the facts.  Does the member want to 
talk about appeal?  Does he want to talk about protecting rights? 
Someone is over the top on this.  The process has five different 
steps and provides at least three opportunities to ask the 
federal court to judicially review the decisions that are being 
taken during these steps. The decisions that come out of these 
judicial reviews can themselves be appealed to the federal court 
appeal division and to the Supreme Court of Canada with 
authorization, with leave. 
That represents a possible total of nine reviews and appeals to 
the courts, not including the initial judicial review by the 
federal court at the very beginning of the revocation process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, oh what an opportunity has been lost, because, as the 
member for Mississauga West has just said, here it is the year 
2000, here we are debating a new citizenship act for the new 
millennium and here we are in a debate that has fallen into 
discord on some very fundamental issues.  We have lost a golden 
opportunity and I really do feel sad about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem with the legislation has to do with the oath of 
citizenship.  I would first like to comment very briefly on the 
issue raised by the member for Kitchener—Waterloo.  After all 
the debate and the rhetoric are over, what we are really dealing 
with in this issue from the member for Kitchener—Waterloo is one 
set of due process for one group of Canadians and another set of 
due process for another group of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Kitchener—Waterloo that there is 
something fundamentally wrong with that, and it can be tested.  As 
the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul said, he justified the 
difference in due process to the fact that some Canadians are 
born here and their citizenship cannot be revoked because they 
have nowhere else to go to.  He then made the assumption that new 
Canadians, who have come from other lands, can have their 
citizenship revoked because they can go back to their original 
land if it is found that they have entered Canada and sought 
citizenship under false pretences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would point out to the member for Winnipeg North—St. 
Paul is that if people from India, where they cannot have dual 
nationality, come to Canada and take out citizenship in Canada, 
they lose their citizenship in India.  What we are basically 
talking about here is that if citizenship is revoked from this 
category of new Canadian who is from India, then they cannot go 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggest is that Bill C-16 does not provide for that, and 
in fact should provide for that, but if it is going to provide 
for that it will have to create a new category of Canadians who 
will have to be treated under a different due process.  That, 
fundamentally, is what is wrong with the legislation as it stands 
now with respect to setting up a different regime for revocation 
of citizenship, a different judicial regime than would exist for 
other Canadians faced with similar contraventions of the law.  I 
think the member for Kitchener—Waterloo has a very important 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My difficulty with the legislation though, Mr. Speaker, is 
different but very closely related.  My problem with Bill C-16, 
the citizenship bill as it is presented, is that it proposes a 
new oath of citizenship that has never been debated in the House. 
It proposes a new oath of citizenship that I do not think 
reflects what it is to be Canadian, that does not reflect the 
principles of being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a new oath of citizenship, Mr. Speaker, that has been 
created in the shadows of the government.  It has been created by 
a bureaucrat or a bureaucracy somewhere.  For that matter, Mr. 
Speaker, for all we know it may have been contracted out.  We do 
not know the pedigree of the oath of citizenship that is now in 
Bill C-16.  On something so absolutely, vitally important as the 
oath of citizenship, we should know and we in the House should 
have participated.  Unfortunately we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on the oath of citizenship has a real history that I 
have actually been involved in.  When I came to parliament for 
the first time as a new MP in 1993, the very first committee that 
I served on was the citizenship and immigration committee in 1993 
and 1994 in which we were analyzing what needed to be done to 
upgrade the citizenship legislation to make it current to the new 
millennium. 
Every witness who came before the committee as a new Canadian was 
asked to express what it meant to be a new Canadian.  Of all the 
committees I have served on that was the most inspiring.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from people from Croatia, like my friend from 
Cambridge.  We heard from people from southeast Asia, the 
Caribbean and the United Kingdom.  They all said essentially the 
same thing.  They said that Canada was admired the world around, 
that it was a magnet for people all over the world because of its 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is admired the world over because of the principles that 
are enshrined in the charter of rights, the rule of law, our 
adherence to democracy, our freedom of speech and our adherence 
to basic human rights.  We heard this theme time and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came down to our report, the committee decided that 
there should be a declaration of citizenship.  We thought it 
would be really wonderful to enshrine these principles that are 
basically expressed in the charter of rights in a declaration 
that would go in the preamble of the citizenship bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the oath was concerned, and I should actually mention 
the oath, the committee unanimously agreed that the oath needed 
to be revisited.  I want to read the oath that exists today and 
that will be amended in Bill C-16.  The oath that was before our 
committee in 1993-94 simply said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true 
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of 
Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and I will faithfully observe 
the laws of Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think just about every new Canadian who came before the 
committee said that oath was inadequate.  They said that when 
they came before their citizenship hearings they were 
disappointed, not just because of the reference to a foreign 
monarch but because they felt the oath did not captured what it 
was to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee came out with its report called “Belonging 
Together”.  I stress that we heard from new Canadians and from 
people who were born in Canada.  The recommendations of that 
report were, first, that a declaration of Canadian citizenship 
should express the vision Canadians share for their future and 
the importance they attach to their citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, that the declaration should reflect the core values of 
our concept of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, that the government should consider calling on the 
writers of Canada to contribute to the drafting of this 
declaration.  We wanted the poets.  We wanted everyone in the 
country involved in expressing what it was to be a Canadian in 
terms of a few lines that could capture that spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth recommendation was that the declaration should be 
drafted in a language that is noble, uplifting and inspires pride 
in being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  Five years later Bill C-63, now Bill C-16, was 
tabled in the House of Commons.  I was here at my place when it 
was tabled.  What we got was no declaration of what it is to be a 
citizen.  There was no change in the preamble of Bill C-16.  What 
we got instead was a warmed over oath of citizenship that bears 
no relation whatsoever to what new Canadians were telling us when 
they came before our committee.  The amazing thing is that we did 
not even know where it came from.  It suddenly appeared in the 
legislation without prior debate, without debate in the second 
citizenship committee.  I will read it.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to 
Canada and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of 
Canada.  I promise to respect our country's rights and freedoms, 
to uphold our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws 
and fulfil my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who wrote that?  Who had the temerity to write those words 
without consulting Canadians?  Who had the temerity to write 
those words without actually fielding them in parliament where we 
could debate them.  What words are they, from the very beginning? 
The words are “I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to Canada”. 
That is a redundancy.  Loyalty and allegiance, in English anyway, 
mean the same thing.  If we analyze the history of the oath we 
can see where that came from.  It came from was the French 
version of the current oath which says “Je jure fidélité et 
sincère allégeance à Sa Majesté la reine”.  It is a direct English 
translation of the French version of the existing oath, 
and it is a bad translation.  Any English or French teacher would 
reject it at the public school level.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say “I promise to respect our country's rights 
and freedoms”.  We are bigger than that.  It is not 
just our country's rights and freedoms.  We as Canadians respect 
everybody's rights and freedoms.  This is a fundamental 
difference and this is what makes us Canadian.  This confines it 
selfishly to Canada alone, and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then says “to uphold our democratic values”.   Democratic 
values are a matter of perception in terms of the country in 
which we happen to be living.  People from East Germany will 
recall that the name for East Germany was the German Democratic 
Republic.  The full name for the Congo is the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, where they are busily killing one another as fast 
as they can.  Right now there is a little civil war going on in 
Fiji and the government is being held hostage.  That is the 
Sovereign Democratic Republic of Fiji.  And so it goes.  The 
Democratic Republic of Korea is really North Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we cannot simply pledge allegiance to the 
democratic values of the country to which we belong.  We have to 
pledge allegiance to democratic values in the abstract because 
the danger is, as we experienced in Germany during the 1930s, 
which led to the second world war, that a dictatorship is very 
fond of perverting democratic values and becoming a dictatorship 
under the guise of democracy.  No.  If we are going to pay 
respect to democratic values it must be democratic values in the 
abstract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final words are “to faithfully observe our laws and fulfil 
my duties and obligations as a citizen”.  That applies to every 
country in the entire world.  Of course a citizen is required to 
obey the traffic act, the criminal code or whatever.  That does 
not make us different as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that oath appeared before the House of Commons, I and 
several of my colleagues reacted very negatively.  We tried very 
rapidly to capture the essence of what we heard in that committee 
in 1993-94.  What I proposed in the House at that time—and I 
seem to be about the only one debating the oath of 
citizenship—was that the oath of citizenship should be rewritten 
in a way that would capture the five principles of the charter of 
rights, which is what makes us unique as Canadians.  Those five 
principles are equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, 
democracy, basic human rights and the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the member for Kitchener—Waterloo is agonizing over 
in his place is that he feels that the rule of law is not being 
respected because we have two different sets of due processes for 
two different sets of Canadians.  I would suggest that the member 
for Kitchener—Waterloo probably has it correct; we cannot have 
two standards for Canadians.  Canadians must always be treated 
the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make a quick comment on those five principles.  I 
have to say that when I proposed that in the House I did have 
some positive response but there was no opportunity to debate it 
other than me standing here and speaking for the length of time 
that I had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what I will point out is obvious:  Equality of 
opportunity is really what being Canadian is all about.  We are 
all different in many ways.  What is essential for every one of 
us individually is to have the chance to compete equally for the 
good things in life, so it is a matter of providing those 
equalities of opportunity.  That is why we as Liberals believe in 
medicare.  We believe that people cannot begin to compete unless 
they have equality in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is freedom of speech.  Many of the new 
Canadians who came before us came from countries where there is 
no such thing as freedom of speech.  The first thing that is done 
in a democracy that wants to be a dictatorship is to suppress the 
press.  Even though it is sometimes very hard for us on the 
government side to bear the attacks that we see almost daily now 
in our national press, it is nevertheless part and parcel of 
democracy and it is absolutely vital.  Freedom of speech is 
absolutely essential.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already commented on democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basic human rights are not just things we stand for as Canadians 
for ourselves; they are things which we stand for around the 
world.  We are genuinely concerned about what happens in Sierra 
Leone.  We were genuinely concerned about what happened in Bosnia 
and Rwanda.  That is what being Canadian is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the rule of law.  It is not obeying the law 
that is so important; it is appreciating the law.  One of the 
reasons we have such a strong democracy is that we have, sitting 
opposite of me, members of parliament who are separatists, who 
believe the country should be broken up.  Yet I am proud of the 
fact that they see that outcome only by means of the rule of law. 
They are as good parliamentarians as I am on this side of the 
House.  I am proud to be in the same Chamber with them, even 
though I reject their fundamental premise.  The fact is, they 
believe that if it is to be achieved, it can only be achieved by 
due process, by the rule of law.  I am proud to be in the Chamber 
with people who feel that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed that oath.  Not too surprisingly it was rejected by 
the House.  One of the things that disappointed me was, when I 
proposed my version of the oath that contained these five 
principles, I asked that there be a free vote in the House, and 
there was not.  I noticed that not just my side, but the NDP, the 
Conservatives and certainly the Bloc Quebecois voted as a group. 
There was obviously no attempt to consider the possibility of a 
made in Canada oath; an oath that, whatever its merits or 
demerits, at least expressed the principles of the charter of 
rights.  If they did not like anything else, if they did not like 
the fact that it dropped the Queen, or if they did not like the 
reference to God, fine.  But it captured what it is to be Canada 
in terms of the charter of rights, which is freedom of speech, 
democracy, rule of law, equality of opportunity and basic human 
rights.  That is what it is to be Canadian.  Any new Canadian who 
comes to this country knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say I am disappointed hardly captures it.  I hate to use the 
word, but I think it was basic cowardice on the part of the 
government and even parliament to allow an oath of citizenship to 
go out that does not reflect the spirit of being Canadian, at 
least in terms of the House.  It has not been debated in the 
House.  We have an obligation.  This House is the repository of 
everything that it means to be Canadian.  This is the focus.  We 
should have debated that.  To not have done so is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member for Cambridge, what am I going to do when I go 
to my citizenship courts, when these starry eyed new Canadians 
come before the citizenship court commissioner now, instead of a 
judge, put their hand up and quote an oath of citizenship that 
the government and parliament never debated or never had the 
courage to even consider the content of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, this is the time when we need the Senate.  I believe 
that the House of Commons failed in its duty when it allowed an 
oath of citizenship to go out that has no heritage, no patrimony, 
no connection to what it really means to be Canadian.  It is 
simply an oath that was created somewhere behind the curtains. 
We do not know where.  We are expecting newcomers to Canada to 
use that oath, not only to understand Canada better, but as a 
commitment to being part of Canada.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that the Senate very carefully look at this 
legislation.  If it cannot come up with an oath that captures the 
principles of being Canadian, then please reject the oath that is 
here.  It is absolutely unacceptable to have a new oath, an 
elaborately revised oath, go before new Canadians when we 
ourselves have never been a part of its creation; when we 
parliamentarians, when we Canadians have never participated in 
the creation of that oath.  It is now up to the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make some comments and congratulate 
the member for expressing with passion his belief on the 
legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of a press release from B'nai Brith Canada which 
says that if we adopt Motions Nos. 4 and 5 they “would make the 
bill more just”.  B'nai Brith Canada is very careful.  It 
believes that there is justice in this bill and that if these 
motions were adopted the bill would be given additional strength. 
I congratulate B'nai Brith Canada for giving that kind of 
reasoned argument and leaving the vote on this issue to the 
honest belief of members of parliament.  There is no threat 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call to the attention of the House another press release from 
a group headed by Mr. W. Halchuk, which states that Bill C-16 is 
discriminatory and is based on race.  It further states that if 
support is given to Bill C-16 consequences will be suffered and 
losing our seats will be more expensive than “having your 
nomination papers not signed”.  Press releases like this from 
people proclaiming to champion Canadian citizenship and at the 
same time risking the freedom and liberty of democracy in debate 
could make us afraid to think.  That is the very threat to 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an adopted citizen of Canada.  I am a naturalized Canadian. 
My loyalty to Canada is undivided.  But I believe that the 
proposed citizenship act, if passed, as the member for 
Mississauga West indicated earlier in this debate, would be a day 
to celebrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but comment on this threat to members of 
parliament made by Mr. Halchuk.  I would like members to listen 
to one more comment:  “Citizenship is too important to be left 
up to the politicians”.  What does this individual think of 
politicians? Like it or not, the Government of Canada and the 
country itself will continue to be run by politicians and we had 
better believe in our profession, the noble calling of politics. 
Threats infuse fear and they have no role in the Chamber of 
democracy, the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kitchener—Waterloo said earlier that if there is 
a charter violation a cost must be paid if a provision of the 
charter of rights and freedoms is violated.  This law already 
exists and is subject to review by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
We cannot take it away.  No act of parliament can take away the 
right of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear argument on a 
violation of the charter of rights and freedoms.  To inject fear 
that it may happen is just that.  It is creating a slavery of 
fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been argued that there is no room for appeal.  Subclause 
18(4) at page 8 of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On making an order under subsection (1), the Minister shall 
inform the person who is the subject of the order that the order 
has been made— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul is addressing his 
comments entirely to the earlier speech given by the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo.  I spoke just prior, and if he has some 
constructive things to say about my speech, would he please do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The point of order is well taken. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul is on questions and 
comments on the speech of the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  I know he will want to make his comments 
relevant to that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, because the member 
alluded to that issue as well, it is in order that I address that 
component of the debate. 
Since I have not finished my debate, he was premature in judging 
that I would not address the other component of his debate.  Only 
time may limit me in addressing that issue, but I intend to do 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue my speech, Mr. Speaker.  Before I was 
interrupted— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I must remind the hon. member that he 
has gone on for almost five minutes of the ten minutes available 
for questions and comments and there may be other members who 
want to ask a question or make a comment.  I think he ought to 
terminate his remarks quite soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  With your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to make comments, which is part of our parliamentary 
procedure.  In fact, I am not even compelled to ask a question. 
Be that as it may, I respect your advice, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 18(4) states:  “On making an order under subsection 
(1), the Minister shall inform the person who is the subject of 
the order that the order has been made”—and I would like to 
underscore this—“and advise them of their right to apply for 
judicial review under section 18.1 of the Federal Court Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule of law is fundamental, as the member from Wentworth has 
alluded to.  That rule of law requires that no immigrant wanting 
to be a Canadian citizen may knowingly breach that rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a breach of the rule of law if there is false 
representation and there is fraud.  That is the very essence of a 
breach of the rule of law, not to respect the law itself.  The 
member from Wentworth said, yes, we must have not two standards 
but one standard for citizenship.  I agree that the bill has only 
one standard.  That is the standard for revocation of 
citizenship.  Therefore, we cannot imagine another standard for 
Canadian citizens born in Canada because we do not create another 
standard for a situation where there will be no instance for 
revocation of citizenship, which is citizenship by birth. 
Therefore, to compare the two is definitely against logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the point that the member from Wentworth alluded to about his 
proposed amendment to the oath, I support in principle his 
amendment that we are united as a people under the supremacy of 
God.  That statement, may I remind the Chamber, is already in the 
statement preceding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
I feel, while it may be reiterated in this instance, to me it is 
already in the highest fundamental law of the land.  That is my 
position on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the position of taking away the allegiance to the Queen, in 
all sincerity, honesty and forthrightness, I believe in the 
heritage of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are two things.  On 
the member's first point, it is still one set of rules for one 
set of Canadians and another set of rules for another set of 
Canadians.  I do find that it does seem to contravene the whole 
basic principle of equality before the law and I have a lot of 
difficulty with that.  When it boils down to that, then I think 
the member for Kitchener—Waterloo has a very important and 
compelling point, and I hope the Senate will look at that as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the other, I thank the member for Winnipeg North—St. 
Paul.  I appreciate the support he has given for what I am trying 
to do with the oath.  I will make the point that the Queen is not 
the real issue.  The real issue is that the oath should actually 
capture for newcomers to this land what it is to be a Canadian 
and what are the basic principles of the charter.  That is the 
more important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the Queen is in a new oath or not, I think in the long 
run it does not matter half as much—and I believe there should 
be a reference to God certainly—but more than anything else, we 
should enunciate for those newcomers to our land the basic 
principles of the charter.  I will say them one more time because 
I really do believe they unite us, we Canadians, as a people. 
They are:  equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, 
basic human rights and the rule of law.  They are not just for we 
Canadians.  We should be upholding those principles for the 
world. That is what it is to be Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo is certainly correct that this country cannot 
tolerate two classes of citizenship.  He is correct to say that 
we all need to be equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding that I would sit here in the House today and 
listen to this debate as we begin a new millennium.  The United 
Nations for years has indicated that Canada is the country to 
which others in the world want to come, to become Canadians and 
to live here in prosperity, in peace, in harmony and to be 
treated equally which they may not have had from where they came. 
To sit here today and listen to the debate among members of the 
government side has really opened my eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, I immigrated to Canada from a wartorn 
country in 1955 when I was six years old.  After living here for 
45 years, to debate whether my status as a Canadian citizen is 
the same as that of my son or my wife who were born in this 
country is almost unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this debate alone is grounds to do something about this 
bill, for the committee to look at it and to make the appropriate 
amendments.  I do not think the country can tolerate the point 
that was raised by the member for Kitchener—Waterloo that in 
essence we will differ because of the due process that is to be 
followed by Canadians that are born in this country and Canadians 
by choice.  If it differs, then we must do something about it.  I 
believe it will certainly not unify the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud and brag about this being a multicultural nation. 
There is no doubt in my mind that this is going to be a very 
divisive issue.  As I say, I cannot believe I am sitting here 
today hearing this debate on citizenship and what the bill means 
to our citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the Canadian Alliance policy on our 
respect for the equality of all citizens before and under the 
law.  Policy number 61 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We affirm the equality of every individual before and under the 
law and the right of every individual to equal protection and 
equal benefit of the law without discrimination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if we attain the status of a Canadian even if we 
were not born in this country, then we are treated like Canadians 
one hundred per cent.  There are not two classes.  We are all 
first class Canadians who all get the same rights.  This is the 
debate that this occurring in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will repeal and replace the current Citizenship 
Act passed in 1977.  Bill C-16 has been tabled with very few 
changes from previous Bill C-63.  The legislation makes several 
changes to the current act with the intention of providing more 
clearly defined guidelines, updating sections, replacing current 
procedures, adding a new administrative structure and increasing 
the minister's power to deny citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 has been touted as the first major reform with respect 
to citizenship in more than 20 years and an attempt to modernize 
the act in order that it might better reflect the true value of 
Canadian citizenship.  However, while some parts are more clearly 
defined than in the previous act, Bill C-16 does not constitute a 
major modern reform. As I said earlier, if it were a modern 
reform, we certainly would not be debating the status of 
citizenship as indicated in the bill. Critical areas have been 
neglected while others have been altered in a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister received recommendations of the government 
dominated Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in 
1994. Again I reiterate from former debate and as members of this 
House have indicated, the witnesses that came before the 
committee made many recommendations that were not taken up in the 
drafting of this bill. 
In fact the government has taken over five years to prepare this 
legislation which still does not address the committee's key 
recommendations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On citizenship at birth, clause 4(1) of Bill C-16 states in 
effect that all children born in Canada, except children of 
foreign diplomats, will continue to automatically acquire 
Canadian citizenship regardless of their parents' immigration or 
citizenship status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point, there are many countries which Canadians come 
from that have only one status.  They do not have dual 
citizenship.  On a personal note, I asked China whether it had 
dual citizenship and it does not. In other words, if I ended up 
getting booted out of this country, where would I go?  Actually I 
do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the conditions for granting citizenship, the presence in 
Canada is covered in clause 6(1)(b).  Bill C-16 defines the term 
permanent resident more concisely than does the current act.  The 
existing legislation may be loosely interpreted.  Some 
individuals have been found to be residing in Canada because they 
had a bank account or owned property in the country without 
having actually resided on Canadian soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that point, in the debate we heard about people who 
were unwanted, who perhaps had criminal records and came into 
Canada in a dishonest manner.  I do not think anyone objects to 
getting rid of those people.  That is not really the issue here. 
The question being debated is citizens, outstanding citizens, 
law-abiding citizens who have made a contribution to this 
country.  Their rights need to be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 calls for 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada in 
the six years preceding application for citizenship.  Bill C-16 
does not provide any mechanism for determining when applicants 
arrive in Canada and when they leave nor is it planned to develop 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties for bureaucratic delays are found in clause 
6(1)(b)(i).  The current act allows individuals whose claims for 
refugee status are approved to count each full day of residency 
in Canada from the date of application as a half day toward the 
total needed for their citizenship application. Bill C-16 removes 
this provision so that applicants will now be penalized for the 
system's bureaucratic delay even when delays are no fault of the 
applicant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of adoption outside Canada, clause 8 of Bill C-16 
will reduce the distinction between a foreign child adopted by a 
Canadian citizen and a child born in Canada.  Currently a foreign 
child adopted by a Canadian citizen must first be admitted to 
Canada as a permanent resident before citizenship can be granted. 
It is currently ensured that the child is sponsored and 
undergoes medical, criminal and security checks.  This bill will 
remove these requirements. The new legislation will make it 
easier for adopting parents to gain Canadian citizenship for the 
child if the adoption occurs outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 stipulates in order to allow citizenship to be granted 
to the minor, the adoption must create a genuine parent-child 
relationship, be in the best interests of the child and cannot 
have been intended to circumvent Canadian immigration or 
citizenship law. Under clause 43(1) defining the terms of this 
relationship are left to the minister's discretion.  The clause 
“in the best interests of the child” was added to Bill C-63 at 
the last minute, although it had not been recommended or 
requested by any witness and retained in Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of redefining the family, clause 43 of Bill C-16 
grants the minister the power to specify who may make an 
application under the act on behalf of a minor and to define what 
constitutes a relationship of parent and child for the purposes 
of determining entitlement to citizenship under any provisions of 
the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of patronage, clauses 31 and 32 of Bill C-16 
maintain the tradition of patronage appointments.  All 
citizenship judges will be reclassified as citizenship 
commissioners, however, all but their ceremonial duties and other 
duties as requested will be taken over by departmental officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of language requirements to gain citizenship, 
clause 6 of Bill C-16 states that the applicant will have an 
adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada. No 
provisions are included on how this is to be judged or by whom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 34 deals with the citizenship oath.  There appears to be 
little public input on the content of the new oath in Bill C-16. 
The minister prepared the oath on her own.  This could have 
provided an ideal opportunity for a nationwide patriotic debate. 
I agree with many of the members who have said that it is a very 
significant, historic family occasion when people make their 
oaths of allegiance to the country.  This is probably the biggest 
thing that will happen in their lives outside of getting married 
and having a child.  It is very, very important and Canadians 
need to have input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's first legislation should have been aimed at 
fixing a failed immigration system rather than citizenship, 
especially considering that the Citizenship Act refers to the 
Immigration Act in several places.  More than five years after 
the Liberal controlled standing committee made its 
recommendations on citizenship, the minister re-tabled legislation 
which delivers little of what was recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation reconfirms that any child born in Canada, except 
to a diplomat, is automatically a Canadian citizen.  This is 
contrary to what the standing committee, the CIC department, the 
official opposition and many Canadians support.  The minister has 
shown arrogance and lack of respect for parliament by proposing 
that critical changes be made by her behind closed doors and by 
retaining patronage appointments even after job positions are 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing this piece of legislation before the House at first 
reading when it had reached report stage in a previous session is 
an admission on the part of the government that Bill C-16 
requires further examination.  However, the minimal changes that 
have been made to the bill easily could have been made during 
report stage.  The minister should focus on fixing our 
immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the debate I have heard today certainly tells me 
that a lot of work needs to be done on the bill.  The big point 
which I need to re-emphasize, and the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo made this a key point, is that this country 
cannot tolerate two classes of citizenship.  We all want to be 
first class. There is only one status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the 
hon. member for Vancouver East, Health; the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest, Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me congratulate the member for Dauphin—Swan River 
on his speech.  I can tell him that the legal issues we are 
dealing with are fairly difficult and it took a while to get 
through them.  At some point when I saw the charts and was trying 
to put them all together I identified the lack of appeal process 
that is available everywhere else ends at the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  We make that available to visitors who come to this 
country and commit a serious offence because we believe in due 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and I have had some similar experiences coming from 
different countries.  No one argues that if someone commits 
serious offences coming to this country, or is a war criminal, or 
has told major lies to get here, we recognize that people who 
apply for refugee status to get to Canada often have to do it by 
stealth.  We recognized that when we had the policy of none is 
too many for Jews.  People had to misinform to get into this 
country.  We applaud that they got through and wish that more had.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the member had it right.  The charter of rights, 
the due process of law and the presumption of innocence should 
apply to everyone.  What scares me in this whole process is that 
we can slander people by saying they are guilty of this or 
that and then fail to prove it in court.  If someone is being 
accused, we have a due process for defending the accusation which 
should apply to everyone, certainly to citizens by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, citizenship and other 
issues of the day need to be done right with absolutely no 
mistakes.  If we look back to the bleak moments of Canadian 
history there have been times when we have done the wrong things. 
Certainly in terms of my own ethnic background, there was the 
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not say that we should compare this to it.  That is not 
the point.  The point is that we cannot make a mistake in terms 
of how we deal with Canadian immigrants from all over the world 
who come to this country.  We have to do it correctly.  People 
have to be treated on an equal footing.  Long gone are the days 
when politicians can decide who they can discriminate or not 
discriminate against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set ourselves up as a country to be the model for the 
world.  Citizenship is one of the keys in becoming the model 
society for the world.  If we are to do the talk then we need to 
do the walk.  Doing the walk is making sure that this legislation 
is correctly done.  We will all be happier for it as will the 
rest of the world.  It will not only be people in this country 
because other people look to us for guidance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, would the hon. member consider referring the 
matter to the Federal Court of Canada Trial Division for the 
ascertainment of allegations of fraud, false identity and 
illegality; notifying the person involved that the order is about 
to be made by the minister; inviting the person who is the 
subject of the potential order to make representations to the 
minister; and then, if the decision has been made, advising the 
person of his or her right to the judicial review, parts of the 
due process of law?  That is my first question because they are 
very good safeguards for the due process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to his fear, a feeling of fear, and he has 
been here since the age of six.  I imagine the member would say 
that he has been here more than five years.  I would like to call 
to his attention that subclause 18(5) with respect to the 
annulment order on citizenship says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may not make an order under subsection (1) more than 
five years after the day on which the citizenship was granted, 
retained, renounced or resumed, as the case may be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is the safeguard of the limitation period 
so he has nothing to fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is that since 1920 the current system has been in 
effect.  Under the provision of that system citizenship is 
revocable by the governor in council, in effect by cabinet, on a 
report of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  Is the 
member aware of any one instance in the history of Canada since 
1920 where we have somehow treated in so far as revocation of 
citizenship is concerned naturalized citizens as second class?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, if we go back through the 
history books we will not have a difficult time finding where 
many different ethnic backgrounds were discriminated against. 
Just because they were naturalized citizens does not mean they 
had full citizenship status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same question today on the whole issue of females 
when it is said that they are not full participating members of 
society.  On the issue of law, I am not worried about myself.  I 
am only saying that what is good for Canadian born citizens is 
just as good for adopted Canadians who came here and put in their 
time, whatever the number of years required to become a full 
status Canadian. They should be treated the same way.  It should 
be no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Even if it is fraud? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  If it is fraud, as I said earlier, then 
get rid of them.  That is not the problem.  The problem is the 
process.  The process should be the same and equal for all of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to say a few words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke asked us if we could give one example 
of discrimination in Canadian history. I remind him of the 
situation in which Japanese Canadians found themselves during 
World War II. Without questioning the member's ethnic origin, I 
could tell him that the Chinese have also faced discrimination in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that being born in Canada does not 
mean that one does not have to worry about democracy. For reasons 
that only they know, some people think they have a monopoly on 
truth. The Prime Minister is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for democracy, we could relate that to Bill C-20. This is an 
example of what democracy can be in a country where it is never 
challenged, where it is taken for granted. That is the danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member wants to change the oath of allegiance. One way or the 
other, it makes absolutely no difference to me. Members will 
notice that Quebecers are not taking part in this debate, and 
that is quite significant. I would like those who say these 
things to give us an answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member of 
the Bloc for raising an excellent point on the whole issue of the 
Japanese internment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of internment in this country was from 1914 to 
1918 when over 5,000 Ukrainian Canadians were interned and over 
80,000 were made to register with the government like common 
criminals.  There are a lot of examples in our history that 
should teach us the lesson that if we are to pass legislation in 
this day we should do it the right way.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 15 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife species 
at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak today to Bill 
C-33, the species at risk act.  It is always a pleasure to rise 
in the House, but I must say on this piece of legislation that my 
NDP colleagues and I are keenly disappointed for reasons which I 
will detail in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is appropriate that we begin debate on this 
legislation soon after the list of species at risk of extinction 
in the country has grown to an all time high.  Recently 14 new 
species were added to the list, which in Canada has been produced 
each spring for the past 23 years.  The number of wild animals, 
plants, insects and marine organisms at risk of disappearing from 
Canada now stands at an all time high of 354.  This is a stark 
reminder that our country's natural heritage is under threat. The 
rate at which species disappear from our planet speaks volumes to 
the overall health of our environment and ultimately our own 
human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disappearance of these species serves as a warning sign, 
much like the canaries that used to be taken down mines shafts. 
It is a warning that something is happening to habitat.  Often 
that something is directly related to the activities of our own 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worldwide we are experiencing the largest extinction epidemic 
since the time of the dinosaurs.  Historically an average of 
about two to three species a year went extinct due to natural 
cause, but currently about two to three species go extinct every 
hour.  This is alarming.  Almost all of this is due to human 
causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists believe we could lose 25% of the earth's species 
within the next 30 years if we stay on our present course.  We in 
Canada have serious endangered species problems of our own and 
things are not getting better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may detail these, 27 species have already gone extinct in 
Canada in the past 150 years.  We now have a total of 354 species 
known to be at risk, and this list is growing every year.  In 
fact 43 species have recently been added to the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about some of our best loved birds and animals such 
as the beluga whale, the woodland caribou, the burrowing owl and 
even the great grizzly bear.  All these species could vanish from 
the wild in coming decades unless we take strong steps to protect 
them, and not only them but the places in which they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is long overdue.  Canadians have been waiting for 
almost a decade for the federal government to come up with 
something meaningful to protect species from becoming extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney government, I must say, demonstrated political 
courage when at the earth summit in 1992 it committed Canada to 
the creation of laws aimed at protecting these vulnerable 
species.  Canada was one of the first countries to sign the 
accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect it is disappointing that after such a long wait 
Bill C-33 is the best the government can do.  Nobody should be 
more disappointed than the hon. Minister of the Environment who 
has staked his political reputation on this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that the NDP caucus is disappointed with Bill C-33 
because the bill is fundamentally weak.  This is in spite of the 
government's lofty claims of national protection and harsh 
penalties for those who would do harm to a plant, animal or fish 
that is in risk of being lost forever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want and endangered species need a law that says it 
will protect species at risk, not a law that says it may protect 
those species.  All the protection this bill claims to provide is 
left to the discretion of the minister.  The only thing that the 
bill requires the government to do is to consult, although it 
does not require the minister to listen or to even follow up on 
those consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 is riddled with political discretion, so much so that 
if passed without some substantial changes it will be the weakest 
bill of its kind in North America.  I knew there would be a day 
when Mexico's environmental laws were just as strong as those in 
this country, I just did not expect it to happen so quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a year ago a survey commissioned by the International Fund 
for Animal Welfare told of Canadians' desire to see strong laws 
passed by their federal government to protect species at risk of 
extinction.  I will give a few of the numbers involved in that 
survey:  91% of Canadians believed that the federal government 
should protect endangered species on all land in Canada;  98% of 
Canadians surveyed recognized that the protection of habitat was 
an important element if we were going to protect species at risk; 
80% of Canadians preferred to have federal laws that would 
protect the full habitat of an endangered species; 72% of 
Canadians believed it was up to the federal government to take a 
lead in protecting these endangered species; and finally, a full 
97% of Canadians surveyed said that it was important that 
endangered species that migrate across borders were equally 
protected in all North American countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vast majority also indicated that they were willing to accept 
at least some economic consequences in order to see endangered 
species protected.  It is important to note that eight in ten 
Canadians advocated placing restrictions on industries that posed 
a threat to endangered species.  These people were willing to 
accept some limitation of activities such as forestry, mining and 
even tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government clearly has a mandate from Canadians to bring in 
comprehensive and meaningful legislation to protect these 
vulnerable species.  Instead, the minister has presented us with 
legislation that is both weak and discretionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a few minutes about listing.  Today a species 
is considered endangered when the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC, the scientific body 
responsible for tracking species, decides to list the species as 
endangered.  This committee has a mandate to make its decisions 
based on the best, up to date, scientific information available. 
However, if this bill becomes law, a species will be considered 
endangered only when the Minister of the Environment says it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In typical Liberal style, Bill C-33 formally establishes COSEWIC 
as the ultimate authority for determining which species are at 
risk of becoming extinct.  At the same time, the bill prevents 
COSEWIC and its science based findings from having any bearing on 
which species are actually protected under the law.  It 
determines which species are endangered but it is not allowed, 
under this legislation, to go ahead and protect those species, to 
list them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the bill's fine words about community knowledge, 
best available information and its claim to protect our most 
vulnerable wildlife, everything, as we see, hinges on the opinion 
of the Minister of the Environment.  The bill does not require 
the minister's opinion to be learned.  It does not have to be 
based on science.  It may be based on the list produced by 
COSEWIC or it may not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, today there are over 350 species on the 
endangered list.  The important question is:  Will they be 
protected immediately upon the passage of this bill? 
Disturbingly, the answer is, no they will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day this bill becomes law there will not be any endangered 
species in Canada, at least not officially.   Not a single 
species at risk today will be protected under this law until the 
minister gets around to making his list.  The existing list of 
species at risk, the result of a full 23 years of work by 
COSEWIC, is not grandfathered or automatically included in the 
legislation. 
I ask the question, when is an endangered species endangered, and 
it seems that the answer is, when the minister decides it is.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single greatest threat to species is the loss of habitat, 
the places where they live, breed and feed.  Habitat loss is 
responsible for 80% of species decline in Canada.  Passing a law 
that does not protect habitat is really a waste of parliament's 
time.  Again, Bill C-33 fails in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While other countries, including Mexico, have made the 
protection of critical habitat mandatory, Canada is proposing to 
make it discretionary.  Once again a species will enjoy 
protection under the provisions of this law at the pleasure of 
the environment minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a species is deemed worthy of protection there remains a 
period that can be as long as 30 months before the habitat is 
actually protected.  Only the residents, the nest or the den is 
protected in the interim, and we feel that is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of what we are talking about occurs only on federal 
government lands.  Provincial lands and privately owned property 
have not been factored into this formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we discuss property issues, I want to say that I come from a 
riding that contains a mix of urban and rural people.  I want to 
address the very real concerns that these people have about a law 
which if passed would affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that we in the NDP believe that people 
should and must be compensated if their lives are affected by a 
federal government plan to rescue an endangered species. 
Landowners must be assured that they are not facing personal 
losses in order to protect habitat.  If land is purchased it has 
to be with the consent of the owner and at fair market prices. 
Workers whose jobs are lost or whose paycheques shrink also have 
to be compensated.  The same goes for communities.  The last 
thing we want to see is compensation for big companies and 
nothing for the employees of those companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that Canadians want to stop more of our wildlife 
from disappearing forever.  We also understand that the cost of 
protecting those species must be shared by all of us, not just 
the people on whose land endangered species happen to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about property rights, I noticed in some of the 
speeches made by my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance that they 
seem to be telling farmers and ranchers that this bill threatens 
their very way of life.  Some suggest that farmers might have 
their land seized by the federal government with no guarantee of 
compensation.  Comments like that play on people's fears, and I 
want to assure the House that we in the NDP will oppose that kind 
of tactic, the use of half truths or scaremongering in an attempt 
to frighten and divide people.  We want a reasoned and a factual 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest disappointment I have with Bill C-33 is its failure 
to protect species at risk on lands where the federal government 
has a clear and an undisputed jurisdiction.  This may come as a 
surprise to some people who have been listening to the news and 
to comments by the Minister of the Environment.  The federal 
government is not even willing to protect species and habitats on 
all of its own land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations, such as the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association 
and the Mining Association of Canada, think that the federal 
government should be doing more to protect wildlife on the lands 
that it owns and oversees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-33 provides protection only on federal lands 
south of the 60th parallel.  This means that the act gives 
federal habitat protection on only a small percentage really of 
Canada's lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also fails to offer protection for species or habitat 
which clearly fall under federal jurisdiction, and I am thinking 
now specifically of migratory birds, cross-border species and 
fish.  Over 70% of Canada's species at risk migrate or range into 
the United States.  Many of these species, because of Bill C-33, 
will lose the protection they enjoy in the United States simply 
by crossing the Canadian border.  In fact, the White House and 
many senators have written to urge Canada to protect the habitat 
of these so-called shared species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask ourselves why there is this lack of protection.  I 
would suggest that in large part it is due to the government's 
departmental turf wars.  The department and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, for example, do not want officials from 
Environment Canada telling them how to protect endangered species 
in our parks.  Officials at the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans have no intention of letting officials from Environment 
Canada tell them how to protect fish habitat.  The same goes for 
the Department of National Defence and the lands which it 
controls.  This is a serious internal problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In political terms, the bottom line is that the Prime Minister 
is very determined to have a law on the books before the next 
election.  The only way to make that happen is to come up with 
legislation that serves as a guide for the federal government 
whenever and if ever it feels obliged to protect a species from 
becoming extinct.  It serves as a guide but there is no necessity 
written into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a few moments about the government's 
environmental record.  I was rather startled to read a book 
review in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> last weekend by a writer named 
Andrew Nikiforuk.  He was reviewing an important new book written 
by Maurice Strong, an environmentalist.  The book described 
Canada environmentally as Mississippi north, a truly startling 
statement which bears only too much truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had tough talk about air pollution but we have yet to 
ratify the Kyoto protocol or to meet our emissions targets set 
years ago.  We have talked about cleaning up the Great Lakes, 
which used to be the world's largest environmental initiative, 
but today it has fallen off the federal government's agenda.  As 
we know, a key agreement with Ontario to work together to clean 
up the lakes was allowed to lapse earlier this year and has still 
not been renegotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government talks about the value of community based 
knowledge and the important contributions Canadians can make on 
their own, it is leading the charge to muzzle the commission for 
environmental co-operation.  That is the NAFTA watchdog whose job 
it is to help citizens blow the whistle on their own governments 
when they fail to enforce environmental protection laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but I will give one more example.  Our national 
parks are in crisis due to years of financial cutbacks and a 
complete lack of direction from a government that likes to talk 
about environmental initiatives but too often falls short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, I and my colleagues in the NDP are 
disappointed by this bill.  Because there was an earlier bill, 
Bill C-65, we thought the second run at this bill would be a vast 
improvement.  However, it is turning out not to be the case.  The 
mail and phone calls that have come into our offices indicate 
that Canadians and environmental organizations are also 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is weak on the protection of species at risk and their 
habitats.  It invites political consideration, political lobbying 
and ministerial discretion at every turn.  It fails to include 
compensation provisions for workers and communities who are 
affected economically by action plans to rescue and recover 
species at risk.  I know this is being looked at but it will only 
be looked at after this legislation is passed, if indeed it is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it is not passed.  I urge my colleagues in the House to 
defeat the bill, send it back to the minister and tell him to 
propose a law that will really protect species at risk of 
becoming extinct, a law that will protect habitat from being 
destroyed, a law that does not mix science with politics and a 
law that will ensure a just and fair distribution of the costs 
involved with saving species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In final summary, Canada deserves and can certainly afford a 
better law than this to protect species at risk of becoming 
extinct.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
will be my distinct pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to 
this bill in a few moments.  I want to compliment my NDP 
colleague for recognizing, in terms of the scientific listing for 
species at risk legislation, that it should be a matter of 
science and not of political choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on why the government would 
not take the advice and the consensus that was built upon by 
industry groups, whether it be the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association, the Canadian Mining Association or the environmental 
groups.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member think the government missed that opportunity 
to build up the consensus when industry was willing to recognize 
that maintaining our biodiversity was one of science and not of 
political choice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his question.  The short answer is that it bewilders me.  I 
do not know why the government would choose a political route 
rather than a scientific route to describe and list species at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned, private industry, which one might 
think would be opposed to listing species in any way which would 
interfere with business and ultimately profit, is telling the 
government to go further.  I do not believe the pressure came 
from the private sector.  I am only speculating, but I mentioned 
in the text of my remarks that I believe part of the problem is 
internal.  There is pressure from various government departments 
that do not want somebody else telling them how to run what they 
consider to be their business, if I may put it that way.  I would 
suggest that it is not just their business; it concerns all of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really must act on this because time is running out.  It is 
not only these species that are at risk.  As these species 
disappear, we are learning some stark lessons about our own 
mortality on this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize for my hon. colleague, I do not know the answer to 
his question.  I do know it is fundamentally important that these 
decisions be science based and not political in nature.  The 
reason for having scientists make scientific decisions is clear. 
I fear the ability of lobbies to say that species are on land or 
water used by humans and, therefore, they should not be protected 
because it would interfere with us.  I would not want to open the 
door to that kind of lobbying and I do not think we need a larger 
lobbying industry in Ottawa.  Our species would suffer from that 
kind of development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on 
Bill C-33.  I want to introduce an amendment to the bill a bit 
later, but at this time I would like to make some introductory 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps no political party in the House of Commons knows more 
about species at risk legislation or endangered species 
legislation than the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. 
Members may remember back in 1993 when the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada was reduced to just one breeding 
pair.  We were able to develop our own type of recovery plan to 
encourage Canadians to invest in the environment stock we had 
elected in 1993.  I am very pleased to say today that the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada still may be extirpated 
from certain regions temporarily, but we are looking to restore a 
habitat in other regions of the country.  From that particular 
perspective, we have returned a very fine breeding stock to the 
House of Commons.  A testament to that is the fact that Rosemary 
Kathleen Herron was born just six weeks ago.  The Tory species is 
indeed growing in leaps and bounds as we head into the next 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has 351 species that are recognized as endangered or at 
risk.  There is no federal law to protect these species.  The 
government's proposed species at risk act, known as SARA, is long 
overdue.  It is a long overdue promise, but it is very 
disappointing.  This legislation is even weaker and less 
effective than Bill C-65, the 1996 federal endangered species 
bill, which died before the 1997 election.  This new bill is 
unacceptably ineffective in several key areas, particularly 
habitat protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main threat facing endangered species is the destruction of 
their habitat, the places where species breed, where they feed 
and where they raise their young. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitat loss has been identified as the root cause for over 80% 
of species decline in Canada.  Yet, in Bill C-33, saving species 
is discretionary, even in areas—and I will bet, Mr. Speaker, 
that you will find this quite shocking—under federal 
jurisdiction.  The bill does not require protection of endangered 
species habitat.  It merely says that cabinet may protect it. 
This is one of the key weaknesses of Bill C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most evident of the weaknesses in this legislation 
is that the federal cabinet will decide which species to list as 
endangered and not the scientific committee known as COSEWIC, 
which is the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada.  The Progressive Conservative Party believes that the 
decision on whether a species is at risk is a matter of science; 
a scientific fact and not a political choice.  Even an all party 
committee report, including Liberal government members and Reform 
members, agreed that scientific listing should be the most basic 
of guiding principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has argued that if COSEWIC's list is 
automatically adopted it would open up scientists to intense 
lobbying.  This point we know to be irrelevant, since nothing 
would preclude them from being lobbied under the proposed bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building successful legislation requires input and support from 
the affected stakeholders.  The Progressive Conservative plan 
calls for more carrots and less sticks.  We believe that it is 
imperative to encourage, recognize and reward stewardship by 
offering more carrots, which in the end will result in fewer 
sticks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Progressive Conservative program would be incentive based and 
not punitive in nature.  Merely making criminals out of Canada's 
best stewards of our lands, the Canadian farmers and our woodlot 
owners, would not precipitate the positive behaviour that we are 
looking to create.  We believe this can be accomplished by 
listening to the concerns of stakeholders, working in 
co-operation with them to build a consensus on effective 
legislation, and, most importantly, engaging stakeholders in the 
recovery process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that without the 
support of the provinces, the nation's principal partners, 
private landowners, resource users and communities, the 
endangered species legislation will be impossible to institute 
and will lead to what is commonly known by the people who are 
following the legislation as a shoot, shovel and shut up 
mentality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be aware of a coalition of major environmental and 
industry groups known as the Species at Risk Working Group, which 
includes the Canadian Nature Federation, the Mining Association 
of Canada, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the Canadian 
Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club of Canada.  They have all 
agreed on the need for strong legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Hugh Windsor pointed out in The <I>Globe and Mail</I> just a few 
weeks ago, following the failure of Bill C-65, these stakeholders 
joined forces two years ago in an attempt to build a common 
position for an outline of a new endangered species act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has always been a party that 
builds consensus by working with stakeholders, uniting Canadians 
and developing sound legislative policy.  That is why we chose to 
support the work of this coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also why our position paper, produced last December, two 
weeks before the government's, has been graded by members of this 
coalition to be an A, while the government's position paper was 
graded a mere D.  We are working from a position where industry 
and environmental groups have argued that our position warrants 
an A, and the basis that formed this legislation is of only D 
quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These stakeholders agreed that, at a minimum, a bill designed to 
protect species at risk should require habitat protection in all 
areas of federal jurisdiction and a science based listing of 
endangered species.  These are key components of our Progressive 
Conservative plan that are absent from the government's Bill 
C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask:  With a joint industry-environment consensus 
handed to the government, how is it possible that it ignored this 
consensus, this work that was done on behalf of the Department of 
the Environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple answer, I am sad to say, is that the government is 
just not listening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the government's proposal, Pierre Gratton of the 
Mining Association of Canada said, “We certainly think it could 
be stronger”.  Robert Decarie of the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association said, “We think the federal government could have 
been much stronger, at least within its own clear 
jurisdictions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 
solid corporate citizenry of the mining association and the pulp 
and paper association for their efforts in developing a broad 
Canadian consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 70% of Canada's species at risk migrate or range into the 
United States.  Even the White House and many senators have 
written to urge Canada to protect the habitat of these shared 
species.  Imagine that.  The Americans are now challenging Canada 
to protect the environment.  How things have changed over seven 
years.  Long gone are the days when Canada led environmental 
battles against the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Progressive Conservative government which took on the 
Americans and negotiated the country's acid rain protocol in 
1987.  Now we have the Americans lobbying Canadians to clean up 
our environmental act.  It is important to note, however, that 
the United States has tough endangered species legislation, but 
we do not support their all stick and no carrot approach, and 
neither does the species at risk working group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the key improvements needed concern internal federal 
issues which would not be opposed by the provinces or industries. 
However, a lack of political will to listen continues to hamper 
any progress on building a better bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial endangered species laws make habitat protection 
mandatory, and thus are stronger in this proposed species at risk 
act.  The Progressive Conservative Party has always believed in 
co-operative federalism.  The Progressive Conservative Party 
believes that a federal law should act as a safety net.  This 
means that a federal act would only apply in provinces where no 
equivalent protection exists.  This was made clear under the 
terms of the national accord for the protection of species at 
risk signed in 1996 by all governments.  We maintain our 
commitment to this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equivalent legislation would be defined as including, at a 
minimum, scientific listing and the protection of critical 
habitat through agreements, laws, permits and effective 
enforcement using the federal-provincial framework.  In addition, 
other elements of equivalency would be established and negotiated 
on a species by species basis, utilizing the framework of the 
national accord for the protection of species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to prove that the government is clearly not committed 
to co-operative federalism.  When I went to Calgary for the 
announcement of the government's position paper in December, I 
contacted the hon. Gary Mar, who is a very learned environment 
minister in this country.  Government officials never took the 
courtesy to contact Minister Mar to let him know that the federal 
government was making the announcement on the position paper at 
the Calgary zoo.  In fact, no members of parliament from Alberta 
took the courtesy to inform Minister Mar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to build co-operative federalism, if it 
wants to work with its provincial partners, it should have at 
least let the provincial ministers know when the position paper 
was coming out and given them a political heads up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the bill was a chance for the Liberal government to 
improve its poor environmental record.  It was another chance for 
the Prime Minister to improve his poor, dismal environmental 
record.  Perhaps the only thing more endangered than the 351 
species at risk on the endangered species list is the 
government's environmental record.  Bill C-33 indicates that the 
environment is still a low priority for the government.  In fact, 
I might add that it is not even on the radar screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate, the Liberal Party has now been in government for 
seven years and has yet to pass one piece of environmental 
legislation of its own. 
Last year it pushed through amendments to the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, revisions that were also widely 
criticized for their key weaknesses.  While the original CEPA 
introduced by the Progressive Conservative Party was a pioneering 
bill, the revised edition contained modest improvements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good example to show what a good environmental record 
is.  It was our party when we were in government that negotiated 
an acid rain protocol with the Americans.  It was our party that 
delivered the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It was our 
party that led the world community in developing the Montreal 
protocol on ozone depleting gases.  It was our party that 
actually helped to make our landfill sites even more 
environmentally friendly with the national packaging protocol. We 
worked with industry in a co-operative fashion.  In contrast, in 
seven years the Liberal Party has had no bills of its own from 
the legislative framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our environmental record is solid, this bill fails to even 
live up to the government's promise in the throne speech. It 
promised legislation to ensure that species at risk and their 
critical natural habitat are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the good news here?  The good news is that the federal 
government is finally introducing long overdue endangered species 
legislation.  The bad news is that the rest of the bill does not 
have very many positive things in terms of protecting species at 
risk, especially in relation to stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 attempts to recognize the need to encourage and reward 
stewardship.  However the funding provided, about $10 million to 
$15 million a year, is only a fraction of what is needed to help 
recover existing species at risk, which is about $50 million a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the tax and spend Liberals do not know what incentives 
are. Tax incentives could be brought forth which would actually 
help stewardship.  They would help the stewards of our land, the 
farmers and woodlot owners, in terms of actually encouraging 
their positive behaviour through their own goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that Bill C-33 
should not be another Kyoto where the provinces are forced to 
implement a plan imposed on them by the federal government.  The 
provinces should be provided with sufficient resources to address 
recovery plans and ensure effective enforcement.  In order for 
this legislation to work, the federal government must work 
co-operatively with all stakeholders, the provinces, private 
landowners, industry and environmentalists alike, to ensure that 
no single party bears the burden of the recovery on its own when 
there is a clear shared reward for species recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finding endangered species on one's land should not mean that 
all development stops.  The key is to manage the lands to ensure 
that the species can continue to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to those rare cases where protecting endangered 
species could impose costs on the landowner, the government 
should provide direct financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking with the hon. member for Lethbridge about this 
issue a while ago.  One weakness is that the bill is too vague. 
It is not clear and it breeds more anxiety about the compensatory 
regime that is going to be required to reward positive 
stewardship to protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that when designing 
the recovery plan with stakeholders, social and economic 
considerations must be accounted for and a balance can be 
achieved that both encourages stewardship and saves endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bill C-33 does not use Canada's existing endangered 
species list as an initial list for this new act, even though the 
1996 bill did.  The government is going backward.  A better 
approach would be to start with the existing COSEWIC list and 
then allow future changes if necessary, as was done in the 1996 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to move an amendment. This 
is my rationale.  When the bill was tabled in the House of 
Commons in April, the minister warned that if the committee made 
changes, the bill would meet a similar fate to the previous one 
which died on the order paper three years ago. It was reported in 
the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> on April 12 that the minister said, 
“If you destabilize this legislation, it is probably gone, just 
as the previous legislation was gone”.  With these threats, the 
minister is effectively telling the committee not to do its job. 
The minister is insulting the democratic process of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to take the bill back and listen to the 
stakeholders who have come up with a collaborative and workable 
compromise. 
I might add they are very close to reaching a very workable 
compromise.  Listen to the Mining Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Nature Federation, the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association, the private woodlot owners, the farming community, 
the Sierra Club and ranchers alike.  Canadians want a bill that 
works.  This bill will not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have already been told by speakers preceding me, Canadians 
are placing high expectations on the government to protect 
endangered species habitat.  We must deliver.  This bill if 
strengthened could provide a fine legacy if it were effective in 
preserving Canada's rich nature heritage. The survival and 
protection of endangered species is one way of turning words into 
action when we speak about leaving a legacy, about what we owe to 
future generations and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing an emergency as has already been indicated by the 
hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. I have been told 
that over the last year the list of endangered wildlife in Canada 
has grown from 340 to 353. I have been told also that a 
comprehensive and complete list would have to consist of 
thousands of species because many categories of Canada's wildlife 
have not yet been assessed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33, the species at risk act, is intended to put an end to 
the loss of our rich natural heritage.  Can this bill reverse 
this trend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to scientists, the loss of habitat is responsible for 
over 80% of species decline.  Therefore the only way to stop the 
tide of extinction is to protect the habitat of endangered 
species.  Canadians know this.  In fact, there are many people 
already working to protect endangered species habitat through 
various conservation projects across the country. Moreover, 91% 
of Canadians recently asked said they believe a law to protect 
endangered species should ensure that habitat is protected.  This 
level of support is consistent across the country among both 
rural and urban Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in recognition of the conservation efforts of 
individual Canadians, communities and organizations, will provide 
$90 million over the next three years to fund conservation 
initiatives.  This is a major step forward.  The provisions in 
the bill aimed at offering a safety net should provinces fail to 
act are also encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill prescribes in detail what measures must be 
included in the recovery strategy in order to ensure that all 
threats to the survival of the species are addressed.  However, 
because Canadians strongly support the role of scientists and 
because Canadians believe in legislation that will protect 
endangered species habitat, we must make sure that the bill 
reaches these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the bill in its current form falls short of 
reaching these objectives.  Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may recall that last year 640 prominent Canadian 
scientists signed a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to 
introduce an effective endangered species bill.  First, they 
urged that the listing of endangered species be transparent, 
science based and free from political interference.  Second, they 
urged that the critical wildlife habitat of endangered species be 
protected wherever it occurred.  Unfortunately, these two 
elements are missing in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bill C-33 is now drafted, the onus is on the minister to 
convince cabinet of the desirability of establishing the list of 
wildlife species at risk.  The minister must do so for species 
that have already been scientifically determined as endangered. 
This approach is not satisfactory as demonstrated by provincial 
data and experience.  Only in Nova Scotia does the scientific 
list of species automatically receive official protection under 
its laws.  Some argue that political responsibility is needed at 
the listing stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-33 already allows ample political discretion on how and 
whether to save an endangered species, from the establishment of 
a recovery strategy to action plans and through the issuance of 
agreements and permits.  Still, should the government of the day 
decide not to save a species, there are provisions in the bill 
allowing the competent minister not to act.  I am referring to 
clause 41(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem pointed out by Canadian scientists relates to 
habitat protection.  As currently proposed in the bill, 
prohibitions against destroying the critical habitat of an 
endangered species will only apply where specified by the entire 
cabinet.  I refer to clauses 59 and 61.  Imagine the entire 
cabinet having to determine the extent of the critical habitat 
required, for instance by the maritime ringlet butterfly.  The 
minister alone does not have the authority to pass regulations 
required to protect the critical habitat.  Again they are left to 
the discretion of the entire cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the recovery strategy.  Under the bill three 
competent ministers are required to develop a recovery strategy 
for listed species, including action plans.  However, the strategy on 
paper will not be adequate to protect the habitat of endangered 
species.  When implementing a strategy, one of the three 
competent ministers may make regulations only with respect to 
one, aquatic species, two, species of birds protected by the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act, and three, species on federal 
lands.  I refer to clause 53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to critical habitat, regulations within federal 
jurisdiction will become the domain of the entire cabinet.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good reasons to fear that the minister responsible will be 
so busy pleading with cabinet for every measure he or she wishes 
to implement that serious delays in protecting the species will 
become inevitable, delays we cannot afford because without prompt 
action extinction will be the fate of endangered species. However 
a good bill will make sure habitat is protected before it is too 
late.  Therefore I would like to make four suggestions in 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there should be one and only one final list of endangered 
species, the scientific list.  Second, within federal 
jurisdiction critical habitat protection should be made 
mandatory, to which other speakers have already referred.  Third, 
the minister responsible and only the minister responsible should 
be given power to pass regulations to protect critical habitat. 
Fourth, the federal government should promptly provide an 
adequate safety net in case a province fails to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen, without improvements this legislation will not 
stem the perpetual slide toward extinction of Canada's endangered 
species.  If improved, this bill will offer great potential for 
thoughtful stewardship of our land and wildlife.  It is my hope 
our legislative process in committee will be flexible enough so 
as to allow for necessary changes to strengthen the bill.  It 
could become the cornerstone of the federal government's 
comprehensive approach for protecting endangered species in 
Canada on behalf of all Canadians and in conformity with our 
international commitments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the hon. member's comment that there should be one list and it 
should be a scientific list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example and get his comments on it.  I 
just went with the Gwich'in, the first nation people of Yukon and 
Alaska, to Washington to lobby with them to get protection for 
the calving grounds of the porcupine caribou herd.  The people of 
Canada depend on that herd yet they calve on the Arctic coast in 
Alaska.  Canada has protected its side but the U.S. has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a people who are working to protect the habit of the 
caribou herd on which historically for over 20,000 years they 
have depended.  They have been lobbying for 20 years but year by 
year the oil drilling creeps closer and closer to the actual 
calving grounds of that herd.  Without that habitat protection 
the herd will become extinct, and the Gwich'in people who have 
depended on that single herd for thousands of years will 
themselves become extinct.  I would like the member to make some 
comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Yukon has outlined the issue very well.  There is not much I can 
add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all familiar with the issue of the porcupine caribou herd 
which moves across the border between Canada and the United 
States into the north slope.  That issue has been with us for 
several decades with changing portions, so to say.  In part the 
future of that herd will depend on the determination of the two 
governments to control and possibly discourage the exploitation 
of petroleum and other sources of fossil fuels in the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was at a time of high oil prices tremendous pressure to 
develop the Arctic petroleum resources a way up north, even north 
of Tuktoyaktuk.  At that time, I am referring to the early 
eighties, the Government of Canada made representations to 
Washington in order to protect the porcupine caribou herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well be that representations are again needed.  I would 
encourage the hon. member to make her presentations on the 
occasion of the Parliamentary Arctic Council meeting which will 
take place next August in Rovaniemi, Finland.  That is a very 
appropriate parliamentary forum in which representations of this 
kind can be made.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the leader of the Canadian delegation, the member

the hon. member for Yukon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member has heard of and supports a 
policy called shoot, shovel and shut up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, as a result of its endangered species 
legislation, people are punished for somehow changing habitats. 
As a result many ranchers and farmers in the United States have 
gone on a process of what they call shoot, shovel and shut up. 
They get rid of the animals before the authorities can find out 
about them because there is no incentive structure whatsoever, 
just punishment.  In other words, there are only sticks and no 
carrots for preserving these animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member intend to put forward a shoot, shovel and 
shut up policy in Canada and wind up with his incentives 
encouraging Canadian ranchers and farmers to get rid of the 
animals rather than providing incentives or carrots rather than 
sticks in terms of dealing with endangered species? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member for 
Calgary West had taken the trouble to read the legislation we are 
debating this afternoon, he would not have asked that silly 
question.  That is certainly not the intent of the legislation at 
all.  As he is raising this question I would have to urge him to 
read Bill C-33 before he starts spreading fears among his 
constituents that are totally unfounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that the bill as presented refrains 
entirely from adopting the American model.  Therefore the system 
of carrots and a carefully balanced legislation has been devised 
and developed by the Minister of the Environment.  In addition 
the hon. member should know that an allocation of some $90 
million has been made to stewardship for the next three years, 
which will then be followed by an allocation of $45 million every 
year in order to encourage stewardship initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, there is no intention whatsoever to adopt a shoot, 
shovel and shut up approach.  That is the American approach.  The 
Canadian approach will be very thoughtful and hopefully very 
effective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to be a member 
of the government that is introducing endangered species 
legislation in the House.  It is a pleasure as well to debate the 
proposed legislation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bringing in the legislation the government is responding to 
its own stated priorities as outlined in our red book and as 
included in the throne speech and in our international 
commitments.  Likewise, we are aware that there is overwhelming 
support from Canadians from coast to coast for strong federal 
legislation to protect endangered species in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing they recognize perhaps that Canada has stood alone 
from its American and Mexican neighbours in not having this 
legislation.  This is more than an exercise in comparative 
politics since 70% of Canada's species at risk are shared with 
those two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pressing the government for strong endangered species 
legislation, Canadians are reflecting their general concern for 
environmental issues and are demanding that governments at all 
levels respond to their concerns and make environmental 
priorities synonymous with government priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all environmental concerns, Canadians place endangered 
species legislation as number one. 
More Canadians have written to us on this issue than on any other 
environmental issue combined.  They demand a courageous and 
assertive response from us to protect species much threatened by 
the infringement of urbanization and expansive economic growth. 
While they recognize the need to balance the other dimensions 
which are inherent in well developed government action, they will 
not be satisfied with half measures and will be unrelenting in 
their judgment of what they perceive to be half measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls are indeed a helpful tool in asserting Canadian views and 
priorities, but nothing compares with spending the day listening 
to our constituents and having them tell us exactly what they are 
thinking.  Friday of a week ago gave me just such an opportunity 
as most Fridays do.  Not only did I escape the rarefied air of 
our fair capital, but I escaped as well the sometimes constrained 
atmosphere of my constituency office to meet with grade 5 
students at Portage View Public School in the morning and with 
grade 8 students at Maple Grove Public School in the afternoon. 
Both schools are in Barrie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about our environment.  We talked about SARA.  More 
than all the details of protecting endangered species and their 
habitats that we discussed, what I heard most in their voices and 
saw most on their faces was the trust they had placed in me to 
look after their future, to guarantee that their future would be 
one where the wildlife and the biodiversity necessary to sustain 
that wildlife would be ensured by a government that had been true 
to its word, by a government that had taken all the necessary 
legislative steps to ensure that our precious species, nature's 
heritage to us, would not be driven to extinction but would be 
protected and thus thrive for future generations and future 
times.  There is nothing like the faces of children to remind us 
what our real priorities are and of the commitments we are bound 
to fulfil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us an environmental bill that has much to commend 
it.  Vital to this or any act that has as its purpose the 
protection of species at risk is the listing agency and the 
listing process.  The Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada, known by its acronym COSEWIC, is a national 
scientific committee that has been operating for 20 years and has 
developed an international reputation as a credible, objective 
scientific body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will provide the legal basis for COSEWIC and 
it will continue to operate at arm's length from government. This 
is essential and it will allow us to continue what we have been 
doing right in Canada, which is executing an excellent listing 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks ago COSEWIC increased the number of entries on 
its list of endangered species or species at risk of extinction 
from 340 to 353.  There is no doubt that the long wait for 
legislation at the provincial and federal levels has seen the 
situation become critical, which compels us to act promptly but 
with legislation that clearly meets the bar.  The listing process 
will be key to that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act includes two other components among many which are 
worth our attention and approbation.  The government strategy 
will emphasize stewardship and will provide compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stewardship program will include agreements among 
landowners, managers and governments in the implementation of 
species recovery plans.  It will include private land acquisition 
programs to purchase land for species habitat and provide 
economic incentives for better land management.  Our stewardship 
approach will help conserve wildlife species not at risk to 
prevent them from becoming so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed SARA provides compensation for individual 
landowners in the event that protection of a species critical 
habitat significantly restricts the use of one's land. 
Compensation differs from stewardship incentives since it would 
only be considered when stewardship and other safety measures 
have been insufficient to protect critical habitat and therefore 
where the critical habitat safety net is required.  It is 
important to note that compensation should not exceed the value 
of incentives that were made available through stewardship 
programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many aspects to this bill that deserve our attention 
but it is not possible to discuss all of them today. As a newly 
returned member of the environment committee, I am anticipating 
the opportunity to do just that at committee hearings and to 
learn at that time the views and concerns of witnesses who will 
meet with us to discuss this vital piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears noting however at this opportunity for opening debate 
that many well informed and discerning groups have already 
studied the legislation at its draft stages and lent us the 
benefits of their experience and analysis.  I make particular 
reference to the species at risk working group's paper that 
entails the composite wisdom of a somewhat disparate and eclectic 
alliance encompassing, as it does, members of the Canadian Nature 
Federation, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the Mining 
Association, the National Agriculture Environment Committee, the 
Canadian Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club of Canada. I am 
impressed when I see un mélange comme ca work together and 
develop common ground.  It is I believe exactly the kind of 
commonality that will make or break the success of this bill. 
Unfortunately I have concerns when I read that they too have 
concerns that the bill does not go as far as they recommended, 
especially when I consider that they often proceeded from very 
different vantage points and still came to an agreement as to 
what this new legislation must incorporate to protect Canada's 
species at risk. Their contention appears to be that we might 
need to go further than what is currently under consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group strongly supports scientific listing of 
species at risk rather than the cabinet approval process outlined 
in the bill.  It recommends that the existing COSEWIC list be 
recognized as the initial list of species at risk. The act 
recently passed by the Nova Scotia government includes both of 
those recommendations.  The group is concerned that there is no 
proposed compensation for communities of workers who may be 
displaced as a result of actions to protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I, like all of us engaged in the public policy making 
process, realize that the fruits of the consultative process 
cannot meet the criteria of each and every interested group or 
party, still one considers carefully the advice of such a group 
representing as it does both industry and environmental persons 
and interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, if I may return to the initial bar which I set for 
myself, to listen carefully to the next generation who have 
entrusted us to ensure the survival of their wildlife, I believe 
it is incumbent on us to listen carefully to all such thoughtful 
wisdom and, as the committee studying this proposed legislation, 
to ensure that we are accessible by what means are available to 
us to the people and places requisite to this very vital piece of 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
two questions for my hon. colleague.  I was a bit concerned when 
she mentioned a couple of times the necessity to have a 
compensatory regime.  One of the things bothering landowners, 
woodlot owners and farmers across the country is the government's 
commitment to developing a good stewardship, compensatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member square with what the minister said on 
September 23, 1999 as reported in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>?  The 
minister said “Responsible behaviour is something we expect, not 
something we need to buy”.  Could my colleague comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I have is, why would she not support an 
amendment at the committee stage for a legal scientific listing 
as opposed to a discretionary regime left to cabinet?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to the 
minister's statement in mid-1999, that he did not believe there 
needed to be a compulsory factor to legislation such as SARA, I 
made reference to an ongoing consultative process.  For ministers 
who are new to their positions, as well as backbenchers who are 
part of the process, we sometimes begin from a certain vantage 
point and as we consult with Canadians and take into account what 
they say, we are open to maybe adjusting our original premises 
and do not want to appear rigid nor indeed to be rigid.  If there 
has been movement on the part of the government, as represented 
by the Minister of the Environment, that shows a flexibility and 
not a retro approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the second question as to whether or not I was in 
favour of an amendment at committee, in all honesty, I do not 
believe I was a member of the committee when that amendment was 
put forward, but I am open to be corrected in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Davenport also talked about the listing 
process and the fact that it should be a scientific process. I 
believe that is something we all agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not quite understand what the member for 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford is proposing.  Once the list is 
established, who then would be responsible for the funds that 
would be applied to a project to protect an endangered species? 
Is the member suggesting that the COSEWIC group be responsible 
for allocating dollars toward a specific project? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my statements with 
regard to listing pertain to the recommendations that were made 
by the species at risk working group.  This group recommended 
that the listing process be under the control of the scientific 
community. Its suggestion was not that it be left to the 
political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not make reference within my opening remarks today to the 
funding or the appropriate resources and infrastructure that 
will be required to accomplish the protection of that species.  I 
have no difficulty with our role as a government to be pivotal in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the recommendation that the listing be left to 
those who have studied and are learned in the process is where it 
should most likely be left.  To put together the kind of program 
that is necessary once the scientific community has triggered the 
government is very much within the purview of government to make 
an assessment of how best to move forward and to do so within the 
costs that will entail.  The listing itself is a different 
process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-33. 
It was an issue that was on the table during the last election 
campaign in 1997 and it has now finally been tabled.  It is much 
needed and it is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to some of the earlier debate, it seems that most 
people are concerned with what is in the bill but for very 
different reasons.  We in the Canadian Alliance are concerned 
with some of the things in the legislation, and I will try to 
outline some of those in my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After many years and almost as many cabinet ministers, it gives 
me great pleasure to finally be able to speak to legislation 
protecting species at risk in Canada.  I want to stress how 
important wildlife and nature is to Canadians and the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value nature for many different reasons. In the past 
many of our forefathers depended on nature for their very 
survival.  Today we value wildlife for different reasons. 
Economic dependence has been largely replaced by the view that 
wildlife should be treasured for its own inherent worth.  The 
affluence of our society is reflected in the 1996 nature survey 
which found that Canadians and visitors to Canada spent $11.7 
billion on nature related pursuits in that year alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wild species are an integral part of our heritage and our 
identity and attract tourists from around the globe.  Indeed, we 
as humans are dependent on the diversity of species on earth for 
our own survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance recognizes this significance in its policy 
declaration, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to protecting and preserving Canada's natural 
environment and endangered species, and to sustainable 
development of our abundant natural resources for the use of 
current and future generations.  Therefore, we will strike a 
balance between environmental preservation and economic 
development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that critical balance that is the only odd issue out in 
many of the debates from both sides of the House.  It is how that 
balance will be created and how it will be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in its last attempt to introduce endangered 
species legislation, the Liberal government failed to find this 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private property rights were a major concern in the last bill, 
Bill C-65, which completely ignored the rights of landowners.  It 
was a heavyhanded bill that relied on government regulation 
instead of co-operation with landowners to protect species.  Due 
in part to the efforts of Reform MPs at the time, the bill never 
passed.  This was the bill referred to earlier as being similar 
to the one developed in the United States which has not worked, 
uses a heavyhanded approach and does 
exactly the opposite for endangered species than what it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance recognizes that landowners are an integral 
part of the species at risk equation and, at its founding policy 
convention earlier this year, the Alliance recognized and 
affirmed the historic common law right to ownership and enjoyment 
of private property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1997 election, Canadian Alliance MPs have been 
advocating the creation of responsible endangered species 
legislation that seeks out co-operation not confrontation, and 
compensation not confiscation in an effort to protect species at 
risk.  Not surprisingly, the government did not share this view 
and it shows in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble of the bill begins innocently enough, recognizing 
the need for co-operation among various orders of government and 
encouraging the stewardship efforts of individual Canadians, but 
quickly becomes clear that it actually relies more on a heavy 
hand than on a helping hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of private property rights and compensation, the 
true environmentalists and the true stewards in this country are 
the people who deal on a daily basis with the land:  our 
ranchers, our farmers, our natural resource people, people who 
enjoy the outdoors and realize that nature is as beautiful and as 
fragile as it is.  No one knows more about the fragile aspect of 
our environment than the people who are on the land every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at compensation, considering that this is a key 
concern for landowners, it is disappointing that the government 
has only chosen to pay lip service to compensate landowners.  In 
clause 64, it states that “the minister may”, not must, “pay 
compensation to any person for losses suffered as a result of any 
extraordinary impact that this legislation may create”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier from the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar 
that he was concerned that our party was not dealing with the 
full facts when we talked to landowners and property owners. I 
would like to ask if it is possible for him to go forward and say 
to them that there is nothing in this legislation that they must 
fear and nothing in Bill C-33 that would affect their livelihood. 
We cannot do that because there are things in here that are of 
major concern to Canadians.  We need to be diligent in dealing 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no details as to how this compensation will be paid 
out, only a nebulous reference to a provision which grants the 
governor in council authority to make the necessary regulations. 
That in itself leaves a lot of concern in the minds of Canadians. 
If there is going to be compensation, it should be defined 
exactly how that is going to take place.  The government says 
that will be in the regulations but it is something that should 
be in this bill.  If it was in the bill then we could have a look 
at it and look at it in a favourable way.  If it is market value 
and if it will help people when their land is expropriated or 
taken away, that is something we could consider.  The way the 
bill is structured now, we cannot support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedures to be followed when claiming compensation must be 
determined, the methods used to determine eligibility of a person 
for compensation and the terms and conditions for the payment all 
need to be mapped out. 
Again I say there is absolutely no reference to fair market value 
anywhere in the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of compensation has been the single biggest barrier to 
the success of the endangered species act in the United States. 
The problem with the U.S. ESA boils down to the fact that it 
creates a perverse incentive for landowners to view species at 
risk on their properties as a liability.  That is exactly what we 
have to avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot put legislation in place that will in any way be 
defined or looked at as causing an endangered species to be a 
liability.  We have to structure it in a way that makes it 
exactly the opposite.  If the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
finds that there is an endangered species on one's land, one 
cannot in any way alter the land and there is no compensation. It 
is not surprising to observe how landowners have responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can Canada learn from the American experience with regard 
to compensation?  Clearly fair and just compensation is essential 
to ensure the success of any legislation.  Landowners must not 
see wildlife on their properties as a liability.  It must be 
viewed as exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation will assist the government in securing the 
co-operation of landowners in fostering a climate of co-operation 
that will enable private associations to continue on in their 
work.  Many organizations have been very successful in working 
with landowners to conserve natural habitats and depend upon the 
continuing good will of landowners to be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Alberta Fish and Game Association and Operation 
Burrowing Owl.  Last summer it was my pleasure to go up to Brooks 
on a tour with the member for Medicine Hat.  The eastern 
irrigation district invited us to go.  Tom Livingston, a member 
of the board, and some of his staff took us out and showed us the 
burrowing owl's tremendous wetland that has been developed all of 
their own will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very impressive.  The land is grazed.  It has oil 
exploration and production on it.  The land close by is actively 
farmed.  All these things are going on at the same time that 
burrowing owls are flourishing in this area.  They do it all 
because of their natural love of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Livingston explained to me that even travelling across the 
prairies in a vehicle, just driving across the grass at 10 or 12 
kilometres ruins one acre of grass.  They are very careful about 
how they drive on it and how they use it.  They manage it very 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ducks Unlimited is another organization with purchase and 
conservation agreements.  Nature Conservancy of Canada does a lot 
of good work and needs to be encouraged in stewardship roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation also forces the government to be accountable by 
taking into consideration the social and economic effects of its 
decisions.  That aspect of it alone is very key.  If we are to 
look at reclamation programs and the protection of habitat 
programs, we have to take into account the social and economic 
effects of any decisions to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern over private property rights extends into other 
sections of the bill.  When we look at property rights we must 
look at not only the possibility of losing one's land but at the 
possibility of people encroaching without just cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes up in the application for investigation.  Although 
the government wisely removed the civil suit provisions contained 
in Bill C-65, it retains a section in this bill which would allow 
any person to initiate an investigation by the government.  Any 
person could go to the government and say he or she suspects 
something is happening and an investigation would have to be 
started by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 95 requires the minister to report back to the applicant 
every 90 days during the investigative period with details of the 
investigation.  This provision is taken into account with clause 
90 which gives enforcement officers the right to enter on and 
pass through or over private property without being liable for 
trespassing.  Added to clause 34 which authorizes the federal 
government to extend its authorities over lands which are not 
federal lands in a province if the minister is of the opinion 
that the laws of the province are not strong enough to protect 
the species, a frightening scenario is created where the private 
landowner has very few resources at his or her disposal for 
protection against vexatious actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the concerns we hear from landowners and 
people in the resource sector.  When these concerns come forward 
they are legitimate.  They have a legitimate concern that their 
lands are in jeopardy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of the things we would like to see 
proposed.  The Canadian Alliance rejects the type of heavy handed 
approach in this bill.  In the little time I have left today and 
in the debates that lie ahead of us I will outline how we will 
hold protected species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most Canadians we have always supported the development of 
endangered species legislation, but we know that in order for it 
to be successful it must respect the fundamental rights of 
property owners.  We believe that co-operation and not 
confrontation will achieve the greatest results.  We also believe 
that governments must be accountable for their actions.  To this 
end we believe that the final listing decision should remain with 
parliament.  It alone has a democratic mandate to balance the 
competing interests of economic and environmental needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the key.  If we have a fully scientific body that does 
the listing, we must have the accountability of parliament to 
recognize that list and to enact any actions that are deemed 
necessary to protect endangered species.  We cannot take 
parliamentary accountability out of the equation or it gets into 
a whole other area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another opportunity I had a little over a year ago was to tour 
the old growth forest on the west coast with some people who took 
us there for two or three days.  We flew in helicopters and had a 
look at the logging practices going on there that  are 
environmentally sensitive.  We saw some of the changes that had 
been made and some of the practices to protect endangered 
species, to protect the land itself from erosion and to protect 
the watersheds.  The industry is more aware of what needs to be 
done.  It is working hard toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see new coalitions being developed with environmental groups, 
industry and land users coming together to try to find a solution 
to this problem.  The legislation put forward by the government 
has to be such that it encourages that co-operation and that it 
brings these people together in a way that will truly help 
protect endangered species and our environment in a very 
substantial way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we include all the stakeholders in the process then we can 
come up with some meaningful legislation, not only in the 
endangered species area but in all environmental issues, to make 
the country sustainable in the long run and to preserve what we 
have for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There are three minutes remaining in 
the day's proceedings.  Does the hon. member for North York want 
to call it 6.41 p.m. and avoid cutting up her time?  I would be 
happy to recognize the hon. member, but she will get only three 
minutes and then she will have another seven or seventeen, as the 
case may be, the next time the bill comes before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as long as I can be 
assured of my opportunity to speak on this very important 
legislation, I would be happy to call it 6.41 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed?

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
May 16 when I rose in the House of Commons to ask the Minister of 
Health how many more lives would have to be lost because of drug 
overdoses before his government took action, the minister 
professed to be very concerned and he responded that he would 
address this “complex and tragic problem”.  He said if I had 
specific suggestions he would be happy to receive them.  Well, I 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I sent the Minister of Health a very detailed letter on 
April 13 outlining precisely what needs to be done to make our 
community safer.  I have done a lot of research and spoken with 
many community members to determine what needs to be done to 
lower the crime rate and to help injection drug users regain 
their sense of dignity and health. I subsequently wrote the 
Minister of Health on May 19 and asked for a meeting to which I 
hope he will agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know unequivocally if the Minister of Health is 
prepared to implement the array of recommendations put to him by 
numerous medical and scientific experts and reports to help this 
community come to grips with this devastating crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the drug resource centre is a very necessary step, it is 
simply not enough.  If the minister is serious, as I am, in 
reducing the incredible harm to individuals and the community as 
a whole, then he must be willing to take comprehensive action 
that must include education, better treatment, expanded 
methadone, programs for drug maintenance, safe injection sites 
and housing and social supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the minister knows the facts.  I believe he knows in 
his heart what needs to be done medically in his department.  The 
question is, does he have the political will to act on the 
irrefutable evidence he has?  What is the minister's response?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
question the hon. member has asked concerning the serious 
situation in Vancouver's downtown east side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. member that the purpose of the 
Canada's Drug Strategy is to reduce the ill effects of alcohol 
and other drugs.  In addition, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and 
the hepatitis C disease prevention, community-based support and 
research program are working with injection drug users, and the 
organizations providing them with support, to prevent the 
transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal-provincial-territorial committees representing the drug 
industry, the HIV/AIDS community, correctional services, justice, 
and public health have pinpointed injection drugs as a priority 
problem.  These committees are working together to determine the 
best ways of addressing this situation in Canada in a 
co-ordinated and multi-jurisdictional manner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has contributed to the development of a resource 
centre for drug users in Vancouver's downtown east side and is 
participating in a partnership under the Vancouver agreement 
among all three levels of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada will also be providing support to the Downtown 
Eastside Women's Centre and to community activities with a 
particular emphasis on aboriginal women who are at risk of 
contracting HIV and those who have AIDS. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to what has been done in Europe, I wish to assure 
the House that Health Canada is looking at the experiences of 
other countries in order to consider the possibility of applying 
their conclusions to the Canadian context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Health Canada will continue to encourage, 
facilitate and increase public participation in a dialogue based 
on objective information concerning the best ways of addressing 
this health problem and serious social issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am on my feet again on the hepatitis C issue.  It is 
an issue that simply will not go away.  Obviously the reason it 
will not go away is because the government has failed to deal 
with it in a manner that would be acceptable to Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am speaking of is the settlement with our hepatitis C 
victims.  Not one nickel of compensation has been received by the 
victims.  It is hard to believe.  It has been going on two years 
since the settlement was reached and not one victim has received 
a nickel.  The only people who have received compensation are the 
lawyers for the federal government.  I know members find that 
hard to believe, but only the lawyers for the federal government 
have received payment.  My question to the minister a number of 
weeks ago was why?  Why can the government not resolve this 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the parallels I drew that day is that the province of 
Ontario has again compensated those victims left outside the 
package. The package the federal government announced leaves out 
the victims prior to 1986 and after 1991. The premier of Ontario, 
although he comes under criticism from the House from time to 
time, had the courage to stand up and say, “Listen, we are going 
to compensate those victims regardless of when they became 
infected.  They deserve compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government opposite has not compensated one victim. 
The only people who have received compensation from the Liberal 
government are the lawyers representing the federal government in 
the suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party are asking the 
government to move on this issue and compensate the victims. 
Canadians want them to be compensated because they truly are 
victims.  We want some action on the part of the federal 
government.  The issue has dragged on now for a number of years. 
It has been two years since the compensation scheme was 
announced.  People are still on the outside looking in.  They 
need help.  We want action.  Will the government move on this 
issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has committed 
approximately $1.4 billion to compensate and assist those 
infected with hepatitis C through the blood supply system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this amount, our government has already spent $875 million in 
order to meet its financial obligations to victims under the 
1986-1990 hepatitis C settlement agreement.  Under this agreement, 
which was approved by the courts, we have probably succeeded in 
avoiding ten years of litigation.  An independent administrator 
was appointed by the courts.  A process for handling 
applications has been put in place and applicants' cheques 
should soon be issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in the case of those infected before 1986 and after 
1990, the government has agreed to pay some $525 million towards 
care, rather than in hard cash.  For it is care that people are 
greatly in need of when they are sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consulted people throughout Canada.  We listened to what they 
had to say and we took action accordingly, putting $50 million 
into hepatitis C research and the creation of community support 
programs.  We have also set aside $125 million for improved 
safety and monitoring of the blood supply system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add that an important component of our 
contribution is an agreement with the provinces and territories 
to pay half the costs, up to $50 million, to identify and notify 
all individuals who have been infected with hepatitis C through 
the blood system so they can receive the care and treatment they 
need.  We have offered a $300 million transfer to the provinces 
and territories.  Our plan is sensible, it provides the care that 
people living with hepatitis C need and it is a compassionate 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
