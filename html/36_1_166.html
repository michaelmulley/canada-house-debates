</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.)</B> moved the second reading of, and concurrence in, 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-25, an act to amend the 
National Defence Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am going to keep this very brief.  Bill 
C-25, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, has returned to the House 
with an amendment from the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 was first introduced in the House a year ago today. 
On behalf of the government and the men and women of the 
Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces, I would 
like to commend the Senators for their thorough review of the 
issues in Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a key element in the program of comprehensive change 
for both the department and the forces and is much anticipated by 
the men and women in those organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has proposed one change to clause 96 of Bill C-25. 
Clause 96 provides for a review of the provisions and operation 
of the bill within five years, and the tabling of a report of the 
review before each House of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment made by the Senate changes the requirement for a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it an opportune time to rise to address Bill C-25 and the 
amendment proposed by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, this is the first time the National 
Defence Act has been amended since 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an opportunity for the government to put forward important 
changes which would allow the Department of National Defence to 
shore up its solid foundation as one of Canada's most important 
institutions.  The Canadian forces, after all, when all is said 
and done, are charged with protecting Canada's sovereignty and, 
by extension, Canadians' freedom.  Unfortunately, the government 
is about to squander yet another opportunity to do good by the 
Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is largely a housekeeping bill.  It does nothing to 
address the systemic problems in the military justice system.  It 
does nothing to address the larger concerns of the Somalia 
inquiry.  There will be no inspector general.  There will be 
little independent oversight of the operations of the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces have been subjected to decades of neglect at 
the hands of this Liberal government and former Liberal 
governments.  Chronic underfunding, equipment shortages, 
excessive bureaucratization, political correctness and a decaying 
military justice system have all played a role in undermining 
this proud institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into detail on these matters today, but I would 
like to urge the members of the House or anyone listening to this 
debate to read the official opposition's minority report in 
response to the SCONDVA report on the quality of life in the 
military.  Our position on these matters is outlined there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is opposed to Bill C-25 because it does 
not deal with any substantive problems that the Canadian forces 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is an unfortunate waste of opportunity to set an 
agenda for renewal for the Canadian forces.  The amendment sent 
from the other place is fine.  The trouble is that the bill as a 
whole is flawed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the bill was 
introduced, the Bloc Quebecois opposed it for a number of 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason was that the bill did not seem to improve the 
situation sufficiently to ensure the rights of the military 
would be protected before the courts, especially as regards 
summary proceedings before military tribunals and court 
martials.  For example, a member of the armed forces had only 24 
hours to decide between a summary proceeding or a court martial. 
He could only consult a lawyer. He could not have one present 
at his trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things remain in the bill and are unchanged by the 
amendment.  Human rights in the military are, in our opinion, 
largely ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another example this week.  I read in the paper that a 
serviceman was taken to military court for refusing an anthrax 
vaccination.  It that is what it means to respect human rights, 
we do not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand that more expeditious summary proceedings 
would be more commonly used in wartime.  We are not in wartime, 
however, and the military deserves better treatment when their 
rights are at issue.  This is particularly true in summary 
proceedings, when a serviceman is judged by a commanding 
officer, who is necessarily in a conflict of interest situation, 
because he has to judge one of his subordinates. 
He must discipline him, he must often pass judgment on his own 
decision concerning a soldier.  The situation may be one in 
which he himself was involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment does not resolve these situations.  All that 
today's amendment, which the government is prepared to pass, 
accomplishes is to increase the number of reports tabled in the 
House.  There will be more reports, which is admittedly already 
an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is talk of an independent report, but what that means is 
not defined.  Who will produce this independent report?  By whom 
would the authors be appointed?  By the department or by the 
government?  Here again, it might be produced by the government 
and not really be independent. 
Will there be any soldiers on the committee responsible for 
producing the report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no guarantee that the term independent will mean that 
there will be greater respect for the rights of the military 
when there occurs a contentious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, therefore, we are unable to support the 
amendment.  It does not correct the flaws we pointed out when 
the bill was introduced.  The Bloc Quebecois will therefore be 
voting against this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words about the Senate amendment to 
Bill C-25.  Our party supports the amendment, which is a very 
minor amendment to the bill.  However, even though we support the 
amendment, I want to say a few words about the Senate itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I object to a bill originating in the Senate or to 
the Senate amending a bill because people in the other place are 
not elected.  The time has come for parliamentary reform in terms 
of doing something about the Senate.  The Minister of National 
Defence is nodding his head and I agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, he is smiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I heard him nodding his head from 
this distance.  I heard the rattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are about to enter a new millennium we should have a more 
mature parliamentary system.  The Senate has been with us for a 
long time.  It was created many years ago as a very elitist 
institution to keep an eye on the commoners, the people in the 
House of Commons.  It comes from the House of Lords in the 
British parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest Angus Reid poll shows that 11% of Canadians support 
the existing Senate.  That is a very small number.  One reason 
people are cynical about the political process is because of the 
parliamentarians in this House.  As well, there are not many 
people who support the Liberals in the west. 
I know that the government House leader is a big fan of the 
Senate.  He wants to be appointed to the Senate someday, the 
happy hunting ground for retiring politicians.  This House has to 
take some leadership along with provincial legislatures and do 
something about getting rid of the other place.  Of course there 
is a debate in the country as to whether it should be abolished 
altogether or whether it should be reformed, elected or whatever.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last decade I have been involved in this issue for some 
time in terms of constitutional change.  We have seen a growing 
movement in the country of the number of people who actually want 
to abolish the Senate.  About 10 years ago it about 20% to 21%. 
In the last polls I have seen it is about 41%, and about 43% want 
to reform the Senate, elect it or change it in some way.  There 
is no consensus in how it should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member from Sarnia and I have started a national 
petition working together in a non-partisan way to try to 
mobilize the idea of straight abolition of the other place.  I 
think the time has come for that.  It is undemocratic, it is 
unelected, it is unaccountable, it costs almost $50 million a 
year and yet we sit here and tolerate the other place as an 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of ministers, and I do not want to quote names, said 
publicly in the past or privately that the Senate has to go.  The 
time has come to show some leadership as we enter the last year 
of this century in terms of a motion on that.  I wanted to make 
that point.  Often over the years when we debated a bill that 
originated in the Senate or was amended by the Senate had 
comments about the Senate itself, going back to the days of 
Stanley Knowles and even before that.  These comments are very 
relevant today. The government leader nods and I hope we will 
have some leadership in terms of democracy for the new millennium 
across the way, a millennium project for democracy and get rid of 
the Senate.  If the government House leader wants to put the 
motion right now I will certainly second it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to speak to this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is in favour of the amendment. However, my party 
remains opposed to the bill.  The bill addresses military justice 
and my party agrees with re-examining the issue that is long 
overdue.  Like everything this government does, no matter how 
noble it appears to be, all we have to do is scratch the surface 
and we will find there are always ulterior motives.  Those 
motives are generally to look good rather than to be good. Again 
today is one of those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing the issue of justice in the military is both 
important and urgent.  My party understands that if we are to do 
something at all it is worth doing right. Unfortunately while 
there are some interesting points in the bill it leaves far too 
much out and it does not address the real problems Canadian 
forces face today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What events brought us to this point?  I think all members are 
aware of the events that transpired as a result of other events 
in Somalia.  However, they are worth repeating. The Somalia 
inquiry was shut down for political and personal reasons early 
last year.  That is what brings us here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inquiry commissions are created because there is a public 
concern that needs to be addressed.  As elected officials to the 
House it is incumbent on all of us to take such matters very 
seriously.  It seems to me that if there a good enough reason to 
begin an inquiry commission then there is probably a good reason 
to complete an inquiry commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's fine military is dragged through the mud and still 
there is no resolution.  The government did not learn from these 
actions.  Last week the public complaints commission looking into 
RCMP behaviour at APEC was shut down because there is a question 
of whether it was biased.  The government should appoint an 
independent judicial inquiry that will get to the truth on that 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want the truth.  It is not interested in 
the truth.  Why?  Because the truth hurts.  We are not here 
because the government all of a sudden cares about justice in the 
military but because the government knows it made a mistake and 
now it wants to hide that mistake as well as possible.  It is not 
because the government all of a sudden cares about military 
justice.  The government shut down the Somalia public inquiry and 
the armed forces were left with no resolution.  The government 
not only hurt the people involved directly in the Somalia case 
when it shut down the inquiry, it hurt the entire Canadian 
forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much in the bill that my party agrees with.  The 
problem, however, is that when one tries to cover something up 
rather than address the real issue, as this government so often 
does, the result is often very inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, because the government introduced the bill for the 
wrong reasons, it does not go far enough in addressing the real 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government missed an excellent opportunity to instil new 
confidence in the military.  The government could have taken 
measures that would truly make a difference, measures that the 
Canadian public could point to and say the government listened, 
and they now have faith in the way the military operates, but the 
government did not listen.  Instead it shut down an inquiry and 
stifled debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Canadian public feels cheated, and justly so.  The 
government feels proud when it says it is fulfilling 80% of the 
recommendations of the Somalia inquiry.  I want to make two 
points on this not so great accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Somalia commission was cut short and so we do not 
know what the full recommendations would have been.  Second, 
while the government thinks 80% is something to brag about, my 
party's answer is that quality is much more important than 
quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry commissioner recommended that the judge 
advocate general be a civilian.  The government ignored that 
recommendation.  The Somalia inquiry commissioner recommended 
that an office of the inspector general be created.  The 
government ignored that recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party proposed in our election platform last year and we 
maintain today that creating the office of the inspector general 
would be the best way to make the military accountable and 
increase transparency to give the public more confidence in its 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed in our platform establishing an inspector general 
for the armed forces to act as an ombudsman to address concerns 
that cannot be dealt with in the routine chain of command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's response to the Somalia inquiry, a document 
that for one reason or another which my party has not yet figured out 
is called “A commitment to Change”, the government turns down 
the proposed inspector general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this minister convinced that the Department of National 
Defence does not need an independent inspector general when 
experts who have studied for months and made recommendations to 
this department tell him he does need an inspector general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence said the Canadian forces do not 
need someone looking over their shoulder.  He went on to say that 
the role of the inspector general is being fulfilled in other 
ways.  He mentions the grievance board made up of eminent 
Canadians.  He mentions the new ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister really thinks the role of the inspector general 
is being fulfilled in other ways, why does he react so violently 
when my party recommends such an office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if this grievance board and the ombudsman 
truly did the same thing as the inspector general, the minister 
would not be so quick to shut down the idea of inspector general 
by saying such a thing as the military does need someone looking 
over its shoulder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that the grievance board and the ombudsman do not do 
what an inspector general could do?  The way the bill would have 
it, these bodies have absolutely no teeth. They can make 
recommendations and the CDS can ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public has little reason not to believe the 
recommendations will be ignored.  The Canadian public is looking 
for a Canadian forces justice system that is fair and 
transparent.  The Canadian public needs such a thing if it is to 
continue supporting the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government squandered the opportunity when it 
refused to listen to the advice of its own commissioners and 
ignored their recommendation for an inspector general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not listen.  It does not hear.  It does not 
want an office with teeth, with real authority.  The government 
ignored the Somalia commissioner's recommendation and what my 
party cannot accept is the way the government picks and chooses 
what recommendations to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party wholeheartedly agrees with the need to change the 
military justice system.  The bill needs to go further to create 
real change.  We want people to know their military serves them 
and not itself. The bill fails to do that and the government has 
failed to do its job.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process we used to develop the Nunavut Court of Justice was 
revolutionary in our history because it involved Inuit. Inuit 
were able to express what kinds of systems they needed to handle 
conflicts and to work for peace and safe communities in the

our public government in Nunavut.  I learned from this process 
ways of bringing our time of silence to an end. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar sentiments were expressed by Ms. Nora Sanders, the 
deputy minister designate for Nunavut, who praised the open, 
respectful and meaningful way in which federal officials 
conducted the consultation process in respect of Bill C-57. They 
should be commended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of Bill C-57 also signals the commencement of a 
new phase in the partnership between the federal government and 
the people of Nunavut.  It is a concrete acknowledgement that 
reform of the criminal justice system in Nunavut now and in the 
future must be responsive to the needs and wishes of the people 
of Nunavut. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to announce that, when the Minister of Justice 
appeared before the standing committee last week, the Reform 
Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive Conservative Party 
indicated to her that they supported Bill C-57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all members of this House to support this bill, and 
thus help the people of Nunavut to realize their dream of 
establishing a single-level trial court before April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Bill C-57 was studied so thoroughly by the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, I have no 
intention of discussing the content of the bill in detail.  I 
would, however, like to go over its salient points, which bring 
out certain unique aspects of the Nunavut Court of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important characteristics of the Court of Justice is 
that, unlike judges in other jurisdictions, the judges of this 
court will be authorized to hear all cases.  An amendment to the 
Nunavut Act authorizes a judge in the Nunavut Court of Justice 
to exercise and perform all powers, duties and functions which 
any law in force in Nunavut confers upon a representative of the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments made to a specific part of the Criminal Code 
provide that a judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice has and may 
exercise and perform all the powers, duties and functions of any 
court or agent of the judicial authority prescribed in the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, a single judge of the Nunavut court of justice 
will be able to do in a remote locality what cannot be done 
anywhere else in Canada, that is to hear all matters on the 
docket of a given circuit court, from the most mundane to the 
most serious cases, in both adult and youth courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Territorial legislation will also enable judges to hear all 
cases, whether family or civil. I have no doubt that this 
characteristic of the new court will expedite trials and ensure 
speedier access to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point is that the bill confers on the Nunavut 
court of justice the jurisdiction of a superior court. Because 
of the demands associated with the administration of justice in 
Northern Canada, judges of the Nunavut court of justice will, of 
necessity, perform most of the functions and duties normally 
performed by other agents of the judicial authority. However, 
these judges will perform these duties in their capacity as 
superior court judges and will have all the powers vested in 
superior court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the judges will reside in Nunavut and be in frequent 
contact with the various communities in Nunavut, I have no doubt 
that the people of Nunavut will notice an improvement in terms 
of access to justice. They will also be able to explain their 
problems to judges who are familiar with their culture, their 
values and their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the proposed amendments to the Criminal 
Code to establish a single level trial court will not curtail in 
any way the rights of the parties before the court.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This respect for equity is reflected, for example, both in the 
appeal provisions and in the new statutory form of review 
designed to ensure the review of certain key decisions made 
under the criminal justice process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 preserves the full ambit and scope of appeal rights 
relating to summary convictions made under all legal proceedings 
instituted in Nunavut. The appeal of summary convictions made by 
the Nunavut court of justice will be heard by a single judge of 
the court of appeal. At the second level, the appeal will be 
heard by three judges from the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the changes made to the legislation, those hon. members 
who take a close interest in the more technical aspects of a 
single-level court system will note that, unlike provincial and 
territorial court rulings, the decisions of the Nunavut court of 
justice cannot be reviewed through prerogative writs, since the 
Nunavut court of justice will be a superior court. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To compensate for this, the provisions of this bill will create 
a new statutory form of review for certain important decisions in 
the criminal justice process.  As is the case with summary 
conviction appeals, the review will be conducted by a single 
judge of the court of appeal and an appeal will lie from the 
review decision to a three person panel of the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In describing these features of the statutory review scheme in 
some detail, I want to emphasize that one of the important 
purposes of the scheme is to ensure that the people of Nunavut 
are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to the 
rights accorded to them by their court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of these features that the government can say in 
the summary printed on the first page of Bill C-57 that the bill: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—creates a single-level trial court system for the territory of 
Nunavut in order to provide an efficient and accessible court 
structure capable of responding to the unique needs of Nunavut 
while, at the same time, maintaining substantive and procedural 
rights equivalent to those enjoyed elsewhere in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final theme in Bill C-57 concerns the changes to the Judges 
Act necessary to accommodate the operation of a single level 
trial court in Nunavut at the superior court level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Judges Act provide for the appointment of 
three superior court judges to the Nunavut court of justice. As I 
indicated earlier, all of them will be resident in the territory 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is committed to finding candidates who 
are qualified, experienced and committed to the north to be 
appointed to the Nunavut bench.  The hon. minister is on record 
with a commitment to consult the people of the north to ensure 
that appointments reflect and respond to the unique demands, 
culture and conditions in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a single level trial court in Nunavut 
represents the starting point in developing a justice system 
which meets the needs of the people it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice is committed to working closely with 
the interim commissioner of Nunavut, Nunavut organizations and 
the new Nunavut government when it is established to help further 
adapt the justice system to the needs of the Nunavut people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one very important issue relates to the training of 
justices of the peace to ensure that they will have the ability 
to complement the work of the Nunavut court of justice by 
resolving less serious matters at the community level.  While the 
training of justices of the peace is a territorial 
responsibility, the Department of Justice will do everything it 
can to assist the new territory in this important task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the administration of justice which will 
continue to be an important aspect of justice delivery in the 
north is the use of both community justice committees and youth 
justice committees.  Continued funding for both committees will 
be the responsibility of the new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth justice committees are extensively used on Baffin Island 
and deal with youth in a pre-charge context.  Youth justice 
committees are also recognized as alternative measures programs 
pursuant to the Young Offenders Act.  Both the youth justice 
committees and the community justice committees have been and 
will continue to be an important part of the broader justice 
system in Nunavut.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a single level trial court brings with it high 
hopes for a court structure which is more responsive to the needs 
of the people of Nunavut, the people it stands to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system proposed in Bill C-57 is unprecedented.  There 
will be a need therefore to monitor and evaluate the system in 
the years ahead to ensure that it achieves the objective of 
providing an efficient, effective and accessible justice system 
in the north. The Department of Justice is working with the 
interim commissioner's office to design a monitoring and 
evaluating system to identify problems and possible changes to 
the court system which might be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of Nunavut in a mere four months from now is a 
momentous event in Canadian history.  It signals a realization of 
a 25 year old dream of the Inuit of the eastern Arctic.  It 
signals the creation of the first single level trial court for 
criminal, civil and family matters in Canada.  It signals a new 
chapter in partnership between the Inuit and the federal 
government.  As one witness indicated to the standing committee 
last week, it signals the dawn of a new age of hope for the 
Nunavut people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence given before the standing committee last week by 
Miss Leena Evic-Twerdin, policy adviser for Nunavut Tunngavik 
Incorporated is noteworthy in this regard.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are beginning the process of reclaiming our identity and 
our ways.  It is the opportunity that is unfolding in front of us 
that is allowing us to begin the process.  Nunavut is that 
opportunity and everything that falls under the establishment of 
Nunavut is a chance for a positive impact on the future of the 
Inuit.  The successful passage of Bill C-57 will mean a better 
opportunity for Nunavut and its people.  That is why we are here 
to encourage you to support the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all the members of the committee and of this House on 
behalf of the minister for their attention today.  I ask for 
their support in the speedy passage of Bill C-57 so that we may 
make history together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of Bill 
C-57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation comes down to the creation of the Nunavut court 
of justice, a single level of court to handle all trials in this 
new territory. Instead of two levels of court as we have in the 
rest of the country, Nunavut will have this single court.  This 
is required because of the small population of approximately 
26,000 spread over such a vast territory with only about 25 
settlements.  This only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three superior court judges are to be appointed.  These 
individuals will be tasked with all matters.  While it is 
unfortunate to have these highly expensive and qualified judges 
being assigned the responsibility over all types of cases 
regardless of importance, there appears to be little alternative. 
It does not make sense to transport a federal level judge and a 
territorial level judge to each community when one judge could 
come in a deal with all cases available for adjudication. We all 
understand that most of these communities are isolated and 
remote.  Judges are not available except from centralized and 
more populated areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends a number of other pieces of Canadian law but 
these are mere consequential changes.  A number of our acts use 
procedures or terminology which must be altered to recognize the 
new territory of Nunavut, the Nunavut court of justice and the 
single level of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleagues and I have expressed our very serious 
concerns over the methods used to select our superior court 
judges.  We have expressed our opposition to the recent pay 
increases granted to judges in Bill C-37 at a time when Canadian 
families are under intense financial pressures.  We also 
expressed concerns surrounding the creation of this new territory 
and its untold costs.  However, those issues are not relevant to 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut is a reality.  As I have said, this legislation is 
highly practical for that reality.  All citizens of Canada are 
entitled to an efficient court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Nunavut court of justice model proves successful, and I 
am sure we all hope that it does, perhaps we will see it 
replicated in other remote, sparsely populated parts of this vast 
country we call Canada.  That would be up to the provincial or 
territorial governments concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some opposition expressed to this legislation as 
it is currently worded, most notably by the Dene of northern 
Manitoba whose traditional territories extend into Nunavut. 
It is my hope that fair and just minded peopled, both north and 
south of 60, will work together toward a solution agreeable to 
all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an 
associate member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development for the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to 
speak again today on C-57, an act to amend the Nunavut Act with 
respect to the Nunavut Court of Justice and to amend other Acts 
in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position and impressions with respect to Bill C-57 are really 
no different than the comments made at second reading.  We were 
favourable then, and we are favourable now.  Ever since this 
bill was introduced in the House, we have wanted to see it 
passed as promptly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-57 is to amend the Criminal Code so that it 
reflects the realities of the new territory of Nunavut and to 
make it possible to establish an operational government before 
April 1, 1999, the territory's official launch date.  It is 
therefore very important for this bill to be passed so that the 
people of Nunavut may be prepared and equipped with all the 
necessary tools to be equal to the challenge of this new 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 is part of the process that began in 1992 with the 
territorial land agreement setting out the legal and political 
framework of the new territory of Nunavut. Approved in 1993, the 
creation of Nunavut is supported by Bill C-39, which we debated 
in the House last year and which provides for the holding of a 
legislative election, while facilitating the transition and 
legitimizing the process.  Bill C-57 is part of this ongoing 
process. 
It is the last building block, as it were, in the political and 
legal structure that will allow the inhabitants of this 
territory to at last be ready for April 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the threshold of 1999.  It is high time to give the 
inhabitants of Nunavut all the political, and more particularly 
in the case before us today, all the legislative instruments 
they will need.  This will enable them to have a court that 
meets their needs and that is closer to them. The creation of a 
trial court, as provided in Bill C-57, is vital to full 
government autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949—I said 
“Confederation” but I should have said “federation”, because we 
know that the successive federal governments, without any 
consultation, threw out Confederation and replaced it with a 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1949, Canada's borders have not been changed. This 
indicates clearly just what a historic moment the creation of 
Nunavut represents and also explains the importance of its 
creation to the people living there.  The Northwest Territories 
will therefore be divided into two separate entities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut covers some two million square kilometres and is north 
of the 60th parallel.  It is divided into three regions and 
includes 28 communities.  Eighty per cent of the population is 
Inuit.  “Nunavut” is a lovely word from their language meaning 
“our land”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, life in the Canadian far north is very 
different from life as we know it in our big cities.  The size 
of the territory alone explains the need to pass legislation 
more suited to these northern communities' needs and realities. 
I firmly believe Bill C-57 meets that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the establishment of a single level trial court and the 
broader powers accorded it, the judges will be more versatile 
and better able to meet the specific needs of the people of 
Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill 
C-57, which enables thousands of native people to move closer to 
solid, viable and more relevant self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 passed in the House last year permits the Inuit in 
Nunavut to administer their land through a legislative assembly 
elected by universal suffrage. We supported the bill at the 
time.  It gave form to more than 25 years of negotiations and 
enabled the Inuit, a great people within Canada, to take their 
place on the continent by controlling their own destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 provides for a transition period and for the powers of 
the federal and territorial governments to be devolved to the 
Nunavut territorial government. This legislation also amends the 
Constitution Act, 1867, so that the people of this territory 
will be represented in the House of Commons and the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ensures that representatives of the Inuit of Nunavut will be 
able to serve their constituents in an operational legislature 
as soon as their territory is officially created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-39 dealt with many issues, some of them must still 
be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the new 
territory at the political and legislative levels. Indeed, much 
work remains to be done between now and April 1, 1999. That is 
why it is essential that Bill C-57 be passed as soon as possible 
to complete the establishment of the territory's legal and 
administrative components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be ready by April 1999, Nunavut must have at its 
disposal all the necessary legislative instruments now. This is 
what Bill C-57 is all about, and we support it. The transfer of 
certain territorial and federal jurisdictions to Nunavut is not 
a simple matter, but it is nonetheless vital and meets the needs 
of the far north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill establishes a single level trial court system for the 
territory of Nunavut. This tribunal, to be known as the Nunavut 
court of justice, is established to provide an efficient and 
accessible court structure capable of meeting the unique needs 
of Nunavut, while at the same time maintaining rights equivalent 
to those enjoyed elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concrete terms, this means that the new Nunavut territory 
will now have its own court of justice. This court of justice 
will replace the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories as 
the superior court, and the territorial court as the lower 
court. Bill C-57 makes further amendments to the Nunavut Act, 
passed in 1993, when the Progressive Conservative Party was in 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Judges Act to provide for three 
superior court judges on the Nunavut court of justice

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senior judge of each of the three territories must be a 
member of the Canadian Judicial Council. Indeed, given the 
expanded jurisdiction of that tribunal, it is important to make 
sure that the judges will be competent to hear cases from the 
lower and superior courts, with the exception of those cases 
that come under the jurisdiction of specialized and 
administrative tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Criminal Code to provide for new 
procedures for the court of justice and it includes a whole 
range of legal considerations. The creation of this court of 
justice will ensure a flexible and efficient legal process for 
the whole territory of Nunavut. 
By making the court competent to hear any case, whether it 
involves a minor wrongdoing or a serious criminal offence, we 
give the people of the territory access to a service that is 
more consistent with its reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, when a judge travels to some small community in 
Nunavut, he will have broader powers. It must be understood that 
the multiplicity of jurisdictions, in other words a multifaceted 
court system, useful in high density urban centres, is not 
necessarily useful in the proper administration of justice in a 
territory such as Nunavut. This is why legislation must be 
passed on this issue and to permit the necessary changes to be 
made to the various laws that, up to now, have granted various 
jurisdictions authority to hear various cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 provides the changes needed for the establishment and 
operation of this court of justice, and it also meets the wishes 
of the promoters of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add that we support the bill and that we will continue to 
support the principle of actions that, like Bill C-57, enable 
peoples to find the tools they need to reach their full 
potential.

sewage treatment at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister acknowledge a significant regional disparity 
in the level of sewage treatment in Atlantic Canada as compared

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one of the great priorities of this government is to 
ensure the necessary infrastructure is put in place for all

disparities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this government some years ago that brought in the $2

there will be no moratorium on fees.  They will enter into effect

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-57.  I thank my colleague from 
the New Democratic Party for permitting me to speak before her. 
I also want to indicate to the Chair that I will be splitting my 
time with the member for St. John's East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will amend the Nunavut Act with respect to the Nunavut 
court of justice.  It will also amend other acts as a 
consequence.  It is a very important step in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would commend my colleague from South Shore who has been a 
strong and vigorous spokesperson, not only on behalf of his 
riding, but on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party and 
all Canadians with respect to his responsibilities as critic for 
the Indian and northern affairs portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take the opportunity to commend the efforts of 
the hon. member for Nunavut.  Although we do not share the same 
political affiliation, I know the member is deeply committed to 
achieving progress for her constituents as they enter the 21st 
century as residents of Canada's newest territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her participation in Tuesday night's hockey game also showed 
that she is one of the Liberal Party's smoothest skaters.  I look 
forward to hearing her provide some lessons to her less limber 
and perhaps less timber happy colleagues, especially the hon. 
member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my remarks on Bill C-57 I want to highlight an 
often overlooked participant in the creation of the Nunavut 
territory.  He was a leader with foresight and vision who pursued 
an aggressive and activist agenda.  He was the Right Hon. Brian 
Mulroney, who as prime minister set the wheels in motion to 
establish the Nunavut territory by signing the Nunavut land 
claims agreement in 1992.  The creation of Nunavut is yet one 
more reason why Mr. Mulroney was named a Companion to the Order 
of Canada.  Furthermore, it was under his government, as well as 
that of the Right Hon. Joe Clark as constitutional affairs 
minister, that aboriginal people became full participants at 
formal constitutional negotiations for the first time in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was refreshing to hear the Minister of Finance say a few 
weeks ago that it was because of the PC government's economic 
plan that the budget is now balanced.  It cannot be stressed 
enough that it was the previous Progressive Conservative 
government which gave aboriginal peoples a voice at the 
constitutional table, a voice through a royal commission, a voice 
through the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and a voice 
for our Inuit people now through the signing of the Nunavut land 
claims agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating another piece of legislation that was 
introduced by a government with a proud legacy, that is, the 
government of the Progressive Conservative Party.  Although our 
party's ambitious policies were unpopular at the time, history 
has shown that it was by and large the Progressive Conservative 
Party that brought forward these initiatives for the betterment 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-57 deals with the best way of providing a court system 
for Nunavut, which is a new and expansive territory.  There have 
been those who object to granting the people of Nunavut a single 
court system.  They may object, on the basis of jurisdictional 
concerns, that this bill would create an intrusive precedent. 
They may object on the basis that this bill might somehow violate 
the equality provisions of the charter of rights and freedoms and 
create constitutional problems.  I believe this piece of 
legislation addresses those problems in a fair and practical way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the justice critic for our party, I do not share the 
objections that have been raised by some opposition members. 
Bill C-57 appears to recognize the unique circumstances in which 
the people of Nunavut live.  First and foremost in this unique 
environment is that the Inuit people will form a strong majority 
of the Nunavut population; 17,000 of the 22,000 residents or 77%. 
Nunavut's territory also represents approximately one-fifth of 
the overall size of Canada, yet its population is only 22,000, 
less than one-quarter of 1% of the entire population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, let us compare Nunavut's size and population 
with other jurisdictions.  Nunavut's 1.9 million square 
kilometres fall just under the figure for Greenland.  Nunavut is 
five times the size of Germany, four times the size of Sweden and 
one-fifth the size of China.  With those expansive territorial 
boundaries we must factor in population distribution.  Nunavut 
only has one-hundredth of one person for every square kilometre 
of its physical territory.  Canada, as a whole, has nearly three 
people living per square kilometre.  Ontario has 11 people per 
square kilometre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut's main human and territorial characteristics are not 
only unique to Canada, they are unique to the entire world.  For 
example, Nunavut has only 20 kilometres of highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Grise Fiord is Nunavut's most northern community.  In fact, I 
believe it is one of Canada's most northern communities and it is 
a community I had the pleasure to visit some time ago.  It is a 
full 2,700 kilometres from the capital.  The population is only 
about 130 people, who experience an average temperature of -35° 
Celsius in January.  These hearty souls also live in 24 hours of 
daylight in June and around the clock darkness in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I experienced a number of challenges practising law in rural 
Nova Scotia.  At that time I always found it a pleasure to work 
with the law enforcement community and those who administer our 
criminal justice system.  By and large, I found that many of 
those individuals work long, hard hours and go above and beyond 
the call of duty, like police officer George Mageney in the 
community of Stellarton, in my riding of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who I have a great deal of time 
and respect for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nevertheless difficult for me, drawing upon my own 
experience, to perceive how court proceedings as they relate to 
criminal, civil or family law, would occur effectively and 
efficiently in such a large jurisdiction as this new territory. 
With such a small population and with such diverse communities, 
this will truly pose an incredible challenge to the people of 
this new territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as has been mentioned previously, Bill C-57 amends 
several existing federal statutes.  It amends the Nunavut Act to 
establish a single level of trial court at the superior court 
level, to be known as the Nunavut Court of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amends the Judges Act to provide for three superior court 
judges on the Nunavut Court of Justice and also to provide for 
full membership in the Canadian Judicial Council for senior 
judges in each of the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amends, most consequently, the Criminal Code to provide for 
new structures and procedures for the Nunavut Court of Justice in 
the following areas:  jurisdiction of judges; summary conviction 
appeals; a new statutory form of release; judicial interim 
release; and elections as to a mode of trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those technical changes that occur within our Criminal 
Code are encompassed in Bill C-57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also amends the Young Offenders Act to ensure adequate 
structures and procedures for a single level of trial court, 
consistent with the new structures and procedures in the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the drafters of this legislation should be credited 
because it does mesh nicely with the existing provisions of the 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore welcome Bill C-57 as a positive measure that 
recognizes the unique characteristics and conditions of the 
people and the territory of Nunavut.  However, I have a number of 
concerns which were not completely addressed at the justice 
committee by the minister and her officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern deals with the greater use of justices of the 
peace.  The Department of Justice believes that with appropriate 
training there is potential for greater use of justices of the 
peace to conduct preliminary inquiries and in some cases summary 
conviction trials.  I endorse this concept.  My concerns mainly 
arise out of the training and the funding for such training that 
will ensure that those who appear before these justices of the 
peace will receive adequate treatment under the law, the same 
treatment that they would receive from a properly ordained 
justice, if I can use that term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the belief of many that the greater use of justices of 
the peace would not only benefit this single justice system in 
Nunavut, but also some of the courts, as our friends in Nunavut 
would say, in southern Canada, that is, the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the role of justices of the peace is to expand, training must 
be assured.  Unfortunately, responsibility for this training 
falls solely under the responsibility of the Nunavut territorial 
government.  So the federal government is once again, in some 
instances, able to wash its hands clean and download to a 
territory or a province.  It is therefore problematic for the 
federal government, through Bill C-57, to open the door for 
increased responsibilities for justices of the peace without 
assuring that they will in fact be able to fund this new 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at the federal government's downloading of the 
funding of the young offender programs in the rest of Canada to 
fear that similar problems could arise in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that Bill C-57 accurately reflects both the 
needs of Nunavut and the obligation of the Government of Canada 
to protect the due course of justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I join my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative caucus to

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to say a few words on Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Nunavut Act.  The bill is important not only for what the 
legislation entails but also for what it represents.  The bill 
provides for a single tier court system in the new territory of 
Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this territory on April 1, 1999 will be a very 
historic occasion.  The legislation will help to ensure that when 
that day comes everything will be ready to begin operations and 
allow for a very smooth transition for this new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories and the rest of Canada will be 
watching with interest when Nunavut becomes a territory.  With 
the unique justice system the legislation will put in place there 
will be even greater reason to monitor the situation closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single court system has been discussed on many different 
occasions but has never been implemented by another province or 
territory.  It will be interesting to see how well it meets the 
needs of the Inuit people.  Currently all provinces and 
territories operate on the two court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide some historical background and information on the 
demographics and size of Nunavut.  The creation of a separate 
Nunavut territory has been discussed for many years, beginning in 
1976 with a request by the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada to have a 
boundary drawn between the eastern and western sections of the 
Northwest Territories.  It was not until a land claim settlement 
was signed in 1993 under the Conservative government of the day 
that the new territory was realized.  The creation of Nunavut was 
included as a provision of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said, the 
agreement gives the Inuit control of about 350,000 square 
kilometres within the more than two million square kilometres 
that will become Nunavut.  The Inuit will make up approximately 
80% of the population of the new territory which will be 
approximately one-fifth of Canada's land mass.  However it will 
only have a population of 22,000.  That sparse population base 
makes the one court system preferable in the eastern arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less time will be spent travelling to remote communities with 
only one court level.  A judge will be able to rule on cases 
relating to criminal, civil or family matters while in the 
community, negating the need for a number of judges to make 
similar trips.  That should reduce costs and eliminate 
administrative details such as the scheduling of numerous court 
appearances.  In time the judges should become more familiar with 
the different communities, which may assist them in their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one court system was chosen for the eastern arctic at the 
request of the Inuit.  The Inuit have their own views of what a 
justice system should provide.  It is hoped that a one tier 
system will better meet their requirements.  We shall have to 
wait to see if that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999 has special 
significance for me.  It will be the first new territory or 
province created since Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949. 
Obviously that will be a very historic day for Canada.  I am 
pleased to support a bill that will help to ensure the transition 
occurs smoothly and put in place a system which will be adequate 
to address the needs of the Inuit and non-Inuit residents of the 
eastern arctic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity in the last session of parliament to speak 
to a bill which also amended the Nunavut Act.  I am pleased to 
speak again to another amendment to the act.  I will be watching 
closely with my colleagues when Nunavut becomes the newest 
territory in Canada in April 1999. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of the New Democratic Party to Bill 
C-57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Nunavut have a unique culture and deserve to have 
a court system which reflects their culture and geographic 
realities.  The NDP has been consistent in its support for 
self-government and that is why at second reading our aboriginal 
affairs spokesperson indicated our principled support for the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have very serious concerns about the bill.  If the 
court system created by the bill is implemented, it will have 
devastating consequences for the Manitoba Dene whose traditional 
territory straddles the Manitoba-Nunavut border.  The Manitoba 
Dene are my constituents.  Although I too support self-government 
for Nunavut, I cannot support or endorse a bill which runs 
counter to their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba Dene are those bands in the Dene nation whose 
reserve lands fall within Manitoba.  There are two such bands, 
the Northlands First Nation who signed a treaty with Canada in 
1907 and the Sayisi Dene First Nation who signed a treaty in 
1910. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties guaranteed members of the nations the inalienable 
right to hunt, fish, trap and select reserve lands anywhere in 
their traditional territories.  Fifty-seven per cent of their 
traditional territory lies north of the 66th parallel that 
divides Manitoba and Nunavut.  This area represents less than 5% 
of the territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since these first nations signed their treaties they have 
continued to hunt, fish and trap in their traditional territories 
north of 60.  When the federal government negotiated the Nunavut 
agreement with the Inuit of Nunavut, the Manitoba Dene asked to 
be included in these negotiations but were inexplicably and 
unjustly excluded.  There was no justification for this 
exclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was negotiating the transfer of lands to which 
the Manitoba Dene have a right according to treaty.  In a feeble 
attempt to justify what it had done the federal government 
claimed out of the blue that the Manitoba Dene had no rights 
north of 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This claim would almost be laughable if it did not have such 
serious consequences for the Manitoba Dene.  No one who knows 
anything about the Manitoba Dene believes this ridiculous claim 
in light of the mountains of evidence to the contrary. 
Archeologists have proven that bands have occupied lands of north 
of 60 for 2,600 years.  These bands have no less than 25 burial 
sites north of 60.  They have occupied lands north and south of 
the 60th parallel for as long as there have been historical 
records about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of the past two and a half centuries they have been a 
nomadic society.  The staple of their diet was the caribou and 
they travelled across vast distances following the great northern 
caribou herds.  This is why their traditional lands do not match 
up with the nice straight lines we see on maps.  Caribou do not 
care about the lines on maps.  By the terms of the treaties the 
Manitoba Dene signed in the first decade of this century they 
have an undeniable claim north of 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of the Northwest Territories acknowledges the 
ridiculousness of the federal government's position with an 
administrative measure called the border A licence area.  Within 
this area, which very closely coincides with the traditional 
territory of the Manitoba Dene, Manitoba Dene are not required to 
have a licence to carry out their traditional practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy directly contradicts the federal government's claim 
but acknowledges the reality of the situation.  To this day the 
Dene of Manitoba still hunt, fish and trap north of 60.  In these 
communities where most food has to be flown from the south, 
making it very expensive, most people still rely on hunting and 
fishing to feed their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the evidence arrayed against their position, the 
Government of Canada clings irrationally to its claim that the 
Manitoba Dene have no rights north of 60.  Even when in 1993 the 
standing committee on aboriginal affairs unanimously called on 
the government to recognize the rights of the Manitoba Dene 
within Nunavut, the government refused.  At that time the 
Progressive Conservative Indian affairs minister said that the 
Manitoba Dene claim north of 60 would have to be resolved in the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this challenge, the Manitoba Dene filed a claim 
with the Federal Court of Canada asking the court to enforce 
their treaty rights.  This case remains before the court today. 
While the Dene of Manitoba case has dragged on, the Liberal 
government has forged blindly ahead with the implementation of 
the Nunavut Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is to establish a Nunavut court of 
justice to reflect the unique cultural and geographic realities 
of Nunavut.  I say again that my party and I support the Inuit 
right to self-government and we support the creation of a 
separate court system for the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northern Manitoba Tribal Council, of which the Manitoba Dene 
are members, the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, also officially 
support the Inuit of Nunavut.  However, they know as I do that it 
is not fair and it is not right to settle one land claim at the 
expense of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Nunavut comes into being a few months from now, the Nunavut 
wildlife management board will have jurisdiction over hunting, 
fishing and trapping in the traditional territory of the Manitoba 
Dene.  Nunavut leaders have refused to recognize the treaty 
rights of the Manitoba Dene until there is a ruling from the 
court.  In the meantime, since the rights of the Dene are not 
recognized, they will be subject to the rules and regulations of 
the Nunavut wildlife management board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nunavut court of justice created by the bill will have the 
power and responsibility to enforce the regulations of the board. 
I cannot in good conscience support the creation of a legal 
authority that will prevent the Manitoba Dene from hunting, 
fishing and trapping in their traditional lands.  I therefore 
submitted an amendment to the bill which would have granted a 
stay of prosecution of the Manitoba Dene people charged with 
these kinds of offences in their traditional lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to read that amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any proceedings before the Nunavut Court of Justice that involve 
the Denesuline of Manitoba claiming as a defence any matter set 
out in the claim presently being advanced for and on behalf of 
the Sayisi Dene First Nations and the Northlands First Nation in 
the Federal Court of Canada (Trial Division) in a Statement of 
Claim dated March 9, 1993, as amended, initiating suit T-703-93 
against the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
and the Attorney General of Canada (among other defendants) shall 
be stayed pending the final decision of the Federal Court of 
Canada with respect to the matter of, if the matter is appealed 
or referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, the final decision of 
the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Table ruled this amendment out of order because it went 
beyond the scope of the bill, I was extremely disappointed and 
frustrated.  This one amendment could have protected the treaty 
rights of the Manitoba Dene until the courts affirmed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How typical of the disrespect and contempt with which the 
Canadian government has treated these people.  In a bill dealing 
with the Nunavut court of justice and its jurisdiction to try 
different crimes in the territory of Nunavut, an amendment to 
temporarily modify its jurisdiction seems entirely within its 
scope to me, especially in light of the number of omnibus bills 
we have seen pushed through the House in the last two months. 
What hypocrisy on the part of the Liberal government.  Without 
tainting or delaying the process that the people of Nunavut 
deserve, the Manitoba Dene, MKO and I have done what we can to 
try to amend the bill within the methods available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are at third reading all I can do is say I am 
opposed to the bill.  I will continue to do everything I can to 
ensure that the rights of the Manitoba Dene are respected.  The 
Manitoba Dene deserve justice.  If their treaty rights are 
respected there is no reason why the Inuit and the Dene cannot 
find some sort of mutually acceptable accommodation in the 
context of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize again that the area in question is less than 5% of 
Nunavut.  Rather than promote such a resolution, successive 
Liberal and Conservative governments have denied Manitoba Dene 
treaty rights and have acted as roadblocks to their justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-58, in Clause 19, be amended by adding after line 7 
on page 12 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3) Section 24 of the Act is amended by adding the 
following after subsection (2): 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) A railway company that operates a line of railway shall 
reimburse a provincial government, city or municipality for 
expenses incurred by the provincial government, city or 
municipality, as the case may be, in respect of the line of 
railway for the purpose of complying with a regulation made under 
subsection (1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) For greater certainty, subsection (3) does not limit the

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today 
to outline my reservations about Bill C-58 introduced by the 
government to optimize rail transportation safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything that has to do with the rail system is of interest to 
the inhabitants of the riding of Argenteuil—Papineau.  In 1994, 
we prepared a brief opposing CP's request to abandon its 
operations in the subdivision of Lachute between 
Saint-Augustin-de-Mirabel and Thurso in the province of Quebec . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, through the intervention of Jacques Léonard, the 
then provincial transport minister, we obtained a moratorium so 
the line would not be abandoned.  Because of this moratorium, 
the trains are again running between Saint-Augustin-de-Mirabel and 
Thurso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bloc Quebecois welcomes this bill, it deplores the 
circumstances that led up to it.  In September 1997, a VIA rail 
passenger train left the tracks near Biggar in Saskatchewan with 
tragic results.  This is what it took to get the minister's 
office to introduce the substantial amendments to the 1989 
Railway Safety Act that were needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have carefully examined the bill, which is a series of very 
technical amendments to the present legislation and, with some 
reservations, are in favour of Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we see it as positive that steps have been taken to 
enhance the government's ability to get the railways to remedy 
nuisances and hazards relating to safety and to the environment. 
Thus the government is assuming more of one of its fundamental 
responsibilities, to ensure people's safety.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also obvious that the government is taking advantage of 
this opportunity to encourage collaboration between the various 
parties involved in railway transportation in the process of 
creating and implementing safety measures for rail users and 
employees, and the population in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill gives the Minister of Transport the necessary 
authority in cases not covered by the legislation to step in 
promptly, overstepping the regulations, in the interests of the 
safety of those affected by rail transportation. 
We acknowledge the justification of this provision.  It is a 
valuable tool in the hands of a Minister of Transport with 
concerns for public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, one of the provisions in the bill strikes us as 
unacceptable in its present wording.  This is clause 19, which 
gives the governor in council authority “respecting the 
construction, alteration and maintenance of roads for the 
purpose of ensuring safe railway operations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are no doubt aware that the construction and 
maintenance of roads is a provincial and municipal responsibility. 
Railway safety is, and we do not dispute this, under federal 
jurisdiction. We nonetheless believe that steps must be taken to 
prevent Ottawa from using this responsibility as an excuse to 
once again invade provincial jurisdictions and letting the 
province or municipality foot the bill, when they cannot afford 
the road work required, especially in the case of small 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 19 is sufficiently vague and its scope sufficiently broad 
that the governor in council could, under this provision, force 
a municipality to build a bridge to carry the road over the rail 
line on the pretext that it will mean greater safety for road 
and rail passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable, hence our amendment, which reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 24 of the same Act is amended by adding the following 
after subsection (2): 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) A railway company that operates a line 
of railway shall reimburse a provincial government, city or 
municipality for expenses incurred by the provincial government, 
city or municipality, as the case may be, in respect of the line 
of railway for the purpose of complying with a regulation made 
under subsection (1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) For greater certainty, subsection (3) 
does not limit the scope of subsection (2) with respect to a 
provincial government, city or municipality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to have the member for Jonquière seconding this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it is desirable and normal that the measures decided by 
a round table headed by the federal Minister of Transport and 
designed to improve safety conditions relating to a railway line 
are not a financial burden unfairly imposed by the federal 
government on the province, city or municipality concerned. 
Clearly, the safety of a railway line is the responsibility of 
the operator of that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that imposing fees on the railway companies concerned 
may be a deterrent to the implementation of projects designed to 
improve the safety of the facilities. This is why it is 
important to include in the act provisions specifying that even 
though the cost of such work must be borne by line operators, it 
must in no way adversely affect the implementation and the 
timetable of such projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while the Bloc Quebecois supports this purely 
technical bill, it insists that the proposed amendments be taken 
into consideration, in the interest of Quebeckers and Canadians.

interests of Quebeckers and to oppose potential or actual 
federal interference in jurisdictions that come under the 
provinces, which this government has no business doing. That 
being said, we think this is basically a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that once the necessary adjustments

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in 
the House today in response to the motion to have a new section 
in this bill that would require railways to fund provincial or 
local government costs. We are not able to support these proposed 
changes for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 24(3) proposed by the hon. member of the third party 
seeks to make railways responsible for reimbursing governments 
for any cost they may incur in complying with requirements 
established under subsection 24(1) of the Railway Safety Act. We 
should consider what this truly implies and particularly how this 
motion would improve safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirements under subsection 24(1) of the act could 
conclude control or prohibition of a variety of land uses 
adjacent to railway property to the extent that they may 
constitute a threat to safe railway operations.  This might mean 
buildings or other structures, mining operations, drainage 
systems, storage of materials on adjacent property, and fencing 
to name a few. Bill C-58 adds to this list by proposing that 
safety requirements could be established for road approaches, an 
important provision that I will touch on later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that section 24 of the act does not 
address who will pay for meeting safety requirements, except 
where the owner, lessee or occupier of the land suffers a loss. 
In that case the act wisely provides that the railway company 
will pay such losses as are agreed to between the parties.  It 
also provides that where there is a dispute, the Canadian 
Transportation Agency may make a determination.  This appeal 
process is specifically intended to ensure that any economic 
considerations are resolved through an independent body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of the costs of meeting any regulations 
established under this section.  All government regulations are 
developed in consultation with affected parties so that both the 
cost of complying with the requirements and the safety benefits 
are established.  Each specific regulation must also identify 
which party is responsible for meeting the requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a regulation may specify that a drainage system 
meet certain standards for the purpose of railway safety.  It 
would normally be the responsibility of the owner of the drainage 
system to design and build it in compliance with the law.  It 
would be their responsibility to pay for it. This is the very 
same situation for the railway company today that must pay the 
cost of meeting requirements for safety of rail equipment, or 
manufacturers of motor vehicles that must meet safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the third point, subsection 24(1) applies widely and not just 
to provincial, local or municipal governments.  Many of the 
owners or occupiers of land are private industries or 
individuals.  Even if we supported the intent of this motion, 
which we do not, it would not help anyone other than governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn for a moment to the intent of clause 19 of 
the bill as presently written.  It adds two sections aimed at 
improving the safety at railway crossings, an important issue for 
all Canadians and a major priority for the Department of 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in Canada people are needlessly killed and injured in 
accidents at crossings and while trespassing on railroad 
property. 
While the number of accidents has come down, initiatives proposed 
in the bill will help to reduce it even further.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will ensure that Canada maintains its commendable rail 
safety record as was noticed by the chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is to improve the safety of Canada's rail 
transportation system.  The act recognizes that a number of 
parties are involved in meeting this objective and has the 
necessary authority to ensure the respective obligations are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed motion does not in any way lead to a possible 
improvement in this regard, since it addresses economic issues 
only.  It would also conflict with government regulatory policy 
by making only one party bear the cost when in many cases others 
have responsibility to do so also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act already provides adequate protection where there are 
economic disputes.  This motion is not, in our opinion, necessary 
for that purpose.  Therefore the government is unable to support 
the proposed amendment by the hon. member.  The Railway Safety 
Act has already led the way in ensuring that our nation's 
railways operate in an extremely safe manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review of this legislation has shown that our system meets 
high safety standards.  Bill C-58 will ensure that we continue to 
build on this well established safety base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge all hon. members to give quick passage to this 
legislation when put forward for third and final reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I regret that the Reform Party cannot endorse the 
amendment presented by the Bloc.  We cannot support an amendment 
that would require railways to pay for the removal of hazards 
created as a result of the emissions of local governments. 
This defies natural justice.  In that respect only we cannot 
support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a local road authority allowed brush to grow 
wild on the approach to a railway crossing and then was forced to 
remove it, under the terms of this amendment, as I understand it, 
the railway would be required to pay for the work.  That would be 
patently unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have misunderstood the motion, I hope during questions and 
comments that will be brought to my attention.  As I interpret 
it, this is simply wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the general question of this legislation is concerned, 
in my part of the country this entire debate is becoming moot or 
academic. The railways it would govern are disappearing thanks to 
the government's brilliance in writing the new Canadian 
transportation act. It is pretty hard to have a railway crossing 
accident where there are no railways.  This is happening to us 
out there at a very rapid rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little concerned that this bill has been fast tracked the 
way it has.  Basically there is not much in the bill with which I 
could find fault. But it certainly is clear evidence of utter 
disorganization in the office of the minister that the bill has 
sat around for heaven knows how many weeks and all of a sudden it 
is being pushed through first reading, second reading, committee, 
report stage, bang, bang, bang, for no good reason that I can 
understand unless we are looking at prorogation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been languishing over there in that tower.  Now we 
have it here and we have to deal with it.  The bill has not even 
been printed as reported.  It is not even available online, on 
the net.  Yet here we are debating the terms.  It has not been 
printed as reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could raise that as a point of order and create 
some disruption.  I do not intend to do so but this is 
ridiculous.  What is the hurry?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had not alerted some stakeholders to the fact that the bill 
was coming up in committee, they would not have had time to even 
think about preparing presentations.  It caught them completely 
off guard.  They had to rush to do what they had to do and they 
did it very well.  Other stakeholders would have come forward if 
they had known what was going on. Perhaps I am impugning motive 
but the government did not care whether the public was aware of 
what it was doing so the word did not go out that committee 
meetings were to be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one example.  The Canadian Trucking Alliance hired a 
prominent transportation consultant to review the bill, 
specifically the provisions related to crossings and the 
standards for construction or alteration of railway works.  I 
presume since these guys do not work cheap it cost the 
association a bundle of money.  The report will not be completed 
until Monday, December 7, which is too late to have any impact. 
So these people have wasted their time trying to get some input 
into the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has not obstructed the bill in any way because it 
is in essence a technical bill.  On the advice of various 
stakeholders we tried to introduce some minor amendments in 
committee but, as usual, the Liberal members lined up in lock 
step to stop us.  Same old, same old.  I sometimes wonder why we 
have committees when everything is done according to the wishes 
and whims of the minister.  However, we are on the rails here.  I 
am not going oppose the bill nor are my colleagues but we are 
getting sick and tired of this nonsense of being pushed around 
and bullied when there is no good reason for doing so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill, in particular to the 
Bloc motion before us.  Perhaps we should look historically at 
the motion. Railways were the first type of major land 
transportation.  They were used years before cars were built and 
we had highway traffic acts in each province.  Therefore the 
standards set out in the Railway Safety Act must be applied from 
coast to coast. We cannot put in a separate statute for a safety 
feature for one province and negate that safety feature in 
another province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands said, it appears 
the bill is aimed at one province, that it is not national in its 
scope.  It seems to be a redundant and therefore I will not be 
able to support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing concern that we should have a more 
co-ordinated safety program.  Like my colleague from Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands, I am wondering why we had to hurry this bill 
through.  It would be more of a safety issue at this time to have 
a national trucking safety policy co-ordinated with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually we will have to deal with a national policy on the 
trucking industry and adapt it to the bill before us. That could 
have been done in conjunction with this bill which would have 
made abundantly more sense than pushing this bill through as 
quickly as we did. 
The last time the Standing Committee on Transport met we had a 
presentation on ITS, intelligent transportation systems.  This 
presentation proved to the few members there that this is the 
coming thing.  ITS no doubt in the future are there not just for 
the railway system but for the trucking system.  They are there 
for the automobile, all traffic, and should have been 
co-ordinated. All these things should be built in to one facet of 
a National Safety Council presentation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railways in the United States, because they are the oldest, 
are reneging about getting into ITS.  I suggest to hon. members 
opposite that the same would be true in Canada that the railways 
will be the last to co-operate in ITS because historically they 
are the oldest and they are the granddaddy of them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What impressed me with the presentation, which leaves the motion 
out, is we must have a national program and that national program 
through intelligent transportation systems will eventually become 
a continental program.  I agree with the member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands that we should not have pushed this so rapidly. 
We should have incorporated it not within this bill but made 
this bill more applicable and easily applied when we move to the 
highway trucking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate a person who came to the transport 
committee.  I asked him for a video.  It was about safety on the 
rails.  I viewed the one hour video which was excellent.  The 
problem is it was made in the U.S.  There is nothing wrong with 
that in itself, however the reason I wanted this was to see if it 
was all right with the copyright to make some copies, send it out 
to my schools, particularly on the two major railways through my 
constituency, for safety reasons to be presented in the schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the big accidents of Amtrak, Southern Pacific and so on. I 
had some concerns about that.  I encourage the Minister of 
Transport in working with other ministers in the House that we 
should present a Canadian video to each province's departments of 
education and schools so that we could stop these needless 
fatalities of children taking chances, playing on right of ways 
of the railway and the needless risking of lives at crossings and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support the motion.  We will be supporting this bill. 
The final plea I make is please look at the safety features not 
only with regard to the operation of trains but relating to the 
general public and for this department to come up with a good 
safety video similar to the one I mentioned produced in the 
United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member from the Bloc for proposing this amendment to 
Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very reasonable amendment to the railway safety aspect 
to ensure that railway companies take financial responsibility 
for the safety of operations.  Should there ever be a cost to 
comply with the safety regulations under clause 19 it is only 
fair that the railways pay for this. 
This amendment if passed will ensure that local taxpayers are not 
forced to pay for railways to comply with these regulations.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to some of the concerns my hon. colleagues in the 
Reform have mentioned, there are already regulations in place. If 
it is a matter of highway and roadway brush, regulations are in 
place within the provinces to ensure that they are responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen more and more devolution of responsibility from the 
federal government on to the provinces and ultimately the 
municipalities to cover costs. They are absolutely taxed to the 
limit.  We need to ensure that the railways are owning up to 
their responsibility.  As my colleague from Souris—Moose 
Mountain indicated, perhaps it will not be a problem in the 
prairies because rail lines are disappearing rather quickly.  It 
is inherently important that we ensure the municipalities do not 
suffer the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is also very timely because it deals with the 
larger issue of corporate welfare.  I have to comment on the 
suggestion that sports teams should have some kind of a tax break 
when citizens throughout Canada are suffering hardships because 
of lack of money going into health care.  It is inherent that we 
make those who are profiting from certain things pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers already give up far too much pay for corporate 
welfare.  The Liberal government cheered on—here is where the 
hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands comes in—by the Reform 
and Progressive Conservative parties shells out billions of 
dollars in tax break and direct subsidies to private interests. 
One of the most outrageous examples was the privatization of CN 
Rail.  Since 1867 and even before then Canadian taxpayers have 
paid for our railway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My party and I are being defamed.  We have been leading 
the pack in fighting against corporate welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon. 
member is getting into debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not really 
concerned because most Canadians truly know who are speaking out 
on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers paid for the trans-continental railway that linked the 
country from east to west.  They got an excellent return for 
their investment as the railway spurred economic growth, 
particularly in the west where it facilitated transportation of 
prairie grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember a time not too long ago when branch lines 
criss-crossed the prairie provinces.  I grew up in southern 
Saskatchewan and feel a great love for the prairie provinces as 
well as for my new home in northern Manitoba.  Grain elevators in 
small prairie towns all connected by rail were gathering points 
for communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that began to change when the Liberal government betrayed 
the Canadian people and sold off CN Rail at a bargain basement 
price.  A few investors got very rich off the corporate welfare 
measure but prairie farmers have ultimately paid the price.  CN 
Rail has begun ripping up the branch lines taxpayers paid for and 
selling them off, leaving prairie farmers to truck their grain 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of corporate welfare is the double standard when 
it comes to taxation.  Individual Canadians and small businesses 
carry large burdens primarily from regressive consumption taxes 
like the GST.  Corporate taxes in Canada are among the lowest in 
the developed world.  Yet when the Liberal government decided to 
balance its budget it cut programs like health and education 
rather than rebalance an unfair tax burden.  It balanced the 
budget on the backs of ordinary Canadian workers and small 
business people who suffered the consequences of the cuts while 
carrying an unfair share of the tax burden.  All the while 
corporate welfare bums made higher and higher profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the budget is balanced the government should reinvest 
in health and social programs and make tax cuts where they are 
needed, like phasing out the GST and reducing the burden on small 
business.  Instead the Liberal dominated finance committee has 
recommended a set of tax breaks in favour of high income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party opposes this tax cut.  In its place we 
propose reinvesting in health and other vital programs and 
targeting tax cuts like a GST cut that will help everyone, not 
just people making well above the national average income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting the Bloc member's proposal as I feel that 
it will ensure Canadian municipalities and provinces will not 
suffer further consequences from the government.  It certainly is 
in the spirit of ending corporate welfare.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak to report stage of Bill C-58, an act to 
amend the Railway Safety Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act, and in particular to the Bloc amendment 
regarding compensation to provinces and municipalities due to 
regulations made under section 24 of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is basically the same as the previous Bill C-43 
introduced during the last parliament which unfortunately died on 
the order paper at the call of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes amendments to the Railway Safety Act which 
came into effect in January 1988.  A statutory review took place 
after five years and the result was the previous Bill C-43 and 
now Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased with the exhaustive consultation which took place 
with the stakeholders involved and their valuable input.  The 
Railway Safety Act which passed in 1988 was a significant change 
in the way we regulate railways and in how railways interact with 
government.  This has proven to be a very good approach, and with 
the legislation before us today I hope it will become even 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester examined the bill in 
detail in committee.  He was glad to hear the witnesses who 
appeared including CP rail, Canadian National, the Canadian 
Railway Association of Canada and three groups representing 
labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in support of the amendment proposed by the Bloc today as 
we feel it will enhance railway safety in Canada.  The Railway 
Safety Act currently allows for compensation to land owners 
affected by the regulations made under section 24 of the act and 
the amendment extends that compensation.  The proposed amendment 
addresses the new areas in which the governor in council may make 
regulations as a result of Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new regulations deal with the construction, alteration and 
maintenance of roads for the purpose of ensuring safe railway 
operation and respecting the control of vehicular and pedestrian 
traffic on road approaches to railroad crossings for the purpose 
of ensuring safe railway operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always a top priority of the Progressive Conservative 
Party to ensure safe railway operation and to provide 
compensation to those affected through no fault of their own.  I 
am glad to say that we will be supporting the motion as we look 
forward to a safer railway system as a result of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in my 
brief time in the House rarely have I seen something rushed 
through as quickly as Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the joy of sitting on the transportation committee.  The 
bill was as quickly considered as a bill could be considered in 
committee.  For the information of the folks at home, the 
Liberals across the way have decided that prorogation of the 
House is a good idea.  I see members shaking their hands, some 
one way and some the other, but that is basically what is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been dragging their feet on changes to the 
Railway Safety Act for a very long time.  Each time they talk 
about it they decide they did not do it right the first time and 
have to make a couple of amendments.  That is what is going on 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went ahead and brought the bill to committee.  They did not 
take a lot of time, energy or effort to go ahead and notify 
stakeholders with regard to Bill C-58.  In one session on one day 
all the people who had an interest—and I have copies of their 
briefs—were rushed through very quickly, one after another, 
rapid fire, so the government could get its changes to the bill. 
Now it is before us at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the interesting scenarios we have with 
regard to Bill C-58.  The Reform Party put forward some 
amendments to the bill in committee.  Just like in all other 
committees we recognize the government will not have its ears 
open in this regard. 
It does not want any changes or any improvements to the 
legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the Reform Party recognized that government members 
were trying to go for very broad and encompassing definitions of 
what would be considered a combustion emission or pollutant.  In 
the past they have included very broad definitions which were as 
expansive as possible so that if any problems arise they are able 
to address them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not the first time this type of thing happened.  We 
recognized that if we strictly defined pollutants as combustion 
emissions it would be very clear what the government was 
intending in this regard. It would not be talking about noise 
pollution, for example, which is referred to in other pieces of 
legislation.  It would be fairly specific.  It would address 
exactly what we were trying to regulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to be precise in terms of what we are 
trying to regulate.  If we allow the government too broad a 
definition, it sometimes takes too great a liberty.  Who gets 
hurt by that?  It is the railways and the other stakeholders.  We 
tried to make that small amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just raising this as an example.  This is not the first 
time we have brought forth amendments to a piece of legislation 
to try to improve it.  Government members turned it down because 
they wanted as broad a definition as possible.  They did not want 
to discuss it. As a result, somewhere down the line somebody will 
have to pay the price for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to accept responsibility with 
regard to provinces and municipalities in terms of any costs that 
will come about as a result of the regulation.  It does not have 
any problem with hoisting all types of costs on people, whether 
it be the railways in terms of precise definitions like 
combustion emissions versus pollutants, or whether it be the 
provinces and the municipalities as a result of the regulations. 
It does not have a problem with other people internalizing the 
costs of its regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government does these types of things it forces others 
to pick up and internalize their costs.  We learned in economics 
in university the whole concept of either internalizing or 
externalizing costs.  If people do not want to internalize a 
cost, they spread it to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when government members like to talk about sharing. They 
love the concept of sharing when they can share costs or 
expenditures with others.  That is when they like to share.  That 
is exactly what we have in this government legislation.  That is 
exactly what we see with the Liberals all the time.  They love to 
share the misery.  They love to share the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just with regard to Bill C-58.  I can look at a 
whole bunch of other pieces of government legislation to see that 
the Liberals love to share misery.  They blame Mike Harris and 
Ralph Klein when they make cuts to health care.  Indeed it is the 
Liberals who are offloading those costs and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exactly the same in this case.  It is more minute but 
nonetheless we have members of a Liberal administration who love 
to share the misery.  They love to share the cost with others, 
but they do not like picking up the responsibilities for what 
they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given a couple of examples in Bill C-58 where that type 
of top down arrogant philosophy continues on big issues like 
health care which impact on every Canadian.  It has spread to 
other things, even the minutia in the Railway Safety Act.  That 
is the type of problem we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will apply a couple of the tests which I said the government 
should have applied before to other pieces of legislation.   Who 
wants it?  Who wants some of the changes?  The Liberals did not 
even have the gratitude or openmindedness to notify ahead of time 
the stakeholders who were to be intimately affected by some of 
these things.  They were rushed through the committee very 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not want to interrupt

The hon. member has about four or five minutes remaining.  In 
order that we may hear his concluding remarks, and in order that 
we may have the bill at report stage, I ask for unanimous consent 
of the House that we not see the clock at 1.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, one more time we have the 
case of the government wanting other people to pick up its costs 
for its regulation and for the things that it wants to see done, 
but the government does not want to pick up the responsibilities 
and the costs.  It is only willing to share the costs, the 
expenditures and burden others with its problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to wrap up with a couple of simple questions I wish the 
government would apply to every piece of legislation it brought 
into this House.  One, who wants it?  Two, who wants to pay for 
it or who is going to pay for it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at these things time and again and the list goes on. 
Whether it is health care, jobs programs, or whatever it happens 
to be, even the minutiae in the railway safety act, we see time 
and again that the government likes to get its way but wants 
other people to pay for what it wants done.  The government does 
not like taking the costs itself. It likes sharing the burden 
with others.  This is a classic case of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government would have been willing to listen to some 
of the amendments from the opposition.  I wish it would have 
notified the stakeholders and given them appropriate time.  I 
wish it would have asked itself some of these crucial questions 
when proposing legislation like this.  The government failed on 
all of those accounts.  However, the government will get its way 
because it has a majority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK244">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
decisively, in response to the evidence in the Canadian Arctic 
Contaminants Assessment Report, to eliminate persistent organic 
pollutants by working to advance the POPs protocol. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, members may ask why we are debating 
this motion. The brief answer is that certain harmful polluting 
substances, which travel long distances, are landing in the 
Arctic.  The Government of Canada is constructively working with 
other governments in arriving at agreements to reduce these 
polluting substances, to protect human health, the environment, 
wildlife and people living in the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name of these polluting substances is POPs.  They are 
pesticides used in agriculture, chemicals such as PCBs, products 
such as chlorinated dioxins, furans, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons otherwise known as PAHs, resulting from fossil fuel 
combustion, the burning and processing of wood and other 
materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why the signature on the protocol of persistent 
organic pollutants or POPs is important and urgent.  Because 16 
nations are required to ratify the protocol so that the agreement 
to reduce organic pollutants goes into effect. 
I am told it will be open for signature by interested nations 
after December 21, 1998.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the Arctic is described in the Canadian Arctic 
contaminants assessment report which was produced last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report states that persistent organic pollutants from 
sources outside Canada and outside the Arctic have been 
transported to the Arctic by air. These pollutants find their way 
into the Arctic food chain and accumulate in traditional 
aboriginal foods.  As a result, high levels of the pesticides 
toxaphene and chlordane have been found in beluga muktoq and seal 
meat. In many cases, our Inuit people who eat even a very small 
quantity of traditional sources of meat may ingest more than what 
Health Canada considers tolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that neither toxaphene nor chlordane is 
used in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that report we find also that there are disturbing 
measurements of PCBs in the breast milk of Inuit women which are 
now among the highest levels in the world.  In the cases of 40% 
and over of Inuit women, the PCB in their blood is up to five 
times the level of concern prescribed by the Department of 
Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, human health depends on what we do about pollutants and 
in the case of the Arctic, about these POPs.  In southern Canada, 
Professor Jules Blais of the University of Ottawa whose research 
appeared in the journal <I>Nature</I> in October 1998 reports 
disturbing quantities of pesticides transported by air to the 
Rocky Mountains. In the Columbia ice fields and at Lake Louise, 
Professor Blais found traces of the prairie crop insecticide, 
lindane; endosulphan, a popular insect killer used in eastern 
Canada; chlordane, a banned termite terminator; and even DDT, a 
pesticide banned in Canada but still in use in China, in Mexico 
and in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also reports related to Denver and Mexico City. People 
may face a problem with respect to their drinking water from snow 
melts on mountains more than 3,000 metres high where there may be 
even greater accumulation of pollutants than found in our 
Rockies. Scientists in Switzerland have also expressed alarm 
because a number of Swiss towns also take their water from lakes 
high in the mountains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this points to the problems posed by these POPs as faced by 
people and governments in different continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Government of Canada, it therefore becomes necessary to 
control the release of these POPs that we still produce at home, 
such as dioxins and furans.  As long as we continue to produce 
them, POPs will enter the ecosystem and the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we pollute, the higher price we pay in terms of health 
care costs.  Many POPs we are told cause endocrine system 
defects, immune system dysfunction, reproductive abnormalities 
and developmental problems in humans. Some POPs can induce or 
promote cancers.  Here at home once we clean our own backyard, 
then of course we can urge our neighbours to clean up theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ratifying the POPs protocol becomes desirable so that other 
countries know we are serious about the reduction of these 
organic pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a lead role in the implementation of the new 
global agreement.  A meeting of international experts on organic 
pollutants held in Vancouver in 1995 produced recommendations. 
The agreement I am referring to is the one that UNEP, the United 
Nations environment program, produced to ensure that firm targets 
and timetables are set for the elimination of these POPs around 
the globe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take a great deal of political will to convince 
developing countries of the long term human health benefits of 
eliminating POPs.  It will also require significant financial 
resources to help those countries to change their processes and 
practices in agriculture and pest management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the World Bank and other international lenders, as a 
condition for giving financial aid, often force farmers in 
developing countries to use pesticides containing POPs.  This 
policy led to a meeting in Vancouver three years ago when 
international experts got together and came up with the following 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, that international and national banking practices should 
promote safe alternatives to and the reduction and elimination of 
POPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, that incentives for the use of safer pesticides and 
chemicals be offered to communities in developing nations in 
order to reduce and eliminate POPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, that there be an enforcement of stricter limits on 
pesticide residue on food and that countries be discouraged from 
using POPs in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, that human and ecological health be taken into account 
when making decisions related to trade and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of addressing the human health implications in 
the Arctic resulting from the long range transport of organic 
pollutants is proven by the northern contaminants program.  This 
will be funded in Canada for a further five years by the 
Government of Canada, in the amount of $6 million each year, for 
a total of $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elimination of these organic pollutants also points to the 
need to take action in Canada on several fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we must continue to do research on the effects of POPs. 
Second, we must enact strong legislation to eliminate and prevent 
POPs and enforce it.  Third, we must regulate industry 
efficiently and prevent damage to human health.  Fourth, we must 
ban substances that are dangerous to human health and, where 
certain substances cannot be banned, use pollution prevention 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are mindful of the fact that there are over 23,000 substances 
registered for use in Canada.  So far only a handful have been 
banned.  Thousands of others still need to be reviewed to 
determine if they are toxic and plans for their management, 
control and elimination still are to be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to implement a policy whereby health is given 
priority over the economy because, as we are discovering, over 
the long term a healthy society and a healthy environment ensure 
the foundation for a healthy economy.  This is the reason we as 
parliamentarians are interested in promoting and accelerating 
treaties which reduce international pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International organic pollutants, POPs, must be seen as a threat 
to health and the economy.  Pollutants from faraway places can 
and do harm us.  Hence, there is a necessity for agreements 
between governments so as to ensure good economic and 
environmental behaviour among nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For parliamentarians there is a role to play through the Arctic 
Council.  There are parliamentary colleagues in Scandinavia, the 
U.S.A. and Russia interested in preventing pollution.  The member 
for Lac-Saint-Louis and I discovered this fact several years ago 
and have at every opportunity advanced the cause of pollution 
prevention and reduction through the signature of protocols.  In 
the case of organic pollutants, we have done so in Iqaluit, in 
Salekhard, Russia and at the Council of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next year we intend to intensify our efforts in Brussels on the 
occasion of a meeting of the Arctic Council and again in 
Strasbourg at the Council of Europe.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude in urging colleagues in this House to speak 
forcefully in favour of pollution reduction and prevention and 
any initiative that can take us toward the reduction and virtual 
elimination of pollutants which are so damaging to human health, 
the economy and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the population on this globe grows and human activities 
intensify, it is becoming evident that we have to accelerate the 
process of pollution reduction and, where possible, pollution 
prevention through changes in industrial processes and practices 
if we are to make life on this planet possible in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of POPs is a classic example of international 
interdependence.  The pollutants we let into the atmosphere can 
harm people in distant places and the pollutants emitted in 
distant places harm us.  We have to renew the strong will which 
guided us in the seventies and the eighties and make a concerted 
new effort toward the goal of a pollution free society.  Today 
that is what this debate on POPs is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding, I am sure

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also led to believe, and perhaps this is my mistake, that 
copies were made available to the media prior to being made 
available to members.  That was not accurate either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made inquiries to the officials of the House of Commons 
and they inform me that they are doing their best to have copies

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
my privilege to stand today to speak to Motion M-37, moved by my 
hon. colleague from Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Davenport has been chairing the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development as we go 
through CEPA, a bill which has some 380 clauses and some 480 
amendments.  So his task in the last few weeks has been rather 
daunting.  It is encouraging to see that he still has the 
strength to be up on Friday speaking to his private member's 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree on how to get to a clean environment, in most 
respects, but we do agree that a clean environment is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
decisively, in response to the evidence in the Canadian Arctic 
Contaminants Assessment Report, to eliminate persistent organic 
pollutants by working to advance the POPs protocol. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important in order to fully understand this motion 
to explain the origin of the POPs protocol.  The roots of this 
protocol can be traced back to the creation of the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Europe, a forum at which the countries of 
North America, western, central and eastern Europe and central 
Asia came together to forge the tools of economic co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This large group of countries, with close historical ties, 
accounts for 64% of world production, but it also is responsible 
for 60% of the world's CO2 emissions. 
These facts illustrate the region's responsibilities toward its 
own people as well as toward those of the other regions of the 
world.  They are the backdrop against which UN/ECE's activities 
are carried out.  The ECE is intended to be a forum for dialogue 
aimed at bringing about better understanding and agreement on 
common guidelines and policies.  Where agreements are negotiated 
and assistance activities prepared, its main purpose is to 
harmonize the policies and practices of its member countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ECE has many different divisions, one of which deals with 
environment and human settlements.  One of the many bodies of 
this division is the executive body for the convention on long 
range transboundary air pollution.  This was drafted after 
scientists investigated the link between sulphur emissions in 
continental Europe and the acidification of Scandinavian lakes 
and later studied the possibility that air pollutants could 
travel several thousand kilometres before deposition and damage 
occurred.  This implied that co-operation at the international 
level was necessary to solve problems such as acidification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention was the first international legally binding 
instrument to deal with problems of air pollution on a broad 
regional basis.  It was signed in 1979 and entered into force in 
1983.  Since its entry into force the convention has been 
extended by seven protocols, one of which is a protocol on 
persistent organic pollutants.  The executive body adopted the 
protocol on persistent organic pollutants on June 24, 1998 in 
Denmark.  It focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been 
singled out according to agreed risk criteria.  The list contains 
eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three byproduct 
contaminants.  The ultimate objective is to eliminate any 
discharges, emissions and POPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol bans the production and use of some products. 
Others are scheduled for elimination at a later stage. The 
protocol severely restricts the use of DDT, HCH and PCBs. The 
protocol includes provisions for dealing with the wastes of 
products that will be banned.  It also obliges parties to reduce 
the emissions of dioxins, furans, PAHs and HCBs below their 1990 
levels.  It lays down specific limit values for the incineration 
of municipal hazardous and medical waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been host to the first of five negotiating sessions 
to be held over the next two years that will eventually see a 
legally binding treaty by 2000.  What does this mean to Canada? 
The Canadian Arctic was once considered pristine because of its 
remoteness and sparse population.  However, over the past 50 
years the north has been exposed to contaminants originating from 
local sources such as heavy industry and from distant regions of 
the world through air and sea currents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is the case we are faced with quite a dilemma.  Many 
of the contaminants of concern in the Arctic are pesticides and 
industrial chemicals that are no longer used in Canada and that 
in many cases have been banned or restricted for use in most of 
the developed world.  However, they continue to be used by 
developing countries and can be found in Canadian lakes, rivers 
and snow.  It is important for developing countries to be part of 
any protocol to reduce pollution in the world. Canada has been a 
world leader in assessing the problem of long range airborne 
pollutants but it will require co-operation on a global scale 
before the pollution problem is properly assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arctic ecosystems are very fragile.  The nature of these 
chemicals is such that they tend to accumulate in the tissues of 
living things.  Animals at the top of the food chain have been 
found with unexpectedly high levels of these contaminants which 
is cause for some concern for Inuit people.  The Inuit people 
rely heavily on naturally harvested foods such as fish, seals, 
caribou not only for their diet but also to maintain their 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were to be taken away the socioeconomic impact alone 
could be vast. Because of this heavy reliance on traditionally 
harvested foods northern aboriginal people are susceptible to 
exposure to the potential adverse effects of these contaminants. 
Although the Canadian arctic contaminants assessment report 
concludes there is not an immediate threat to the health of 
adults, there are concerns over possible health effects on unborn 
children and infants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not the right way to fix the problem.  The 
environmental damage to Canada's north is from more than just 
POPs. The motion is only a piecemeal solution to a much bigger 
problem. 
The government has not yet told Canadians how it is planning to 
deal with contaminated sites on federal lands.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the auditor general recognized that the government has 
no idea how to deal with the estimated 5,000 contaminated sites 
located on crown land in Canada.  It has no comprehensive view of 
the potential risk to health, safety and the environment 
associated with these sites.  It does not yet have a complete and 
accurate view of the related contingent or actual liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not developed and implemented a central 
timetable and has not finalized and implemented a high level 
environmental policy for common standards for due diligence in a 
consistent manner.  There is still confusion over who would take 
a leadership role with respect to this mess, so as a result there 
is no leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party recognizes the right of all Canadians to dwell 
in a clean and healthy environment.  It has been our policy from 
the beginning to support immediate long term restoration programs 
for areas of the environment damaged due to inadequate or 
improperly enforced regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this motion is not a long term restoration program for an 
area of the environment that has been damaged due to inadequate 
or improperly enforced regulations.  It is a solution to only a 
small part of a greater problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion lets the government off too easy.  When will we see a 
motion that would commit the government to a clear plan of 
action, a plan where it will take responsibility and show some 
leadership?  It would be seriously remiss for this House to 
approve this motion, although I know it is not votable, while 
ignoring the bigger problems Canada's northern people face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. Earlier the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley did 
not accuse the chairman of the finance committee of leaking the 
report but accused the chair of compromising his position to take 
advantage for himself while the other members of the committee 
were disadvantaged because the report was not available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that since the report was not printed 
the other members were disadvantaged.  Ethically it was not 
appropriate to use his position in this way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to 
support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1997 the Arctic environmental strategy, northern 
contaminants program issued the Canadian Arctic contaminants 
report.  This report was the result of 6 years of scientific 
research and more than 100 studies.  The results confirmed what 
northerners had been saying for years, that the environment is 
changing, people are becoming sick by compromised immune systems, 
thyroid malfunction, tumours and cancer.  These are unheard of 
through thousands of years of northern people's histories.  The 
fish, the caribou, the birds, they too are sick, the very food 
and sustenance of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The science identified a complete contamination of the northern 
ecosystem. Persistent contaminants could be found throughout the 
Arctic ecosystem: air, surface, sea water, suspended sediments, 
show, fish, marine mammals, seabirds and terrestrial plants and 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most frightening and shocking findings were that 
contaminants in northern people are in mothers' breast milk. PCBs 
and other chemicals are there.  There are very high levels of 
thyroid malfunction in the north as well.  The science calls it 
POPs, persistent organic pollutants.  They persist and they are 
unmanageable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party recognizes these POPs are an 
international concern, an issue that threatens ecosystems around 
the globe, a danger that is all too real for aboriginal peoples 
through the north as well as anyone else who lives in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this motion that calls for strong action on POPs and 
we commend the hon. member for Davenport for raising this issue, 
for his persistence and his dedication in doing so.  We are truly 
fortunate to have such a member of parliament among us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Arctic is one of the most susceptible and proven 
dumping grounds on earth for these insidious poisons.  The cold 
climate acts as a sink.  These pollutants do not evaporate to be 
carried elsewhere.  They persist and they remain in the north. 
They are known as the dirty dozen.  They are acknowledged 
deadlies and there are thousands more as yet undefined and 
unidentified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations meeting in Montreal for the elimination of 
POPs, held this June, is a significant step toward reaching a 
global treaty by 2000.  Canada's environment minister called for 
the elimination of POPs which do include PCBs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet she refuses to clean up the PCB laden Marwell tar pit in 
Whitehorse, Yukon.  This government owned the land, allowed it to 
be polluted then transferred it to the Yukon tar pit, PCBs and 
all.   Yet this government refuses any responsibility for these 
deadly pollutants in the middle of a major city in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worry that this government has little regard for transboundary 
contaminants in the north.  An excellent example of the obvious 
indifference demonstrated by this government to the environmental 
degradation in Yukon and the north is not limited to the mass 
deforestation encouraged by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call to the attention of the House a request for information 
on possible transboundary contaminants related to four decades of 
the United States military operations in Alaska.  POPs and 
environmental contaminants are known to be carried by the wind 
and water.  These operations were conducted within 200 kilometres 
of Canada's borders, perhaps carried across our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 29, 1998, I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
to determine if possible cross-border environmental contamination 
of Canadian territory, Yukon, had occurred.  This request was 
related to the following five points: chemical and biological 
weapons testing at the Gerstle River site of Alaska; 
transportation of replacement nuclear reactor cores to Fort 
Greely in 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1970; the March 1998 bunker bomb 
testing using depleted uranium bomb cases just across the border 
from Yukon; chemical weapons testing at Fort Wainright in the 
early 1990s; unexploded ordinance, nuclear waste storage, 
landfills and disposal sites at various points in Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not received a response to date, this after the November 
30 meeting in Washington D.C. with the minister's counterpart 
Madeline Albreight.  If northerners cannot receive a basic 
response from this government to concerns related to 
environmental contaminants such as chemical and biological 
weapons testing adjacent to the Yukon Territory, how can we 
expect any leadership related to international efforts related to 
persistent organic pollutants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we as a nation can acknowledge the terrible price the 
north is expected to pay for inaction.  Action is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote Craig Boljkovak, part of the U.N. 
treaty on persistent organic pollutants. Canada's moral 
authority is in peril: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present Canada is headed down a road where its hard fought 
gains in the form of a POPs treaty are being seriously 
undermined by its weak domestic record.  Political intervention 
is necessary at the highest level to put the government back on 
track.  The environment and its human inhabitants deserve no 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's international reputation belies its lack of domestic 
action on POPs and other toxics. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done a laudable job of publicizing the plight 
of the Arctic and the Great Lakes among countries considering 
action on POPs and Canada can be considered a driving force for a 
treaty. This high level of international activity unfortunately 
is not matched by domestic action on POPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the very citizens in the north who depend on our 
government to protect them and to protect the environment and 
food source in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action is needed.  Leadership is needed.  Political will is 
needed to reduce the pollutants, prevent their creation and to 
clean up old messes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yukon has over 200 abandoned military sites that need to be 
cleaned up and again this government cut funding to the Arctic 
environment strategy which identified these contaminated sites 
for clean-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has a serious involvement.  It has abandoned 
distant early warning sites, old military sites and airfield 
sites.  The list goes on and on. Much of this was done during the 
second world war but that does not mean it should not be cleaned 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with the words of Norma Kassi, a woman who 
represented the flatlands of Old Crow for many years. She is a 
Gwitchin woman: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was raised on Old Crow Flats in northern Yukon.  Old Crow Flats 
is one of the world's great wetlands, having more than 2000 lakes 
throughout 600,000 hectares just above the Arctic circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name of my people, Vuntut Gwitchin, means the caribou people 
of the lakes.  We've lived here for thousands and thousands of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time I've watched the birds come back to Old Crow 
Flats every spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was about ten years old, sitting with my 
grandfather at the lake where a lot of birds used to come. They 
would land and play and meet one another after their long trip. 
They made a lot of noise.  They were singing.  They were happy. 
They were telling stories. These birds I only knew in my own 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfather said to me “You know, someday when you are a 
woman you are going to see a lot of changes.  When there are only 
loons out there you are going to know that something is wrong 
with the land and the weather”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was 30 years ago.  Now I go back to Old Crow Flats every 
three or four years and I see the changes.  I sit at the same 
spot and I remember my grandfather's words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I return I see fewer animals, fewer fish, fewer 
birds.  The water is silent and so crystal clear I can see to the 
bottom.  There used to be so much activity, so much aquatic life, 
insects and little bugs.  But now I can't.  And now I see a pair 
of loons only out there and that is about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak this afternoon to 
Motion No. 37 as presented by the hon. member for Davenport that 
in the opinion of the House, the government should act decisively 
in response to the evidence in the Canada Arctic contaminants 
assessment report to eliminate persistent organic pollutants by 
working to advance the POPs protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yukon had the opportunity to speak to this 
motion.  She represents a riding obviously of a northern nature 
that is more susceptible to the effects of persistent organic 
pollutants than any other region of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that pollutants that are created from 
afar affect us no matter where we reside in this country.  Also, 
pollutants with respect to POPs produced where we live actually 
have an effect on individuals who live very far from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion refers to the Canadian Arctic contaminants assessment 
report.  I would like to read a few words of that report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Arctic was once considered pristine because of its remoteness 
and sparse population. However, over the last 50 years the north 
has been exposed to contaminants originating from local sources 
such as mining and from distant industrial and agricultural 
regions of the world. These persistent contaminants have been 
detected throughout Arctic ecosystems including air, surface 
seawater, suspended sediments and snow. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to highlight another comment with respect to 
POPs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants, known as 
POPs, heavy metals and radionuclides enter the Arctic through 
long range transport on air and water currents, with the 
atmosphere being the primary pathway. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is individuals who may not be responsible for 
manufacturing or creating these pollutants are actually victims 
of these pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to say that from 1985 to 87 PCBs were 
measured in the blood of Inuit in the community of Broughton 
Island, NWT, known to have a relatively high per capita intake of 
traditionally harvested foods.  Results showed that blood PCBs 
exceeded tolerable levels set by Health Canada in 63% of the 
females and males under 15 and in 39% of females 15 to 44.  In 6% 
of males 15 years and older, they also had a higher proportion of 
PCBs in their bodies than the acceptable level as set out by 
Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is the evidence of this report is actually calling on 
society and the world community to take actions.  POPs are carbon 
based chemical compounds that are products and byproducts of 
human industry.  They are highly toxic substances that cause a 
wide array of adverse health effects.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is about human health, that the pollutants we create 
affect others.   The member for Davenport encouraged all members 
of the House to speak aggressively about pollution prevention, 
the reduction of pollution and ultimately eliminating all 
persistent organic pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>POPs have what we refer to as a grasshopper effect.  They are 
released in the environment through evaporation and deposit and 
are transported through the atmosphere to regions far from the 
original source.  The colder the climate, the less these 
substances tend to evaporate.  As a result the north is a cold 
trap for them.  POPs can be found in people and animals living in 
regions such as the Arctic, thousands of kilometres from where 
POPs are produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This phenomenon is especially prominent in the north.  As a 
result Inuit women have up to eight times higher levels of PCBs 
in their breast milk than women in southern Canada.  These are 
well over the limits permissible by Health Canada.  Some POPs are 
known to affect the liver, the nervous system, the kidneys, the 
reproductive system and the immune system.  They are endocrine 
disrupters or hormone disrupting substances as we aggressively 
discussed as we went through clause by clause consideration of 
the Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No man is an island.  POPs is a global problem that requires 
global solutions.  I point to the DDT pesticide which has been 
used to combat malaria in a number of developing nations.  Even 
though DDT has been banned for a number of years in this country 
it ends up in our food chains.  As a wealthy industrialized 
country it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we develop 
replacements for pesticides such as DDT so that we can change 
practices for combating diseases such as malaria.  It is our 
responsibility to help the developing world, which has real 
concerns with respect to malaria, to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been done so far?  At the Rio earth summit in 1992 we 
began to discuss the issue.  Agenda 21, including chapter 19 
which called for an intergovernmental forum on chemical safety to 
promote and co-ordinate international work on chemicals, was 
adopted.  Countries were committed to formulating a joint plan of 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998 the intergovernmental negotiating committee met in 
Montreal to begin laying the framework for a global plan. 
Negotiators were asked to target a short list of the 12 most 
dangerous POPs known as the dirty dozen.  They were also assigned 
the task of defining a procedure for identifying new substances 
as candidates for future global action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be done?  The government needs to act quickly. The 
persistence of these substances and their accumulation in living 
tissue means that each year that passes without a solution will 
result in decades of additional exposure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second round of international treaty negotiation talks will 
take place in February 1999.  A deal must be reached by the year 
2000.  The only effective solution is to phase out and eliminate 
POPS as the source and to begin now.  CEPA, as is currently 
written, does not accomplish this fact and thereby continues to 
fail to protect the most exposed and vulnerable in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to phase them out.  We need to find replacements.  We 
need to change practices.  We need a stronger CEPA, one that 
assesses and classifies new substances quickly before they 
further contaminate the north.  The proposed system for assessing 
substances is weak.  Attempts to improve the new CEPA bill have 
been voted down by the government on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment 
spoke in committee.  She said it was perhaps too premature to 
include any kind of mechanism to address endocrine disrupters or 
hormone disrupting substances, many of which are POPs. 
I remind the hon. parliamentary secretary that in defeating 
amendments tabled by my colleague from the NDP, the member for 
York North, and the member for Lac-Saint-Louis, supported by the 
member for Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, and me, she had to build a 
coalition with Reform.  The parliamentary secretary is now 
building an environmental coalition with a party that is still 
challenging the science on climate change.

I am proud to report that Canada is actively pursuing initiatives 
and making great progress in the management and control of 
persistent organic pollutants or POPs, particularly with respect 
to foreign sources of substances that are impacting on the health 
and environment of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to this item I wish to begin by thanking the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Health, the Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and the Minister of 
Natural Resources for the effective way in which we have all 
worked together to make the POPs protocol a success story for 
Canada.  I also thank the member for Davenport for raising this 
very important issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our tracking of the POPs issue indicates that we are also making 
progress in aspects of great importance for the federal 
government, such as health, children and aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada has banned or greatly cut back on the use of 
POPs in the Canadian North, other countries continue to use 
them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>POPs continue to be a problem for Canadians since they are 
carried by air currents from sources outside Canada and are 
deposited in Canadian ecosystems, particularly in northern 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has contributed significantly to the science that has 
enabled us to substantiate the need for international action and 
agreements on persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.  We 
have stopped releases from most Canadian sources of POPs and 
reduced domestic emissions of heavy metals.  Unfortunately 
domestic efforts are not enough to protect the peoples of the 
Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing POPs in Canada's Arctic requires concerted 
international efforts.  Canada has played a leading role in using 
the scientific information contained in the Canadian Arctic 
contaminants assessment report and AMAP reports to achieve 
international action on contaminants reaching the Arctic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional protocols on the reduction of POPs and heavy metals 
have been drawn up under the Convention on Long-range 
Transboundary Air Pollution of the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These protocols, signed in June 1998 by 34 countries, including 
Canada, the United States, and the countries of Eastern and 
Western Europe, as well as the former Soviet Union, are the 
first enforceable major multinational agreements aimed at 
protecting the environment and human health by imposing limits 
on the release of POPs and heavy metals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These protocols will serve as a model for even broader world-wide 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June, under the auspices of the United Nations Environment 
Program, Canada hosted the initial session to negotiate a global 
POPs agreement, which is expected to be signed around the year 
2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada strongly supports this effort and is committed to playing 
a vigorous leadership role.  The government is committed to a 
continuing leadership role in moving the UNEP global initiative 
to a successful conclusion, for it is only through the concerted 
and vigorous action of all countries to eliminate or reduce their 
emissions of hazardous substances that Canada can achieve the 
protection it requires from these chemicals that know no borders.

one of the first, if not the first country to formally accept the 
controls on POPs specified in this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for Davenport for bringing this 
matter to the attention of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
because of the hour I will make only some brief remarks in 
thanking hon. colleagues for their interventions and input today. 
The members for Lethbridge, Yukon and Fundy—Royal brought out a 
number of additional issues and dimensions which are important. I 
concur with them that we should have an approach which is as 
broad as possible in resolving the question of pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lethbridge dwelt on the question of contaminated 
lands.  His observations reflect the reality there, as did those 
of the member for Yukon when referring to over 200 national 
defence sites that have been abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some difficulty in understanding completely the logic of 
the member for Lethbridge.  He said that he and his party cannot 
support this motion because it is not comprehensive enough and 
does not deal with all aspects of the issue that we are facing, 
not only on the POPs but also the contaminated lands and related 
issues.  It seems to me that there is a choice between 
incremental action and supporting any possible motion that moves 
the agenda forward or no action at all. It escapes my ability to 
follow the logic of the Reform Party in this respect, and I must 
say in other respects also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Yukon for her very kind 
remarks and friendly suggestions. She certainly brought to our 
attention the situation that is now being faced in the north, 
which probably was the same situation faced in the south several 
decades ago.  We should draw some lessons from what the 
northerners are telling us as to what they are observing so that 
we can see the necessity in prevention and that the north retains 
its pristine quality. Possibly through that lesson we can regain 
the lost ground in the south.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the member for Fundy—Royal who got a little 
carried away with partisan remarks which is understandable.  He 
felt it was necessary to put on record the achievements of the 
previous government.  We have not forgotten that record.  He 
certainly reinforced the theme of this motion and provided a 
helpful observation which I will take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the parliamentary secretary for the good news she gave 
the House and for emphasizing the importance of co-operation in 
achieving something which, because of its international nature, 
is extremely difficult.  Canada has developed a skill for which 
we are highly respected abroad, namely the capacity to bring 
diverging interests together in the pursuit of the environmental 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It being after 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.31 p.m.)
