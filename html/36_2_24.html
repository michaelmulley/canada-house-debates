<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CIVIL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-4, an act to 
implement the agreement among the Government of Canada, 
Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the 
Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, 
and the Government of the United States of America concerning 
co-operation on the civil international space station and to make 
related amendments to other acts, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that I rise to begin third reading of Bill C-4, the civil

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues in the House will recall from the second 
reading debate, the international space station is the world's 
most ambitious civil undertaking in the area of science and 
technology.  Canada is honoured and privileged to have played a 
very crucial and central role in this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 40 flights of the U.S. space shuttle will be required to 
loft this impressive outpost of humanity into orbit.  Canada has 
already embarked on this exciting adventure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSA astronaut Julie Payette flew to the space station in May of 
this year.  Next year, CSA astronauts Marc Garneau and Chris 
Hadfield are scheduled to participate in missions to the space 
station, ultimately delivering Canada's principle contribution: 
the mobile servicing system, Canada's next generation, state of 
the art space robot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A project of such scope and grandeur required the definition of 
a very elaborate management regime, negotiated over several years 
and laid out in detail in the international agreement.  This 
multilateral treaty brings together 15 participating nations in a 
truly global space station partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Bill C-4 implements our commitments under the 
international agreement by bringing Canadian legislation in line 
with that agreement.  Let me point out that much of this text can 
be implemented directly without changes to the existing law.  In 
other areas changes were clearly necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, and most importantly, Bill C-4 extends the application of 
Canada's criminal code to the Canadians onboard the space station 
and, in exceptional circumstances, to foreign nationals as well. 
This is similar in principle to the other extraterritorial 
applications of the criminal code, for example on high-sea oil 
drilling platforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, however, there is something new and exciting about 
extending the application of the Canada law beyond the immediate 
borders of our planet.  As the space station partners defined the 
legal regime of the first truly international, collaborative, 
crewed space vehicle, Canada was at the very heart of those 
discussions.  Through Bill C-4, Canada will enact into law the 
principles it helped define. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also ensures, for example, that Canadian law applies to 
Canadians travelling to and from the space station, rather than 
the law of the carrying countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 also ensures that information essential to meeting our 
space station commitments is available to the Canadian government 
and that any information provided to meet those commitments is 
used exclusively for that and only that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues will also recall that during second reading in the 
House, every party spoke strongly in favour of this outstanding 
project and Canada's unique role, of course.  During our 
committee sessions, we were able to move quickly and, let me say, 
competently through the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must take a moment now to thank my colleagues from both sides 
of the House, in particular the members of the Standing Committee 
on Industry, for their strong support behind the passage of the 
legislation.  The members of the committee co-operated 
efficiently and while taking an earnest interest in the bill and 
the ISS program did not delay its passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment was proposed by the committee to section 10 of the 
bill, an amendment which would ensure that any amendments to the 
intergovernmental agreement would be laid before parliament so 
that we are made aware of the evolving nature of Canada's ISS 
related commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although technical in nature, this implementing legislation is a 
crucial step on the path toward the ratification of the 
intergovernmental agreement.  Canada made a clear commitment to 
the space station when it signed the agreement in January 1998. 
Ratification will clear the path for Canada and ultimately for 
all space station partners and open a new era of space 
exploration:  the operation and utilization of the world's 
largest permanently inhabited laboratory station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pride, Mr. Speaker, that I ask you today to 
help bring this remarkable project to a close and make it indeed 
a reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy today to participate in the debate on Bill C-4.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is now at third reading.  The Reform Party is 
interested in having this pass the House, proceed to the Senate 
and receive royal assent so that we can implement Canada's 
obligation under the agreement we signed with the other parties 
to this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure today to speak to Bill C-4, which the Reform 
Party supports very heartily.  It is a new and exciting frontier 
which Canada is privileged to participate in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 implements the agreement that Canada signed last year 
with the United States, Japan, Russia and 11 countries of the 
European Union.  The agreement formulates Canada's participation 
in the international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station is a bold and exciting project which has 
nations around the world working together in a spirit of 
co-operation rather than rivalry.  We have moved to a new point 
in our world development where we are seeing more and more 
international co-operation on many projects. I certainly welcome 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite different than the environment that existed only 
10 years ago when the collapse of the Soviet Union brought a new 
era to world peace and world co-operation.  We need to welcome 
that spirit of co-operation that exists today.  We know what 
happened when we had 50 or more years of cold war and the 
difficulties that led to, including the Berlin wall which divided 
East and West Germany.  We have seen in the papers just recently 
the 10 year anniversary of the fall of the great wall.  It 
signified a change in direction that was very welcome in terms of 
international co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a step that will enhance co-operation.  We 
will have the ability to study our globe from the outlook of the 
space station orbiting above the earth.  I think this will be 
very beneficial to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this spirit of co-operation.  It is the largest science 
and technology project in the history of humanity.  Canadians 
should be proud of the role we are playing and will continue to 
play in this key role of its development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final form, the station will cover an area as large as a 
football field, weigh 450 tonnes and be clearly visible in the 
night sky as it orbits the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more young people are interested in astronomy and have 
telescopes to observe the different constellations and stars.  I 
think it will be interesting that they will see pictures coming 
back from the space station.  They will see pictures of Canada's 
involvement in building the space station.  They will also be 
able to use their telescopes to see the space station in the 
night sky as it orbits the earth and does its good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The habitation modules and the laboratories will accommodate a 
permanent international crew of seven astronauts dedicated to 
advancements in areas of biotechnology, engineering, earth 
observations and telecommunications.  Those are all key areas in 
which Canada is striving to develop new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as the critic for the area of industry, these are 
all areas that we recognize in Canada as areas of growth for 
Canadian business.  The telecommunications industry is one that 
Canada is very, very good at.  Nortel comes to mind as a case in 
point.  According to an announcement last week, it is expanding 
right here in the Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications in a large country like Canada is a very 
important aspect.  We are now able to have satellite phones with 
connections in the Arctic.  It does not really matter where we 
live in Canada these days, we can develop a home based business 
because of the ability of Canadians to be able to use the new 
technologies that are developed through telecommunications.  I 
suggest that will be enhanced by the Canadian involvement in the 
space station.  I would think companies like Nortel and others 
could take advantage of the space station to develop new 
technologies, try them out, deliver them to the Canadian space 
station and apply the scientific results that accrue from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of biotechnology is a very big industry in Canada these 
days. 
I know there is work being done at the University of Alberta in 
Edmonton.  It has an expanding role in agriculture, but not just 
agriculture, and it is certainly one that I believe is going to 
serve us well into the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is an opportunity for Canadian companies to have a 
vehicle for research and development, perhaps with some 
co-operation through the labs that are on board with the United 
States and Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Earth observation, I will be speaking to that a bit 
later, but I see that as an important aspect of this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the Reform Party will support the 
speedy passage of the bill.  I recognize that there is some 
urgency in getting it passed quickly to meet the commitments that 
we have made to our partners in this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say, though, that we have some concern about the way 
these international agreements are developed and the role that 
the House of Commons plays, or in this case does not play, in the 
development of those agreements.  I am not speaking only about 
international agreements, I am also speaking about agreements 
such as the one that was made between the government and the 
Nisga'a people where there has been very little consultation in 
places like British Columbia.  Even here in parliament the 
government brings the Nisga'a deal to us and has us rubber stamp 
it without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns about the way these agreements are developed. I 
know the former minister for international trade, Mr. Marchi, 
decided that it was important to consult civil society. 
Therefore, I think there is a new era developing in Canada in 
terms of how we develop international agreements.  The only 
reason I am talking about it in light of the space station bill 
is that it is just another example of an agreement that is 
brought here.  I know that amendments can and are being made in 
this particular case, but the basic agreement was put in place 
and brought here with the intent that parliament would just 
approve it and not alter it in any meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case I do not think we need to alter it in 
any substantial way, but parliament would like to have the 
ability to do that and not just act as a rubber stamp for 
government. That is a concern that we have in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest, and many of my colleagues have a keen interest in the 
area of space development.  It is the new frontier.  It is a 
frontier that is probably comparable in many ways to the 
industrial revolution, a frontier that was opened up by the steam 
boat and trains back in the early 1800s in England, eventually 
leading to development all over the world, in particular North 
America.   We know what happened when the steam locomotive was 
developed, how it opened up Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a distant relative who was involved in developing and in 
fact was credited with being the first person to manufacture the 
first locomotive and the first railway, George Stephenson, which 
took place in northern England in the Newcastle area.  He 
observed that there was rail track on which coal cars were 
hauling coal from the mines to the ocean for export.  Those coal 
cars were being pulled by oxen.  At the same time there were 
stream pumps being used in the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My great great uncle was a 10 year old boy working in the mine. 
His job eventually led to making sure the steam pump worked to 
pump the water out of the mine.  This man had a son, his only 
son, Robert Stephenson, who became famous in his own right.  He 
had enough money to send his son to school.  That was not a 
common occurrence in those days in early England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very significant that George Stephenson was illiterate. 
He was the man who developed the steam locomotive which opened up 
the world in terms of having railways across Canada, the United 
States, Brazil and Europe, which enabled us to have speedy 
transportation. 
He scraped every cent together so that he could send his son 
Robert to school.  Robert came home with his books and George 
Stephenson learned to read and write with the help of his eight 
year old son.  It is a very interesting story.  His son went on 
to do famous things.  They worked together on the improved model 
of the steam locomotive, the rocket, which is still on display in 
northern England.  Robert Stephenson built railways all over the 
world.  He built the railway bridge, the first bridge across the 
St. Lawrence River in Canada, which was called the Victoria 
Bridge.  The bridge has been rebuilt and remains in the same 
location.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of us in the Reform Party are interested in this new 
technology.  I suggest that it is not much different from what 
happened in the early days of the steam locomotive and the 
industrial revolution.  We are on the verge of a launch into 
space.  We are on the verge of being able to observe our planet 
much better with our involvement in the space station and we will 
learn a lot more about ourselves in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to visit the NASA 
space science centre in Houston.  I saw some of the rockets that 
boosted some of the early satellites into orbit, as well as the 
early shuttles.  I marvelled at the technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an exciting frontier.  In 1957 Russia sent the first 
satellite, Sputnik, into orbit and now we are co-operating with 
that very country, which was formerly a communist country. 
Russia had a tremendous difference in philosophy from that of the 
United States and Canada.  In just over 40 years we have moved 
from the first satellite in orbit to co-operating with Russia to 
build the international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be thankful that Russia is involved in this project. 
It has the ability with its rockets to send up a lot of the 
material that is needed to build this very big space station.  It 
takes a lot of capacity to do that.  Russia has that capacity. 
Even though it is having some difficulty these days financially, 
we think it is going to meet its commitments in delivering its 
part of the space station into orbit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be thankful to Russia for another reason.  When it 
joined the international space station project it insisted that 
the orbit of the space station would fly on a more northerly 
route from time to time.  Over a period of one month the 
international space station will vary its orbit from 52° south to 
52° north.  That is very good news for Canada because it will fly 
over parts of Canada where it probably would not have flown if 
Russia had not insisted that development take place.  It wants to 
observe its country as well and it is basically on the same 
latitude as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space station will be angled.  It will be 400 kilometres 
above the earth, and at 52° latitude we will be able to see a big 
part of our country and observe what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get to the reasons we are supporting this bill, I will 
provide listeners with a bit of background as to when and how the 
space station got its start.  Its history goes back to 1984. 
President Reagan of the United States directed NASA to develop 
and place into orbit a permanently manned space station.  At the 
time, President Reagan invited friends and allies to participate 
in its development and to share in its benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may remember President Reagan talking about the star wars 
concept at the same time.  That has not actually developed in any 
meaningful way, but the space station is a survivor.  The first 
section of the space station has already been delivered into 
orbit and different components are going to be set up and joined 
together shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Quebec summit in March 1985, Canada accepted the 
invitation to confirm Canada's interest in the co-operation at a 
summit meeting in Washington the following year.  At the same 
time, various other countries expressed interest in the project 
and over the years signed memorandums of understanding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was recognized that Russia could greatly enhance the 
capabilities of the space station.  Not only does it have the 
boost capacity, it has a long list of accomplishments in the area 
of human space flight and missions of long duration.  Russian 
astronauts have been in space for long periods of time and that 
has greatly enhanced our ability to study whether we can have 
permanent life on space stations in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 6, 1993 Russia was invited to take part in the 
project.  Arrangements were then made for co-operation on human 
space flight activities, including the Russia and United States 
Mir shuttle program, to prepare for the building of the space 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Russia will derive benefits from this as well.  Russia is a very 
big country.  Now that the Soviet Union has broken up, we 
naturally think that Canada must be the largest country in the 
world.  Large parts of the Soviet Union broke away from Russia 
when the mentality of the eastern bloc started to come apart.  We 
know of countries such as Ukraine which claimed independence on 
its own. However, we have to recognize that even though that 
happened, Russia is still twice as big as Canada, and Canada is 
the second biggest country in the world.  We have much land and 
water to view from the space station, but Russia has even more 
and I know its people would be greatly interested in using the 
space station to do that.  In fact, they are building a science 
lab of their own to perform scientific studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 29, 1998 the countries got together and signed the 
civil international space station agreement which established a 
framework for the design, development, operation and utilization 
of the space station.  Bill C-4 seeks to implement the agreement 
signed last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international agreement that was signed by Canada, the 
United States, Japan, Russia and 11 European countries contains 
28 articles and an annex which summarizes the tasks to which the 
various countries have committed themselves.  In Canada's case 
the space agency will provide three elements:  a mobile servicing 
centre, a special purpose dexterous manipulator, the new 
generation Canadarm that is going to be used to put the space 
station together and service it afterward, and space station 
unique ground elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The articles lay out the objective and scope of the agreement, 
international rights and obligations, ownership of the elements 
and the equipment and the management of the space station.  As 
well, aspects of design and development are covered, the right to 
provide qualified crew, transportation and right of access to the 
space station and the provision of a communications network, 
which are all important things that need to be settled early in 
the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each partner will bear the cost of fulfilling its respective 
responsibilities under the agreement, including sharing on an 
equitable basis a common systems operating cost and activities 
attributed to the operation of the space station as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that there has been some delay in the 
project because of the involvement of the United States in the 
lift capacity.  The space shuttle program is undergoing repair 
and some of the shuttles need fairly extensive work.  On the 
other side, the last couple of Russian delivery rockets have 
failed to deliver satellites into space and have actually burned 
up.  There is some work to do to make sure that these important 
components which they will be lifting into orbit will be able to 
deliver the merchandise.  It is very expensive technology that we 
are delivering and we want to be absolutely sure that something 
does not go awry.  We do not want to have to start over again 
with building different modules to replace anything that might 
happen to be accidentally destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody is pretty hopeful that after a short delay some of 
these problems will be ironed out, we will be back on track and 
the space station will be developed in an orderly manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 19 of the agreement deals with the exchange of data and 
goods.  Each partner to the agreement agrees to transfer all 
technical data and goods considered necessary for the fulfilment 
of the responsibilities of the partners.  Bill C-4 actually 
contains provisions in clause 7, giving the agreement the power 
to force companies, individuals and third parties that are not in 
direct contractual relationship to the crown to release 
information related to the space agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why that would be necessary.  It is necessary in 
the event that a company working under contract to the government 
on a project is bought out by another company which may be 
unwilling to honour the company's contractual obligations.  The 
partners did not want to be held up to ransom if that were to 
happen.  This is the reason for the particular clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 of the bill provides safeguards to ensure that 
documents so produced are not unduly communicated to other 
parties.  Because they will require these companies, if they are 
bought out, to fulfil their contractual obligations, they want to 
safeguard that they will not be produced and sent out, that the 
information in those contractual arrangements will not be sort of 
public knowledge, and that they would be guaranteed with some 
process defined in clause 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the exchange of information and scientific data is crucial 
to the successful development of the entire project, the 
protection of intellectual property rights is also very 
important.  We talked about this point in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary referred to the fact that we had 
pretty speedy passage in committee of Bill C-4, but when the 
space agency people appeared before the committee that was one of 
the questions I raised because I think it is important that 
intellectual property rights or any product development in the 
space station be guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many partners involved in the space station and many 
people from different countries working there.  It is absolutely 
important that any research and development that leads to product 
development or new service development is not stolen.  It needs 
to be protected.  That is the reason we were concerned that 
intellectual property rights have proper protection.  We were 
assured that was the case.  The agreement contains article 21 
which states the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of intellectual property law, an activity 
occurring in or on a Space Station flight element shall be deemed 
to have occurred...in the territory of the Partner State of that 
element's registry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a Canadian is developing it, it is essentially protected as 
if it were developed in Canada.  Normal patent procedures will 
apply, which means that the person or entity first filing a 
patent is the owner of that intellectual property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains amendments to the criminal code.  The 
amendments ensure that any criminal acts committed in space by a 
Canadian crew member fall under Canadian law.  While that is not 
likely to happen, we did not know what developments could occur 
there.  We wanted to make that each country would try that 
particular person under its own law.  That is important for 
Canada's well-being as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's involvement in this matter goes goes back away. 
Recently Julie Payette became the first Canadian to board the 
first component of the space station.  In the year 2000, which is 
not far away, Marc Garneau will participate in his third space 
mission as a crew member on the shuttle.  He will be followed by 
Chris Hatfield who will instal Canada's space station robotic 
manipulator system, the new generation Canadarm, and the main 
element of the mobile servicing system.  It is called MSS for 
short.  Once installed, the MSS will move around the space 
station doing assembly and repair work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learn a lot from nature.  Even in flight itself we have 
learned from nature.  Here again they are sort of emulating how 
the inchworm moves, and the new Canadarm will move in exactly the 
same way.  It will attach itself, loop, attach to the other end 
and pick up.  It will be able to assemble components of the space 
station by moving around the space station as if it were an 
inchworm doing its work. 
Canadians will be able to see this happening as the space station 
is developing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also contributing a vision system for the operators of 
this remote manipulator.  They have to be inside the space 
station when they are doing it to minimize exposure to danger. 
They will be doing this from a windowless space station, so there 
is a need for a vision system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the ground the MSS operation complex at the Canadian Space 
Agency in Saint-Hubert, Quebec, will plan missions, monitor the 
condition of the remote manipulator, and train the space station 
crew in its use.  The cost of designing, developing, operating 
and launching the MSS into orbit is approximately $1.4 billion 
over 20 years.  That project actually started in 1984 so it 
includes the years 1984 to 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately $3 per Canadian taxpayer per year is Canada's 
contribution.  Although Canada's contribution will be $1.4 
billion, it is still relatively small in terms of the total 
project at just 2.5%.  It is important nonetheless.  The 1999 
federal budget provides the Canadian Space Agency with $430 
million in new funds over three years, which stabilizes the 
agency's budget at $300 million per year starting in the year 
2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific benefits for Canada from the space station will 
be our ability to monitor the earth; to study our environment 
including agriculture, crop monitoring and the Arctic ice pack; 
and to aid navigation for shipping.  These are all very important 
elements.  That is one reason we are so happy the deflection in 
the orbit will take it to 52.5° north, which will probably fly 
over somewhere between Red Deer and Edmonton, Alberta, on its 
most northerly flight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a very large country, as I said earlier.  We have a 
lot of land mass and water to monitor.  We want to make sure, for 
example, that our environment is being protected.  We will have 
the ability through the Canadian space station to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of agriculture and crop monitoring, we will be able to 
see where areas are under stress because of lack of moisture or 
too much moisture.  We will see where there is stress in terms of 
erosion that is affecting agriculture over the years and will 
design programs to fix it.  Of course that is assuming there will 
be any Canadian farmers to worry about in the future.  Because 
agriculture is in a very tough state right now the Liberal Party 
needs to do some work to make sure that Canadian farmers are here 
down the road in 10 years when the space station will be doing 
the majority of its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw an interesting infrared picture one time of the 
Canada-U.S. border taken from a satellite.  This is the type of 
monitoring we will be able to do.  Some people asked how we could 
see the 49th parallel between North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan 
and Alberta, how we could tell that was the border.  We could 
tell because the infrared rays picked up what types of crops were 
being grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with government policy.  Government policy has its 
shortcomings but one reason we can see the Canada-U.S. border is 
that the United States subsidizes its grain farmers so 
extensively that right up to the 49th parallel in North Dakota 
and Montana grain crops were being grown.  On the Alberta and 
Saskatchewan side, the land was left in grass because there was 
not sufficient money to encourage farmers to grown grain crops. 
The different colours that showed up on the infrared picture 
because of the different crops being grown showed the Canada-U.S. 
border for hundreds of miles.  That is the type of thing we will 
be able to see from the Canadian space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 90% of Canada's investment is going into contracts 
to Canadian firms.  The rest is going to universities.  Since 
1987 over 150 contracts have been let for automation and robotics 
technology development.  During the space station's estimated 10 
year lifespan Canada will be able to expand it research in 
micro-gravity with applications into human disorders such as 
osteoporosis and cancer.  Canada will also continue its research 
into protein crystallization in space for the medical industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important element in Canada's involvement is that we have 
the ability to do quite a bit of research to aid Canadians in the 
future in terms of important studies into subjects like 
osteoporosis.  A lot of the female population at a certain age 
suffers from this condition.  The Russians who worked in space 
for long periods of time have been studied as a result, because 
the same conditions exist in space and space travel where 
significant bone density loss occurs if a person stays too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important area to Canada.  How that happens and what 
can be done to correct it will help an aging population in 
Canada, and we have an aging population as baby boomers start to 
work through our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cancer research is very important work that will be done by 
scientists on the space station.  There will be co-operation with 
other countries such as the United States in its space 
laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technologies that have already resulted from our space 
involvement include the first robotic refuelling station.  When 
we are spending this amount of money, $1.4 billion, people have 
to see some concrete physical example of how it helps us on an 
everyday basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a northern country.  In northern Alberta, where I 
come from, sometimes during the winter, in January, the 
temperature reaches -40°C and even lower. We know that shopping 
centres with indoor stores help to combat the cold.  In downtown 
Ottawa we can go through a network of malls for several blocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a northern country we need to find ways to work with the 
Canadian winter.  The new technology for refuelling stations 
being developed by a firm in British Columbia in partnership with 
Shell is doing just that.  While the first development is 
actually in California, it is my understanding we can now drive 
our cars to service stations and not even get out because a 
robotic system fills the cars with fuel.  I can imagine the 
application and benefit of that when it is 45° below outside.  We 
will not have to get out of our cars and freeze a bit in the 
process.  There will be developments which apply to us and have 
everyday application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Quebec firm applied space expertise to develop a digital 
imaging system for x-rays which eliminates the need for 
photographic film.  In addition, a company in Newfoundland has 
developed a sensitive skin, originally developed for space 
robotic manipulators, that is now being applied to artificial 
limbs and even car bumpers to control the release of airbags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are examples of technology we will be using on an everyday 
basis.  I believe many more of those kinds of advances will be 
used in practical ways in our own country as a result of this 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the horrific wars in which Canada has been involved in 
the 20th century there have been technologies and new product 
developments because of the need to win which have actually 
benefited Canadians in civilian use.  Various examples of 
expertise have been developed in a warring fashion.  Why can we 
not have the same kind of development in the peaceful 
co-operation that is taking place as a result of the 
international space station? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think international space station co-operation will be 
expanded into the future.  Although the space station's life is 
scheduled to be only about 10 years, in talking to Mac Evans, 
head of the Canadian Space Agency, and others, I am told that 
there are components which will be obsolete in 10 years. 
Because they are components, a shuttle flight can be sent up with 
a new component.  The old section that has become obsolete 
because of the new technologies can be replaced with the new one. 
Plug it in and it becomes part of the new space station.  It will 
be a continual process of upgrading over time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many firms have succeeded in entering the international market 
by landing contracts based on the expertise they have gained from 
working on various aspects of the space project.  Other firms are 
helping partner countries with their own contribution to the 
space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Ottawa company EMS Technologies recently won a 
$9.5 million contract with Mitsubishi to supply electronics for 
Japan's contribution to the space station. Ripples occur and 
Canadians benefit beyond our own involvement.  In this case we 
are taking advantage of Japan's involvement by supplying it with 
electronics for the space station itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada's involvement has produced tremendous 
returns so far.  Satellites are being used for 
telecommunications, as I said earlier, in such areas as our very 
remote Arctic.  I travelled in the Arctic a few years ago with 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  People were using cell phones that had direct linkages to 
satellites.  They could talk to someone thousands of miles away 
in the Arctic without using any wire control telephone system. 
The wireless system takes advantage of the new technologies in 
space provided by our satellites.  Canada is continually putting 
up more satellites to increase this capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to us that we have this co-operation and that we 
be involved with the space station.  On our own we would never be 
able to develop or fund a project of this magnitude.  It is very 
big.  As I said, Canada's involvement amounts to 2.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential for a meaningful contribution therefore has to 
come from co-operating with others.  The potential for this 
meaningful contribution and rewarding spinoffs is very great. We 
do not know where it is going to lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been unmanned flights to Mars to explore the surface 
of that planet and there has been talk about a manned flight.  We 
hope that this international agreement and co-operation can lead 
to other successful ventures in the future such as a manned 
flight to Mars. I think there would have to be some new lift 
capacity. My understanding is a trip to Mars and back takes about 
three or four years which is a pretty significant investment of 
time.  I am not sure who would want to make that investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our co-operation in the international space station is most 
important for the young people of Canada.  They will follow 
Canada's achievements in space thereby sparking their interest in 
the fields of science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a very well educated population to compete in the 
future.  Our astronauts Julie Payette, Chris Hadfield and Marc 
Garneau have been travelling around the country.  They have 
travelled to space and have worked to develop the space station. 
Their interest will spark the interest of our young people to get 
involved in science and perhaps work in that area in the future 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to be reminded that our future prosperity lies in 
our ability to encourage the pursuit of knowledge for those 
following behind us.  As in the past, they are the building 
blocks in scientific areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the House that the Reform Party is supporting 
this bill.  We are very supportive of our involvement in the 
space agency. My colleagues and I wish Canada well in the future 
in whatever endeavours we might undertake in a co-operative 
nature with other countries to explore far beyond where we are 
now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also in favour of this bill, but the 
government does not have much respect for us as 
parliamentarians, in having us vote on an agreement entered into 
nearly two years ago, right at the two year limit set for its 
ratification.  I say right at the two year limit because the 
final date is January 29, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the House does not sit in January or over the holiday 
period unless there is an emergency and the bill has to go to 
the other House, we are really up against the deadline. 
Imagine, as parliamentarians, what would happen if it did not go 
through.  The government has been spending money under this 
agreement for two years.  It would be a fine mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a pretty strange way to finish up this millennium. 
It was precisely in order to avoid a repetition of such a thing 
that my colleague for Beauharnois—Salaberry recently introduced 
private member's Bill C-214.  Its intent is to get parliament 
more involved in ratifying treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech before this House, the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry indicated that the present Government of 
Canada, like the previous one, appears to be following a British 
tradition, one followed by member countries of the Commonwealth, 
one that is not a practice in most other democratic countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat what my colleague has said, but I will point 
out that in the United States, surely the most advanced country 
as far as space is concerned, a two-thirds vote of the Senate is 
required for an agreement of this nature to be ratified by the 
president. 
We can see therefore we have a way to go in terms of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question. Regardless of what the members opposite have 
to say, is Canada still dependent on the British system, since 
we retain many of the parliamentary rules and traditions of this 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with space, therefore electronics and very 
advanced science and technology.  I have been in a number of 
parliaments on delegation visits.  In most western countries 
that have parliaments, votes are taken electronically from the 
desks of the members.  They insert a smart card, and the 
calculations are done automatically.  They do this in the 
States, as in many other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a bill and will soon have to vote on it, rising 
each in turn.  It is perhaps a good thing that we all rise, but 
the calculations must still be done manually in the best country 
in the world, as the Prime Minister often says.

encourages Canadians to get connected, but is unable to connect 
its own parliament.

and for approximately 10 months of the year I lose $110 to 
employment insurance and $140 to the CPP”.  He is afraid that he 
will not collect the CPP and he cannot claim employment 
insurance.  He said, “Even before I get a chance to pay into 
other things that are supposed to help take care of my family, I 
have to give almost $1,400 to the federal government.  Because of 
the debt we have, my wife and I have decided that only the kids

for ourselves or our extended family.  So much for merry.  There

</I></B></P><P align=left>1989 was also the year that the House of Commons voted 
unanimously to pass a motion by NDP leader Ed Broadbent to 
eradicate child poverty by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are noble concepts, but how have we fared when it comes to 
putting words into action?  In 1989, 14% of Canadian children 
lived in poverty.  In 1999, that figure is 21%, an increase of 
50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, Canada still refuses to sign ILO Convention 
No. 138, prohibiting labour by children under 14 years of age. 
It refuses to ban the importation of goods made by child labour. 
It refuses to push for rigid labour standards in international 
trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we are not doing that well in living up to the 
spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It seems 
that if we starve one child we can be thrown into jail for child 
abuse, but if we deprive 1.5 million kids of the basic needs to 
survive, the government calls it balancing the budget and it 
might even get a person elected as prime minister.

the aim of creating a breach through the German Hindenburg Line. 
The Fort Garry Horse, as part of the Canadian Calvary Brigade, 
was given the task of spearheading the assault and the special 
mission of capturing a German corps headquarters behind the enemy 
lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that day, Lieutenant Harcus Strachan took command of B 
Squadron when his commander was killed by machine-gun fire.  With 
his sword drawn, Lieutenant Strachan led a charge of 129 men on 
horseback to destroy a German artillery battery.  He won the 
Victoria Cross, an astonishing feat of conspicuous bravery and 
leadership during operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Fort Garry Horse continue to serve Canada with 
distinction.  In recent years, they have been on operations in 
Cyprus, the Golan Heights, the Sinai and various missions in the 
former Yugoslavia with the UN and NATO.  The Garrys also helped 
out at home during the 1997 Manitoba flood and the Pan-Am games 
held last—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Wednesday I had the misfortune of attending the 
Indian affairs committee hearing on the Nisga'a treaty in Prince 
George. Why taxpayers would pay to fly pro treaty witnesses from 
Vancouver Island and the lower mainland to Prince George while 
denying locals the opportunity to be heard is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government has proven the hearings to be the farce 
that we feared, will the government now conduct a province-wide 
referendum so that the people of British Columbia can have a say 
on the Nisga'a treaty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the decisions of the committee with respect to witnesses 
are the decisions of that group.  They are not decisions of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the committee hearings are indications of how the 
democratic processes of parliamentary government are working. 
People are being heard at the committee hearings, including those 
not favourable to the treaty.  After the committee hearings are 
completed, there will be further debate in the House at report 
stage and third reading, as well as in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic process based on our system of parliamentary 
government is working and the Reform Party should admit that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reality is that the Liberal majority on the 
committee decided who the witnesses were going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Prince George on Wednesday the committee only heard from four 
witnesses all day, three of which were from southern British 
Columbia.  Even though three other organizations backed out at 
the last minute, the committee chair denied representatives from 
B.C. in Focus and the Central Interior Logging Association an 
opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the Nisga'a have had a direct vote on this treaty.  Other 
affected Indian bands have not been granted the same right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before it rams the Nisga'a treaty through this House, will the 
government conduct a referendum so that all British Columbians, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal alike, can have a direct vote on 
the Nisga'a treaty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me say that the work of a committee, it is very 
clear under our rules, is for the committee itself.  The hon. 
member should know that.  He did not get here yesterday, although 
he is acting like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we are not intending to ram this through the House. 
We want to provide reasonable time for debate but we also need to 
take decisions.  Parliament is for debate but it is also for 
decisions.  We hope that we will have the support of the Reform 
Party to let the democratic process based on our system of 
parliamentary government work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why would the government spend hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to fly the committee to northern British Columbia and not 
hear from people from that area directly affected by this treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, taxpayer money was spent to fly an author from 
Vancouver to speak, yet the people from Prince George, the people 
who took time off from work to attend those committee meetings, 
were denied the right to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government agree with the recently deposed premier of 
B.C., Glen Clark, that the reason for denying a referendum to the 
people of British Columbia is because the government knows that 
it will fail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should not try to rewrite history, even 
if it is recent history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the committee list was agreed to by all 
committee members collectively.  Second, it is the Reform Party 
that insisted that the committee go to British Columbia. If the 
Reform members do not like the fact that the committee is going 
there and that it costs money, this is their fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what the member is complaining about shows that this 
system works.  We are willing to listen to the opposition, even 
when its concerns are as poorly grounded as the Reform Party's. I 
do not know why the hon. member is getting up today and saying 
that we should not be spending money when the Reform Party asked 
that this be done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister is not answering the question about the 
referendum.  Support for the Nisga'a deal hardly extends beyond 
the Liberal caucus room door.  Both current and former B.C. 
Liberal leaders have slammed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gordon Campbell called the deal an unacceptable slight to 
Canadians.  Gordon Gibson said “Say no to a separate government 
structure for Indians”.  But these Ottawa Liberals want to ram 
this deal through British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Indian affairs minister not just admit that he is 
afraid of holding a referendum because he knows it will fail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the

meetings relating to the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that during the provincial part of this whole 
discussion, the province had 27 different meetings in different 
communities in British Columbia. 
In fact the longest debate in the history of the B.C. legislature 
was on this particular agreement.  There were over 500 
consultations with interested groups when the Nisga'a agreement

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

not allow people from British Columbia the opportunity to have a 
referendum on this deal.  That is the question the minister is 
avoiding, the Deputy Prime Minister is avoiding and the

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

approach to parliamentary government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is right. We handle our 
approach based on the democratic principles inherited from Great 
Britain.  I do not know why the hon. member opposes our 
democratic parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of leaders of the British Columbia Liberal Party 
provincially and their views on this, I am sure Reform supporters 
in British Columbia were not asked in a referendum whether the

to look at the whole industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly wants to shed light on this issue, does 
it not agree that a Canada-wide investigation is required to look

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member that we invest $5 billion a year

happening with the national child benefit.  In fact, the federal 
government gives assistance to poor families through $1.7 billion, 
soon to be $2 
billion in income support.  That allows the provinces to take 
moneys and build a platform of services to support of our 
children in low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big challenge that we have is giving opportunities to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, when 
we questioned the government about its inability to reduce 
poverty in Canada, the learned Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs explained that Quebec's referendum debate was 
responsible for the increase in the number of poor children in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we come back to this issue today. My question is for the 
Deputy Prime Minister.  Does the government agree with this 
somewhat short-sighted analysis by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, according to which the number of poor 
children in Canada has increased since 1993 because a referendum 
was held in Quebec in 1995? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs indicated very clearly that political instability was 
hurting the country's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the country's economy dips, it is naturally hard on the 
poor and everyone else.  If the member opposite does not 
understand this, I am sure he is the only one here who does not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have my 
doubts, although they are not about the House leader, who has 
put his foot in it.  I find myself obliged to tell him that the 
poorest place in Canada is Newfoundland and the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge, the last constitutional referendum in 
Newfoundland took place in 1948.  Is he telling us that the 
effects have lasted 50 years? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the member 
asked about Newfoundland.  In fact, in the last two years, it is 
one of the provinces, if not the province, with the highest rate 
of economic growth in Canada.

we continue to receive hundreds of paystubs from Canadians who 
are fed up with having to spend half of their income to finance 
the government's tax and spend habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like Adam Grabowski, a teacher from Hamiota, Manitoba, 
sent a paystub showing that income tax took 49% of his pay 
or 54.7% when CPP and employment insurance premiums are included.

spend the money than he does on his family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government continues to cut 
taxes.  In the last budget it cut $16.5 billion.  For a typical 
family of four with a $65,000 income that is a 10% reduction in 
federal taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to cutting taxes.  In the economic 
update the Minister of Finance invited comments on where Canada 
will go in the future with our surpluses.  Canadians will 
participate in that debate.  Our government is committed to more 
tax reductions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is the new Liberal math.  I wonder if the member really 
believes that there has been a 10% tax cut when everybody has 
seen their tax burden increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the disposable incomes of people shrinking if in fact 
the tax burden has gone down?  The member is talking about a 
so-called reduction which has been overwhelmed by bracket creep 
and the Canada pension plan increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people like Adam Grabowski have to continue working 
harder and making sacrifices when the government refuses to 
provide real tax relief?

Speaker, the hon. member is calling for tax cuts, which we have 
already begun doing and will do a lot more of.

to be spent by the government on health care.  Why do members of 
that party not get their act together?  They do not seem to 
understand that there is a balance between these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pursuing a fair balance and we will continue both with 
respect to tax cuts and investing in key priorities like health 
care.  In the meantime the Reform Party ought to go back behind 
the curtains and get its act together.

the minister is paying attention to that he should pay a little 
more attention in here.  The fact is that the cattle industry in 
Canada spent nearly $5 million in legal fees fighting these 
complaints by protectionist American producers, money that did 
not have to be spent if the government had implemented the 
changes requested by Canadian producers.  It could have spent 
that money on research and promotion.

will do so.  But at this point it appears there is not even

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

accounts for half of the $3 billion profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that the 5,000 jobs the member refers to are having 
to do with the Toronto-Dominion Bank's proposed acquisition of 
Canada Trust.  That would be over a three year period.  That

over 200 Canadians a year.  The national highway system has been 
a federal responsibility since 1919 and the Liberal government 
cannot blame the provinces for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fixing the national highway system would cost 26 cents for every

Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have the hon. member's support for 
upgrading the national highway system.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, 
in the throne speech we said that there would be an 
infrastructure program with a transportation component.  As to 
how much money goes into that, it depends on the work the 
Minister of Finance is currently doing in juggling other

available.  It is nice to have the NDP's support on this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think I am going to use the 32 minutes I am allowed since 
we are in favour of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I mentioned in my remarks before question period, I 
would like to reiterate our disappointment in the fact that we 
are called upon now to discuss this bill to ratify an 
international agreement reached nearly two years ago, when the 
deadline for the ratification of the agreement is January 29, 
2000. Since the House does not sit in January, parliamentarians 
are really called upon to express their views on this bill at 
the very last minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should address one particular aspect of this bill.  It 
seems to have become a habit, as I noticed myself last year with 
Bill C-54, to include the substance of the bill in the schedule. 
While the bill per se is only six pages long, the schedule 
contains 26 pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a provision in the bill that says that, once the bill 
passed, after nearly two years, the minister will only need an 
order in council to amend the agreement through changes to the 
schedule. It is as simple as that.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are, two years later, and this is the first time we hear 
about that in the House. It might well be the last, even if the 
agreement can be changed at the international level by different 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that I find this rather highhanded. It may be a 
matter of form rather than substance, but I would not like the 
government to continue in that vein, because it would be 
tantamount to gagging members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project, a civil international space station, is extremely 
important, and the Bloc Quebecois obviously does not want to 
unduly hold up the legislative process, because the impact of 
this project in Quebec is quite significant. 
I remind the House that the Canadian Space Agency is 
headquartered in St. Hubert, near Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The space agency has offices in each province, but since its 
headquarters are in St. Hubert, many businesses in the Montreal 
area and in other regions in Quebec benefit from the spinoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself is quite short; it is only 6 pages long. It 
might be interesting to give a general idea of each one of its 
clauses. When I have to address the House, I make a point of 
reading all the clauses of a bill, even when there are many. In 
this case, there are only 13, so we should be able to go through 
them fairly quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problem with clause 1, which deals with the title of 
the bill, since we are talking about the Civil International 
Space Station Agreement Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ship the first part of clause 2, but I would draw the 
attention of parliamentarians to the definition of “minister”. I 
know it is commonly used in legislation. It is good to remind 
people that we live in a so-called sovereign state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of “minister” reads “member or members of the 
Queen's Privy Council of Canada.” This is the Queen of England 
of course. It is good to remind ourselves that, although Canada 
claims it is a sovereign state, it still maintains very clear 
ties with the monarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3 states “The purpose of this Act is to fulfill”—I emphasize 
the word fulfill—“Canada's obligations under the agreement”. We 
are talking about two years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4 states “This act is binding on Her Majesty in right of 
Canada or a province.” Same as before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 states “The governor in council may designate one or 
more members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada as the 
minister or ministers for the purpose of this act.” We have 
no problem with this one either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly clause 6 gives a lot of power to the minister. It reads 
“The minister may delegate any powers, duties and functions 
to one or more persons”. One comment in this respect. I hope the 
minister will not delegate any duty to the secret service agent 
who lost his documents. We are talking about space and things 
could go wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 7 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may send a notice to any person that the Minister 
believes, on reasonable grounds, has information or documents 
relevant to the administration or enforcement of this Act, 
requesting the person to provide, within any period that the 
Minister specifies, that information or those documents to the 
Minister or any person that the Minister designates. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very nice.  Such notice could be sent to people who 
might have important information on space research, many aspects 
of which may be top secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 reads as follows “No person in possession of information 
or a document that has been provided under this act or the 
agreement shall knowingly communicate it”. But there are two 
exceptions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when the communication or access is in the public 
interest or necessary for the administration or enforcement of 
the act or the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may make regulations that the Governor 
in Council considers necessary for carrying out the purpose of 
this Act and giving effect to the Agreement— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governor in council is the cabinet.  I repeat, this 
agreement can be changed merely by changing the schedule, 
without going back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall, by order, amend the schedule to incorporate 
any amendment to the Agreement— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just said, the agreement of parliament is not required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 11 is longer, so I will just give a summary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7 of the criminal code is amended to include offences 
committed by a Canadian crew member even if he or she is in 
space.  Similarly, the law would apply to a crew member from a 
partner state who commits an act or omission affecting the life 
or security of a Canadian crew member or a flight element 
belonging to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for clause 12(3), it is worthwhile reading it in its entirety, 
for it is not very long: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the employee or the dependants referred to in subsection (1) 
elect to claim compensation under this Act, Her Majesty shall be 
subrogated to the rights of the employee or dependants and may, 
subject to the Agreement implemented by the Civil International 
Space Station Agreement Implementation Act, maintain an action 
in the name of the employee or dependants or of Her Majesty 
against the person against whom the action lies and any sum 
recovered shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, this is very vague. However, it is normal to have 
recourse, but all this is subject to the approval of Her 
Majesty, which is “subrogated to the rights of the employee or 
dependants and may, subject to the agreement implemented—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 13 deals with the coming into force of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The schedule, which is the agreement itself, is very 
interesting. It mentions many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It indicates that the whole process began in 1984. 
We are discussing the agreement now, in 1999, but the whole 
process began in 1984. Since then, there was, among other 
events, a meeting between the President of the United States and 
the Prime Minister of Canada at the time. I will never forget 
that meeting, which ended with the former Prime Minister and 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the U.S. 
President, Mr. Reagan, bursting out in song together. At the 
time, everyone recognized that Canada was very, very close to 
the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pointing this out, because we recently travelled to Russia 
to meet a Russian parliamentary committee on science and 
technology, as part of an economic mission led by the Secretary 
of State for Science, Research and Development. People asked 
questions about the space station, because the Russians are 
experiencing financial problems and are having difficulties 
meeting the requirements of the agreement they signed in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Russian parliamentarians' objections had to do with Canada 
always appearing to be too close to the United States and to be 
in agreement with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned our ties with the Commonwealth. The 
Russians believed, and they were very blunt about it, that we 
were too close to the Americans, and they had doubts about the 
future of the space station. So much so that they insisted on 
keeping a separate module, which is the exception on board this 
particular space station. The Russians absolutely want a module 
not accessible to the rest of the space station, because they do 
not trust the Americans.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I will not go over all the other pages of this substantial 
schedule, which deals with international rights and obligations, 
management, intellectual property and, of course, research. The 
latter is an important issue, because Canada is taking part in 
this initiative. I think it is important that we preserve 
intellectual property rights over the research Canada will have 
invested in. The same thing goes for the other participating 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to underscore the special contribution of Canada to 
this research project through the Canadian Space Agency, thanks 
to the mobile servicing system. 
People will ask “What is the mobile maintenance system?”.  It is 
the famous Canadarm, which will be able to move just about 
anywhere in the station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fascinated , during a visit I paid with the other members 
of the Standing Committee on Industry to the space agency in St. 
Hubert, by the way mobility is achieved.  The Canadarm has two 
hands, so to speak, and if it attaches itself to one part of the 
station, the other hand can move about and attach itself to 
another part of the station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw that.  I think that people can go and visit the centre. 
They can see this discovery, which has put Canada and Quebec's 
scientific community on the map, as they say, because this 
system will be used not only for repairs but to assemble all of 
the elements of the module. 
Canada's participation is therefore vital to the construction of 
the station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the role played by Quebecer Julie 
Payette in a research expedition in the international space 
station.  She was the first Canadian to go there.  Her 
particular contribution was important, since she was the head of 
the medical team, which obviously monitored the health and 
physical condition of the astronauts and which carried out very 
serious medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of medical research in space, a number of 
treatments for diseases have been found, thus improving health. 
There are obviously a lot of questions about bone density and 
balance.  In short, it is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project, which will span over 20 years, requires a 
$1.4 billion contribution by Canada. This may seem expensive, but 
the economic benefits are estimated at over $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An investment that will yield such substantial economic benefits 
is a good investment. Overall, it will create 70,000 jobs, which 
is significant. This is one reason that motivated us, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, to support this bill. These jobs are not only in 
the province of Quebec, since, as I said, the Canadian Space 
Agency has divisions across the country. But Quebec is glad that 
the agency has its headquarters in Saint-Hubert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking only about public servant or researcher jobs 
paid by the agency, but also about jobs in the private sector 
and for people who do research on a contractual basis or who try 
to apply research elements identified by the agency itself. 
The application aspect is very important and it also creates a 
lot of jobs.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be enormous economic and scientific benefits in our 
daily lives. Because of the financial limitations of a country 
with 30 million people, the space agency has decided to limit its 
activities to certain niches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the Canadarm and the mobile maintenance system I 
mentioned earlier, the agency has become a world leader in 
satellite communication. This is not necessarily related to this 
particular project, but the Canadian Space Agency developed 
RADARSAT, as well as other applications. Another project will be 
launched shortly, which will contribute further to the 
advancement of satellite communication. 
This means that soon someone in the Sahara desert will actually 
be able to speak on the phone with someone in Ottawa. They will 
be able to communicate. This is no small thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is not all.  Those interested in geography can expect 
to see more accurate maps, because it will be possible to take 
shots to within approximately two metres from the ground. 
Agency representatives told us that the Russians and the 
Americans do not want it to be any closer, apparently for 
security reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my visit, I observed the seriousness of Agency employees, 
especially their pride when astronauts from around the world 
come to the training centre devoted solely to use of the 
Canadarm. 
All astronauts, whether they are Russian, American, European, or 
Japanese, come to Saint-Hubert regularly for training.  This is 
great for the city of Saint-Hubert and for Quebec.  It is also 
good for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk about what I think is the most 
important aspect of the civil international space station, and 
that is co-operation among various countries.  These include 
Canada, the United States, Japan, Russia and European countries; 
others could join eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “partnership” appears throughout the agreement.  It is 
used very frequently.  I think this is very important.  This is 
a step forward for the advancement of aerospace science.  This 
multilateral agreement has been quite a shot in the arm.  Since 
the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall, the 
Russians have joined the expedition.  I think this is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of history, this year the Canadian Space Agency, which 
has its headquarters in Saint-Hubert, is celebrating its tenth 
anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on a political note.  The word “partnership” 
crops up everywhere in this agreement.  Canada has agreed to 
discuss an important agreement with other nations, but has said 
in advance that it is not interested in discussing partnership 
with Quebec.  This government is prepared to talk with everyone 
except Quebec.  That is how much this government seems to care 
about a wish expressed in 1995 by 49.6% of Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-4, the 
civil international space station agreement implementation act. 
This bill represents a key advancement in Canada's important role 
in the development of the international space station and further 
strengthens the very valuable level of international co-operation 
that began under the previous Progressive Conservative 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of recognition the PC Party has supported this bill 
from its inception as it is a further development in the process 
that began under the leadership of Brian Mulroney.  On this level 
I must congratulate the minister for continuing his government's 
commitment to the agenda set by the former prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond furthering Canada's reputation as a major player in 
international efforts, the bill provides for an important 
contribution to the development of the Canadian scientific 
community.  However, it must be noted that this is but a scratch 
in the surface of where we must go in order to further develop 
our high tech industry which stretches well beyond our 
responsibilities to the space program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is easy to support given the origins of its purpose. 
Beyond this, it is one that is merely evidence of the Liberal 
government's chronic, mediocre commitment to advancing the 
Canadian context of technology.  For instance, since 1993 the 
government has steadily cut into the budget of the Canadian space 
agency, reducing it from $378 million in the 1993-94 budget 
period to $350 million this year and ultimately down to a level 
of $300 million in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the developed world around us races toward the future the 
Liberal government creeps along a path of complacent indifference 
toward this most vital sector of our economy and of our 
well-being.  As our talented technology workers head south of the 
border—incidentally, with the Prime Minister's full support—the 
Canadian technology sector, stifled in large part by high 
taxation, slips further and further behind our competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of the fast rate of change in the United States I 
will point out the incomprehensible speed at which the technology 
sector is advancing in the United States.  Through innovation and 
e-commerce, for example, Dell Computers is generating $30 million 
per day in Internet sales every single day of the year.  How does 
it do it?  Hard work and a system that rewards innovation and 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As further evidence, in Santa Clara, California alone, 64 
millionaires emerge every day from the competitive and rewarding 
environment that is so vital in fostering this astronomical rate 
of growth.  These are two examples of many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this not occur in Canada?  One need only look at this 
bill to appreciate the cause.  It has taken nearly two years for 
the government to finally get Bill C-4 through parliament, just 
barely making it for the international co-operation deadline in 
January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This slow rate of progress is not a confidence building 
approach.  Taking this long to get through a piece of legislation 
which we all, in essence, support is remarkably 
counterproductive, especially when one realizes that we should be 
dealing with far more issues related to the technology sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must get off its duff and accept that we are 
losing the great war for talent.  Yes, the bill does provide 
money for research and development to the technology sector, but 
it is incredibly far from being enough.  Everywhere else this 
industry is in a brawl with no rules, whereas in Canada, among 
the countless punitive regulations and taxes, the most telling 
rule is “Leave if you don't like it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what our talent does.  They do not wish to have to reply 
to the question of “Where were you during the great enterprises 
of Y2K?” by saying they were waiting for the Liberal government 
to stop diddling over long overdue legislation and tax cuts. That 
is why they leave.  There is virtually no commitment to ensuring 
that we give our massively talented workforce the tools to 
prosper in the most important industry of the present and indeed 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as no surprise that the government waffles on 
this issue.  In fact it becomes more and more apparent that its 
interest wanes when it is asked to support something it did not 
create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge that the government take some leadership on this 
issue.  I do not offer this appeal on the basis that we begin 
massive new spending projects.  Quite the contrary, we need to 
offer an environment that allows the technology industry to do 
what it does best, innovate.  However, it is hard to do so when 
there is an increasing burden of taxation on the corporate sector 
and on the individuals it employs.  This is completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we can bring Canada up to a far greater level of 
productivity in technology is to slash taxes.  We need to cut 
taxes in a meaningful way for Canadian businesses and Canadians, 
not as window dressing for the posterity of the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Finance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government need not provide the capital if it is encouraging 
the incentive.  That incentive lies at the end of the day, when 
the hard working and talented Canadian workers are able to see a 
substantive reward for their efforts.  Should this occur, should 
we rise to the occasion, the government and the country will reap 
the rewards of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I fully support Bill C-4 and do not wish to further 
delay this valuable piece of legislation.  I will, however, 
restate my message to the government that it best begin to change 
this lethargic approach to the industry and get on the ball.  It 
has to recognize and respond to the rapid rate of change.  It is 
barely able to govern effectively with its present complacence 
with regard to pressing issues which, as it happens, may 
disqualify it from successfully governing for the future, and 
that is the kind of leadership which the country so desperately 
needs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was most interested in the member's comments, in particular with 
regard to the movement of our talent south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether he saw the article in the <I>Citizen</I> 
last weekend about Nortel's CEO.  It was a very interesting 
article about the amount of brain power that is moving south of 
the border and the inability of our system to replace that 
talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we also have a Prime Minister who says 
there is not a brain drain in this country, that it is just a 
myth.  Yet, these high tech firms categorically state that they 
cannot compete with the U.S., in particular because of the tax 
structure.  I certainly concur with the member's comments that we 
are taxed out of our socks in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to stop this brain drain?  It fits with the 
space station and it fits with the high technology arena that we 
are in.  Where does the hon. member see the solutions to stopping 
the brain drain and getting the country on its feet again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his excellent question.  It is not a simple one to answer, but 
basically we are beside the greatest economy in the world.  I do 
not know why we are trying to forge a different economy of high 
taxes when the United States encourages innovation and free 
enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get our taxes, both corporate and personal, more in 
line.  There is a whole new revolution going on, for example, 
with Dell Computer and the e-commerce world.  Ninety per cent of 
Canadians today, when they are buying products on e-commerce, buy 
them from the United States.  They are not buying in Canada. 
Dell is doing $30 million a day, every day of the year, and it 
has just started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to encourage people that if they work hard they 
will enjoy the fruits of their labour.  For example, in Santa 
Clara, 64 millionaires are created each day.  I bet those people 
for a year or so had the dream of becoming rich and knew that if 
they worked hard, once they realized their aspirations they would 
get to keep their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to tax it away, do some sort of income averaging and 
give the money to everyone.  We have to encourage the 
entrepreneurial spirit at the school level, and when people work 
hard they should be able to keep their money.  We have to reduce 
taxes both at the corporate and personal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a standing committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, any time I 
have the opportunity, I will stand up in defence of Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those poor, beleaguered people are attacked at every turn by 
government after government after government.  It boggles the 
mind to think that Canadian taxpayers give up over half of their 
earnings just to fund their levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often said that if someone came into my house and took 
half of everything I owned, I would probably phone the RCMP.  I 
would tell them to come and get this guy, take him away and lock 
him up.  Let us have some justice here.  Probably most Canadians 
would say, “Yes, you are entitled to do that.  That is fair. 
That is in defence of your property.  That is stuff that you 
bought with money you worked for and earned.  The guy who went in 
at night has no right to take it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxman comes in the daytime.  He comes and takes everything 
I earn.  If I do not help him load the truck, I am the one that 
goes to jail.  If I do not co-operate with him loading up and 
taking my stuff, I am considered to be some sort of a lesser 
citizen because I will not take part in the scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess should put this into balance.  I suppose I should not 
always talk about taxes like that, because it is a privilege to 
pay taxes.  I concur with what many people say, this is a 
wonderful country.  It is a privilege to live in Canada.  I 
believe it is a privilege to be a member of parliament in the 
country.  It is a privilege and an honour to stand in this place 
in defence of the people who elected me and who are paying the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from a lot of people in my riding and across the country 
who say, “You know, I would not mind paying a fair amount of 
taxes, but the taxes we pay are too much.  We keep on paying 
taxes on taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are aware that we pay a lot of taxes 
on taxes literally.  For example, if we go to the gas station to 
buy $10 worth of fuel for our cars, in the end that $10 actually 
includes a portion of the federal gasoline tax and the provincial 
gasoline tax.  That price of $10, although I cannot remember the 
last time I only bought $10 worth of gas at one stop, but that 
$10 already contains a bunch of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we then get here?  The government says that it wants to 
charge GST on it.  The GST is our famous gouge and screw tax. It 
is added to everything, even to the tax portion of that gasoline. 
Here we have money that we have earned and on which we have paid 
income tax.  We then take the part that is left and pay the 
gasoline taxes.  On those taxes, GST is added.  When I say taxes 
on taxes on taxes, it is literally true that we end up paying 
taxes on taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting very close now to talking about municipal grants 
because we want to talk about taxation collected by 
municipalities.  It is also true that when we pay our municipal 
property taxes, in most instances the money we use to pay that 
tax we have already paid income tax on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We work like slaves, get some money and the federal and 
provincial taxman keeps about half of it, on incremental income 
for most Canadians these days. 
With the half that we have left over we have to pay our municipal 
taxes.  This is the reason I introduced my private member's bill 
that says that people who pay property taxes should be able to 
deduct that amount from their taxable income.  I do not think it 
is right for Canadians to have to pay taxes on money they earn 
for the sole purpose of paying taxes.  It is enough already, as 
my grandmother would say.  It is just too much.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about Bill C-10.  Bill C-10 is also a bill 
which has to do with how to distribute and move around money that 
has been collected from taxpayers.  It also has to do with 
municipal taxes and other fees and charges that are paid by 
different levels of government, in this case, the federal 
government.  I find it absolutely incredible that the money that 
the taxpayer sends to Ottawa is used for all sorts of different 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the Canadian government operates a number 
of vehicles.  We have thousands of dollars of real property.  I 
suppose that is a necessity, although sometimes I wonder whether 
we have allowed that to get out of hand as well.  It seems to me 
that our government is larger than it ought to be because there 
has not been any real accountability on the part of government on 
how it spends money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, when the federal government uses part of the facility 
in a municipality to operate its buildings, it should also pay a 
fair share of the municipal taxes.  One could argue that there is 
only one taxpayer.  However, the fact of the matter is that this 
is a way of relieving, at least partially, the burden of property 
taxes on people in the municipalities.  That is, in order to 
provide the services and the infrastructure which also supports 
the government facility, as it supports other businesses and 
homes and apartments, this money is also used for these 
government buildings and government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is fair that the 
Canadian taxpayer should pay a fair share of the municipal taxes 
because there is an increasing burden on municipalities to pay 
for all of the things that are being downloaded by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that will amend the Municipal Grants Act. It has 
to do with how the federal government makes grants to 
municipalities directly in lieu of taxes that it should be 
paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you had some anxiety as to whether or not I 
was on topic, but I was indeed giving my preliminary lead-up to 
the topic at hand today.  I think I can probably promise you, Mr. 
Speaker, that at least 95% of the time I will open my speech with 
some sort of a statement that says it is time to cut taxes in the 
country, so my preamble was most appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular bill, there are a number of things which are 
needed and are justified.  It is a case where we have a number of 
items that are probably worth supporting.  We know, and this has 
been the case for quite some time, that supplementary payments 
can be made to municipalities in lieu of taxes.  In other words, 
in this country we do not permit one level of government to tax 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some exceptions to this. I have noticed lately that 
federal government vehicles carry provincial licence plates. 
Agreements have been reached on that, which is fair since those 
vehicles utilize the roads of the province in which they are 
stationed, for the most part. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things that have been permitted for quite some 
time.  The federal government, however, cannot be levied a tax. 
If a municipality says that we have a federal court, a federal 
taxation building or an EI office that is owned and operated or 
leased by the federal government, normally if that were any other 
lessee it would assess property taxes against that property.  The 
federal government, in order to be fair, has for a number of 
years voluntarily paid a fair assessment to the different 
municipalities.  By doing this, it gets around that little rule 
that one level of government may not tax another level of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill has a couple of good features in it.  It 
will extend the ability of the federal government to make these 
voluntary payments in other areas.  For example, it would extend 
it to making payments of interest in the event that the payment 
was late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if members have heard this rumour, but there are 
some government departments that are continually late in their 
payments.  The Minister of Defence is here and maybe he can give 
me a wave if I am wrong, but I have heard rumours that the 
Department of National Defence spends millions of dollars every 
year on late payments through the normal billing of expenses.  It 
is late in paying, so the supplier of the commodity that the 
defence department has purchased just adds the usual carrying 
charge to the late payment and the government pays it because it 
is a legitimate payment.  If it would be on the bit and pay its 
bills promptly it would not have those interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of municipalities, they also assess charges for late 
payments, whether it is late payments for municipally owned 
utilities or whether it is late payments on property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill would extend the ability of the government 
to make voluntary payments in lieu of interest on payments which 
are late.  Again, I cannot really be against that.  I think it is 
fair to the municipalities, the ratepayers and the property 
taxpayers in those particular municipalities where this applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that happens.  Sometimes the federal 
government owns a property but does not use it all.  Even though 
it is owned by the government, it leases that same property out 
to another third party.  Almost always, those particular 
contracts for lease include a clause that says that the lessee 
must pay the property tax on that property.  Sometimes these 
people who lease the property are not diligent in their payments. 
As a result, they go late.  This particular bill will now, I 
guess, stiff the taxpayer for the inability of the government at 
whatever level to collect the rent and tax payments from the 
individual or business that is leasing the property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, it is a transfer of tax dollars from one location 
to another.  In this case, it is from the federal government to 
the municipality.  If the taxes are delinquent, this bill will 
allow the federal government to voluntarily make that payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some kinds of structures that have been added to the 
list.  I would not disagree with that.  Also, we now have a 
committee of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that the Reform Party has a very good policy with respect to this 
type of thing.  I would like to read a page from the book.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will insist that all laws pertaining to 
individuals and the private sector apply equally to the 
Government of Canada, its personnel, its agencies and Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will be totally amazed at how I am going to 
weave the MP pension plan into this story.  That principle 
applying to the fairness of municipal taxation is a principle 
that extends right across the board. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to the attention of members and anyone else who is 
hearing or reading these words that in the pension plan for 
members of parliament and senators, legislation is in place which 
specifically exempts members of parliament from certain 
provisions of the Income Tax Act. I meet many people who would 
love to defer an additional 2% or 5% of their income for taxation 
in some future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a violation of the Reform principle which says that all 
laws which pertain to individuals and the private sector will 
apply equally to individuals as well as to governments, as well 
as to members of the government, including the employees, members 
of parliament and senators.  We have here a violation of that 
principle. The MP pension plan is one of the most blatant 
violations.  Specific legislation was passed in this place to 
exempt members from a law that applies to every other Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Liberals have the gall to do that?  I cannot 
believe Canadian voters continue to send members to this place 
who would do that type of thing.  It boggles my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is maintaining a special position in this bill. 
Even though the Government of Canada will voluntarily pay taxes 
to some municipalities on behalf of its buildings and structures, 
it will not necessarily do it all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One objection we have to the bill is that Canada Post is not 
included.  It is very much an arm of the government. The Canadian 
mint, a crown corporation, is not included as having to 
participate in this program.  We think that is wrong. It should 
apply to everyone equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payment of grants in lieu of taxes is a very good program 
but every once in a while a dispute arises.  How would we solve a 
dispute?  There are a number of ways to resolve a dispute when 
two people disagree.  The best way is to sit down, talk about it, 
negotiate it, figure out who is willing to bend which way and 
come together on it.  Every once in a while disputes become 
serious and the federal or provincial courts become involved. We 
try to resolve our differences at the court level by having a 
judge and in some cases a jury look at the situation to try to 
bring about justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a serious flaw in this bill.  Even though when there is 
a dispute there is a mechanism to solve it, lo and behold we find 
that the board that is supposed to do this is appointed by the 
minister.  It is like getting into a boxing ring and finding out 
that the opponent is also the referee.  It does not bring a great 
deal of fairness to the situation.  This flaw should be corrected 
before the bill is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second flaw is that board members make recommendations to the 
minister. Is that not a surprise.  First the minister appoints 
the board members and then they make a recommendation to him. The 
bill is clear.  The minister may or may not accept their 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a municipality disagrees with the payment level or the 
promptness of the payment being made by the federal government 
and challenges it, the matter goes to the the board which hears 
the case.  The board may give some very good advice or it may 
given rotten advice, we do not know which, but we hope the board 
would try to be fair.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the Prime Minister would hasten to tell us that just 
because they were Liberals who were appointed to the board does 
not mean that they will always make a wrong judgment, and I 
suppose that would be a fair statement.  They probably would not 
always make a wrong judgment.  In any case they make a 
recommendation to the minister and then the minister has the 
choice to take the recommendation or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness the minister and his officials would probably 
read and study the recommendation.  I would hope they would.  I 
hope the decision would not be arbitrary and capricious, but 
there is nothing in the bill or the act that would prevent that 
from happening. The minister could take their advice or he could 
decline their advice and do whatever he wants.  He would then 
unilaterally say, “Sorry, we are not paying” and that would be 
the end of the matter.  There is no further appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the very serious flaws in the bill that should 
be corrected.  There should be some fairness built into this. 
Arranging the affairs so that the person one is fighting with in 
the boxing ring is also the referee is just not a very good way 
to plan success. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of the bedrock principles of our system is that 
there is to be no taxation without representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the municipal level, in my lifetime, that has been expanded 
so that there is no residency without the right to 
representation. Renters who pay their taxes indirectly are 
allowed, just as landowners are, to have a vote on the activities 
of their local government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before the House a bill that flies squarely in the face 
of that principle.  It is called the ratification of the Nisga'a 
treaty which will make it quite possible for a group of municipal 
councillors, band councillors if you will, since the government 
keeps telling us that what it is setting up is a form of 
municipal government, to levy taxes.  This group will be able to 
levy taxes on any and all residents on the reserve irrespective 
of what the persons being taxed may think or what they may want 
to do.  They will not have a voice in it because voting and the 
choice of councillors will be limited only to people who have the 
correct skin pigmentation. The fact that one may be living, doing 
business or providing a service on the reserve will be totally 
irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have an example of this sort of thing on the Musqueam 
reserve where in addition to the massive rent increases that we 
hear so much about, there is also a silent and somewhat 
unreported problem of taxation. The band is levying taxes to the 
tune of about $6,000 per residence on the people who will 
ultimately be dispossessed of their homes.  They are doing this 
without any recourse to democratic action.  These people cannot 
vote in any way on what their local government is doing with 
respect to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague have any thoughts or suggestions on this 
subject as to what might be done to ameliorate the problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question 
because it has to do with how Bill C-10 impacts on the life and 
times of municipal taxpayers.  We are talking about municipal 
taxpayers paying their bills to the municipality in which they 
live or in which they own property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands has made an excellent 
point.  We have long held the principle that there cannot be 
taxation without representation.  There cannot be a body for 
which we have no opportunity to vote and which can levy taxation 
against us, make rules that actually part us from some of our 
income.  It is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made mention of the fact that this is what is happening in 
the treaty agreements in British Columbia. 
I would take the point a little further than he did.  There is 
certainly an immediate and serious problem that needs to be 
addressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members, all those green foreheads as I refer to 
them, are just not listening.  They are not paying attention to 
the genuine concerns we are bringing forward on behalf of the 
people of British Columbia on this issue.  I wish they would 
listen because not only is there an immediate concern, but there 
is the immediate huge injustice of people losing their own 
property through a process over which they have no control and no 
recourse.  There is also a long term repercussion which I think 
our children and our grandchildren are going to rue for years and 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To divide our population based on genetic make-up and to say 
that different rules apply to different people because of their 
particular genetic make-up, history teaches us that that is 
dangerous.  Common sense makes us aware that that is dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate with legislation like that which we have 
before us today and legislation such as my colleague mentioned 
that the government is totally blind and deaf. It will not see 
the problem and it will not hear from the people.  I find it 
unconscionable that the government is actually contemplating not 
even permitting the people of British Columbia to have a 
referendum on what is going to make a tremendous difference to 
their lives and their society, not only now but for years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague for an excellent question.  That is the 
type of thing I wish we could debate clearly and openly in the 
House with a genuine willingness to listen and to make changes 
when it becomes clear that there is inadequacy in the legislation 
before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a 
bit disappointed in the comments by my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if other members of the House get lists of the new 
citizens of Canada.  We get a list of the new citizens in our 
ridings.  I am always pleased when there is someone on it who I 
have known for a number of years.  I have a couple of friends who 
have lived in Canada for 25 and 30 years.  The other day I was 
going through my list while I was sitting here listening to the 
really important debates we have.  I noticed that a couple of my 
friends were on that list and I automatically thought great, two 
more votes next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that these friends had lived and worked in 
Canada for 25 or 30 years and had paid taxes, they were not able 
to vote on electing federal members.  Why is that?  Because we 
recognize that until people become citizens of our country, we do 
not allow them to vote for the governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he think it is fair that people move to Canada and are not 
able to vote for a federal member of parliament unless they 
become citizens?  I think it is reasonable.  Does he not think it 
is reasonable as well, or does he think people should not have to 
become citizens and be part of a community before they vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with what the member 
has said.  I notice she did not in any way indicate that we would 
first of all test the pigmentation of people's skin or genes 
before we allow them to take up citizenship. It is totally 
irrelevant to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add a further caution to what she has said.  I will put 
it in the form of a rhetorical question.  Do we really want to 
within the boundaries of our country have little countries all 
over the place, here a country, there a country, here a country, 
so that when we walk into those boundaries we cannot be a citizen 
of that country unless we pass a racial test?  I need to ask, is 
that really where we want to take our country?  I say as 
emphatically as I can, no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
municipalities across our great land are paying in terms of 
employment insurance.  As a result of that and the huge 
overpayments this government is amassing, municipal governments 
across the country are transferring municipal tax dollars to the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One level of government is taxing another with municipal taxes 
going into the federal coffers.  What does the hon. member have 
to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have all sorts of government 
politicians and bureaucrats playing around in the big mixing bowl 
with taxpayer money.  It is going here.  It is going there.  It 
is going everywhere.  Nobody really knows how much is going 
where, and the level of accountability is altogether entirely too 
low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a principle in Canada that one level of government 
cannot tax another.  With all deference to my colleague, we have 
a voluntary plan on the part of the federal government to carry 
at least some part of the fair share of municipal taxation in 
those municipalities which have facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is unfair.  The money comes from the 
taxpayer.  Some municipalities have a preponderance of federal 
government agencies, buildings or facilities, and it is not 
totally unfair that should be done.  However, the principle that 
he has referred to must of course be maintained. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
always, I will start my comments on the bill by telling the folks 
back home what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act.  It talks 
about administration.  It talks about payments.  It talks about 
taxes.  It talks about common tax due dates.  It talks about 
government leasing its properties to non-departmental third 
parties.  It mentions the Canada Post Corporation and goes into 
the discretionary power of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a few points about those subjects.  We have a 
situation where we have three levels of government, federal, 
provincial and municipal, and this government is trying to 
establish a fourth level of government.  This is despite the fact 
that the country is already overgoverned, despite the fact that 
we have a $600 billion national debt, and despite the fact that 
we have unfunded liabilities with the Canada pension plan that 
will max out in 2017. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that we have all these concerns—and the 
government certainly has a full plate if it were willing to deal 
with it—it is creating a fourth level of government by what it 
is doing with Nisga'a.  That impinges because we have three 
levels of government and we are already having difficulties.  It 
is troublesome at times to deal with those issues, especially for 
the taxpayer, because there is one taxpayer and there are three 
levels of government, and now we are to have four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that is the whole issue of taxation without 
representation.  That is exactly what will happen with the fourth 
level of government that I mentioned.  Not only will that happen 
in the new level of government, but it will learn from the 
previous ones.  It will be picked up as precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where we have taxation without 
representation going on right now with municipal governments. I 
asked a question of one of my colleagues about the whole issue of 
municipalities across the country that are paying more employment 
insurance than they get back in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a taxpayer in Calgary.  By contributing my money to 
municipal taxes in Calgary I am paying for municipal workers in 
the city of Calgary, and the overpayments this government is 
collecting in employment insurance, in the EI fund, is therefore 
going into federal coffers.  The situation is the same for all 
those who pay municipal taxes 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unfair that the federal taxman is robbing money 
out of municipal coffers across the country, especially when we 
consider the federal government has cut back its transfers to the 
provinces and therefore also cut back transfers to the 
municipalities dependent upon provincial funds.  That is a shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continually says that it believes in some of the 
programs that it holds high as sacred cows in the country, but 
time after time it makes cuts to them.  On top of that it raises 
taxes.  I could talk about the CPP tax hike and the EI taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that as well municipal governments are forced to go 
ahead and overpay employment insurance for their employees.  In 
the city of Vancouver alone the people of Vancouver are 
overcontributing over $2 million to the federal government.  It 
is not as though the people of British Columbia and the people of 
Vancouver are not overtaxed as it is.  On top of that $2 million 
of their money are being transferred to the federal government. 
That is an absolute shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes appointments.  I happen to be the Senate 
and patronage critic of the official opposition. Patronage all 
too often takes place in all aspects of government legislation. 
There are thousands of positions, and this bill is no different, 
that include patronage positions.  People meet with the Prime 
Minister on a regular basis to go ahead and dole out the precious 
positions Liberals love to give to their friends.  Part of what 
the bill is about is appointments and patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 this government said it would change things.  When the 
Prime Minister ran for election as leader of the Liberal Party he 
said that things would be different under his rule.  We do not 
have that.  The Liberals promised in the red book in 1993 and 
again in 1997 that patronage would change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the government House leader helped to 
author the McGrath report in which he said that some of those 
positions would be vetted by parliamentary committees which have 
the ability to go into these matters and would love to be able to 
scrutinize people based on the merits they have to hold their 
positions.  Instead, we continue to have this government push 
forward its agenda of patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  It goes into the whole idea of tax sharing and 
tax agreements.  I have been in this place two years.  The longer 
I am here, the more I believe the provinces should divest 
themselves of the tax sharing and tax agreements with the federal 
government because they are done wrong by them.  I applaud the 
Government of Alberta for moving ahead.  Within the next few 
years it will go ahead and separate the tax collection situation 
from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is collecting taxes and collecting taxes 
for the federal government.  That is a result of the first and 
second world wars and the Great Depression when no other 
government had the ability to meet the needs of the country in 
those dire times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time the federal government has abused that 
privilege.  It has gone ahead and is using the money for buying 
votes like it always does.  It is cutting back on programs.  It 
entered into arrangements with the provincial governments on 
things like health care, and I could name others, where it said 
it would fund 50% of the programs.  Instead it has cut, hacked 
and slashed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time it came to an election government members said 
“Trust us, we will increase the money”.  When push came to 
shove, they cut and cut deeply, to the point where the provincial 
Government of Alberta now receives only 15% for every dollar, 
even though the federal government promised Ernest Manning and 
that province when they entered into the agreement on health care 
that they would receive 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have the gall to stand in this place to tell 
us that they will somehow shove their way down the throat of the 
Government of Alberta.  The tail is wagging the dog.  They are 
only funding 15% of the show and they said they were committed to 
50%.  They preach high morals about how they want to defend this 
and that, but they do not ante up with the cash.  They continues 
to cut.  Shame on them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the whole idea of government leases, 
third party leases, mentioned in the bill.  That is when the 
government leases some of its properties to non-departmental 
third parties. I will pose a general question, and I hope the 
folks back home are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government has more property than it needs to do 
its job, why should it be going ahead and renting out the 
property in competition with private sector renters?  Taxpayers 
have been calling for money for certain programs.  Why does the 
government not sell off the property, that taxpayer asset, and 
give the money back to taxpayer programs or give taxpayers a long 
awaited tax break? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government has assets or property it is not using 
and is renting out right now, it should get rid of it.  It should 
be sold off and given back to the free market or given back to 
the people.  There is no reason the federal government needs to 
continue to hang on to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the bill is that of the Canada Post 
Corporation.  It touches on that.  It is another example of a 
government institution that does not believe in competition and 
will not allow anybody else to give it a fair shake for the 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>T2P Overnight, a company in Calgary was willing to deliver 
anywhere within the T2P postal code in Calgary for significantly 
less money than what it costs for a first class stamp.  The 
company delivered overnight, in one day.  Can we imagine Canada 
Post Corporation promising the delivery of mail in one day and 
doing it for less money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not allow that.  They shut the company down and said it 
was competition for Canada Post.  They could not handle it.  As a 
result they closed it.  A private sector entrepreneur who wanted 
to start up something offered a better level of service.  It 
could have provided an incentive and an example for the 
government and for the Canada Post Corporation, but they would 
not even allow competition.  They would not even think about it. 
As a result, an entrepreneur in the city of Calgary suffered for 
it, jobs were lost and the government won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about arm's length relationships.  Those arms 
continue to grow and grow, not only in terms of the multiplicity 
and the number of arms on this government beast but the length of 
the government's arms.  Everywhere we look the government wants 
to establish longer arm's length relationships, because ministers 
in the House do not want to have to stand and answer for their 
own departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would rather be able to stand and say “I am sorry, Mr. 
Speaker, but that is not my department.  It is not my department 
that is responsible for that.  It is that arm's length body, that 
arm's length organization.  I do not have anything to do with 
that.  It is not directly involving me. It is now independent”. 
That is a joke.  It is going on right now with Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to go ahead and establish an arm's length 
relationship.  More and more they want to distance themselves 
from the actual business of governing because they realizes they 
are not doing it well.  They realize they are squandering 
taxpayer dollars, that they are not accountable, that they are 
overtaxing people and that they are doing it poorly.  As a result 
they want to distance themselves from their poor record, from 
their shoddy record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting themselves up in some sort of arm's length relationship 
is a code word for saying that ministers do not want to be 
accountable for abrogating the whole idea of parliamentary 
responsibility, the whole idea of the cabinet being accountable 
to the country, and the whole idea of the minister being 
responsible for the actions of all those employed beneath him. 
Those are just some of the problems with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about priorities for a second.  There is a real lack 
of priorities around this place when we talk about bills like 
this one with all their inherent flaws, and I went through them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of thing occupies our time when instead they could be 
talking about cutting taxes and coming forward with tax cuts. 
They could be talking about employment insurance reform.  They 
could be talking about putting money back into health care.  That 
does not happen.  Instead they talk about arm's length 
relationships and cutting back on their accountability.  Shame on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member will 
have approximately seven minutes when next the bill comes to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, a minimum of 20 per cent of federal excise tax revenues on 
gasoline should be directed to joint federal and provincial 
programs to upgrade or renew many sub-standard sections of the 
national highway system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, my motion proposes that two cents from 
the ten cents per litre federal excise tax on gasoline be 
directed to joint federal and provincial programs to upgrade and 
renew our crumbling national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have addressed this issue many times both in and out of the 
House.  I was eagerly anticipating presentation of this motion 
and I very deeply regret that today we will be going through this 
silly charade of a debate with no opportunity for a vote on a 
matter of great public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only developed country with no national highway 
program or even a coherent national highways policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, a federal-provincial study identified 25,400 
kilometres, including the Trans-Canada Highway and a few major 
cross-border arteries, as the national highway system.  However, 
having been identified, the system has been almost totally 
forgotten.  There is no administrative framework and no federal 
funding for maintaining or upgrading it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the federal government collects about $5 billion in 
fuel excise taxes, including $4.3 billion specifically from 
highway fuels.  A miserable 4% of that lovely pot of money is 
going to be reinvested in highways this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 4, 1998, in the Standing Committee on Transport, the 
Minister of Transport readily admitted that there is a lack of 
balance between federal fuel tax collected and federal 
expenditures on roads.  He said that the government needed the 
money for other purposes.  He stated, “I accept the general 
thrust of your argument and it is something we have to work 
toward as we progressively get the books in order”.  The 
government has been crowing about its huge projected revenue 
surpluses, surpluses from usurious taxation, so the time has come 
to invest in something of permanent national benefit.  Show us 
the money, Mr. Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 7, 1997, in a transport committee report called, A 
National Highway Renewal Strategy, it is mentioned that the 
Minister of Finance had conceded that the dedicated tax concept 
might be examined at such time as the government is generating 
substantial surpluses.  Show us the money, Mr. Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same finance minister has from time to time expressed his 
distaste for the dedication of tax revenues and has indicated 
that dedicated taxes are not the Canadian way.  Apparently only 
excessive taxes can be classified as truly Canadian.  Actually 
there are precedents for dedicated federal taxes.  For example, 
old age security and the air navigation system were both in the 
past funded by dedicated taxes.  Now, in spite of usurious 
federal fuel taxes, there is no dedicated federal road 
improvement fund in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrast this with the United States where federal fuel taxes go 
into a highway trust fund, where the money is protected by a 
budgetary firewall mandating that transportation infrastructure 
spending cannot be reduced in order to finance other programs. 
The U.S. transportation equity act provides each state with a 
minimum guaranteed level of federal highway funding proportional 
to each state's highway mileage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget for six years is $217 billion U.S. 
An equivalent expenditure proportional to Canada's population 
would be $5.3 billion Canadian annually, not much more than we 
have been paying every year into the fuel tax fund, or as fuel 
taxes with nothing substantive to show for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbours have not only identified a national highway 
system, they fund it, as part of the program that I have just 
described, to the tune of $29,000 per mile per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we financed our much smaller so-called national highway 
system at that rate, the annual cost in Canadian dollars would be 
less than $700 million.  With the $800 million that my motion 
would yield, we could actually play catch-up on the worst parts 
of the system before it deteriorates beyond the point of no 
return.  If we do nothing and total replacement becomes 
necessary, tens of billions of dollars will have to be found 
somewhere or we will have to revert to red river carts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a national disgrace that the Trans-Canada Highway traffic 
is routinely diverted south of the border to where the highways 
are. Tens of millions of dollars in fuel taxes that could be used 
to upgrade our system stay in the United States, together with 
the costs of lodging, meals, repairs and incidentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traffic does not just move south for comfort, convenience and 
speed, but also for safety.  Hundreds of people die every year in 
Canada because of substandard highways.  Almost every province 
has at least one stretch of two-lane Trans-Canada Highway 
referred to locally as the “death strip” or “death alley”. In 
Saskatchewan, the death strip happens to be in my riding where a 
113 kilometre segment has claimed 40 lives in the last 20 years. 
The provincial government has just completed twinning a 27 
kilometre piece of it, with no federal assistance, and plans to 
complete this project in small segments over a period of several 
years.  To do that, it will have to take funds away from 
secondary roads now being destroyed, thanks to federally-blessed 
railway abandonments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-five per cent of Canadian passenger miles and 24% per 
cent of freight tonne miles move on the public road system which 
is rapidly disintegrating under that heavy burden.  Transferring 
a mere two cents per litre from the ten cent federal excise tax 
for the national highway system would not only solve some of our 
arterial highway problems, but it would free up provincial funds 
for other roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I received an unsolicited and kind letter of support 
from Mr. Brian Hunt, the president of the 3.2 million member 
Canadian Automobile Association.  I would like to quote a few 
segments of his letter.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—structurally sound highways improve safety, productivity and 
trade.  The National Highway System must be upgraded to ensure 
continued economic growth and productivity across the country. 
It's time the federal government paid serious attention to our 
nation's transportation infrastructure...and commit to multi-year 
funding for Canada's national transportation infrastructure. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from a member of the public who represents a very large 
number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has always had a bottomless purse to pursue pork 
barrel projects in the Prime Minister's riding, development aid 
to despotic countries like China and useless initiatives such as 
universal firearms registration.  But, it has nothing for vital 
communication links of any kind, much less highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot see the condition of a highway from a Challenger jet 
at 30,000 feet.  I would recommend that a few cabinet ministers 
jump into their limousines and try driving from here to 
Vancouver.  Perhaps then they would gain a little understanding 
of the situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak today to the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes that the government dedicate a minimum of 
20% of federal gasoline excise tax revenues to joint federal and 
provincial programs to update or renew substandard sections of 
the national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appreciates the hon. member's concern for the 
national highway system and commends him for bringing this matter 
to the attention of the House.  I had the opportunity to work 
closely with the member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands as co-vice 
chairs of the Standing Committee on Transport for the House of 
Commons.  I know he has a keen interest in this topic as do many 
of us on this side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the motion, however, I want to take a moment 
to set the issue in context.  Since the beginning of its first 
mandate back in 1993, two of the government's ongoing priority 
areas continue to be sound financial management and fairness in 
the tax system.  Balancing these two equally demanding 
commitments has been a challenge for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With order now restored to the nation's finances and targeted 
tax relief provided in each budget since 1994, together with 
broad based tax relief starting in 1998, the government will 
continue to meet these commitments as resources become available. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with these challenges, the government unfortunately cannot 
agree to direct part of the revenues from the federal excise tax 
on gasoline to upgrade or renew highways. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The earmarking of tax revenues, which is the focus of the motion 
before us today, is a concern shared by many hon. members. The 
government has several reasons not to direct tax revenues to 
specific programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earmarking tax revenues for a specific item would limit the 
government's capacity to redirect federal expenditures according 
to its changing priorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member says that the Minister of Finance has 
sanctioned dedicated taxes, he knows full well that this finance 
minister has never been in favour of dedicated taxes.  In fact, 
it was our finance minister who appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Transport and encouraged the committee to look at 
public-private partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenues from federal taxes, including the excise tax on fuel 
products, go into the consolidated revenue fund which is used to 
support a broad range of federal programs that are enjoyed and 
valued by all Canadians, programs such as health care, post 
secondary education, seniors' benefits and national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason the government has avoided dedicating tax 
revenues to specific programs is because earmarking can result in 
some programs being overfunded while others suffer from 
shortfalls.  Making budgetary and long term investment decisions 
under a program funded by earmarked taxes is difficult as 
revenues from taxes fluctuate from year to year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third reason for avoiding earmarking revenues for certain 
activities is that the government believes that potential 
spending initiatives, including highways, should be evaluated 
independently of tax sources and examined as competing 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, there are many demands today on the 
government's scarce resources.  Because of this, it is important 
that the government remains firmly committed to sound financial 
management.  What the government intends to do is to continue to 
follow a balanced approach to managing the wide range of 
priorities.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. members of something else 
because it is important. Highways fall under provincial 
jurisdiction. I know that provincial governments are pressuring 
the federal government to invest in highways. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, hon. members will recall that the federal government 
has assisted provinces in the past with provincial highway 
construction projects through a series of federal-provincial cost 
shared agreements.  In addition, about one-third of the $2.425 
billion federal contribution under the Canada infrastructure 
works program went toward municipal roads and bridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many of these agreements are winding down, the federal 
government intends to continue working with the provinces and 
municipalities.  In the October 12, 1999 Speech from the Throne, 
the government announced its intention to implement a new 
physical infrastructure program to invest in and improve our 
nation's physical infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government stated in the throne speech that it will 
work with other levels of government and the private sector to 
reach agreement on a five year plan for improving physical 
infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country by 
the end of the year 2000.  This agreement will set out shared 
principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to 
increase their resources directed toward infrastructure. It will 
focus on such areas as transportation, as well as tourism, 
telecommunications, culture, health and safety, and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer for highways does not reside solely in seeking more 
federal funding.  In searching for solutions we need to be 
creative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted in the Speech from the Throne, one of the partners in 
addressing the infrastructure challenges is the private sector. 
While not a panacea, public-private partnerships warrant more 
encouragement.  When properly structured, they may provide roads 
at a lower cost and more quickly than traditional procurement 
methods. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I cannot support this motion for the reasons I 
have stated. However, I want to thank the hon. member for 
raising this important issue in the House. I also hope that the 
hon. member will find some positive elements in some of the 
ideas set out in the throne speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to rise to speak to the Reform motion before us today, 
asking that a minimum of 20% of federal excise tax revenues on 
gasoline be directed to joint federal and provincial programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal colleague opposite said that the government had no 
money to intervene immediately, but he seemed to have forgotten 
that it already has a surplus of several billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my speech will not deal with the Reform motion per se, 
but rather with the high gas prices people have to pay these 
days. 
If I were to move a motion, it would be to reduce this tax to 
deal with a glaring problem people have today, namely that if 
the price of gas keeps on rising as it has, soon they will no 
longer be able to drive their own cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a riding like mine, Lotbinière, and in several other ridings 
throughout Quebec, a car has become a necessity since, over the 
past few years, inter-city bus networks have been dismantled one 
by one, with the result that there is no longer any link between 
smaller municipalities or with the major centres around the 
riding of Lotbinière. If we lower taxes, therefore, it should be 
with the consumers in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the issue of roads is concerned, it should be dealt 
with through the infrastructure program soon, not only in 
December 2000. 
In the throne speech, the government made several commitments, 
but they are all for the long term. The strategy of the Liberals 
across the way reeks of electioneering. Everything is being 
delayed until the end of the year 2000, so there will be goodies 
left for the budget in 2001, because we know there will then be 
an election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have a good memory, and I hope they will keep it until 
the next federal election. This government's approach to 
everything is to keep people waiting, waiting for the programs 
announced with regard to mothers and parental leave, waiting for 
the infrastructure program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for everything announced in the Speech from the Throne, 
nothing has yet taken concrete form. The budget for the year 
2000 will be more or less a rehash of the one for 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to wait for the 2001 budget to really find out what 
the intentions of this government are.  The unemployed will also 
have to wait.  The young people will have to wait.  Everyone 
will have to wait, with this government.  I am going to come 
back to the matter of reducing taxes, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present surplus situation we are in, it is high time the 
federal government started thinking about the consumer.  It is 
high time the Liberal Party started thinking about the middle 
class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Canadian statistics, middle class incomes are 
between $30,000 and $70,000. That is not the case in my region. 
That is not the case in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of our middle class earn only $18,000, $20,000 or 
$25,000.  Hardworking factory workers nearly faint when they see 
what they have to pay at the gas pump.  Nothing has been done by 
this government to try to get this back to normal either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the summer, gas prices were like a yo-yo.  They could be 61 
cents in the morning and 68 cents in the afternoon. They were as 
low as 59 cents and as high as 70 cents. And nobody really 
understood why the oil companies were doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government wants at all cost to take humanitarian 
action that will help consumers, it should reduce its excise 
tax. It should indeed reduce its gasoline taxes so that 
consumers can continue to use their own vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing to have people come to your office saying 
“Listen, if this keeps on, I might be able to use my car for two 
or three weeks or a month, but if the price of gas continues to 
climb, I won't be able to”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will people do?  They will feel isolated.  They will feel 
deprived of a vital tool, one they use every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation I am referring to must exist pretty well 
everywhere in Canada as well, in regions similar to my own, in 
ridings that are half rural and half urban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not acting?  It has the surpluses to 
respond to the Reform Party's motion.  It should announce its 
infrastructure program right away and not do as the President of 
the Treasury Board did yesterday, put things off again to 
December 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, vehicles are breaking down, and we are having a 
hugely difficult time keeping a decent road system in Quebec and 
in Canada. 
When I hear the government say that roads come under provincial 
jurisdiction, I am glad that it is beginning to understand the 
constitution a little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But although it can see the difference when it comes time to 
invest money in roads, I would like it to be as discerning with 
respect to health, education and social programs. The hon. 
member should talk to his caucus and persuade it to get out of 
exclusively provincial jurisdictions and, while he is at it, ask 
the caucus, the Prime Minister and cabinet to immediately 
restore the transfer payments they have cut since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too I am almost certain that, if provincial governments had 
available to them all the money cut from their budgets, if they 
had all the money they needed, they too would come up with the 
necessary funds to invest in a decent road system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing with this government is that, when it comes 
to consumers, the middle class, and the unemployed, their 
memories fail them and we are left hanging.  So, yes to tax cuts 
but for the benefit of consumers. As far as roads are concerned, 
with the present surpluses, let the infrastructure program 
announced by the President of the Treasury Board be implemented 
now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
New Democratic Party transportation critic, it is an honour to 
speak in support of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by thanking the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands for bringing this motion before the House.  I 
put in a very similar motion about a year ago. I know the hon. 
member submitted this motion when he was still his party's 
transportation critic and I am glad to see he decided to follow 
through in this area even though he is no longer the 
transportation critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As any Canadian driver will tell us, the highways in our country 
are in terrible shape.  The Liberal government has abandoned its 
duty to maintain safe and adequate roads.  It has abandoned our 
highways just as it has abandoned health care, education, 
homeless children, first nations, farmers, the RCMP and so many 
other vital areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the finance minister said that he would balance the 
budget come hell or high water.  In my home province of Manitoba 
we have seen high water in two disastrous floods and thanks to 
the Liberal government, driving on our roads is hell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only country in the developed world that does not 
have a national highway program.  It is truly pathetic. When it 
comes to highways, Canada is dead last.  Not only are we last, 
but we are not even close to most other countries we need to 
compete with for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States spends six times as much per kilometre as 
Canada on maintaining and expanding its national highway system. 
Britain spends four times as much per kilometre.  Our G-7 
competitors like Germany, France and Italy all spend five to ten 
times as much as Canada does on their national highways systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out exactly what we mean by the 
national highway system.  We are not talking about every road in 
the country.  The national highway system makes up 3% of Canada's 
roads. This 3% of our highways carries over 25% of all highway 
traffic in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national highway system has been a federal responsibility 
ever since the Canadian Highways Act was passed in 1919.  The 
provinces are responsible for the other 97% of our roads.  Is it 
too much to ask that this Liberal government do its job and 
maintain that measly 3% it is responsible for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the Liberal government's abandonment of highways, the 
provinces have had to pick up the slack as best they can. 
Unfortunately the provinces have also had to pick up the slack 
for all the other Liberal government cuts, cuts to health care, 
cuts to education, cuts to housing, cuts to policing.  The 
Liberal government has cut so much, the provinces have not been 
able to keep up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be a shock but the regions that are getting ripped 
off the most by the Liberal government are, as usual, the west 
and the north.  Between now and 2001 the four western provinces 
and the three territories combined will only see $13 million in 
Transport Canada money for highways, with $6 million going to 
B.C., $5 million to the territories, and $2 million to 
Saskatchewan. Manitoba and Alberta are not getting one red cent. 
If we drive down the road in Manitoba and we have to stop on a 
dime, we know for sure that it is a provincial dime because the 
federal transport department invests not one red cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need good highways?  Why is the national system 
something the government needs to make a priority?  There are 
three main reasons:  safety, the environment and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will talk about safety because it is the most important 
reason.  At a bare minimum Canadians should be able to drive 
safely but many of our roads simply are not safe enough. 
Thirty-eight per cent of the national highway system is 
substandard.  Right now over 1,100 bridges on the national 
highway system need repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of two summers ago during our summer recess. There 
was an article in which a beaver was being blamed for the 
breakdown of part of the Trans-Canada Highway.  A beaver had made 
a dam which had damaged the road.  I thought, one would think 
someone was out there maintaining that road, but no, the beaver 
was blamed for the breakdown of the highway.  It is like blaming 
the cow for the spilled milk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that overall the number of deaths on Canadian roads 
has been decreasing since the seventies, and that is a good 
thing.  The Liberal government points to this statistic and says, 
“See, the roads are getting safer”.  We know that is simply not 
true. The government is misrepresenting the numbers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the number of deaths on the roads has been dropping 
since the seventies is because the rate of seatbelt use has gone 
up and the rate of drunk driving has dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government would bring the national highway 
system up to a minimum standard, the number of accidents this 
would prevent would save an average of 247 lives and 16,000 
injuries every year.  Even one preventable death or injury is too 
many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that the Liberal government is continuing to 
neglect our highways when Canadians are dying on our substandard 
roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason to improve highways is to help the 
environment.  Transportation fuel is responsible for over half of 
our nation's greenhouse gas emissions.  We have to bring this 
down to meet our commitments under the Kyoto agreement and stop 
global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing the national highway system up to minimum standards 
would save over 230 million litres of fuel each year.  This alone 
would not be enough to meet our commitments to stop global 
warming, but it would be an important start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to switch to greener forms of transportation, such 
as rail and mass transit, particularly in big cities.  But many 
Canadians, particularly in rural and northern areas like my 
riding of Churchill, absolutely need to drive, so the Liberal 
government has a responsibility to invest in highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason to fix the national highway system is that of 
economics.  I do not expect the Liberal government to listen to 
my arguments about the need to save Canadians' lives.  If the 
government really cared about saving Canadians' lives it would 
not have cut health care by $25 billion since 1995.  I also do 
not expect it to listen to my arguments about saving the 
environment because the Liberal government's record on the 
environment is terrible.  But I do know that the Liberal 
government listens to the bottom-line economic arguments, so here 
they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, highways are good for business.  Most of Canada's 
manufactured goods are transported by road.  Companies setting up 
plants look for access to good roads.  That is one of the reasons 
the economy is now booming in the U.S., while many hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians are still out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. knows the benefits of investing in highways.  Bad roads 
also discourage tourism, which is an important industry in many 
parts of our country.  Many truckers and other travellers going 
across Canada prefer to go south, cut across the U.S. and then 
come back up to Canada.  This means that on their trip they buy 
U.S. gas, stay in U.S. motels, eat in U.S. restaurants and pay 
taxes to the U.S. government instead of to the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would cost about $13 billion to bring the national highway 
system to minimum standards.  That is a lot of money, but if we 
spread it out over a number of years it is something the 
government could well afford within the budget surplus.  Not only 
that, in the long run improving our highways would save money, 
not cost money.  Preventable accidents cost more than $25 billion 
each year in emergency health care for victims, long term health 
care and other costs, such as property damage and lost 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care savings alone would pay for the cost of fixing 
the national highway system, not to mention the benefits of the 
increased economic activity that better roads would lead to, 
particularly job creation, something Canadians badly need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by repeating my support for the motion. 
The Liberal government has abandoned its responsibility for 
national highways.  By doing so it has put the lives and health 
of Canadians at risk.  It has also squandered the many economic 
benefits that come from having good highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for dedicating a modest 20% of income from fuel 
taxes to highway improvements.  Normally I would not support 
dedicated taxation.  However, as we have seen with the way the 
Liberal government has misused Canadians' employment insurance 
money, we cannot trust the Liberal government to use Canadians' 
money for what it is intended.  Twenty per cent of fuel taxes is 
a reasonable base line and the Liberal government has no excuse 
not to invest at least that much in our highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome the opportunity to speak today to the motion put 
forward by the member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands which calls 
for a minimum of 20% of federal excise tax revenues on gasoline 
to be directed to federal and provincial programs to upgrade and 
renew many substandard sections of the national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the motion because highway renewal is 
extremely important and must be a priority.  An increased portion 
of gasoline excise tax is one way of finding more of the 
necessary resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report commissioned by the council of ministers 
responsible for transportation and highway safety shows that the 
cost to bring the national highway system up to standard has 
increased from approximately $12 billion in 1988 to $17.2 billion 
in 1997.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our national highway system consists of approximately 25,000 
kilometres of highways, including the Trans-Canada Highway, which 
connects all of our capital cities, commercial and population 
centres, and access points to our largest trading partner, the 
United States.  For decades the Government of Canada provided 
funding through federal-provincial funding agreements for 
highways.  Over the last five years all of those agreements have 
expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government policy has allowed the railways over the last 
15 years to decline and heavy truck traffic has taken the place 
of the railways as the major product and commodity movers.  This 
federal policy has resulted in increased damage to our highways 
as goods and services transfer from rail to highway trucks. 
Pressure is increasing on the Government of Canada in conjunction 
with the provinces and territories to reinvest in our 
deteriorating highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there may be increasing consensus toward the need for 
reinvestment, all options must be considered in order to achieve 
the goal of improving our highways.  Therefore, we are supportive 
of the idea of directing more of the revenue generated from 
gasoline excise tax toward upgrading the nation's highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea, however, is not new for us.  My colleague, the PC 
transport critic, the member for Cumberland—Colchester, has 
already recommended this plan to all provincial and territorial 
ministers of transportation in their continuing discussions with 
the federal Minister of Transport.  The PC transport critic has 
contacted all provincial and territorial ministers in calling on 
the federal government to increase the portion of the tax 
collected on gasoline and diesel fuel sales that is invested into 
highways from the current 4% level to a 15% level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would yield 15% of $6 billion collected each year, 
for a total of $900 million.  Considering that the estimated cost 
for upgrading our present highway system is over $17 billion, 
this funding alone, with matching provincial funding, would go a 
long way toward correcting a problem that has been overlooked for 
too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have argued that asking for 15% of the total gas and diesel 
tax to be returned to the highways is eminently fair and more 
than reasonable.  It would still enable 85% to be dedicated 
toward general revenues.  It is our belief that public opinion 
would also be supportive of this measure and the federal 
government would have a difficult time not going along with this 
plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, there are two items at the 
head of the agenda, including the Van Horne bridge, which has 
been unsafe for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Construction and upgrade work on this bridge should have been 
done several years ago. Now, the people of my riding of 
Madawaska—Restigouche and especially of Campbellton who use the 
bridge linking New Brunswick to Quebec are in danger, because 
the bridge's structure has been neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public works department has been aware of the problem for 
several years now, but again, the government has not responded. 
The department had to reduce the number of heavy duty trucks on 
this bridge used every day by Canadian consumers and citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other item that has me very concerned and that comes under 
the motion put forward by my Reform colleague deals with the 
major highway in the riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, to be more 
precise in the Upper Madawaska Valley. The previous parliament 
had voted moneys for the construction of a highway between the 
economic sector of the Upper Madawaska Valley and the 
Trans-Canada Highway.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happened in this case with the government and 
the then transport minister Doug Young. The government 
transferred the money, and believe me, it was strictly for 
partisan purposes. All the local stakeholders were unanimous: 
the mayors, the people, the provincial government and even the 
federal government had achieved a consensus on the need to build 
this highway. Again, we saw money being transferred strictly for 
partisan reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House again that a greater portion of 
revenues from gasoline taxes should be used directly for highway 
improvement in Canada, as members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party have been requesting for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another colleague of mine, the member for Brandon—Souris, also 
brought forward in the House a motion asking that the federal 
government apply a portion of tax dollars raised on fuel sales 
to the maintenance of the rural road system in Canada. Even 
though this is not a new idea for our party, it does not mean it 
should not be considered by the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among Canada's premiers. I hope the 
Government of Canada will respect that consensus. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994 the premiers have called on their federal partners to 
ensure that money is reinvested.  Many organizations across the 
country are increasing their call on the government to act.  The 
mayors, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the 
Canadian Automobile Association are just a few of the groups that 
are speaking out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canadians are recognizing more and more that the 
federal government is spending too little on our roads.  In a 
national poll conducted in October, 81% of Canadians who were 
asked thought that the government should be spending more money 
toward improving our highways.  As well, almost 90% said that we 
have real safety concerns with the state of our highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive impacts of reinvesting, namely, 
increasing the safety of our roads and the safety of our 
citizens, which is something the government does not seem to be 
able to see.  This is extremely important when one considers the 
high number of injuries and fatalities each year on our roadways. 
Road accidents are the most serious transportation safety 
problems that we face.  They account for nearly 95% of all 
transport related deaths.  An improved highway system would also 
provide the important economic spinoff of increased commercial 
activity for business and increased tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this motion and hope that the government will 
seriously look at this type of proposal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to support my colleague from Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands in dedicating fuel tax revenues to highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by describing a section of road: 
non-existent shoulders and blind curves, a narrow road jammed 
with tourists and commercial traffic made even more dangerous by 
wildlife, steep grades and falling debris, some roadsides with 
abrupt 500 metre drop-offs and no guardrails.  Where would this 
piece of highway be?  Is it in the Cape Breton Highlands?  Is it 
in Newfoundland?  Is it in a rural area of Ontario or Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is not in Etobicoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  It is the Trans-Canada Highway between 
Golden and Field, B.C.  One would expect that this piece of road 
would have been fixed.  I have been driving it for probably four 
decades and there has not been any great improvement in the road. 
Imagine a two-lane road, the Trans-Canada Highway, that is that 
dangerous and yet it has not been fixed.  The question is, why? 
Clearly it is a function of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every province has its killer chunk of highway, as my hon. 
colleague mentioned earlier.  We all know that there is one where 
each of us comes from.  Whether it is down around Windsor, in the 
maritimes or across the prairies, there are chunks of the main 
highways of this country which are clearly dangerous.  They are 
killing people. 
How are we going to address that?  How are we going to fix that 
up?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of ways. One is dedicated revenues, which I 
agree with.  I am not a big fan of dedicated revenues but I think 
in this case it is correct.  Another way would be toll roads. The 
Americans do some of that.  We tried it for example with the 
Coquihalla highway which was built for Expo '86 basically to feed 
the lower mainland during Expo.  My understanding is that it has 
been paid for seven times over.  The provincial government is now 
looking at it as a cash cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toll roads have opportunities but they tend to get abused. Again 
it brings up the question of double taxation because we are taxed 
already on our fuel taxes.  Why should we be then taxed to use 
the road? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use the American model because I believe the 
Americans have excellent roads.  They have dedicated revenues. 
They have found the prescription that is fair.  My NDP colleague 
was commenting earlier about areas like Manitoba that get no 
revenues, that are getting no money this year in the budget.  The 
Americans solved that by doing it on the number of miles of 
roads.  Some poor areas such as Mississippi and Arkansas because 
of their tax bases and their situations cannot afford to put the 
money into roads, but the national system does it on a per mile 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we transferred that formula to Canada, where Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba are having trouble in getting finances, this formula 
would solve it.  There would be dedicated revenues and the 
national highway system would be fixed up.  That is a good 
formula we can look toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Liberal Party commented earlier that it 
was in the budget and he is not supporting it but to my mind it 
is too little too late.  We have to address the system. Certainly 
the budget is dedicating some revenue and I do not quarrel with 
that, but it is not dedicating nearly enough revenue toward 
highways.  We are putting back about 5% of what we take in 
taxation revenue just from fuel.  That is wrong. Fuels are not a 
cash cow.  They simply need to be put back into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are areas like Windsor where 10,000 trucks a day are 
coming across the bridge and are being dumped into downtown 
Windsor. This is not a freeway system; basically they are 
municipal roads.  In situations like that, there is a bottleneck. 
NAFTA is clearly going to expand and there will be more trucks. 
We should fix the situation. We can deal with it with dedicated 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways the government is missing the point.  The point is 
where do we direct our tax revenues from gasoline, from diesel? 
Do they go into general revenues, into the main pot?  Do they go, 
as most of us in the House would agree with, back into the 
highway system?  We do not need a Cadillac system, the same as 
that of the Americans.  But we certainly do not need roads that 
are going to be like those of a banana republic if we keep going 
the way we have been for the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support my colleague.  It is a good idea.  In fact, I would 
ask unanimous consent of the House that this motion be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Alberni has asked the unanimous consent of the House 
that this motion be made votable.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As members know, the last 
five minutes are reserved for the 
sponsor of the bill, but we have another five minutes available 
for debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thought I would not have a chance to talk about this motion 
today, but I am a very fortunate man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact the government will not allow a vote, would not 
allow the will of the taxpayers to be done on this, I would like 
to touch on a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, suppose I took a significant chunk of your money 
and in return I gave you 6% back. 
This is a special year and I will give you a special deal, Mr. 
Speaker, because I like you.  I will give you only 4% of that 
money back.  I will keep 96% of the money. You would probably say 
that was not such a good deal.  Mr. Speaker, you are a pretty 
fiscally responsible fellow and you would probably say it was a 
pretty bad deal.  And that is exactly what has been happening in 
our country with fuel taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Folks at home please pay attention because this is your tax 
money at work.  The federal government takes in excess of $4 
billion of taxpayer funds.  For every tank of gas that we buy, 10 
cents on every litre goes to the federal government but we are 
given a pittance back in terms of what is returned in our 
highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shake our heads sometimes and ask why did the government do 
that?  Why did the federal government put a 10 cent tax on 
gasoline?  We already pay many taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1975 Petro-Canada was created, the nationalization of 
Petrofina.  And thank you Pierre Trudeau.  Albertans loved the 
prime minister for that, as you well know, Mr. Speaker.  The 
government taxed people 2.2 cents a litre. The funny thing about 
government is that over time, it just continues to grow.  It went 
from 2.2 cents in order to fund Petro-Canada, Pierre Trudeau's 
pet project, to become the 10 cent per litre tax that it is 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things known as dedicated taxes in this country.  The 
government will tell us that it does not believe in dedicated 
taxes, but it sure believed in dedicated taxes when it came to 
old age security. It believed in dedicated taxes when it came to 
the air navigation system.  But now the government is beyond 
dedicated taxes and is into something noble called slush funds. 
That is what the Liberal Party of Canada is into now. That party 
does not like dedicated taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slush funds are way better for the Liberals.  They can then take 
the 96 cents out of every dollar we pay in fuel taxes and buy 
votes from other folks. Why give the money back to the taxpayer? 
Instead, they can give the money to special interest groups or 
someone who is really going to appreciate it and give them 
electoral support or work for them on election day.  That is what 
they do with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my opinion, but what do the premiers have to say about 
this?  In 1994 at the annual premiers conference they said that 
they did not like the system either.  Provinces across the 
country said that they were getting shafted and they wanted 
something different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in a debate at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. Our 
mayor was there.  The provincial government, myself representing 
the official opposition, and our mayor all said that not only 20% 
but it would be really sweet if they could get 50% of the money 
that goes into the federal coffers to be spent on the national 
transportation system. But this year it is only going to be 4%, a 
far cry from 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the people of Calgary that our 
mayor Al Duerr would love to introduce a municipal fuel tax. As a 
result of that debate, the provincial government coughed up the 
money to give to the city of Calgary.  As a result the mayor did 
not get his way on a municipal fuel tax.  Remember that the mayor 
of Calgary is in favour of a municipal fuel tax.  Do not forget 
it next election day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government tries to say that this is a provincial 
responsibility, that it is not its bailiwick any more.  If it is 
not the federal government's bailiwick, why is the federal 
government taxing people 10 cents per litre and taking $4 billion 
of their money?  Leave it alone.  It is the taxpayers' money.  If 
the federal government is not going to give money back to the 
taxpayers in better roads, then it should not collect it in the 
first place.  If it is going to collect $4 billion and spend only 
$200 million, leave the money in the taxpayers pockets. 
Otherwise, direct that money toward the roads. I could go on 
about why that would be a good thing to do, but my time is up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a long, lonely 
ride.  It has been a ride over bad roads too, but that is another 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been at this now since 1995.  Occasionally, I get 
whispers from the ministerial side that makes me think that I am 
making headway.  However, it always seems to be not one step 
forward and two steps back, but one step forward and about five 
steps back.  We get a lot of rhetoric and a lot of talk about 
infrastructure programs, but in the meantime the roads are 
crumbling, people are dying and nothing is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the country needs is some action.  What the country needs 
is a Liberal like C.D. Howe to come back from the grave and show 
these guys how to run a country.  Instead, we have these effete 
folks who like to have money to spend for their little projects: 
their millennium projects, their patronage deals, the Prime 
Minister's riding and the $800 million to subsidize the CBC 
television network and so on.  But, something of substance, 
something we could look upon with pride and say “we built that, 
that is the Canadian national highway system” has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that as long as these folks continue to occupy those 
chairs, it will not happen.  We will still keep driving down to 
the United States.  If we want to go from Mississauga to 
Vancouver, we start off through Michigan.  This is the way it is. 
This is Canada.  This is what we have to show for the tens of 
billions of dollars that have been sucked out of Canadian 
truckers and private motorists over the last few decades.  To do 
what?  To go into that great black hole known as general revenue, 
but not to do anything useful for the country.  We cannot drive 
our cars safely on the national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I drove from Saskatchewan to Ottawa three years ago.  While 
driving across northern Ontario on the Trans-Canada Highway, I 
lost a windshield and a shock absorber.  Now that is beyond 
disgraceful.  We are almost into the 21st century and still we 
cannot build a decent highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked in a lot of third world countries.  I can assure 
members that in many of them the main trunk artery is a damn 
sight better than the main trunk artery in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Etobicoke did contradict something I had 
said in my presentation.  I quoted from a report of the Standing 
Committee on Transport, which in turn quoted the Minister of 
Finance as saying “yes, maybe we could look at dedicated 
revenue”.  If the member does not believe me he can check that 
himself in the government document.  I know that it is baloney 
because do I know this minister.  If there is one thing he has it 
is a hard head and his hard head does not allow for any input 
from private members, from his caucus or from anybody else.  He 
does not like dedicated taxes.  To use the American terminology, 
when there is a fire wall around that money he cannot get his 
greedy hands on it.  That is the whole idea of a fire wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, some day before I die, I will live to see a highway 
that one can safely and reasonably drive on, right from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific.  But, I get discouraged.  We have our 
surges in the country of activity.  All of a sudden, back in the 
late 1870s and early 1880s, we build a railroad.  It was a 
marvellous thing and we are still talking about it.  From 1958 to 
1962, we build a Trans-Canada Highway.  It was a lot better then 
than it is now because it had not had 30 years to fall apart.

modern industrialized state, did something useful and permanent, 
and gave taxpayers something to show for all the money that is 
being scooped up by the government.

for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now
