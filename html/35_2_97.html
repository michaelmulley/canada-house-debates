	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under Standing Order 52 of the House of Commons, I 
wish to request that an emergency debate be held regarding the 
reprehensible actions of Quebec's lieutenant-governor, Jean-Louis 
Roux.
<P>
	Given the role conferred on him by section 65 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867, and in light of his unacceptable, unjustifiable, and 
unspeakable behaviour during the second world war, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois are of the firm opinion that Mr. Roux is not able to carry 
out his duties as lieutenant-governor of Quebec in a dignified 
manner.
<P>
	We believe that, having worn the swastika and taken part in a 
demonstration whose stated purpose was to wreck the offices of 
<I>The Gazette</I>, during which endeavour damage was done to 
businesses belonging to members of the Jewish community, 
Quebec's lieutenant-governor, Jean-Louis Roux, cannot carry out 
his duties as representative of Her Majesty the Queen without 
prejudice to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	In particular, the lieutenant-governor has expressed no regret for 
over 50 years, having made no public apology to Quebecers, 
Canadians and the Jewish community.
<P>
	I would therefore ask that you consider favourably my request 
for an emergency debate.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-ISRAELFREETRADEAGREEMENTIMPLEMENTATIONACT">CANADA-ISRAEL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-61, an act to 
implement the Canada-Israel free trade agreement, as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today 
to debate Bill C-61, which is in keeping with our government's 
commitment to work with Canadian industry to ensure that we 
work on behalf of Canadian industry in removing tariff and 
non-tariff barriers to trade in markets that are of concern to Canada. 
Quite clearly this free trade deal with Israel is an area that Canada 
has worked on over the last number of years. It was with great 
anticipation in some industry sectors that Canada actually started 
the negotiations to remove the tariff barriers to trade. The Prime 
Minister initiated these discussions with the former prime minister 
of Israel in 1994. Some people have asked why Canada would want 
to conclude a free trade deal with Israel. Why is Israel an important 
state? At committee we were told that the trade figures are not so 
high as to make this an obvious priority.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government proceeded in 1994 with the initial 
discussions with the Israeli government. A number of Canadian 
companies, many resident in the province of Quebec, were having 
great difficulty competing in the Israeli market. This was 
happening because the United States and the European Union had 
entered into free trade arrangements with the state of Israel.
<P>
	In many cases Canadian businesses found their products were in 
a less competitive position than they would have been. They were 
not getting the preferential tariff treatment that goods provided 
from the United States and the European Union were getting 
because of the free trade deals that had been negotiated between 
those partners.
<P>
	The Canadian government felt that this market, although small, 
was where Canadian companies could grow. It was a market in the 
Middle East where we are extremely interested in expanding 
trading and investment activity.
<P>
	The House knows the importance of trade to Canada. Anyone 
who has been here or has worked in industry recognizes that the 
health of the Canadian economy, the jobs that must grow in this 
economy, are going to come by encouraging our incredibly 
competitive companies in the sectors in which they operate to look 
abroad for new markets. As most people in this House know, 
maybe some outside do not know, Canada is the leader in the G-7 
countries with respect to our percentage of GDP that comes from 
trade.
<P>
	The job creation record of this government since it came into 
power a few years ago shows that over 600,000 jobs have been 
created in the economy. Most jobs are related to trading activities, 
not just with the United States and Mexico but abroad. It is the 
fundamental belief of the government that if we want to see the 
economy grow, want to create jobs for Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast, then we must be outward looking, we must work 
with companies and other governments to ensure that those 
companies have an even footing when it comes to competing in 
foreign markets.
<P>
	This was clearly the case with Israel. The agreement was signed 
in July 1996 after an almost unprecedented level of consultation 
with Canadian industry. I will refer to that very briefly.
<P>
	We have in Canada what are called sectoral advisory groups and 
international trade. We also have groups with the provinces. 
Starting November 23, 1994 when the news release first came out 
literally dozens of meetings-I have pages of meetings-that took 
place with various sectoral advisory groups leading up to July 31, 
1996 when it was announced that Canada and Israel had signed the 
free trade agreement.
<P>
	Quite clearly this was not done on the back of a matchbook. It 
was a very complex set of negotiations. There were some areas 
which the Israeli government was very slow to move on but our 
negotiators were firm in their resolve. We were flexible in our 
approach but at the end of the day we knew that in order for 
Canadian companies to be competitive in the Israeli market 
Canadian companies had to be dealing on a level playing field.
<P>
	With the special treatment afforded the United States and the 
European Union it meant that Canadian companies could not be as 
competitive as they had to be in order to get those contracts, service 
that market and create jobs in Canada.
<P>
	I remember hearing a member from Quebec tell us a real story. A 
lot of times the bureaucrats will tell us that this has to be done for 
this or that reason but this was a real story. It was about a company 
in Montreal that was exporting into the Israeli market. Its problem 
was that it could not compete with American produced goods 
because of the preferential tariff afforded under the U.S.-Israel free 
trade agreement. The company did as much processing of the 
product in Canada as it could and then shipped a semi-finished 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6093"> 6093 </A></B>
<P>
product to the United States. In that way the value add could be 
done in the United States and those goods would then qualify under 
the rules of origin in the U.S.-Israel free trade deal. Those goods 
then could be shipped into the Israeli market as U.S. goods. That 
meant real jobs for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	We understand on our side of the House that the Montreal 
economy for a whole variety of reasons is not performing at the 
level at which we would like. However, for that one company and 
dozens of others which employ Canadians who live in and around 
the great city of Montreal, this bill gives them a level playing field. 
It means that they do not have to semi-finish their product and ship 
it to the United States where citizens of the United States gain the 
economic benefit and employment and the U.S. municipalities, 
states and federal government get the taxes that go with that type of 
economic activity. Under this deal that particular company and 
dozens of others like it can make sure that all of the product and all 
of the value add is done in Canada and that Canadians get 100 per 
cent of the net economic benefit for the competitiveness of the 
product and the entrepreneurship of the owners of those companies.
<P>
	We went ahead and did that. In the free trade deal with Israel we 
made sure that it also applies to the Palestinian territories. This has 
been a concern of the Canadian government, of most members of 
the House and of most people who are observers of what is going 
on in the Middle East.
<P>
	When these negotiations began we had great hopes that the peace 
process, which was going on in fits and starts, would gain some 
steam. Indeed, Canadians and most people around the world were 
very happy with what had happened as the peace process gained 
some steam and that the former administration in Israel had started 
to make some real progress toward eliminating some of the 
outstanding issues and solving some of the problems so that at long 
last the world there would be peace in the Middle East.
<P>
	One of the things Canada said from the very beginning was that 
if a free trade deal was negotiated with Israel, it was absolutely 
fundamental that goods that were produced in the occupied 
territories should also benefit from the preferential tariff that free 
trade would bring. Indeed, it has been the government's intention 
from the first meetings that took place with the Israelis that the 
Palestinian authorities would also be consulted to ensure that any 
benefit that accrued to Israel would also accrue to goods produced 
in the Palestinian territories.
<P>
	All through that peace, and most particularly starting on January 
12, 1995, Canada's chief negotiator was speaking with senior 
Palestinian officials to ensure that they understood that we had 
negotiated the CITA, the Canada-Israeli trade agreement, in 
principle and that the  benefits would be extended to goods 
produced in the West Bank and Gaza as was agreed to in the earlier 
meetings and teleconferences that senior overseas officials had 
with the Palestinian authorities.
<P>
	Again, in July and August the head of the mission in Israel had 
met with senior ministers in the Palestinian authority to ensure that 
they knew full well the terms and conditions of the Canada-Israel 
free trade deal and reaffirmed Canada's commitment to enact the 
necessary regulations after this legislation was ratified through the 
House and Senate of Canada so that the Palestinian territory would 
be included in any benefit that was given.
<P>
	Again in September a commercial counsellor from our embassy 
and our second secretariat met with senior Palestinian ministers of 
the economy and trade and deputy ministers to provide a hard copy 
of the Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	On October 20 Ambassador Berger, a former member of this 
place, made sure that if the Palestinian officials had any questions 
that the questions were properly couched so our officials could 
respond appropriately to any concerns that they had.
<P>
	On October 27 meetings took place because the Canadian 
government was very concerned about some comments that had 
been made during the legislative process that somehow the 
Palestinians were excluded from the benefits of this deal.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. As we speak meetings 
are going on in the occupied territories, in Palestine, which have 
been co-sponsored by the Palestinian ministry of trade and industry 
and the Canadian government via the Canadian embassy in Israel. 
The object of the meetings is to try to disseminate information to 
Palestinian businesses about the benefits of this free trade deal for 
goods that are produced in the occupied territories by Palestinian 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	All through this peace process the Canadian government has 
been extremely clear that it has always been its intention that any 
economic benefit that accrues to goods produced by entrepreneurs 
operating out of Israel proper would also be extended to 
entrepreneurs for goods produced in the occupied territories.
<P>
	To ensure transparency I should tell the House about another 
thing we have done. At committee the other day, on behalf of the 
government, I gave the committee a number of undertakings with 
the assumption that the House passes this legislation, the Senate 
deals with it in an appropriately hasty fashion, it is proclaimed in 
law by the end of the year so we can live up to the timetable of the 
agreement and have it enacted on January 1, 1997.
<P>
	In order to provide members of the standing committee with the 
assurance they needed that this deal will apply to the occupied 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6094"> 6094 </A></B>
<P>
Palestinian territories, I have  agreed on behalf of the government 
to do three things. First, I have agreed to put the draft regulations to 
the House committee, which is unusual because the regulations 
would normally be gazetted after the bill was passed at the end of 
December.
<P>
	The committee has deliberated and added to our understanding 
and discussion of not only the economic circumstances 
surrounding this deal but also of the larger geopolitical 
circumstances within which this deal has been constructed. I would 
hope that by next week the members of the standing committee on 
foreign affairs would have at their disposal the draft regulations so 
they can satisfy themselves that after this bill is passed into law, the 
regulations will do what the officials said they would do, which is 
de facto extend the benefits of the Canada-Israeli free trade deal to 
the Palestinian territories.
<P>
	Second, on behalf of the government I have undertaken to file 
the letters we have received to date from the Israeli authorities with 
the clerk of the committee thus making them public documents. 
These letters indicate that the Israelis understand and agree that this 
deal applies to the Palestinian territories and for the purposes of 
this deal they will treat any goods produced in the occupied 
territories the same and give them the same passage as if they were 
produced within the sovereign state of Israel.
<P>
	We have a letter from the Israelis on file, which we will 
reconfirm. It indicates quite clearly that they will do what they 
have to do with respect to rules of origin but they will do what they 
have to do under this deal to ensure the goods produced in the 
Palestinian territories flow seamlessly through Israel and into the 
Canadian market, and vice versa that goods which are covered 
under this deal from the Canadian market will flow seamlessly 
through Israel and into the occupied territories.
<P>
	That is a very strong document which has legal force. It is an 
undertaking from one government to the other to not impede the 
goods that are produced in the occupied territories or that are 
produced in Canada and destined for the occupied territories.
<P>
	It is also our hope that by that time we will have a letter back 
from the Palestinian authority with whom we are in almost daily 
contact. We hope the letter expresses agreement that the benefits 
and terms of the Canada-Israeli deal do indeed flow into the 
occupied territories.
<P>
	All of those letters will be made public when they are deposited 
with the clerk of the committee. Then the members of the foreign 
affairs committee who have raised some very good suggestions and 
legitimate concerns will be able to examine in the light of day how 
everything we said would be done to extend this deal to the 
territories indeed will have been done.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	We must not lose sight of the fact that this deal first and foremost 
has been done not to benefit the Israelis, not to benefit the 
Palestinians, but to benefit Canadian companies that are active in 
that region.
<P>
	We must recognize that there are very major and disturbing 
issues which are yet to be settled in the Middle East with respect to 
the peace process in Israel, the status of the West Bank and Gaza. 
However, to date nobody on the Palestinian side has told us this is 
not a good deal, that it should not go forward and that they do not 
want the benefits of the Canada-Israel free trade deal to be equally 
applied to goods produced in the Palestinian territories.
<P>
	We on the government side continue at the diplomatic level and 
government to government to encourage the Israeli government to 
put the peace process back on track. To date we have done 
everything we can in meetings and discussions between our foreign 
affairs minister and heads of state to indicate quite clearly it is 
Canada's desire that the peace process which was started and seems 
to have faltered of late be put back on track. It is the logic of the 
Canadian government that it is only through peace in the Middle 
East, no matter if they are Palestinians or Israelis, no matter who 
they are, that they will be able to live to their full potential. The 
region will be able to grow and stability will be long lasting when 
the outstanding issues with respect to the peace process are 
determined.
<P>
	Canada continues to support a very strong effort by the 
international community. We are part of that community. We are 
part of the effort to see the peace process concluded properly.
<P>
	At the same time we know that for the Palestinians, those 
individuals who seek to have their political situation defined 
properly in the international context, who seek peace and for the 
Israelis who seek peace and security, that once this is all done, 
peace and security will only be long lasting if the economic 
potential of the region is realized. Then the individuals, 
Palestinians, Israelis, or whoever they are will be able to live and to 
prosper in the region with the type of jobs and wealth that are 
required for internal and external stability.
<P>
	This free trade deal is timely. We believe in spite of the fact that 
the peace process appears to have slowed, that the benefits which 
are in this deal are not one sided. The benefits, because they will 
apply equally to the goods produced in the occupied territories and 
Israeli goods, will be working on a parallel track to the peace 
process. As peace comes to the Middle East we will have a greater 
economic input in building the required economic stability for all 
the states concerned.
<P>
	Those who have been critical have said that the timing is bad. 
The timing may not be the way we wanted it but it still is timely. 
For those individuals who are living in the  occupied territories and 
find themselves cut off from international trade, even though we do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6095"> 6095 </A></B>
<P>
not do a great deal of trade, this is an opportunity for them to find 
new markets in Canada. For Canadian companies that are working 
in the Middle East, this gives them equal access. It gives them a 
level playing field so that their goods can compete on an equal 
footing with European goods and with goods from the United 
States in the Israeli market.
<P>
	Further, as this free trade deal gets implemented, more and more 
Canadian companies will become involved in that market. It will 
open a window of opportunity for further trade in all of the 
European countries and further investment by Canadian companies 
in industries in Israel, in the occupied territories, in Egypt, in 
Jordan, in all the states in the Middle East.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is my hope that the consensus we seemed to 
have in this House at second reading will continue at report stage 
and third reading of this bill. I hope we will be able to dispatch this 
bill to the other place. I hope when it does get to the other place that 
they recognize that this bill has been carefully crafted. It has taken 
over two years of negotiation. It is supported by over 20 different 
sectoral advisor groups on international trade which the 
government has put up.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	First and foremost, the agreement will give Canadian companies 
operating in the region a level playing field. It will give them equal 
access to those markets with their American and European 
counterparts. In the long term it will assist in some small way in 
ensuring that once the peace process is concluded, that Canadian 
companies and Canadian investment will add to the stability of the 
Middle East.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the parliamentary secretary for his speech. You will, however, see 
in the next few minutes that the government has not earned an 
honourable mention for today's speech.
<P>
	First of all, I must point out that the government added the bill to 
the order paper at the last minute yesterday evening, very likely on 
the assumption that, since all of the members of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade were out of 
the country on committee business, discussion of the bill this 
morning would not pose too much of a problem.
<P>
	I would point out to them, however, that we are here and are well 
informed on the issue, so we too will be able to contest the stuff and 
nonsense we have just been treated to.
<P>
	Let me begin by stating that we are totally in agreement with the 
Canada-Israel free trade agreement. We in Quebec are part of a free 
trade Canada. We will not oppose the principle of a free trade 
agreement  between Canada and Israel. However, contrary to what 
the parliamentary secretary has just admitted, we are in a position 
to ask some questions about its timing. He says this is the right 
time. We, on the other hand, believe that it could not be a worse 
time for the ratification or implementation of such an agreement.
<P>
	On October 9, I rose in this House in support of Bill C-61, the 
purpose of which was to implement the Canada-Israel free trade 
agreement the Government of Canada rushed to sign on July 31 last 
with the government of the State of Israel.
<P>
	In that speech, however, I regretted the fact that everything 
surrounding the agreement had been kept secret and that there had 
been an unacceptable lack of consultation in the matter. I also 
referred to the dissatisfaction of Quebec's top of the line women's 
swimwear industry.
<P>
	While my views are the same concerning the reservations 
expressed during second reading, I still believe that having a free 
trade agreement may be beneficial to the Quebec and the Canadian 
economy, and that this agreement will no doubt increase trade 
between our two countries.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of free trade, free trade 
agreements in general and of course the free trade agreement with 
Israel, but always at the appropriate time.
<P>
	Since our first debate on Bill C-61 on October 9, I have now 
realized that the government is trying to get this agreement through 
as Parliament quickly and discreetly as possible. This raises many 
questions. If this agreement is so wonderful, why is the government 
trying to implement it on the sly, as it were? Because this 
agreement is becoming increasingly controversial from the 
political point of view. That is why.
<P>
	Hon. members will agree that this morning's third reading is 
foolishly being rushed through, at a time when all members of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, who heard a 
number of witnesses on Bill C-61 and are very well informed on 
this topic, are outside the country on committee business. Too bad 
for the minister and the parliamentary secretary: there are still a 
number of members in this House who know all about this issue 
and the protests that were heard before the committee.
<P>
	These witnesses who came before us on October 29 told us, first 
of all, that the coming into force of the agreement on January 1, as 
proposed in Bill C-61, was a mistake. First, because it was not the 
right time to implement the agreement now that the peace process 
in the Middle East is in worse shape than ever before.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Arab groups also pointed out that this free trade agreement was 
perceived by many Arabs, in Canada and in the Middle East, as a 
sign that Canada supported the  actions of Israel and the 
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If this free 
trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6096"> 6096 </A></B>
<P>
agreement were to come into force at this time, according to them it 
might even endanger the peace process in the Middle East.
<P>
	As for the situation of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories-the agreement will automatically apply to the occupied 
territories as soon as it comes into effect-its stability is very 
fragile. Witnesses told us that the Palestinians do not even control 
their own territory, much less their economy, which means that 
today, to apply the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement to 
Palestinian territory would be to recognize the albeit illegal control 
the State of Israel has over the Palestinian people.
<P>
	The occupied territories are at this very moment practically in a 
state of war. That is what professors, Arab representatives and 
entrepreneurs came to tell members of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Interestingly, these 
witnesses had never been consulted previously by the department. 
After listening to this testimony, which put a different light on the 
matter, we tried to move amendments to Bill C-61, but to no avail.
<P>
	Our goal, which was shared by many, including Liberal 
members, was to defer the implementation of the agreement until 
two conditions had been met. First, the peace process had to be well 
under way. It seems to me this is commendable.
<P>
	Second, the negotiations between the State of Israel and the 
Palestinian authorities on the future of the occupied territories had 
to be completed. This amendment to clause 62 of Bill C-61 reads as 
follows. This is the text of the amendment presented by the Bloc 
Quebecois to the committee reviewing Bill C-61:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No order may be made by the Governor in Council under subsection (1) unless he 
has been advised by the committee of the House of Commons to which foreign 
affairs matters are normally referred that the committee is satisfied that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the Government of the State of Israel has taken satisfactory steps to implement 
the agreement;</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is already in Bill C-61.
<P>
	But we added the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) that the peace process between the State of Israel and the Palestinian authorities is 
well under way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will demonstrate in a moment that this amendment to the bill is 
completely consistent with the Canadian government's foreign 
policy. We are therefore justified in wondering why they voted 
against something that was consistent with their own policy.
<P>
	And,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) that the negotiations between the State of Israel and the Palestinian authorities on 
the political status and economic development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
indicate that these two territories are about to gain effective control over their 
economic and internal affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The chairman of the Standing Committee on foreign Affairs and 
International Trade ruled this amendment out of order for 
procedural reasons, on the basis that the changes were outside the 
scope of the bill.
<P>
	We would also have liked to amend the preamble to the bill. You 
realize that, with the agreement having already been signed by the 
government, no changes can be made to the wording of the 
agreement per se. This in itself is quite frustrating, in a 
parliamentary system that claims to be democratic, for an elected 
representative like myself who does not have a say until it is too 
late to make any changes and the agreement has been signed.
<P>
	We would have liked to amend the preamble since that is the 
only part of Bill C-61 that we are entitled to change. But, again for 
reasons of lack of consistency with the spirit of this agreement 
entered into quietly by the parties, we were told changes could not 
be made.
<P>
	A clause might have been added, as suggested by some 
witnesses, to deal with human rights and democratic principles. 
The Bloc Quebecois considers it is essential that fundamental 
rights be respected, and such a principle should be an integral part 
of any agreement like this Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade felt and still feels that the 
protection of human rights has no place in a free trade agreement, 
even though the free trade agreement between Israel and the 
European Union contains an interesting clause in this regard: ``The 
relations between the parties, as well as all the provisions in this 
agreement, are based on respect for human rights and the 
democratic principles that underlie their domestic and international 
policies and constitute an essential part of this agreement''.
<P>
	If such an amendment to the Canada-Israel free trade agreement 
had been proposed, we would have supported it right away, but we 
were prevented from putting it forward by the committee on 
foreign affairs and international trade.
<P>
	A provision on the Canadian government's commitment to the 
Middle East peace process could have been included in the 
preamble. Our government could have used this provision as a 
moral benchmark for its future actions in that part of the world.
<P>
	A clause on Canada's foreign policy regarding the occupied 
territories would have been quite appropriate. I will get back to this 
glaring contradiction in the agreement a little later, but for now I 
will just point out how the Canadian government has violated its 
own foreign policy by signing the free trade agreement with Israel, 
since it also applies to the occupied territories.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6097"> 6097 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has always maintained that these 
territories are illegally occupied by the State of Israel and that the 
Palestinians should be the ones in charge.
<P>
	I will now quote Canada's foreign policy on the situation in that 
part of the world: ``As far as the occupied territories are concerned, 
Canada does not recognize the permanency of Israeli control over 
the territories occupied since 1967 (the Golan Heights, the West 
Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip) and opposes any 
unilateral measure to determine in advance the results of 
negotiations, including the establishment of new settlements in the 
territories and unilateral measures to annex East Jerusalem and the 
Golan Heights. In Canada's opinion, these measures contravene 
international law and undermine the peace process''.
<P>
	Further on in this policy, the Canadian government addresses the 
rights of Palestinians, and I quote: ``Canada recognizes that the 
legitimate rights of Palestinians that must be exercised in the 
context of peace negotiations, including the right to 
self-determination, must be respected''.
<P>
	This is not interference. It is simply consistency in foreign 
policy. We are in agreement with it, but when we asked the Liberal 
government to observe its foreign policy, we met with a categorical 
refusal.
<P>
	We are in favour of establishing trade ties with the State of Israel 
and the Palestinian people. But we do not feel this is the right time 
to implement the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, given the 
present very worrisome situation in the Middle East.
<P>
	We are aware of the commitment the Canadian government 
made to the State of Israel by signing the free trade agreement last 
July 31. But we feel that the political and social context is no longer 
the same as when the Canadian government began its negotiations 
with the State of Israel. Nor is it the same as when the agreement 
was finalized and signed.
<P>
	Furthermore, even the Israeli government in power has changed. 
We cannot deny the negative impact on the peace process of the 
death of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, almost 
exactly one year ago.
<P>
	For some months now, the Middle East peace process has been 
taking a turn for the worse. Negotiations have practically come to a 
standstill. Exchanges of violence have continued since the opening 
of the Jerusalem tunnel last September. Recently, the Israeli 
government approved an increase in its budget, apparently in order 
to bump up the number of troops at the border with Syria in the 
event of war.
<P>
	Spending related to Jewish settlement went up by 90 per cent 
recently, although it is known for a fact that the principal source of 
disagreement between Israelis and Palestinians has to do with 
Jewish settlements. The situation is far from ideal and the 
implementation of the  agreement in this context is far from 
appropriate. It is true that the government feels that this agreement 
can help the peace process by increasing trade.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	That is what we thought also, but some very well informed 
witnesses have explained that, on the contrary, the timing of the 
agreement will be harmful instead, and will convince the 
Palestinians that Canada is siding with the Israelis, contrary to its 
foreign policy. Let me repeat, we are not against the Canada-Israel 
Free Trade Agreement, but we do question its timing. The 
worrisome situation in that part of the world is obvious to anyone 
who watches the news.
<P>
	What are we to do if the peace process is not successful in the 
medium term? This is a legitimate question, and my answer is that, 
for once, we must question the type of economic partner Canada 
wants to have.
<P>
	What is more, it is our opinion, as it was the opinion of the 
Canadian government in its foreign policy statement from which I 
have already quoted, that the government of Israel is occupying the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank illegally, in flagrant violation of 
international law.
<P>
	How, then, can we approve having the agreement apply 
automatically to these territories, without the Palestinian 
authorities' accepting the Agreement, and particularly without the 
Palestinian people's having total control over its territory and its 
economy, so as to reap the full benefit of this free trade agreement?
<P>
	The government tells us, as the parliamentary secretary did in his 
speech, that it is pursuing negotiations and exchanging letters with 
Palestinian leaders. It seems to me that instead of ratifying so 
quickly the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement we could wait for 
the completion of these processes. We will be able to study the 
letters and regulations and adopt a more enlightened position on the 
issue.
<P>
	During the last committee hearing, the parliamentary secretary 
came in with a new card in hand, saying: ``The official opposition 
members of the foreign affairs committee have brought forward 
very good arguments in the last few hearings, so there is something 
we forgot to tell you. It is true that we have now been in negotiation 
for more than a year. It is also true that we forgot to consult several 
groups, so some of them came to see me. We forgot to inform you 
that we had an exchange of correspondence with the Palestinians 
that we will make public after the vote on Bill C-61''.
<P>
	He also said: ``It is also true that we forgot to tell you about some 
regulations but we intend to make them public after the debate on 
Bill C-61 in the House. Do not worry, you will see that we did some 
good work. Have no fear, you will see the documents but we cannot 
show them to you immediately because we have not had time to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6098"> 6098 </A></B>
<P>
prepare them. We forgot to tell you about them, but we are 
informing you now''.
<P>
	This took place no later that one week ago. Why did the Liberals 
bring forward new arguments just a few days before the debate on 
Bill C-61 in this House? They knew very well that the present 
situation would not help them and that the lack of consistency of 
their foreign affairs policy would not help them either.
<P>
	Therefore, they had to use some pretty ``bright'' subterfuge in 
order to get us to say: ``Listen, support this agreement, support Bill 
C-61, then we will make public the letters exchanged between the 
Palestinian authorities and the Canadian government. Then, we 
will make public the regulations designed to include the Palestinian 
people, or at least to ensure they fully benefit from this free trade 
agreement. Do not worry.''
<P>
	But, given what we have seen for three years, for those who have 
known the Liberal Party over the years, there is reason to be 
somewhat concerned, at least a little concerned when we are told 
after a few months, a few years of negotiation: ``Afterwards, you 
will see all the documents, all the papers.'' Why were we told that 
the first time only last week? This also is a little strange.
<P>
	As I said, if we are given those letters, we will be able to analyze 
them and to have a more informed discussion. It is true that, until 
now, Palestinians have not opposed the application of the 
Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement in their territory.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	They probably feel that this agreement is an unexpected opening 
onto a foreign country and therefore can help them. It is exactly for 
this reason that Palestinian authorities must be part of the 
negotiations and that their situation should not be dealt in their 
absence with the Israeli government, as the Canadian government 
is trying to do now.
<P>
	This is such a current issue that this very morning, the French 
and English dailies contained articles dealing with the 
Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement. I quote a report from 
Associated Press entitled ``Call to Israel's Boycott as the Cairo 
Summit approaches'', from which I will read some brief excerpts. 
It is a very relevant report that appeared this morning in <I>La Presse</I>.
<P>
	It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Egyptian Union of Chambers of Commerce has called on its members to 
boycott Israel and to refrain from all bilateral or multilateral co-operation with it, 
including with the State of Israel.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further on, it reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We reject any economic co-operation with Israel so long as a global political 
settlement has not been reached in the Near East.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That was said by the representative of the Egyptian Chambers of 
Commerce.
<P>
	Later on, the article stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Palestinian manufacturers decided to boycott the economic summit by way of 
protest against Israel's sealing off their territories, which is choking their economy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The same kind of report can be found in English newspapers in 
Canada today and probably everywhere in the world. This is no 
secret. Liberals tried to keep the negotiations secret for a lot of 
things, but this is no secret. The Palestinian situation is now well 
known.
<P>
	Moreover, as mentioned in these articles, one must keep in mind 
the situation in the occupied territories. For the time being, the 
Israelis are controlling the territories and their economy. Since 
February 1996, the territories have been sealed off almost 
permanently, preventing Palestinians from harvesting their crops 
and even working.
<P>
	According to an American study, Israel is using this 
border-closing policy to prevent the influx of competitive 
Palestinian farm products and manufactured goods on the Israeli 
market, thus hampering all attempts of the Palestinian economy to 
take off, and increasing its dependency on Israel's economy.
<P>
	We can only presume that the free trade agreement will make the 
situation worse, increasing Israel's control over the Palestinian 
economy. On the other hand, it should be noted that the economic 
life in the occupied territories is nearly at a standstill. Foreign trade 
has just about disappeared. The economy is working at only 3 or 4 
per cent of its capacity and, this spring, the unemployment rate was 
between 60 and 70 per cent in the Gaza Strip and between 40 and 
50 per cent on the West Bank, not to mention a very tense climate 
and numerous violent flare-ups.
<P>
	The same article went on to say, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to a report published last week by the UN, as a result of the repeated 
sealing off of the territories, the Palestinian GDP has dropped by 23 per cent over the 
past four years, and the per capita income has declined by 39 per cent over the same 
period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To conclude, we are questioning the coming into force in the 
occupied territories of the free trade agreement signed by Israel, as 
long as the Palestinians have not agreed to it and the Palestinian 
people are not in full control of their territory and economy.
<P>
	We believe that this is not the time to implement such an 
agreement now that the peace process has been stopped and is in 
very bad shape indeed. As long as we are not convinced, as we 
mentioned in our amendments, that the explosive situation in the 
Middle East has been defused, we believe that the coming into 
force of Bill C-61-and consequently of the free trade 
agreement-should be at least delayed. We believe that the coming 
into force of this agreement on January 1st, 1997, and the passing 
now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6099"> 6099 </A></B>
<P>
of Bill C-61 send the wrong  message to Canadians, the world in 
general and the Arab world in particular.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Given the evidence we heard on October 29 and the new 
developments, and since Israel is preparing for war by releasing 
new funds for this purpose, we would think that, on the contrary, 
our intervention at this critical point in time could have a negative 
impact on the peace process.
<P>
	It would be much better to encourage the Israeli and the 
Palestinians to seriously negotiate the restoration of peace in the 
Middle East and, meanwhile, to suspend this agreement, which 
could favour one of the two parties involved.
<P>
	We must put pressure on the Israeli government to respect 
international law and therefore the Palestinian people. The 
Canadian government must have the political courage to put the 
agreement on hold. The Bloc Quebecois, and probably the Reform 
Party, would support such an action. The Bloc Quebecois totally 
disagrees with the approach chosen by the Liberal government for 
the signing of free trade agreements. The secrecy, the lack of 
consultation are totally unacceptable and contrary to what we are 
being told.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that the Canadian government would negotiate 
and sign free trade agreements by itself and without any 
transparency. This is what the federal government did in the case of 
the Canada-Israel agreement and it is doing the same thing for the 
Canada-Chile agreement, which is now being negotiated.
<P>
	Once the text of the agreement is published, it will be too late to 
change it because the agreement will already have been signed. 
What a remarkable democracy! Then they will ask this House to 
discuss the Canada-Chile free trade agreement, as they are doing 
now for Israel, saying: ``The only element you have the power to 
change is the date of coming into force''. And even on that point, 
the Liberal majority in committee will decide if the date should be 
modified or not.
<P>
	Even if the Liberal majority decides, according to its convictions 
and just as it did at the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, to postpone the date the agreement comes into 
force, it will be very simple, they will only change the players. The 
government takes the knowledgeable players and puts them on the 
bench, puts them aside, then sends in people who have not heard 
about this free trade agreement because, as hard working as they 
are, as sharp as they are, they are part of other committees and have 
other issues to examine. The government sends them to raise their 
hands in committee and say: ``Agreed''.
<P>
	They were not present at previous committee meetings. They did 
not hear witnesses, they have only influenced the government 
party's decision, as opposed to the beliefs of men and women who 
were sitting on the foreign affairs committee and who had to be 
replaced at the last minute so that the international trade minister 
could have his bill passed clause by clause.
<P>
	Even the clerk had to be replaced so that another one could come 
and tell us that our amendments were out of order, even though our 
amendments were totally compatible with clause 62 of the bill.
<P>
	It is relatively simple. What we were supposed to put forward 
dealt with the coming into force of the Canada-Israel free trade 
agreement, that is: Is the timing appropriate, given the current 
situation in Israel and the occupied territories? We are sending a 
signal to that part of the world that Canada is going against its 
foreign policy as defined by the government, not by us, as this is 
not the position of the official opposition here but the position of 
the Canadian government.
<P>
	Does the Canadian government want to send a signal to the rest 
of the world that it believes everything is well with the 
Palestinians, everything is well with the Israelis, everything is well 
in that part of the world, and that now we can sign a free trade 
agreement, do business with everybody involved, even though 
Palestinians have no control over their economy, even though 
Palestinians have no control over their territory, even though the 
peace process has been significantly disrupted? No.
<P>
	According to the Canadian government, this position is a 
figment of the imagination of the official opposition, this position 
is unrealistic. News bulletins, newspaper articles must have been 
made up, they must not be true. And we, the Canadian government, 
they say, are prepared to send this signal to the entire world, that is, 
that we can do business, no matter what the situation is, with that 
part of the world. That is what the Bloc Quebecois wonders about.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We will continue to ask questions to the government party before 
supporting Bill C-61. I want to repeat that we totally agree with a 
Canada-Israel free trade agreement, but only at the appropriate 
time.

<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Finance has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to rise to 
speak in support of the Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	As members know, trade is extremely important to this country. 
One third of the jobs in this country are dependent on exports. As 
members may know, every $1 billion in trade translates into 11,000 
jobs.
<P>
	We should never underestimate the importance of trade to this 
country. This government, recognizing that, has made several 
efforts to enhance trade opportunities for Canadian businesses.
<P>
	First, members will be aware of the several trade missions that 
the Prime Minister has lead to various parts of the world which 
have resulted in billions of dollars in contracts translating into tens 
of thousands of jobs in this country.
<P>
	Those trade missions and the success of those trade missions 
help to explain why Canada has led the OECD in job growth. This 
government has also taken other steps in the trade area, notably, 
promoting trade liberalization through the GATT or the WTO as it 
is known. Canada has led the multilateral effort for trade 
liberalization.
<P>
	This government has taken the initiative in promoting freer trade 
bilaterally in the NAFTA, adding Mexico to the negotiations that 
are ongoing with Chile which may well in time lead to a bilateral 
free trade agreement with that country and South America, and 
lately the bill we are speaking on to implement the Canada-Israel 
free trade agreement.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	With respect to Israel, Canadian businesses have been at a 
distinct disadvantage. Israel and the European Community have a 
free trade agreement, and so does Israel and the United States. That 
means Canadian businesses wishing to export products to Israel are 
at a competitive disadvantage.
<P>
	This trade initiative will level the playing field, leading to 
enhanced trade and investment opportunities for Canadians doing 
business with Israel. This deal will also give Canada a foothold in 
the Middle East, maintaining  us as a player in fostering freer trade 
in that region and enhancing economic relations with an important 
part of the world. Canada, through negotiating this treaty with 
Israel, shows its readiness to embrace new and emerging 
economies in this trade liberalization effort. Members should not 
lose sight of the fact that the Canada-Israel treaty will be a model 
for other treaties with other countries in that region.
<P>
	Members opposite have raised a number of questions and a 
number of questions are out there that we should respond to. One of 
those questions is why free trade with Israel, why at this time. Let 
me remind members that when we are talking about the Middle 
East we must not lose sight of the fact that the State of Israel is the 
only democracy in the Middle East, a vigorous democracy at that. 
We need only reflect on the very hotly contested Israeli elections 
this past spring to recognize what a vigorous and vibrant 
democracy is the State of Israel today.
<P>
	While others may wonder why not free trade right now with 
other countries in the Middle East, we must remember that Canada 
would not enter into free trade arrangements with countries which 
are not members of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and it 
is only Israel in that region of the world which qualifies.
<P>
	I repeat that free trade with Israel will provide a level playing 
field and respond to the disadvantage that Canadian business has 
been under in not having free trade access which its American and 
European competitors have in that area. The free trade agreement 
with Israel can certainly be a model for free trade agreements with 
other countries of that region when they join the WTO.
<P>
	There are members in this House and people in this country who 
ask whether it is wise to benefit Israel at this time. They are 
concerned about events there, as we all are, and they ask that 
question. I want to respond with a couple of points.
<P>
	First, I want to point out that the initiative, the impetus, the 
genesis of this agreement is Canadian business. It is not the State of 
Israel that has come to Canada and asked for the advantage of free 
trade. It is Canadian businesses that have come to the Canadian 
government and said that in the efforts to liberalize trade, let us do 
something in an important area of the world, the Middle East, the 
gateway to enormous business opportunities for Canadians. Let us 
end this comparative disadvantage they have vis-à-vis their 
American and European counterparts by negotiating a free trade 
agreement. The initiative is from Canadian businesses and the 
primary benefit is to Canadian businesses.
<P>
	Second, I would like to focus on the fact that this treaty is 
remarkably important not only for the trade and investment 
opportunities it provides but for the fact that the benefits of this 
treaty will extent to the Gaza and the  West Bank. This initiative of 
extending the free trade agreement to the Gaza and West Bank was 
a development that the Canadian government undertook and is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6101"> 6101 </A></B>
<P>
indeed one that caught our American friends by surprise, so much 
so that they have now very recently extended their free trade 
agreement also to Gaza and the West Bank. Canada has been a 
trailblazer in this aspect of the treaty which I think will provide real 
economic benefit to people not only in the State of Israel but in the 
West Bank and Gaza.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	I point out that the Government of Israel has taken all steps 
required under the treaty to extend the benefit of the treaty to the 
West Bank and Gaza. I have seen the letter and members will have 
undoubtedly heard about it. If not, I draw their attention to a letter 
from Natan Sharansky, the minister of industry and trade, the 
Government of Israel, to the Minister for International Trade, our 
minister responsible for this treaty.
<P>
	The letter confirms that the Government of Israel supports the 
principle of the extension of this treaty both inbound and outbound 
to the Gaza and West Bank territories. That is extremely important. 
For those who wonder if the benefit of this treaty will ever extend 
to those regions, they need only look at this document. It illustrates 
that Israel is doing everything it undertook to do in the treaty as 
negotiated.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, there are members in the House who say 
this is not good for the Palestinians or it is not good at this time. I 
find it ironic that Canadian politicians can be so presumptuous in 
telling the Palestinian authority what is good for it. The Palestinian 
authority and the Palestinian people in the West Bank, Gaza and 
elsewhere are in a position to tell us whether or not this agreement 
is in the interests of the people who live in the West Bank and Gaza. 
There has been no official comment to the Canadian government 
that this treaty is not appropriate at this time, that it is not desirable. 
Quite to the contrary. We should take note of that.
<P>
	Members should recognize this treaty for free trade between 
Canada and Israel provides remarkable opportunities not just for 
Canadian business but also for Canadians to continue to be 
significant participants in economic and other developments in an 
important region of the world.
<P>
	There would be no other way for the people of Gaza and the West 
Bank to have the benefit of free trade, as there is no Palestinian 
state and there is no other state in the Middle East that could 
qualify for free trade with Canada at this time. This additional 
provision of the agreement, its extension to Gaza and the West 
Bank, is a remarkable opportunity to enhance economic 
opportunities for people in those regions.
<P>
	I urge members on all sides of the House to wholeheartedly 
support this free trade agreement for the benefits it provides, for 
the opportunities it provides to Canadians including Canadian 
exporters, for the opportunities it provides for Canada to maintain 
an important role in an extremely important part of the world. I 
urge hon. members to support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
has spoken about the benefits of the free trade deal, both for Israel 
and for Palestinians in the occupied territories.
<P>
	I know he was probably listening in the lobby. The spokesperson 
for the official opposition indicated many times during his speech 
that somehow the government should stop this process because it 
was not in the best interests of the Palestinians. The member who 
just spoke mentioned some documents which clearly indicate that 
the Canadian government has been in constant dialogue with 
Palestinian authorities.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member's comments about what I said in 
committee the other day. I said that sometimes some of us in public 
office believe we have to speak for everyone as if no one other than 
us has a voice. In this case, is it his belief that the Palestinian 
authorities have had ample opportunity to express their viewpoint 
particularly if they were opposed to this deal because it was not in 
their best economic or political interests?
<P>
	I would like to hear his comments with respect to the seminars, 
which are apparently being held this week jointly sponsored by the 
minister of industry for the Palestinian authority and the Canadian 
embassy officials from Israel.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
elaborate on what I said. Numerous contacts have been made, as I 
understand it, with the Palestinian authority. The Palestinian 
authority has been briefed and informed by our ambassador as to 
the free trade agreement and is well aware of the fact that it is now 
being debated before this House.
<P>
	I do not think any of us should doubt the capacity of the 
Palestinian authority to weigh in, as it does from time to time, on 
issues that are of concern and importance to it. That is why it is so 
ironic to find some members of this House concerned about the 
impact of this particular initiative at this time on the Palestinians or 
the Palestinian authority. We should afford them the respect they 
deserve in their ability to speak in their own self-interests.
<P>
	There are ongoing discussions as the parliamentary secretary 
mentioned. Continuous economic consultations between our 
embassy and Palestinian representatives are ongoing 
notwithstanding the fact that we are in the midst of debate and 
hopefully in very short order will be passing this important trade 
agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6102"> 6102 </A></B>
<P>
	I thank the parliamentary secretary for his comment and the 
opportunity to elaborate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a few questions to the hon. member who spoke 
after me. Questions which, I believe, are fairly simple and to which 
I hope to receive simple and clear answers.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to make a comment. Through its 
parliamentary secretary, the government said that seminars would 
be held this week between the Department of International Trade 
and Palestinian authorities, when we are expected to deal with Bill 
C-61 today. Would it not be better to have these seminars or 
meetings before instead of after?
<P>
	Now, here is my simple question: Could the hon. member tell us 
whether, according to him and his government, Palestinians control 
their economy and their territory?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been numerous 
meetings between the Palestinian minister of economy and trade 
and various others with respect to this agreement. We are not just 
starting that process; this has been ongoing. The Canadian 
ambassador to Israel, who is also responsible for the West Bank 
and Gaza, has had numerous contacts over the last year with 
Palestinian authorities on this trade agreement. This is not 
something we are just starting right now.
<P>
	The second issue again raises the question of who should speak 
for the interests of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. I 
assert emphatically that it is the Palestinian authority and it can tell 
us how it feels about this. The Palestinian authority's actions speak 
volumes about the importance it sees in this treaty for the West 
Bank and Gaza.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member and I agree with him that one third of 
the jobs in Canada depend on international trade. However, I do 
deplore the lack of information. Hon. members were not kept 
abreast of the negotiations leading to this agreement, and 
unfortunately we now have the same problem with respect to the 
negotiations between Canada and Chile.
<P>
	I asked the Minister of International Trade for a progress report, 
but all we got was one briefing with a public servant, who did not 
answer all of our questions. As hon. members, we should be better 
informed about such negotiations.
<P>
	I also deplore the fact that this Canada-Israel agreement does not 
include any social provisions to protect workers, as is the case in 
NAFTA or the Canada-Chile agreement. These two agreements 
provide  for parallel agreements on labour and on the environment, 
which are missing from the Canada-Israel agreement. In my 
opinion, such social provisions are needed to protect Israeli, 
Palestinian and Canadian workers. I would like to hear your 
reaction in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the nature of the negotiations 
that members are briefed as soon as a deal is arrived at. It would be 
pointless to brief people on a deal that had not been concluded. 
Once that took place there were several meetings and debriefings 
for the opposition caucus. There have been hearings before the 
committee. There have been discussions at length and questions 
which have been responded to.
<P>
	With regard to the other social charter type issues, there are 
ongoing negotiations within the WTO of which Israel is a member. 
I point out that no other country in the Middle East is a member of 
the WTO.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-61 dealing with the 
Canada-Israel free trade agreement.
<P>
	Although we support the agreement, I believe we have let down 
the people of the Middle East, the Israelis, the Palestinians and the 
larger Arab nations of the region with this agreement. Its roots held 
great promise and possibilities for improving the socioeconomic 
conditions for the Palestinian people which is absolutely integral 
for peace for that is part of the major problems addressing and 
affecting the terrible situation in the Middle East.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that what we have seen in the last couple of 
months has nearly extinguished the flame of peace. The efforts for 
peace had been worked on for a long time and culminated in the 
Oslo accords last year which brought much hope to Palestinians 
and Israelis. It has almost been extinguished since Mr. Netanyahu 
and the Likud party came into power last May. Clearly the 
responsibility for what is taking place there does not rest entirely 
on their shoulders. It is a responsibility of both the Palestinians and 
the Israelis.
<P>
	However, the bulk of what has taken place recently falls squarely 
on the shoulders of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party. He must 
understand that the health and welfare of the people he professes to 
help, the Israeli people, is intimately associated with the health and 
welfare of the Palestinian people. They are two halves of the same 
whole, whether they like it or not.
<P>
	The dance of death, destruction and mayhem we have seen for so 
many years is simply not going to end unless the leaders of the 
Middle East demonstrate statesmanship, courage, leadership and 
faith. Without that, there is not going to be an end to the terrible and 
tragic deaths that have been occurring for ever so long. Indeed, it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6103"> 6103 </A></B>
<P>
impossible to find any compelling  justification for the deaths of 
Arab and Jewish youths. It is not necessary.
<P>
	With strong leadership in the Middle East by both Mr. 
Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat we will find a solution for peace in the 
Middle East. However, there are a number of things that they must 
come to terms with.
<P>
	If Mr. Netanyahu believes that he can foist peace upon the 
Palestinian people, he is wrong. It will require an extraordinary 
amount of militarization. He will have to go into the Palestinian 
autonomous regions and it simply will not work. If he believes that 
the Palestinian people will somehow capitulate to a stronger Israel 
and that by foisting their ideals upon them they will back down, he 
is dead wrong. History has proven that the Palestinian people will 
not back down until their demands are met. On the other side, it 
will require a great deal of capitulation by Mr. Arafat and the 
Palestinian authority to ensure the safety of Israel and Israelis.
<P>
	Both leaders will have to work together on this issue and both 
will have to compromise. They are also going to have to look at 
what happened around the Oslo peace accords as an example of 
what compromise can effect.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It is also going to require bold moves by Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. 
Arafat if they are going to arrive at a solution.
<P>
	There are a few realities that have to be recognized. The first is 
that the Israeli and the Palestinian people cannot live together. The 
only way to achieve long term peace is to separate Israel and 
Palestine. As painful as that realization may be, both sides are 
going to have to come to terms with it.
<P>
	There are boundaries and maps which have been drawn by both 
sides which are not too dissimilar from each other. Essentially, the 
areas under Palestinian rule are the West Bank, the Gaza strip and 
the Palestinian autonomous regions. A strong security cord would 
be drawn around those areas. That is necessary for peace in the 
region.
<P>
	Second, Israeli settlements in the Palestinian autonomous 
regions must be moved to other areas. The Israeli people who are 
living in these armed encampments must be removed.
<P>
	A compromise can be achieved if a line is drawn around the West 
Bank which is contiguous with Israel and the settlers who are in the 
West Bank and Gaza strip can be moved there. That will be painful 
for both sides. However, they will probably be able to endure the 
pain quite easily. It would be a compromise for the Israeli settlers 
who wish to live in Palestinian autonomous regions and the 
Palestinian people who do not want to have Israeli armed camps in 
their midst. It would also defuse tension in these areas.
<P>
	The Gaza strip is ready to blow up. We have been hearing that for 
some time. Now we have an opportunity to defuse the situation in 
the Gaza strip to avoid further killings. If the Gaza strip blows up 
we will see bloodshed the likes of which we have not seen for a 
very long time. That bloodshed will be needless and pointless. It is 
an avoidable tragedy.
<P>
	Third, the Israelis have to stop blocking the West Bank and the 
Gaza strip. That completely blocks the ebb and flow of the 
Palestinian people. They cannot get to work. It separates husbands 
from their wives. Sick people cannot get to hospitals. It completely 
destroys the commerce of the Palestinian autonomous regions.
<P>
	It is also wise for us to take a look at the roots which have caused 
such desperation in the Palestinian people, in particular among 
Palestinian youth in the West Bank and the Gaza strip.
<P>
	For anyone who has visited that region, one can only be shocked 
and saddened by the deplorable and wretched conditions under 
which many of the Palestinian people live. The environment of 
abject poverty creates desperation. Out of desperation and 
frustration comes anger. Out of anger comes violence. That is in 
part why we have seen the Intifada. That is why we have seen 
Hamas. That is why we have seen, to a lesser extent, Islamic jihad.
<P>
	These groups have managed to retain their power out of the 
frustration, the anger and the desperation which these people feel. 
Therefore economic emancipation for the Palestinian people in 
these areas is absolutely critical in the peace process. Ensuring that 
the Palestinian people have their own autonomous state is as 
important as economic emancipation.
<P>
	There are two generations of Palestinian youth who are 
desperate. They are unemployed. The unemployment rate is over 
60 per cent in some of these areas.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	They have absolutely nothing to lose. When there is a group of 
people with nothing to lose, then there is a group of people who are 
desperate and will and have resorted to anything in their means.
<P>
	Therefore what we need to see-I was hoping that Bill C-61 
would enable Canada to take a leadership role in this-is to 
improve the economic situation in the West Bank. Canada, through 
Bill C-61, could have put pressure on the Israeli people to enter into 
bilateral agreements with the Palestinian people to improve the 
socioeconomic conditions, including health, hospitals, clinics, 
water and employment in Palestinian areas.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have not seen that. What we are relying on is 
the goodwill of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party to actually do 
this. So far since they have come to power in May we have seen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6104"> 6104 </A></B>
<P>
very little honest intention to actually work with the Palestinian 
authority on looking forward to a long term peace.
<P>
	That was a grave mistake by Canada in not ensuring that this bill 
address that. Having said that, there are still opportunities. We can 
work with the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations to help 
improve the socioeconomic conditions in the West Bank and the 
Gaza strip along with, of course, the Palestinian authorities.
<P>
	However, if we do this, accountability and transparency must 
take place because there is some disturbing evidence that has come 
out that elements of the Palestinian authority is misappropriating a 
great number of funds that are coming through to it. They are not 
getting down to the people who desperately need this.
<P>
	If moneys and funds and loans are going to come through and 
endeavours are going to take place in the Palestinian areas, they 
must be done with accountability and transparency. If that is not 
going to take place, then it simply ought not to be done.
<P>
	The aspect of Jerusalem is a touchy issue but has to also be dealt 
with. I would propose, as a Roman Catholic, that Jerusalem be 
made an international sight for the religions of the world. No one 
single nation, no one single religion is to have control over this 
sensitive sight. Indeed, it is ironic that the centre, the site, which is 
so holy to the great religions of the world, would be the cause of so 
much rancour, so much bloodshed and so much heartache.
<P>
	It is not the intention of Jerusalem. It is the exact opposite of 
what it has come to represent. Indeed, perhaps the only solution 
that we can have to ensure that this site is going to be available to 
the nations and the peoples of the earth to celebrate their religion is 
to make that site the United Nations site for the religions of the 
world, organized and guarded by the United Nations. I cannot see 
anything short of that taking place.
<P>
	Another key player in the situation, of course, is Syria and Mr. 
Hafez al-Assad. No one is actually approaching Mr. Hafez al-Assad 
directly to bring him into the peace process. It is absolutely 
essential that this happen, not through intermediaries because in 
the Middle East the only way there is going to be actual action on 
this issue is if the leaders of the areas meet face to face.
<P>
	Working through intermediaries is not going to actually produce 
any kind of effective, bold moves that are going to move this area 
into long term peace. Mr. al-Assad indeed as we all know in this 
House is an absolute key player in the peace process.
<P>
	For Mr. Arafat's part, he has to be absolutely ruthless with 
Palestinian terrorists in his midst who are going to try to get rid of 
Israel, create terrorist activities on Israeli soil or create terrorist 
activities and terrorize his own Palestinian people.
<P>
	He must demonstrate to the Israeli government and to the Israeli 
people that he also is honest in his intention for peace. He cannot 
work at both sides, as Mr. Netanyahu has done, paying lip service 
to peace on one hand but on the other hand trying to capitulate to a 
very hard line element in his midst. He has to demonstrate and go 
out on a limb and say the dove of peace is more important than the 
hand of war.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	He must be ruthless with his security forces to make sure that he 
can demonstrate to Israel that he can control them. In September 
that was not in evidence when the bloodshed erupted in the West 
Bank and the Palestinian autonomous regions. Mr. Arafat did not 
demonstrate that he could control his security forces. It is 
absolutely essential for Israel and the Israeli people to have that 
comfort that these forces can indeed be controlled.
<P>
	In the end, the ultimate solution with regard to the 
Israel-Palestinian situation is that these two peoples, who are very 
similar in many ways, cannot live under the same roof. They will 
not live as one country. Therefore both groups, both leaders, both 
political powers must come to the realization that the only 
effective, bold, long term solution to peace in the Middle East is 
going to be Israel and Palestine consisting of a two nation state.
<P>
	After that I hope that there would be bilateral and economic 
endeavours, agreements and initiatives between both sides. One of 
the many existing problems is the massive water problem which 
few people are taking into consideration. Potable water, 
particularly in Israel and Palestine, is in critical short supply. This 
issue affects the people of both Israel and Palestine. Therefore it is 
important that this issue be addressed co-operatively. This can 
demonstrate the good will and co-operation that is needed to build 
bridges between both sides.
<P>
	Mr. Netanyahu has to take the first step. He has a long way to go 
to demonstrate that he has the statesmanship of his predecessors, 
one being Mr. Perez. He must demonstrate to the world, his people 
and to the Palestinian people that he is committed to the peace 
process. To do anything less will commit his nation and the region 
to years of bloody civil strife and conflict with absolutely no 
movement forward to long term peace.
<P>
	There is a saying in the Middle East that peace is when a son 
buries his father, but war is when a father buries his son. For the 
sake of the children, the sons, the fathers, the daughters and the 
wives of the Israeli and Palestinian people that the leaders will join 
hands and demonstrate to their people and the world that they can 
indeed make the bold moves necessary to finally develop a long 
lasting peace in the Middle East.
<P>
	I hope that Canada, a nation that has been a part of every single 
peacekeeping initiative in the Middle East, a nation of great 
international respect, can move forward to try to bring these two 
nations together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6105"> 6105 </A></B>
<P>
	We are fortunate that Mr. Raymond Chrétien has been appointed 
the UN rapporteur to Central Africa. We have seen the Norwegians 
display their statesmanship in bringing the Israeli and Palestinians 
together through the Oslo accords. Canada is capable of doing the 
same thing. Canada is internationally respected, we have 
diplomatic power and abilities to try to bring warring groups 
together under one umbrella to build bridges.
<P>
	It is not going to cost Canada more money to do this. From a 
purely self-centred point of view, it is actually going to save 
Canada and Canadians money through drains on our defence, 
immigration and international development aid budgets. There is 
compelling justification for Canada to get involved, to use our 
existing diplomatic structures to finally bring the Israeli and 
Palestinian people together but also involve the Syrians, Egyptians 
and Iranians.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	I hope the government will take it upon itself to invest the people 
we already have in this worthwhile initiative for the sake of peace 
and the people of the Middle East.
<P>
	I have a motion to put forward. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That we amend the bill by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-61, an act to implement the Canada-Israeli free trade agreement be not 
now read a third time but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade for the purpose of reconsidering clause 62 and, in 
particular, to consider substantially changing the implementation date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member was kind enough to show 
the amendment earlier and it is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member opposite. Obviously he has a great deal 
of knowledge and an interest to have gained the knowledge of some 
of the complexities of dealing with the politics of the Middle East.
<P>
	He quite eloquently described the wish of most Canadians and 
most people who live in peace around the world that countries such 
as Canada, which has a tremendous amount of goodwill, uses that 
goodwill to try to not isolate one side from the other. These 
countries should try to bring both sides together to make them 
understand that it is in everybody's interest that peace be pursued 
vigorously. The plans that have been laid down and the progress 
that has been made in the past has to be built on. At the end of the 
day the people who have suffered so long in that region because of 
wars and hatreds should be allowed to live in peace and to 
participate in their communities and their economies without fear 
of retribution, conflict, terrorism and war.
<P>
	I agree 100 per cent with what the member said. The 
disagreement that I may have, however, is in the approach he takes 
with respect to the bill and how that impacts on it.
<P>
	The member opposite moved a motion which would put the bill 
back in committee. This would likely mean that the bill would not 
be implemented at the beginning of January which is the agreed 
upon date.
<P>
	How can the member reconcile what he has just said with respect 
to Canada using its good name, good offices and its international 
reputation to try to get both sides together when we would be 
effectively saying to one side that we have taken sides in this 
conflict? The Canadian government has made it very clear that it 
wants this peace process back on track. We have made it very clear 
that when we deal with the Israeli settlements on the West Bank 
and Gaza that we do not believe those settlements should be there. 
It is not helpful to the peace process.
<P>
	We have implored the Israeli government to get back on track, to 
get the negotiations going with the Palestinian authorities so that 
the people, not the politicians, can enjoy peace at long last.
<P>
	How could he reconcile those statements, which I happen to 
agree with, with the position that the member's party has taken? 
The position would be that we would then go in and say to the 
Israelis: ``We are not going to sign the deal that we negotiated in 
good faith because we do not happen to like the democratically 
elected government of the day and how it is pursuing a particular 
peace proposal''.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Does the member believe we have such leverage with the 
legislation that it is somehow going to turn them around or would it 
be better to continue the dialogue, to ask the Israeli government as 
strongly as we can, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs was 
extremely strong on this just a few weeks ago, to get back on track 
with the peace process?
<P>
	With the Palestinian authorities, the facts speak for themselves. 
Members of the government, including myself, have concerns. We 
want to make sure that we are not advantaging one side to the 
disadvantage of the other. We have taken pains to ensure that this 
deal will apply to goods that are produced in the Palestinian 
territories.
<P>
	I say this with the greatest respect for the opposition, nobody 
from the Palestinian side has come back. We have had over a year 
of discussions with the Palestinians. I understand that they have a 
larger political agenda and may even agree with the larger political 
agenda. But they are following a parallel track. They are pursuing 
the larger political agenda for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. They also recognize that the road to a lasting peace has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6106"> 6106 </A></B>
<P>
to be built on investment from the  outside, markets for Palestinian 
goods and access to markets.
<P>
	They have not told us no. If the Palestinian authorities had 
believed that the best policy Canada could pursue for peace in the 
Middle East was not to have this deal, not to have the economic 
benefits accrue to Palestinian enterprises as well, they have had 
plenty of opportunity to tell us but they have not.
<P>
	How can the member reconcile his obviously very deeply felt 
comments with respect to the peace process in the Middle East and 
the ability that Canada has to leverage its good name with both 
sides? He is right. We have had peacekeepers in that region forever. 
Canadians are highly regarded. Is it not a better role for Canada to 
play, to have these benefits extended to the Palestinian territories, 
including the West Bank and the Gaza, not just for the benefit of the 
Palestinians and not just for the benefit of the Israelis. Remember 
why we have done this. We have done it for Canadian companies.
<P>
	I have dozens of letters here from Canadian companies that 
employ people in communities right across the country. They have 
told us that this is the right thing to do. Some of the companies that 
have had dealings in the Middle East have indicated to us that the 
best way that Canada can increase its leverage on the peace process 
is to have more Canadian companies there, making investments 
both in the occupied territories and in Israel.
<P>
	That is how we are going to take the good name that Canada has 
and that is how we are going to have a better impact by way of 
influencing both sides to get back to the table and fulfil what 
seemed to be a promising peace process that was started about a 
year ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. friend from the government who always speaks so 
eloquently in this House.
<P>
	Basically we are saying very similar things. The intent of the 
motion is to ensure what the hon. member said, that there are going 
to be bilateral, co-operative efforts between Israel and the 
Palestinian people, that the Palestinian people would have free 
access to markets, that they would have access to the benefits of 
this agreement and to ensure that there is going to be equity.
<P>
	The reason why we brought this forward is that the current Likud 
government in Israel has not demonstrated that it has an interest in 
developing the peace process in any meaningful way.
<P>
	Mr. Netanyahu has been giving lip service to the peace process 
since he came into power in May, saying one thing internationally 
and doing something very different domestically. That cannot be 
allowed to happen. We were hoping that Canada would use the bill 
as a carrot. Canada would say to the Israeli government: ``We find 
your behaviour unacceptable. We have this opportunity here for 
you, the Israeli people, but also for the Palestinian people, that 
economic emancipation for both the Israelis and the Palestinians is 
absolutely essential for peace. Mr. Netanyahu, sir, you have not 
demonstrated that since you have come to power and Canada finds 
it completely unacceptable''.
<P>
	Therefore, here is a carrot to Israel that we can give but we want 
some demonstration from the Israeli government that indeed they 
are going to do what the hon. member just suggested.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	We want some demonstration that it will ensure bilateral 
economic agreements with the Palestinian people, that it will 
ensure free access for the Palestinian people to markets, that it will 
address the problems associated with the closures of the West Bank 
and the Gaza strip which have such an enormous detrimental effect 
on the economy of the Palestinian autonomous regions.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party put forward this motion to ensure 
Canada does not take a behind the scenes view but instead 
demonstrates its intent, interest and eagerness to co-operate. 
Canada should demonstrate its desire to build bridges between both 
people through this bill. Again, we want to make sure the bill 
addresses and helps both the Palestinians and the Israelis, not just 
the Israelis.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-61, an act to 
implement the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	According to the timetable provided for in the bill, this 
agreement, which was signed in July 1996, will come into effect in 
January 1997.
<P>
	What is in this agreement? First of all, this free trade bill is more 
concerned with goods than services. For example, customs tariffs 
on industrial products of Canadian or Israeli origin will be 
eliminated on January 1. Only swimwear-at Canada's 
request-and certain cotton fabrics-at Israel's request-will still 
be subject to duty for another two and a half years.
<P>
	Low duties or no duties will apply to various products, especially 
in the areas of agriculture and fisheries. These products include 
grains and their byproducts, beef, maple sugar, alcoholic 
beverages, and various processed components. Both parties have 
excluded dairy, poultry and egg products, which will be the subject 
of future negotiations to further liberalize trade in the agri-food 
sector.
<P>
	Like NAFTA, the free trade agreement with Israel provides for a 
tribunal, a binding dispute settlement mechanism, which has 
worked rather well so far in the case of free trade with the U.S. and 
Mexico.
<P>
	According to the government, the next step is to have the bill 
passed by Parliament. Should this be done before January, the act 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6107"> 6107 </A></B>
<P>
will come into effect on January 1, 1997. I will get back to the 
timetable and the process a little later.
<P>
	I should point out that, according to the Government of Canada, 
the sectors that will benefit the most from this agreement are the 
grains and grain products industry, manufacturers of 
telecommunications equipment, the environmental industry, and 
other cutting-edge areas. Some sectors are excluded: neither the 
Auto Pact nor cultural industries are affected.
<P>
	Other areas of trade such as services and government 
procurement would continue to be governed by the multilateral 
rules being established through the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	This is an overview of the agreement. As we can see, this is a 
free trade agreement dealing much less with products than with 
services. This is a first step in increasing trade currently worth 
anywhere from $450 million to $500 million between Canada and 
Israel.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois are obviously in favour of free trade in 
principle. I may remind my hon. colleagues that this has 
traditionally been the position of sovereignists who, as a matter of 
fact, strongly supported the implementation of the free trade 
agreement between Canada and they United States. It was a central 
issue in the 1988 campaign, with the sovereignists backing a party 
that advocated implementing the agreement at the time.
<P>
	Similarly, we supported the free trade agreement later expanded 
to include all of North America, NAFTA. The purpose of these 
agreements is to extend free trade zones for the benefit of 
economies that specialize in areas where they have comparative 
advantages.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Everyone can benefit from free trade provided that companies 
adapt and that they can specialize and be productive in areas where 
the economy gives them these comparative advantages.
<P>
	That said, the government must not forget that it has 
responsibilities in terms of wealth redistribution and also regarding 
the human rights situation, as may the case in any number of 
agreements. Trade must be pursued, free trade must be promoted, 
but not at the expense of our global responsibilities as individuals 
and as a society.
<P>
	Speaking of the pro-free trade position held by sovereignists, I 
cannot help but recall the last campaign fought by the Liberal 
Party, which now forms the government. At that time, the Liberals 
were against the free trade agreement with the United States and 
promised to renegotiate NAFTA.
<P>
	Today, a few years after they came to power, we see that they 
have been converted to free trade, obviously inspiredby sheer 
common sense. It makes us very confident in the future to see that 
the Canadian people generally seems to understand that there is a 
future in  relations as extensive as possible with different countries, 
whether it be Israel, as is now the case, or Chile.
<P>
	Some day we will talk about the expansion or the preservation of 
the economic zone between Quebec and Canada which is, and I 
stress it, 135 times more important than trade between Canada and 
Israel.
<P>
	What is positive in this agreement? The development of this free 
trade agreement between Canada and Israel will enhance trade. 
Trade relations will be increased and there will be increased ties 
between the two countries. That being said, we should not think 
this will be enough to influence the State of Israel with regard to 
the peace process in the Middle East. We must be careful not to 
jump to such conclusions.
<P>
	Many people think that the strengthening of economic ties is a 
good way to influence the internal policy of our trade partners, 
down the road, because there will be more dialogue. It is desirable, 
but it is certainly not enough.
<P>
	We are aware of the position of the Israeli government which is 
not not facilitating the peace process in the Middle East, far from it. 
This peace process is very fragile and has not been working very 
well lately. There might be a perception-and this is important in 
the political world and in the everyday world-that this free trade 
agreement between Canada and Israel is be some kind of support 
for Israel. That is the most negative aspect of this agreement.
<P>
	Speakers from the government side are telling us that we have to 
understand the difference between the two. This could have been 
specified through the various amendments moved in committee, by 
the Bloc members among others. These amendments were aimed at 
setting out, in the free trade agreement itself, Canada's foreign 
policy position.
<P>
	It has to be understood that the agreement applies in the territory 
of Israel, including the Palestinian territories, and therefore that it 
will apply also in the territories Israel claims as its own, but that the 
international community would prefer to have dealt with during 
negotiations between the State of Israel and the Palestinians. They 
have not been a party to this process, but they will now be included, 
and that could be an advantage with this free trade agreement.
<P>
	It should not be forgotten that, in the Canadian foreign policy, 
the occupation of these territories is considered illegitimate. The 
Canadian policy on this issue is that Canada does not recognize 
permanent Israeli control over the territories that have been 
occupied since 1967. These territories include the Golan Heights, 
the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza strip. Canada 
condemns any unilateral action to predetermine the outcome of 
negotiations, including those on Jewish settlements, and to annex 
East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Canada considers these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6108"> 6108 </A></B>
<P>
actions are contrary to international law and do not in any way 
foster the peace process.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	So, we have two separate policies, one on foreign affairs, and the 
other one on international trade, that run in different directions. 
The agreement does not even mention disagreement over Israel's 
policies. This is a weakness on the part of this government that is to 
be found in many areas of its foreign policy concerning human 
rights in general. This is a position of weakness, an 
acknowledgement of failure and helplessness. It is almost as if 
human rights are not a concern any more.
<P>
	In many cases, this government has forsaken the international 
responsibility it had taken up. It had become a major player in 
various peace processes. Canada also had acquired an international 
influence. Today, it seems that we are just giving up. We are hiding 
behind this effort to make free trade areas wider, and we are 
claiming this will eventually help us improve situations we would 
like to change.
<P>
	We should not be doing this right now, because we are sending 
mixed signals about Canada's foreign policy concerning the peace 
process in the Middle East.
<P>
	Another complaint we have, and it concerns not only this 
agreement, but all free trade negotiations, is that we are always 
presented with a done deal, and there is not much we can do except 
accept or reject the whole thing.
<P>
	Because of the negotiation process used for these kinds of 
agreements, Parliament, at least here in Canada, does not have a 
major influence or impact, and the views of the public are 
presented by their elected representatives during debate.
<P>
	This is just a warning because I am sure that we will soon have 
before us a free trade agreement with Chile and the same 
negotiation process will have been used. A different approach 
would probably have given us the opportunity to ask questions or 
even to amend provisions or add parallel agreements on social 
issues and the environment, as we did with NAFTA, to ensure that 
those free trade agreements do not threaten our working conditions 
or our environment in any way.
<P>
	There is something wrong with the agreement between Canada 
and Israel at that level. Maybe we can settle this issue in the future, 
but for the time being we have to consider what we have before us. 
I would like to remind the House that we will have to vote on the 
agreement as a whole and that if Parliament does not pass the bill it 
will delay the implementation of a very practical and nicely 
designed agreement which has been negotiated and concluded.
<P>
	Not giving Parliament the opportunity to have a greater and 
more direct influence or impact on the negotiation of such 
international agreements is not a very healthy way of doing things 
in a democracy.
<P>
	A word of caution. Canada has asked for protection for the 
swimwear industry under this treaty, which means that duties will 
remain in effect for another two and a half years. However, the 
imbalance is due to the fact that Israel can buy supplies from the 
European Economic Community, pursuant to the free trade 
agreement it has with the EEC, something Canada cannot do. So, 
the Canadian swimwear industry will be penalized or be at a 
disadvantage compared to Israel to the tune of 25 per cent, because 
Israel has signed a free trade agreement with the European 
Economic Community.
<P>
	We should be concerned about the potentially very negative 
impact this could have on the swimwear industry, in Quebec in 
particular. My hon. colleague from Terrebonne has raised this issue 
several times but so far the government does not seem to be very 
worried. Let us hope that behind this facade the government is at 
least giving some serious consideration to the impact on the 
swimwear industry, particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc brought forward a number of amendments and I want 
to go over them because I believe they make of lot of sense. As a 
first amendment, we wanted to include, at the very beginning of the 
agreement, a declaration that Canada and Israel are committed to 
human rights and the principles of democracy and that their 
domestic and foreign policies must be based on that commitment.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	It was a word for word rendering of clause 1 of the free trade 
agreement between the European Union and the State of Israel. 
Canada did not even consider it a good thing to include this clause 
in the free trade agreement between Canada and Israel. Why? The 
question is legitimate, since that would have shown somewhere 
that, while signing international trade agreements, Canada wants to 
maintain its positive influence on the peace process and send a 
clear signal to the State of Israel.
<P>
	There is a second provision, in the suggested amendments, that 
would have explained that Canada's signing does not sanction in 
any way the position taken by the new Israeli government towards 
the peace process. Canada's position is quite clear if one looks at 
the foreign affairs policy, government papers and government 
speeches. Thus, why not state it again?
<P>
	I must remind you that the government does not recognize 
Israel's control over the Golan Heights, the West Bank, East 
Jerusalem and the Gaza strip. This could have been mentioned, 
emphasized and indicated during the negotiations, where both sides 
wanted to reach an agreement, so that everyone would be reminded 
of Canada's position on its foreign affairs policy. In this way, trade 
and human rights would not have been totally disconnected, as the 
government seems to be doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6109"> 6109 </A></B>
<P>
	It is disturbing to see Canada shirk its responsibilities at the 
world level for the sake of economic interests  alone. There are 
indeed limits to the benefits of economic development if this 
development is not backed by actions on the part of a government 
that assumes its primary responsibilities. Economic growth would 
still exist without the government, that is for sure.
<P>
	That being said, the government must ensure that growth occurs 
in an orderly fashion, in accordance with the fundamental 
principles of society, from redistribution of wealth to equal 
opportunity, and respect for democracy. We must not abdicate these 
values, which are the very foundation of the state, simply so that 
some individual interests can benefit from agreements that could 
go against collective interests if they are not related to the 
fundamental workings of the state itself.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc is worried about the schedule provided for 
the passing of this bill, although we are deeply in favour of free 
trade and convinced that there lies the future. Quebec is open to the 
world and it always has been. In this regard, Quebec has been a 
pioneer in Canada. Without Quebec, we could very well be only at 
the ratification stage, or even only at the negotiation stage, of the 
free trade agreement with the United States. Quebec played a major 
role in the process that led to the signing of the free trade 
agreement with the Unites States. I simply wanted to remind you of 
that fact in closing.
<P>
	However, I am reassured by the fact that the present government 
has finally recognized the merits of free trade. It is reassuring for 
Quebecers to see that the day they will decide to take over their 
own political destiny they will have a free trade neighbour that has 
an interest in its economic development and, for that reason, an 
interest in negotiating with a partner with which its trade is 135 
times greater than its trade with Israel. It is said that the volume of 
trade between Canada and Israel is about $500 million, but trade 
between Canada and Quebec represents more than $65 billion.
<P>
	Understandably, under such circumstances, common sense will 
prevail, but that being said we, as a society, must not forget our 
responsibilities towards democratic values and human rights. I 
hope the government does not abdicate those responsibilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate you, since this is the first opportunity I have had to do 
so, on your recent appointment. I know that you will add a great 
deal to the civility of the debate in the House and that you will 
ensure that members' privileges and rights are properly upheld. 
Indeed, you will add greatly to the decorum of the House. My 
congratulations on your appointment. It is long overdue.
<P>
	My comments to the hon. member opposite again deal with 
different approaches to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The first approach obviously has to be that the bill was done not 
to benefit or to reward the Israelis or the Palestinians for any 
particular behaviour. It was done because Canadian companies, 
many of them resident in the province of Quebec had indicated they 
were having great trouble competing in the Israeli market.
<P>
	There was mention that the government of late has come to the 
road of free trade and the member is correct. However, we have 
always indicated that when trade deals are done, that Canadian 
interests must be vigorously debated and defended during the 
negotiations. I think we have done that in this deal.
<P>
	I am somewhat troubled by the approach by some members of 
the hon. member's party on this deal that because of the very 
serious situation in the Middle East we should just forget this, take 
the two years of negotiations and put the matter on hold until the 
situation is further resolved.
<P>
	The member should understand first that the trade deal is meant 
to give Canadian companies access on an equal footing with their 
competitors from the United States and the European Union in the 
Israeli market. He also should know that the deal has been very 
carefully crafted to ensure that whatever benefits accrue to 
entrepreneurs and business people and the production of goods in 
Israel also apply equally to the occupied territories.
<P>
	The member also knows full well that Canada has been very firm 
and very strong in its position with respect to the peace process. 
Indeed, we have used our stature in the international community to 
try to encourage both sides to get back to the table and deal one on 
one, face to face and finally put this very tragic issue behind all of 
us and bring peace to the Middle East.
<P>
	I have pages of names of companies that deal with Israel. There 
are companies from Montreal that produce products but if they are 
destined for the Israeli market, they do not produce all of the 
product. They send it to the United States for finishing, which 
means jobs that Quebecers will not have. American workers finish 
the product so that it can be shipped into the Israeli market under 
the rules of origin requirement and it is given preferential tariff 
treatment under the Israel-U.S. arrangement.
<P>
	Surely the member must know that to further delay this matter 
means lost jobs in Canadian companies that cannot be competitive. 
Those companies that have decided they can be competitive have 
gone south of the border and are literally exporting jobs from 
Montreal, Quebec, from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and from 
Winnipeg and North Bay. It is literally stopping the job growth 
there could be if there was a level playing field.
<P>
	Companies such as Price Waterhouse in Toronto have vigorously 
supported the deal and indicated that it must  go forward. There is 
Nortel, and the Canada-Israel Industrial Research and 
Development Foundation which we heard in committee. There is 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6110"> 6110 </A></B>
<P>
Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada. There are 
Freed and Freed International of Winnipeg; Teleglobe Canada 
Incorporated from Montreal; Pratt and Whitney in Ontario; and Air 
Canada. The list goes on and on of Canadian companies that 
provide jobs in the province of Quebec and throughout the 
Canadian economy because they are competitive and when they are 
given a level playing field they can get contracts which mean jobs 
for Canadians no matter where they live.
<P>
	In light of all the member has said, does he not see the downside 
in not proceeding at this point? Does he agree with the position of 
the Canadian government, that it is by promoting trade, by getting 
Canadian companies and exporters into the Israeli and Palestinian 
areas that we will be most able to show the benefits from the 
normalization of relations in the political spirit as well as 
economically for the peoples who live in the region?
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to certain 
comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
International Trade.
<P>
	He said something important in his speech. He said that the trade 
deal was first meant to give Canadian companies access to the 
Israeli market. He did say that was its prime objective. I understand 
that, but what this also means is that the objective of putting the 
peace process back on track comes in second or worse. Indeed, this 
is typical of this government for which democratic values and 
human rights always come in second when the time comes to talk 
about economic issues in relation to respect for democratic values 
and human rights.
<P>
	In a sense, I am happy that he made things clear, but this does not 
mean that we agree. The parliamentary secretary was clear and 
frank when he said the agreement's prime objective was to give 
Canadian companies access to the market in Israel.
<P>
	He also said that it would benefit Quebec almost exclusively, if 
we are to go by the list of Quebec companies he read out. I would 
like to remind him that 80 per cent of our exports to Israel are also 
food products, such as grain. We know full well that the west will 
also benefit quite a lot.
<P>
	Therefore, it should not be said that only Quebec stands to gain. 
Of course, I am not surprised that companies from Quebec export 
to Israel because Quebec understood long ago that the economy of 
the future is turned towards foreign markets and free trade. I do not 
want to debate this question further, but I am convinced that it is 
normal that Quebec should export to other countries as well, even 
countries with which we did not sign a free trade agreement.
<P>
	The hon. member exaggerated a little when he said jobs would 
be lost if the coming into force of the agreement was delayed. It is 
as though people thought that without free trade there can be no 
trade at all. Wait a minute. There is trade, but it is not as simple. 
Even if duties are charged, there can be trade.
<P>
	Let us take the example of Canada and the United States. Three 
quarters of our trade was already liberalized even before the free 
trade agreement. So people must not think that there is no trade 
between countries if there is no free trade agreement. So to say that 
jobs would be lost if we were to delay the implementation of the 
agreement is going a bit too far. Perhaps it would delay the job 
development process, which is a totally different thing. However, 
as representatives of the people of Quebec and Canada, we must 
not forget that Canada has a responsibility to protect human rights 
in other parts of the world.
<P>
	The adoption of this bill at this moment could be viewed as an 
expression of support or at least would send a very ambiguous 
message with regard to the peace process in the Middle East.
<P>
	If the Liberals want so much to respect or to improve the peace 
process in the Middle East, then why did they not accept the 
amendments that were proposed? I remind them that the purpose of 
these amendments was to include in the agreement, as in the free 
trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, that 
Canada and Israel are committed to human rights and the principles 
of democracy and that their domestic and foreign policies must be 
based on that commitment.
<P>
	Such a provision exists in the free trade agreement between the 
European Union and Israel. The inclusion of this commitment in 
the deal would have been justifiable, as well as the inclusion of a 
provision explaining that the signing of this deal does not mean in 
any way that Canada supports the new Israeli government's 
position with regard to the peace process where it is not in line with 
Canada's foreign policy. This could have been mentioned as well.
<P>
	This way, at least, we would have said that the Canadian 
government continues to be deeply committed to these values, 
which are the state's responsibility. But we can see that Canada has 
reneged on that commitment and that its only objective, as 
mentioned by the parliamentary secretary, is to secure better access 
to these markets, whatever the circumstances.
<P>
	Yes, the role of a government or a state is to promote economic 
development, but not at any cost.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to take part in this important debate 
today. First of all, I support the amendment proposed by the 
Reform Party which would postpone the date on which the bill 
would come into effect and refer the bill back to committee.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6111"> 6111 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to say to the secretary of state that I was 
surprised to hear him refer to the position defended by colleagues 
on this side of the House as opposing the principle of this 
agreement. That is not the point.
<P>
	I know that the Bloc Quebecois, speaking for the majority of 
Quebecers, has supported the free trade principle underlying this 
agreement. However, this does not mean we cannot say that the fact 
that these negotiations took place in secret may account for the 
surprise apparently shown by the secretary of state today.
<P>
	In the past, Canada has participated in international 
peacekeeping operations. It has been praised for this. I would say 
that the Bloc has been proud to participate in developing and, if 
necessary, maintaining a foreign policy for Canada that is worthy 
of that past. The government seems to want to sweep this fairly 
recent past under the rug, as it lists the names of companies that are 
pressuring the government to adopt this agreement. Is there not 
something very ironic about all this?
<P>
	Even in the United States people are starting to disagree with the 
slogan that what is good for GM is good for the United States. Is 
Canada now going to say that what is good for a number of large 
corporations is good for Canada? In an area as delicate and 
sensitive as the laborious peace process in the Middle East which 
has now almost ground to a halt, prudence is of the essence.
<P>
	The government cannot say this agreement is not a signal. It was 
negotiated in the context of peace building. I may recall this 
context: men and women put their lives on the line so that both 
camps, the Israelis and the Palestinians, can visualize peace and 
reach an agreement. This kind of peace would only be thinkable as 
part of the development of Israel and Palestine. That in line with 
this tendency Canada, like the European Union which has renewed 
its agreement, should initiate and develop a negotiating process to 
conclude a free trade agreement was entirely normal and in keeping 
with Canada's history.
<P>
	However, that Canada, following the latest incidents, regretted 
by all supporters of the peace process and just a few days before the 
sad anniversary of the death of Mr. Rabin, after initiating 
negotiations and seeking to conclude the agreement in this context, 
should say that this is just a business agreement does not appear to 
be consistent with what Canadian policy has been so far. Such an 
agreement cannot be dissociated from foreign policy, even if they 
would have us believe that it is only a trade matter.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Such a claim is impossible, it is not true. This agreement would 
not have been negotiated if there had not been a vigorous desire for 
peace, and if the path toward peace had not been sought and 
attained, through the Oslo agreements at least.
<P>
	What does the Bloc want now, then? Not for the agreement to be 
set aside indefinitely. On the contrary, the Bloc believes that this 
agreement can be a strong instrument of assistance, without 
interfering into the internal affairs of either Israel or Palestine, in 
order to send the message that the peace process is important to us.
<P>
	This is the reason the Bloc Quebecois would have liked to 
see-and this is a point it raised in committee-the addition to this 
agreement of a clause that is included in the free trade agreement 
between Israel and the European Union. Its article I reads as 
follows: relations between the parties, as well as all of the clauses 
making up this agreement, are based on a respect of the human 
rights and democratic principles underlying their domestic and 
foreign policies and constituting an essential element of this 
agreement.
<P>
	With this clause, the European Union can play a role which 
Canada refuses to play, I repeat, which Canada refuses to play, by 
signing this agreement, as if there were nothing to it.
<P>
	Although we agree with the principle of this agreement-even if, 
as I have said, it was negotiated in secret, as is the agreement with 
Chile, as well-we have doubts about the timeliness of 
implementing this bill now. At the very least, we want to see the 
timing looked into.
<P>
	We feel this is sending a message which we feel does not 
coincide with what countries everywhere who are concerned with 
the Israel-Palestine situation are trying to do in their foreign 
policies. They are concerned because, this is my feeling, these two 
peoples, these two nations, have suffered too much for this difficult 
agreement we have arrived at not to be implemented.
<P>
	What message would that send? Some claim that the Palestinians 
had no problem with this agreement. We have asked for proof of 
this. Until we are given proof to the contrary, however, we have our 
doubts.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention one surprising point. Earlier, the 
secretary of state said that businesses want that agreement to be 
signed as soon as possible and declared that jobs could be lost if we 
do not facilitate trade with Israel and Palestine.
<P>
	Well, let me say that such statement seems to conflict slightly, I 
repeat slightly, with what we have heard in Quebec these past few 
months concerning the harmful effects of political uncertainty on 
the economy. I am emphasizing that point because there seems to 
be two different analyses, two different visions. On the one hand, 
businesses are in a hurry to see the amount of trade and investments 
between Canada and Israel increase but, on the other hand, those 
same businesses are terribly worried about the Quebec situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6112"> 6112 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to point out that during the NAFTA negotiation 
process, some parallel agreements were developed on environment 
and labour. We could call it a social clause process. But there is 
no such thing in this agreement with Israel, although it would be 
important.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will simply say that in this instance they are not 
striving for such parallel agreements which seemed so crucial to 
this government. Let me remind you that the Liberals ranted and 
raved over the free trade agreement, saying it was unacceptable to 
them; but now, they are promoting the agreement after having 
reassured Canadians who were concerned about parallel 
agreements on labour and the environment.
<P>
	We could question their efficiency but there is a message there. 
And what message could the agreement with Israel be sending if 
not that Canada is abdicating its foreign policy, its traditional 
policy of championing and promoting peace, that it is foregoing the 
minimum requirements that the European Union demanded 
concerning human rights and that it is not even asking for parallel 
agreements like those that accompanied NAFTA. That is why, 
because the measure would send the wrong message, I will support 
the Reform Party amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest and I am a bit surprised that the hon. member has made 
statements in this House that are patently false. They are not true.
<P>
	The hon. member would have individuals believe that the 
government proceeded with this bill somehow through dark 
corridors in the dead of night and that parliamentarians were not 
apprised of the process as it was under way. That is simply not true.
<P>
	It is important when statements are made which are factually 
incorrect that it is brought to the attention of the House and the 
people who are watching this debate. Indeed the member opposite 
asked why with such haste has this bill gone forward. I do not know 
where she or her party has been of late but this is simply not the 
case with this bill.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	On November 23, 1994, quite a while ago I would say the 
member, there was a news release. It was not done in the dark of 
night. It was put on the wire for the English and French press across 
the country which indicated that the Prime Minister and the late 
Prime Minister Rabin officially announced the launching of the 
trade negotiations.
<P>
	On November 29 and 30, 1994 the chief negotiator for Canada 
briefed the federal-provincial trade policy committee and invited 
input from provincial governments, including the government in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	On January 14, the <I>Canada Gazette</I> published the official notice 
requesting submissions from any interested parties.
<P>
	On January 23, 1995 the Department of Finance wrote 35 
companies and industry reps requesting comments and views 
regarding negotiations, particularly on things like rules of origins. 
Some of those companies were in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	There were at least a dozen SAGITs, industry meetings that took 
place, and those representatives are from the sectoral industries 
right across Canada.
<P>
	On June 23, 1995 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada distributed 
a working paper on Israel's agriculture and trade to the 
federal-provincial agricultural trade policy committee and the 
agricultural food and beverage SAGITs, again representing that 
particular sector right across the country.
<P>
	On January 12, 1996 another news release: ``Canada and Israel 
officials reach tentative agreement on the proposed trade deal''.
<P>
	On January 19, 1996 the chief negotiator held a conference call 
with the provinces. And so on and so on down until June 11, 1996 
when the rules of origin negotiated provides update to all of the 
provinces at the seed trade meetings.
<P>
	On July 31 a news release was made stating that Canada and 
Israel signed the free trade deal.
<P>
	In addition to that, the Bloc Quebecois caucus, the Reform Party 
caucus, the Liberal Party caucus and anybody who had an interest 
was offered a briefing by the senior officials who had negotiated 
this deal.
<P>
	In addition to that, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
on which we have three members from the Bloc Quebecois, did a 
vigorous examination of this bill.
<P>
	The second thing she indicated, which I find misleading, is that 
the government is hiding something in this bill, otherwise why did 
it not pass the amendments of the Bloc Quebecois. I will tell the 
member that if her House leadership, at least those individuals in 
the research bureau who are supposed to know about proper form 
and content, would have looked at those amendments that were put 
at committee they would have found that they were clearly out of 
order. The reason those amendments were not put and voted upon is 
they were not in the proper form. They exceeded the scope of the 
bill. The chairman of the committee, who has as much authority in 
committee as the Speaker does in this place, indicated quite clearly 
that these motions were not in order. There was nothing nefarious 
about that. Nobody changed clerks in the middle of the stream to 
try to somehow subvert the rights and privileges of members of that 
committee. It was all above board and done according to the rules.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6113"> 6113 </A></B>
<P>
	The last thing I want to say to the hon. member, which I think 
is important, is this is about trade for Canadian companies. There 
are real Canadian companies out there. Some of them may be in 
Dartmouth, some in Montreal, some in Winnipeg or some in North 
Bay, as I said before, that are having difficulty accessing this 
market. To indicate that somehow the Government of Canada has 
put trade ahead of those other very important issues like peace 
in the Middle East belies the facts. This government and our 
Minister of Foreign Affairs have been steadfast in his 
determination to use the goodwill that Canada has abroad to 
promote the peace process at every opportunity.
<P>
	Concurrent with these negotiations and subsequent to these 
negotiations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister 
and other ministers of this government have made it extremely 
clear that it is Canada's wish and desire that the peace process 
continue, that it get back on track and that there is a successful 
conclusion to those negotiations.
<P>
	With respect to human rights and other issues that the member 
has raised, this government has always been concerned about 
human rights but we fundamentally believe that a policy of 
exclusion means that if there are human rights violations in any 
jurisdiction they will only get worse. We do not follow that policy 
with Cuba nor with a number of other countries. The members 
opposite agree with the government's policy.
<P>
	With respect to Israel and human rights, vis-à-vis the Israelis and 
the Palestinians, the Canadian government has been very clear. We 
have sent messages to both sides. We have said, in each and every 
instance, that the solution to the problems in the Middle East and 
more globally in other nations does not come from a policy of 
exclusion and containment but from one of inclusion and dialogue. 
Trade is one of the routes by which we can do that. We have done it 
successfully in the past and we will continue to do it.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I hope the member recognizes that members of her party have sat 
on this committee and have contributed a great deal. They 
understand what this is all about.
<P>
	I hope that she will correct the record. There has not been an 
attempt by the government to hide this very public deal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, once the deal was done it was 
made public. This is not what I meant. What I said, and what the 
committee members said, is negotiations went on behind closed 
doors. On the one hand, what the secretary of state has just said 
does not contradict this.
<P>
	On the other, what he said about the firm stand the government 
took with regard to the peace process does not contradict in any 
way the fact that endorsing the agreement now will send the 
message that we support the current policy.
<P>
	I was happy to hear in what context negotiations started: in the 
context of a slow and painful peace process which has been very 
costly for both sides. These negotiations were meaningful then. 
Even if, as I said before, they went on behind closed doors, 
everything he said does not contradict this fact. Even if this is the 
way the deal was done, we agree with it in principle, but we are 
questioning the timing, and none of his answers are satisfying with 
regard to the effectiveness of this agreement as far as the current 
process is concerned.
<P>
	The European Union will be able to intervene thanks to the 
wording of the principle. We know that if the situation does not 
improve, it will do so, whereas Canada will have signed an 
agreement with no such provisions.
<P>
	I have too much respect for the peace efforts. I had the pleasure 
of being in Israel during the implementation of the Oslo agreement, 
and of witnessing the peace process in action. I was able to see how 
difficult it was, how deeply rooted in their history the settlers' 
claims were. And it is because this process is so difficult that 
countries, such as Canada, who might influence it and help the 
democratic forces within to respect the Oslo agreement, must keep 
up the pressure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
let me say how welcoming it is to see you in the chair. I know you 
will grace it with honour, with distinction and with a sense of levity 
as you bring calm, peace and quiet discussion to informed debate. 
Welcome. I am pleased to see you there.
<P>
	We are having a very important discussion on the Canada-Israel 
free trade agreement. I would first ask my own constituency and 
the people following this debate with so much interest to consider 
that what I have to say first started with what my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade, 
said so eloquently on this issue before the intervention of the 
member for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	He outlined in a succinct way the importance and the value of the 
nature of this agreement in the interests of Canadians. This bill, 
first of all, was initiated because Canadians wanted a fair and even 
playing field with the Americans and the Europeans.
<P>
	We know what it is to have to work to an even and fair playing 
field with our American colleagues, having been very much a part 
of the NAFTA agreement. It is good particularly for Canadian 
businesses in my riding where large companies have to 
manufacture parts, not be able to complete them and put the value 
added parts on because we did not have this kind of agreement. We  
shipped the products to the United States to put a U.S. stamp on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6114"> 6114 </A></B>
<P>
them even though they had been made here except for the last little 
value added parts. In that way we could sell them at a reasonable 
and competitive price.
<P>
	Second, it is good for Israel because Canada has products that we 
can sell there. They have products that we can buy here that are of 
value to us.
<P>
	Third, it is good for the Palestinians. The Palestinians have, at 
this point, no exit route for the development of industry that is 
indigenous to their part of the West Bank and Gaza. There is no 
World Trade Organization agreement for any of the alliance 
countries around them. Israel is the only democracy in that area 
that has accreditation to the World Trade Organization, easily 
referred to very often by the letters WTO.
<P>
	The other thing that is so vital for us to keep in mind is that we 
are Canadians in a Canadian government and we are masters of our 
own internal relationships. We are not interested in having external 
input into how we run our business.
<P>
	Peace, order and good government is fundamental to all 
countries as they see it and as they determine it. We are not the 
Israelis, we are not the Palestinians. They, themselves, have to 
come to some kind of agreement with the help of countries outside 
their borders which are often there as peacekeepers, as the 
Canadians have been.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians have become peace makers. This 
agreement is a ground breaking agreement with respect to the 
Middle East, which is a flash point. It could have been a flash point 
at any point in the history of the world and has so been.
<P>
	The fact that we put into this agreement an acknowledgement of 
the place and the role of the Palestinian people, the importance of 
people working together in business, in trade who will, by just 
merely getting together talking to each other and knowing each 
other will in this inclusive environment move that dialogue toward 
better relationships between people.
<P>
	We all recognize this in Canada. We are a civil country with civil 
discourse. There is a country that needs our example. By our very 
presence in the field of trade and commerce, I believe we bring a 
very important message. Our peace makers and our peacekeepers, 
in whom we have great pride, have been in that country for over 26 
years. We have the longest history there. We have a degree of 
credibility, both with the Palestinians and the Israelis. That is an 
added dimension.
<P>
	I want to remind the Bloc and the Reform Party that we were the 
first countries to do business with Cuba, to do business in the 
Asian-Pacific area, to do business in countries that do not have 
great relationships among their people, who are not as respectful of 
human rights as we would like them to be.
<P>
	I believe fundamentally that when you work with people, when 
you bring your business culture and your business climate and your 
business people in and exchange through dialogue and personal 
relationships, you affect those relationships between the people 
who are indigenous to that country. You are, by your very presence 
as a role model, affecting change.
<P>
	I believe that this agreement, the Canada-Israel free trade 
agreement, is very necessary for that part of the world, is most 
important for Canadians and is going to be enabling of the 
Palestinians.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I was in Israel to monitor the Palestinian elections. I met with 
many Palestinians. I talked with them in east Jerusalem. I met with 
them in Ram Allah. They all knew about this trade agreement. Is it 
not interesting that they knew last year and the other side of the 
House seems to be just now finding out about it?
<P>
	My colleague from Dartmouth has outlined all the steps since 
November 1994 that have been ongoing in the development of this 
free trade agreement. According to another colleague in the House 
who is an expert on international trade, it is an extraordinarily well 
drafted document. I gather the Bloc and the Reform Party 
acknowledge that, accept that and would like to move forward 
given the time.
<P>
	Timing is not up to us. What is up to us is to be present to enable 
a propitious moment to effect change. Although this free trade 
agreement is not a reward for Israel it certainly enables Canadians, 
Israelis and Palestinians.
<P>
	As an aside, I found it quite rewarding to watch the minister of 
trade, Natan Sharansky, signing and sending the letter. We realize 
the world has changed dramatically when we see an immigrant 
from Russia, an open country, who has been in Israel for barely 
four or five years and is now a minister. That is a democracy of 
which we can be proud.
<P>
	It is the same with many people in this House who have come 
from very diverse backgrounds. They have come as immigrants to 
our country and are now here leading our country as ministers. We 
see the same situation reflected in the values and the democratic 
principles within Israel. They find themselves in a very different 
political milieu, political ambience than we are privileged to have 
right here in this country notwithstanding some of the discomforts 
and the concerns we presently live with.
<P>
	It was very exciting to meet with the leadership of the women's 
movement in Ram Allah. The women talked about the importance 
of the development of trade links and business, both with Israel and 
the potential Canadian agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6115"> 6115 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague from Dartmouth pointed out that we have not 
heard one word from the Palestinians against this accord. We have 
only heard from members on the opposition benches who seem 
to be becoming the ministers for international trade for the 
Palestinian people, which is a most inappropriate role for them 
to undertake.
<P>
	I have an addition to my colleague from Dartmouth's 
chronology. I continue along his outline from November 23, 1994 
to July 31, 1996. My addition looks particularly at the role that has 
been played by the Palestinian people.
<P>
	In 1995 there were meetings and telephone conversations 
between Kevin Gore, Canada's chief negotiator and Abu Allah, 
then Palestinian minister of the economy and still current deputy 
minister Samir Huelella.
<P>
	On January 12, 1996 and July 31, 1996 ongoing negotiations 
were continued. Commercial counsellor Zeisler spoke with deputy 
minister Huelella and other Palestinian authority trade officials 
regarding the extension of benefits and requests meetings with 
Minister Masri to formally present a copy of the free trade 
agreement.
<P>
	On September 3, 1996 commercial counsellor Zeisler met again 
with the new Palestinian minister of economy and trade.
<P>
	On October 20, 1996 commercial counsellor Zeisler, 
Ambassador Berger and the First Secretary Barber met with the 
Palestinians. Again there were technical seminars on November 6 
and November 9 on the benefits to the Palestinians under this 
agreement.
<P>
	On October 27 there was another meeting. October 28, a letter 
was sent to Minister Masri elaborating Canada's legislative 
process. It was faxed on October 29.
<P>
	The whole outline is one of openness. The ability to be involved 
in this undertaking is quite exciting and interesting. As a last note, 
we have given an example to the world. The Americans have 
decided to follow the route Canada has undertaken with respect to 
the inclusion of our Palestinian cousins who are found in the area.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I would urge the House to look upon this free trade agreement as 
positive in the interests of Canada, in the interests of Israel, in the 
interests of Palestinians and in the interests of forwarding the peace 
movement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEFISHERIESACT">THE FISHERIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 4, 1996, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-62, an act respecting fisheries, be now read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could say right 
away that, indeed, I am pleased to rise in this House to speak to the 
bill of the century, since we are talking here about reviewing 
legislation that dates back almost to 1868. However, I must say 
first that the bill of the century is badly structured. I am surprised to 
see that the fisheries and oceans minister took only 15 minutes in 
this House, yesterday, to deal with a bill of the century.
<P>
	You will understand all the fears and all the concern that one may 
have about such a bill when one sees that the fisheries minister 
gives so little time to such a bill, the bill of the century.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I could add that, despite the fact that the minister seems to give it 
so little time, I appreciate the relevancy and the usefulness of 
reviewing and updating legislation dating back to Confederation. 
Unfortunately, instead of taking the opportunity to solve the serious 
organizational problems within the fishing industry, the federal 
government is presenting us with a bill containing major 
deficiencies.
<P>
	I will have the opportunity this afternoon to instruct my other 
colleagues in the House. The Bloc Quebecois hopes that, this time, 
the Liberal government will be able to show a little more judgment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6116"> 6116 </A></B>
<P>
and will accept to put partisanship aside to make Bill C-62 
acceptable to fishermen.
<P>
	This act being about fisheries, there is a need to get the fishing 
industry, the fishermen, to see it as good piece of legislation. It is 
important to do a good job about it, especially if no changes are to 
be made to the legislation for another century.
<P>
	I must say that, until such time as major changes have been made 
to the bill, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose the principles set out in 
this bill for reasons I will explain later.
<P>
	For the benefit of my hon. colleagues and our audience, I would 
like to say that Bill C-62 has four parts. Part I deals with fisheries 
conservation and management; it creates a work system. Part II is 
about fish habitat conservation and protection, and pollution 
prevention; it contains a series of measures allowing the legislator 
to achieve his goal.
<P>
	Part III is administrative sanctions. Two fisheries tribunals 
would be established to look after the administration and 
implementation of the administrative sanctions. Finally, part IV of 
the bill deals with administration and enforcement. Basically, part 
IV describes the working of the administration.
<P>
	I told you how shocked I was when I saw the botched job the 
government had done with its fisheries legislation. I would like to 
start my remarks by recalling the three main reasons why Bloc 
members will vote against Bill C-62 at second reading.
<P>
	First of all, we disagree with the approach taken by the minister 
in relation to fisheries management agreements. These agreements 
are covered by part I of the Fisheries Act. Second, as the bill stands, 
not enough powers are being delegated to the provinces, which 
flies in the face of the management agreements provided for in the 
same act. I will explain a little later.
<P>
	The third reason why we disagree with and will vote against this 
bill has to do with Part III concerning the establishment of fisheries 
tribunals to manage administrative sanctions. These tribunals are a 
smoke screen that will allow the minister to maintain control over 
sanctions. Those are the three reasons why the Bloc Quebecois will 
oppose Bill C-62.
<P>
	I would not want to overlook another reason related to Part II, 
which deals with habitat conservation and protection, but I will let 
my colleague from Laurentides tell you about this later. I think that 
Part II as drafted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
directly encroaches on environmental matters under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces, including Quebec. I will let my 
colleague elaborate on this.
<P>
	To get back to the heart of my speech, I will try to explain the 
reasons.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	I spoke to you earlier about management agreements. We did not 
think the minister should propose management agreements. For the 
benefit of the members present in this House and the people 
listening to us, I could perhaps quote part of clause 17, whose title 
is ``Fisheries Management Agreements''.
<P>
	Subclause 17(1) provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>17. (1) Her Majesty in right of Canada, represented by the minister, may enter into 
a fisheries management agreement with any organization that, in the opinion of the 
minister, is representative of a class of persons or holders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is to say, licence holders. It is not known whether the clause 
refers to licence holders or fishermen, but the word ``persons'' is 
used.
<P>
	What I find greatly irritating-and I fear the fisheries sector will 
feel the same way-is the discretionary nature of subclause 17(1), 
which specifies right away that fisheries management agreements 
can only be signed by the organizations or individuals invited to do 
so by the minister.
<P>
	In my view, this bill shows a dichotomy. A little further in the 
documentation on the new fisheries act, a link is made between 
fisheries management and partnership agreements. Mention is 
made of a partnership with the fisheries community. Well, 
partnership should equal transparency. There is an obligation to 
earn the trust of those they want to work with.
<P>
	If, at the outset, the minister has the discretion to decide who he 
will invite to take part in the management agreement, the whole 
thing seems to be unfair, it is not fair play, as we say in the industry, 
for the other partners or players sitting at the table. Those people do 
not know who will be invited and when.
<P>
	In other words, the minister always knows who will be invited, 
but at any time he can come out and bring another partner into the 
management agreement and that is when he could jeopardize the 
beginning of the partnership set up by the players already involved. 
This is the first problem.
<P>
	I want to stress this issue because we are at the very beginning of 
the revival of the groundfish industry. What I am trying to say 
about subclause 17(1) will be seen as a precondition to the revival 
of the cod fishing industry. Let me explain.
<P>
	The fisheries resource advisory council recommended quotas 
representing, year after year, close to 10 per cent of the catches 
registered previously. This means that not everyone will be able to 
start fishing again at the same time. It means that someone will 
have to decide who will start fishing and who will go first.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6117"> 6117 </A></B>
<P>
	So, the first problem I see with this so-called bill of the century, 
since the old one was passed 100 years ago and needs to be 
modernized, is that the minister will have to make a 
recommendation in mid-December.
<P>
	How is it that he did not take advantage of the tabling of his bill 
to at least write a clause somewhere to tell us that the minister or 
the cabinet, the executive body of government, could establish the 
rules to determine parameters thereof. There is absolutely nothing 
on that subject. If we are not able to plan for the short term, it will 
be at our door tomorrow morning, or almost, how can we expect to 
live another hundred years with something that is still at the 
minister's discretion, since the delivery of licenses is still just as 
discretionary? It was a ministerial privilege.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Fishermen will need to know that and that it is not visible.
<P>
	I always make a comparison with the reopening of the cod 
fishery, which many are hoping for next spring, after the 
moratorium established in 1993 by the department.
<P>
	When the moratorium was established, the department talked 
about a rationalization of fisheries. Fishermen said that maybe the 
way to do so was to make their trade a profession. Fishermen put a 
lot of work into that issue. There is nothing in the bill about a 
legislative framework for professional status.
<P>
	Surely the multitude of officials surrounding the fisheries 
minister have undoubtedly heard the fishermen's demands; how is 
it that there is not one iota of this in the bill or a reference to the fact 
that it will be done soon. No, there is nothing at all.
<P>
	You will note that I find that, in the first paragraph only, the 
minister should have mentioned two little things, that is, 
professional status and a definition of the essence of fishing. He 
could have told us in this clause how he sees the future, but no, 
there is nothing about that either.
<P>
	In the same perspective-and I would like to help people see 
whether the minister is clear or not and whether he has understood 
the wishes of the fishing community-when a moratorium was 
imposed on the cod fishery, fishermen said that, when that fishery 
would reopen, they would like more versatility. What did it mean? 
It meant that they would be able to catch different species, which 
seemed logical to me since there is always a risk of accidentally 
catching other species.
<P>
	However, when we are talking about management agreements, 
we are talking about a group of individuals who will be invited to 
develop management measures for a particular fishery and to 
harvest that resource. How will people who are not part of the 
group be allowed to join in? Will it be by designation or on the 
minister's discretionary advice? If such is the case, what 
confidence  will the people who developed the agreement have in 
this agreement? I am not talking about excluding people. I am just 
asking how new people will be included in such a group. There are 
methods for doing that, and I will be happy to give the minister a 
course on that subject.
<P>
	I want to raise a second point with regard to these management 
agreements. Paragraph 17(2)(<I>d</I>) refers to the obligations, 
responsibilities and funding arrangements with respect to 
management of the fishery. But just before that, paragraph 17(2)(<I>c</I>) 
says that Canada or Her Majesty may collect fees for the issuance 
of licences.
<P>
	That is exactly what Nova Scotia fishermen are contesting right 
now with regard to the lobster fishery: the increase in their fishing 
licence fees. All fishermen in Canada know that fishing licence 
fees have been raised by 300, 500 or even 1,000 per cent in some 
cases.
<P>
	These increases have hurt fishing communities and have had a 
devastating effect on the economic activity in these communities 
because that is money taken out directly from their economy.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	In clause 17(2)(<I>d</I>) of the new bill, the minister immediately 
announces that, in order to have access to a particular fishery, you 
will now have to sign or you will be invited to sign a partnership 
agreement, but, on top of that, you will have to pay new fees related 
to management and protection of this resource. As it stands, this 
does not resolve any of the fisheries' organizational problems, but 
it does one heck of a job of resolving the department's financial 
problems.
<P>
	The minister has come up with this clause, and this bill, to sort 
out his own problem of organization. He sets up a screen, he 
appoints a committee, he can add as many players as he likes, and 
to cap it all he sends them a bill.
<P>
	What is the benefit to fishermen in all this? How does it help the 
fishery? I repeat, it is the statute of the century. The last one was 
written in 1868; it is now 1996 and we are about to be taken to the 
cleaners.
<P>
	With respect to financial costs alone, I would like to give the 
example of the partnership agreements signed last year with 
respect to the crab fishers in zone 12 of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 
Traditional crabbers worked like fiends, I have to say, with 
Fisheries and Oceans officials over a long period of time. They 
were working on a partnership agreement.
<P>
	But last February, the new fisheries minister blunders in and says 
``That has to go''. What happened? He brought in new players. I am 
not contesting the right of new fishermen to come into this fishery. 
What I have a problem with is the cavalier manner in which the 
minister has acted. How can the traditional crabbers in the example 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6118"> 6118 </A></B>
<P>
I have just given trust a minister who scraps a partnership 
agreement worked out by his own department. He is the boss, after 
all.
<P>
	And the crab fishermen. He brought in a new breed of shore 
fishermen by the back door. I do not have anything against this, but 
as I said with respect to clause 17(1), there must be a mechanism 
setting out under what circumstances new players will be allowed 
to join, something transparent for those around the table.
<P>
	Imagine, the crab fishermen were preparing, for this year alone I 
believe, to pay $500,000 to Fisheries and Oceans in shared 
management costs. That is a lot of money. These people were going 
to invest money without knowing how much ministerial honesty 
and transparency there would be. If history repeats itself, how do 
you think the fishermen will react? How will they react to the 
minister's present request for a blank cheque?
<P>
	I would like to raise another small point. I have spoken of the 
first item: our position with respect to the way in which the 
minister proposed the management agreements. I offered you some 
examples to explain our opposition.
<P>
	Now, I would like to speak about why we are opposed to the 
wording of the clause concerning delegation of power to the 
provinces, delegation I would characterize as insufficient and 
contradictory.
<P>
	In this connection, I would just like to point out that, at present, 
the minister or his department is in the process of working on an 
agreement in principle with British Columbia, precisely for the 
purpose of reviewing the division of powers. Yet, with respect to 
the division of powers referred to in the June press release over the 
signatures of B.C. minister Glen Clark and the present federal 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, they indicated that everything 
was on the table and negotiable.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The delegation of power described in the present bill refers only 
to transferring licensing, with the added bonus of any charges that 
might be collected.
<P>
	This is insufficient, if we are going to be coherent with respect to 
fisheries-and I believe the B.C. Premier was when he said: ``Now 
then, if we want to look at what is happening with respect to 
fisheries, we must lay everything out on the table: licensing, 
conservation, administrative rules. Coherence is necessary, for at 
present, as everybody knows, a live fish is federal, but a dead fish is 
provincial''. We must work to ensure that this industry has all the 
same tools in its tool chest. When delegating, you cannot delegate 
just the doorknob; you have to delegate the whole door, with 
hinges, lock and key.
<P>
	I gave the example of British Columbia perhaps for fear of being 
criticized for talking about Quebec all the time. I will remind the 
House immediately that, at the Victoria conference in November 
1994, Quebec too asked for more power over fisheries.
<P>
	If time permits, it may be a good idea to remind all the hon. 
members in this place and the public as well of what Quebec 
publicly requested and is still requesting, as repeated by Quebec 
fisheries minister Guy Julien just recently, one or two weeks ago. 
This public position has been reiterated.
<P>
	Regarding stocks captured completely and entirely by its 
residents, which basically means inshore species, Quebec was 
asking for full administrative responsibility for fish stock 
assessment, preservation or management policy development and 
issuing of licences on the basis of allowable harvesting levels, as 
well as control and monitoring of its fisheries.
<P>
	To be effective in an area such as this one, you have to take a 
top-down approach.
<P>
	Furthermore, it was requested that the related budgets and 
positions be transferred along with these responsibilities. This is 
the kind of issue that can easily be settled through the transfer of 
tax points. The Quebec fisheries minister was reaching out. 
Looking at the federal minister's bill, I notice that he is trying to 
resolve some financial problems. But Quebec's proposal would 
have resolved both these financial problems and structural 
problems in fisheries.
<P>
	The other items requested by Quebec were that, regarding 
underexploited fish stocks and stocks captured by residents of more 
than one province, the federal government assume responsibility, 
directly or through special agencies, for resource assessment as 
well as the control and monitoring of the use made of this resource. 
As far as these stocks are concerned, the preservation mandate 
should go to an independent agency with decision making authority 
set up by the federal government.
<P>
	The Atlantic provinces and Quebec would designate 
representatives from their respective industries as well as 
government representatives to this agency.
<P>
	Again, regarding the stocks caught by several provinces, point 
(<I>b</I>) calls on the federal government and the provinces to establish a 
multilateral process for determining provincial fleets' access to 
fish resources. In other words, the quotas would be set before the 
fleets went out to sea. This would be a good way of settling matters, 
of being proactive. I think this kind of approach is occasionally 
needed.
<P>
	Under point (<I>c</I>), Quebec would be responsible for distributing its 
share of the stocks among its own residents, and receive related 
budgetary appropriations.
<P>
	In other words, Quebec's minister of fisheries offered to resolve 
many of the issues for his federal counterpart as long as he had the 
powers to do so. In this regard, I am still in a good position to say 
that the provinces may be better able to resolve fisheries-related 
problems, since last spring-to get back to the example I used 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6119"> 6119 </A></B>
<P>
earlier-the current federal minister of fisheries was unable to even 
make a dent in the troubles in the crab fishery.
<P>
	I would suggest that he even poured oil on the fire by refusing to 
meet with the parties in the fishing industry who could not come to 
an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Who restored public peace? Quebec's minister of fisheries, Guy 
Julien, and New Brunswick's minister of fisheries, Mr. Thériault, 
who bore the brunt of the fishermen's and factory workers' 
discontent. The windows of his house were smashed.
<P>
	It was not his area of jurisdiction but he had to settle the matter 
himself. If there is any desire to be in the least consistent, when the 
minister dares-either out of naivete or because people are thought 
to be foolish enough to swallow such a thing-to draft something 
like clause 9 on delegation of powers, with its insufficient 
description of powers, when this spring he needed his provincial 
counterparts to settle his problems, this is a real shame.
<P>
	Still relating to the delegation of powers to the provinces, I 
would also like to draw the attention of the minister, the members 
of this House and the public, to the contradiction between a desire 
to delegate powers to the provinces, as stipulated in clause 9, and 
reference to fisheries management agreements as set out in clause 
17.
<P>
	In clause 9, what is delegated is not the power to issue licences 
and to collect fees. Clause 17 on fisheries management agreements 
is not subject in any way to clause 9. Thus, what will those 
provinces wishing to take advantage of clause 9 have to administer 
if, in another forum, the federal level, via its present Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, is signing partnership agreements with those 
he himself designates, and who in his opinion represent the 
fisheries? What power does he delegate to the provinces? An empty 
shell.
<P>
	I am getting carried away, but I see time is flying, and I would 
not like to leave you without speaking of the third point which is an 
irritant to myself and the Bloc members, part III of this bill which 
addresses the creation of a Fisheries Tribunal, which I have just 
now described as a smokescreen for the minister.
<P>
	The purpose of part III, as described under the establishment of 
tribunals, was to prevent Fisheries and Oceans, both the department 
and the minister, from being judge and jury, in other words, from 
hearing evidence that a fisherman had committed fraud or violated 
a fishing regulation and then imposing the sanction right away.
<P>
	I think that under any civilized system, every accused person is 
innocent until proven guilty. What is being proposed here is this: 
the fine will no longer be imposed by the regional directors of 
Fisheries and Oceans, oh no, but by people we are going to appoint. 
The minister is going to appoint people for a period of three years; 
he will give them guidelines.
<P>
	What is the difference between appointing a representative who 
works under the supervision of the minister according to the 
minister's guidelines, and the current regional directors of 
Fisheries and Oceans? I do not see the difference. Perhaps the 
Liberals do. The difference is that they will be able to appoint their 
friends to these positions. That is obvious.
<P>
	In fact, the only two criteria for being appointed judge of these 
tribunals is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> To be a card-carrying Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> -to have a good knowledge of Canada's 
ocean resources or a good knowledge of administrative decision 
making.
<P>
	I even heard someone say: perhaps to be a card-carrying Liberal. 
Well, he might have to be a card-carrying member of some other 
party when the time comes, but we want is transparency.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I am not saying that people in the fisheries sector are 
incompetent, but I want the process to be transparent. I want 
fishermen and the people who make a living in this industry to be 
judged with a genuine traditional system. These are not second 
class citizens. They should not be judged by a second class court. 
And especially not by friends of the party who will have to do 
exactly what the minister asks them to do.
<P>
	I may recall that three years is not a long time, so if you do not 
do the job, my boy, they will put someone else in your place who 
will do exactly what the minister wants him to do. That is how I 
interpret this part and that is how it is written.
<P>
	To conclude on this issue, what the minister is proposing to us is 
a second-rate, parallel justice system. At the same time, he is 
sending real judges, who have completed law studies and know the 
system inside out, the message that they are doing a bad job. I am 
not convinced the minister is in a position to teach them lessons.
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice thinks that judges and lawyers should 
be better informed, he should follow in Quebec's footsteps. When 
Quebec amended its civil code, it invited all the judges in the 
province to review the new parts of the civil code.
<P>
	If the minister of fisheries thinks this is important, he should ask 
the Minister of Justice to establish a process to familiarize 
Canadian judges with the new fisheries act. I agree that the last one 
dates back 100 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6120"> 6120 </A></B>
<P>
	The many points we raised show how important this is. 
Fishermen are not second-class citizens. They have the right to 
go to court, to benefit from a transparent, equal and equitable 
justice system across Canada.
<P>
	What bothers me somewhat is the perception by departmental 
officials that fishermen are poachers. Fishermen are not poachers; 
their goal is to catch fish at the lowest possible cost while 
protecting the environment to ensure that this resource can be 
sustained.
<P>
	Again, regarding departmental officials' notion that fishermen 
are poachers, who drafted the regulations? Who said that any cod 
measuring less than 16 inches should be thrown back into the 
water?
<P>
	Fishermen cannot see the ocean floor, while the fish do not know 
that fishermen are prohibited from catching fish measuring less 
than 16 inches. So what should fishermen who inadvertently catch 
fish measuring less than 16 inches in their nets do? If they bring it 
back, they will become poachers and be fined by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. So what do they do? They throw the fish 
back into the water. But if they throw it back into the water and 
Fisheries and Oceans finds out, they are still poachers in the 
department's eyes.
<P>
	How can we establish a system that will treat fishermen not as 
poachers but as people trying to catch fish in a cost-effective way 
while protecting the environment so they can continue fishing year 
after year?
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	This may be a different subject, but let me tell you that, as far as 
I can see, the tribunals certainly do not look like they will be fair 
and impartial, given that they will be the ones making the 
regulations, and I am not always sure that the people who work 
there use their heads to make them.
<P>
	My point, and perhaps some people will have a hard time 
following, but what we must realize is that, as I said earlier, the 
main problem with fishery at present is the need for a constant 
relationship, the same tool box, so that all the fish caught by the 
fishermen, and hopefully only the most mature fish will be caught, 
all this fish can be sold. But we have just changed jurisdiction here. 
Because dead fish is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. Could we 
not focus on seeing how fisheries will be commercialized, by 
providing the fishing industry with the tools it needs to avoid 
making blunders like forcing fishermen to throw their catch back in 
the water?
<P>
	We should work toward giving them the necessary tools. And if 
the federal government does not have the authority required, it 
should refer the matter to the provinces, because they are the ones 
licensing fish processing plants, guaranteeing boat loans and, in 
some cases, helping fund the construction of processing plants.
<P>
	What is left for the federal government to be responsible for? 
Issuing fishing licences.
<P>
	As for conservation, I think that it is clear to everyone that stocks 
overlap. We are prepared to share and to live with a central player 
in the form of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	But for the province of Quebec or for Newfoundland, working 
with Fisheries and Oceans Canada to conserve the resource or 
working with NAFO, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization, boils down to the same thing. But what is better 
about NAFO's rules is that they are respected by Canada and by all 
other countries in the world, as well as in the provinces because 
Canada is a member country. It would not be a heck of a lot harder, 
and in fact would be that much easier, to get along in this respect.
<P>
	I will therefore wrap up before I run out of time. I would like to 
remind viewers that the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against the 
bill. I am nonetheless pleased to take part in discussions about a bill 
that I described as the bill of the century, but I am saddened 
because it is badly put together.
<P>
	In review, there are three major reasons the Bloc Quebecois will 
be voting against the bill at second reading. The first is that the 
minister determines who may enter into management agreements. 
This prevents fishermen from knowing all the players.
<P>
	The second irritant, still in part I, concerns the delegation of 
authority. In my view, the delegation of authority set out in clause 9 
is inadequate, as well as contradictory.
<P>
	The third point concerns the Fisheries Tribunal. I would call it a 
front. It resolves nothing. The minister will sort things out quietly 
himself behind the scenes.
<P>
	At the start of my speech, I also criticized what I would call the 
minister's lack of interest. And yet, at the same time, it is as though 
he wants to ram the bill through. The best he could manage was a 
15 minute speech yesterday in the House to launch the fisheries bill 
of the century. In my view, this is a lack of respect for the fishery 
and for the Canadian people. I think it is simply lacking in respect 
to ram through in 15 minutes a bill that will not come up for review 
for perhaps another 100 years. I hope to be able to meet with him 
again to discuss this subject, because I am not certain that 
Quebecers and Canadians will share his sentiments, in light of the 
introduction he gave the bill.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address 
Bill C-62. The bill gives sweeping powers to the minister to 
manage the fisheries through ministerial orders, through private 
fishing agreements, and it transfers authority to the provinces. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6121"> 6121 </A></B>
<P>
major question is does the bill address the real problems that are 
facing the fishing industry.
<P>
	First I would like to take a look at the west coast, where I come 
from, and advance some problems that are facing the industry 
there. I would like members to consider whether this bill will do 
anything to alleviate those difficulties.
<P>
	For example, I would like to quote from a document which was 
prepared for congressional staff in the U.S. It mentions the 
Canadian salmon fleet restructuring. It states that on August 9, 
1996 a report by the B.C. job protection commission was released, 
revealing that in the past two years the B.C. commercial salmon 
fleet's decline has cost the provincial economy $180 million, with 
7,800 jobs lost. At the same time, the provincial sport fishing 
sector's decline has cost the economy $170 million, with the loss of 
2,175 jobs.
<P>
	By allowing the minister under the new act to give fish to his 
friends, will that alleviate the difficulties identified in that report?
<P>
	A document entitled ``Status of Anadromous Salmon and Trout 
in British Columbia and the Yukon'', prepared by T.L. Slaney et al 
for the American Fisheries Society's North Pacific international 
chapter, attempted to give some idea to the public about the health 
of fish stocks in B.C. The assessment found that 624 salmon stocks 
were at high risk, 78 were at moderate risk, 230 were of special 
concern and 142 were extirpated in this century. One hundred and 
forty-two salmon species extinguished in this century alone. They 
were unable to classify 4,172 stocks, or 43 per cent, because of an 
absence of reliable data.
<P>
	They go on to note that habitat degradation associated with 
logging, urbanization and hydro power development contributed to 
most of the 142 documented stock extinctions.
<P>
	Furthermore, they say there is little doubt that overutilization by 
commercial and recreational fisheries has in many cases resulted in 
severe stock depressions that, when added to other factors, has put 
many stocks at risk.
<P>
	The question again is will this act somehow alleviate this 
problem. I think not.
<P>
	The preface to the bill notes that this is an act respecting 
fisheries. The preamble says that the powers, duties and functions 
of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans extend to seacoast and 
inland fisheries. The point I want to raise is just how certain is the 
minister's authority when it comes to this bill and as well to the 
oceans act?
<P>
	I would like to go back to December 1995. At that time the 
oceans act was up for discussion. A House of Commons standing 
committee received a notice from the president of Nunavut 
Tunngavick Inc., the Inuit fishery organization in the territory of 
Nunavut.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	It advised the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans that 
sections 35 and 107 of the new oceans act, which was Bill C-98 at 
that time, were ultra vires given the Nunavut Land Claims 
Agreement. The NTI proposed the following amendments to the 
oceans act. It proposed in section 30(5) that the governor in council 
may make regulations (a) establishing marine protected areas with 
approval of bodies established under land claims agreement where 
required.
<P>
	Section (b) would have said that the governor in council could 
make regulations prescribing measures not inconsistent with 
Canada's international obligations or the authority of bodies 
established under land claims agreements for the conservation and 
protection of fisheries resources and their habitat in marine 
protected areas.
<P>
	Clearly the Inuit of Nunavut interpreted their treaty as limiting 
federal authority over legislation affecting arctic waters within the 
Nunavut settlement agreement. The response of the committee to 
this request was to acknowledge that regulations under the new 
oceans act were to be limited by the terms and conditions of land 
claims agreements.
<P>
	The committee sent the following amendments to Parliament for 
consideration at report stage of what was then Bill C-98. The 
regulation then read in section 2(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty nothing in this Act shall be construed so as to abrogate or 
derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of 
Canada under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 36(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council, on recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, may make orders exercising any power under section 35 on an emergency 
basis where the Minister is of the opinion that a marine resource or habitat is likely to 
be at risk to the extent that such orders are not inconsistent with the land claims 
agreement that has been given effect and has been ratified or improved by an Act of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is to say, the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans 
conceded that land claims agreements may constrain the ability of 
the Government of Canada to protect a resource owned by all the 
people of Canada. The question again is will this new act somehow 
improve on that situation. Does it somehow allow that the minister 
has the ultimate authority? No, it does not.
<P>
	This will have a devastating effect on management of the 
fisheries resource in British Columbia. We are looking at 
approximately 40 treaties which are to be put together in the next 
few years, each one of which will have the ability to overrule the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Obviously that makes the 
management of fisheries unworkable.
<P>
	The fisheries act, Bill C-62, which the government has laid 
before this House, is a bill that will radically change  the 
management of the fishery as we have known it for over 150 years. 
Bill 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6122"> 6122 </A></B>
<P>
C-62 gives the minister of fisheries unlimited discretion to carve up 
the public fishery into private fisheries.
<P>
	There is no requirement for any publication of the private 
exclusive fishing agreements. There are no guidelines on whom 
these agreements are to be with. The minister is given unlimited 
discretion to make his own regulations, to organize the fishery by 
ministerial decrees or orders. These ministerial orders can even 
override regulations made by the governor in council. The 
government can transfer its constitutional responsibilities for 
fisheries management, enforcement and habitat protection to the 
provinces without ever coming back to seek the sanction of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Before we examine the detail of the bill or the problems it should 
address, this House would do well to remember some sage advice 
from a former member of this Chamber, Stanley Knowles. He said: 
``It is our experience in Parliament time and time again to think we 
know what we passed when we gave final approval to a piece of 
legislation only to find months later that things were being done or 
restrictions were being imposed of a kind we did not believe 
appeared in the bill at all. We try to find out what happened. We 
discover that we had given authority to the governor in council to 
make regulations for the carrying out of the purposes of the act and 
that under this authority restrictive regulations were passed or 
restrictive definitions were introduced of such a nature as to 
produce quite a different result from the result we thought had been 
intended''.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	A recent report of this House issued another warning that bears 
repeating. When delegated authority is broad and use of that 
authority is not adequately supervised by Parliament, the implied 
parliamentary control is absent and the supremacy of Parliament is 
undermined.
<P>
	I would like to refer to the bill and to some of those sections 
which give the minister that kind of blanket authority to do what he 
wishes. Clause 17(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Her Majesty in right of Canada, represented by the Minister, may enter into a 
fisheries management agreement with any organization that, in the opinion of the 
Minister, is representative of a class of persons or holders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is any group, whether they be friends of the minister of or 
of the government, whatever, but there is no limitation as to what 
that group should represent. There is no coming back to Parliament 
for authority to enter into policy decisions which, as I will point out 
later, will impact on the fisheries as it has been run since 
Confederation.
<P>
	Clause 18(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Before a fisheries management agreement is entered into, notice of it shall be 
given to the holders or persons likely to be subject to it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, no notice need be given to anyone other than those who 
are going to be covered by it. The public at large does not need to 
be informed.
<P>
	Clause 19(1) states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister shall publish a fisheries management agreement in the manner the 
Minister sees fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, no publication or notice need be given of that 
arrangement.
<P>
	The adoption of a set of agreements between the crown and any 
organization gives sweeping power to the minister to create private 
fisheries out of the public fisheries of Canada. This would be the 
first time since Confederation since this power has existed. All 
fisheries law in tidal waters in British Columbia has so far 
proceeded on the principle that all Canadians are to have equal 
access to the commercial licences governing the fishery.
<P>
	Apart from a brief period during the war when Canadians of 
Japanese ancestry were denied this right, it has prevailed without 
question.
<P>
	A second exception is the recent incursion into the public fishery 
by the AFS, but that was not provided for in the act and is probably 
ultra vires of the act. It would not be ultra vires of Bill C-62.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I am loath to interrupt your speech, 
but I wonder if perhaps you could take your speech up at the end of 
question period. Of course you will have the floor again. At this

this past weekend I attended a retirement celebration to honour the 
45 years of service by Gord Rolling and 32 years of service by 
Arnold Smith, more commonly known as Smitty. Both served with 
distinction and dedication as firefighters on the Mount Albert

	In celebrating their retirement, it gives us the opportunity to 
reflect on the contribution of all of our firefighters, particularly the

provide our communities. However, we may not be fully aware of 
the hours taken away from families in fighting fires, assisting at 
accidents, on training courses and other community activities. Nor

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
wish to pay tribute to a business woman in my riding, Lise 
Brouillette. Ms. Brouillette, who has been Director General of the 
Société régionale de développement économique des Moulins 
since 1991, recently received the 1996 Prix Professionnelle en 
développement économique du Québec in appreciation of her 
contribution to the economic development of the des Moulins

<P>
	As a woman very involved in the development of our region, she 
managed, with her dynamic approach, to create several thousand 
jobs and attract $50 million worth of investment since the 
beginning of her mandate at the SORDEM.
<P>
	Last year, Ms. Brouillette was awarded the Assiette d'argent de 
l'Association des professionnels en développement économique du 
Québec. This woman is an outstanding example of how to succeed 
and a symbol of excellence for everyone.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Liberals' words sound great but their actions differ: $87 million in 
questionable corporate welfare to Bombardier; millions of dollars 
in a questionable flag giveaway program; and more millions of 
dollars on a questionable information office in Ottawa.
<P>
	Meanwhile back on the west coast we see cuts; information 
limited; automated light stations replace reliable manned stations; 
coast guard vessels and operations are reduced, as are hatcheries 
needed to rebuild endangered salmon stocks.
<P>
	An unusually heavy October storm resulted in the failure of 
several automated light stations leaving mariners and others who 
rely on vital weather information to fend for themselves.
<P>
	The decision to postpone closure of the Ganges coast guard 
station was welcome but apparently has not changed the ultimate 
Ottawa intention to relocate the station to Victoria. To replace a 
fast, proven vessel  located at the hub of maritime activity in this 
very busy region with a slower vessel substantially removed from 
much of that activity simply does not make sense.
<P>
	This Liberal decision places west coast public safety and lives at 
risk.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week marks National 4-H Week, a time to reflect on 
the important work that 4-H does in developing one of our greatest 
resources, our rural young people.
<P>
	For nearly a century, 4-H has been giving young Canadians the 
education, skills and support they need so they can grow up to be 
contributing members of our society. Rural communities are a 
wellspring of our economy providing the people and the resource 
base that underlies much of our success as a trading nation.
<P>
	One of rural Canada's leading industries, agriculture and food, 
will create jobs and growth for our economy well into the 21st 
century. The foundation for this growth is people who have a 
wealth of creativity, ability and self-confidence to build our farms 
and businesses. 4-H has a proven track record developing those 
skills in our young citizens.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will contribute $300,000 over three 
years to 4-H activities. It is not only an investment in our young 
people, it is an investment in the social fabric of our country and 
the future prosperity of Canada.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I had 
the honour to speak at a Remembrance Day ceremony for the 
merchant navy war dead at the war memorial here in Ottawa.
<P>
	During the second world war the government named the 
merchant navy the fourth arm of the armed services and for good 
reason. The merchant ships formed the lifeline to the free world. 
They carried vital supplies of food, munitions and fuel. The 
merchant navy became the designated target of the enemy and its 
losses were the highest of all the war services.
<P>
	Now in their seventies and eighties, only 2,900 remain of the 
12,000 who went to war. They are veterans in name only without 
equality of entitlement for disability pensions, health care and 
other benefits.
<P>
	I was disappointed that the Secretary of State for Veterans 
Affairs was not able to attend the memorial service today. I call on 
<P>

decision making process. People need to know where the jobs are 
and what the requirements are to get them.

	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
year and over the previous five years, Canadians marked the 50th 
anniversaries of the events of the second world war. The 
anniversaries led to unprecedented media coverage of the 
commemorative ceremonies for such historic events as the Battle 
of Britain, the Dieppe landing, the Italian campaign, D-Day and the 
end of the war. Across the country veterans organizations helped 
communities stage special ceremonies and celebrations that 
brought to mind the way of life of a different time, and the spirit of 
dedication of those who served Canada.
<P>
	We must not let go of that sense of respect for the generation of 
the second world war now that the 50th anniversaries have passed. I

	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-66 which amends the Canada Labour Code is in my view a fair 
and balanced piece of legislation. There are several reasons for 
this.
<P>
	The first has to do with the process to produce the legislation. 
Labour and management participated fully in the review process. 
The second has to do with the contents of the bill. Unquestionably, 
the most contentious issue to address was the replacement worker  
issue and here we came up with a reasonable compromise.
<P>
	The bill does not abolish the right of employers to use 
replacement workers, however employers will not be able to use 
replacement workers to undermine the union. It is the board that 
will determine if an employer action constitutes an unfair labour 
practice, not the union.
<P>
	Collective bargaining is widely accepted in Canada by both 
labour and management. This bill will improve the efficiency with 
which the law is administered and enhance the effectiveness of the 
collective bargaining process. It does nothing to alter the balance of 
the labour-management relationship. In fact, it ensures a balance 
will continue in a world of rapid change.

<P>
	This resignation was certainly the only possible solution under

having made such a poor choice for the position of 
lieutenant-governor of Quebec?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have accepted the resignation of Jean-Louis Roux as 
lieutenant-governor of Quebec with enormous regret.
<P>
	Jean-Louis Roux is one of the most honourable men in Quebec. 
He has enjoyed an exceptional career in our province. He was 
involved in all manner of causes for the defence of human rights 
and freedoms in this society.
<P>
	I would ask the indulgence of the Chair to demonstrate how this 
man has participated in the advancement of human rights and 
freedoms in Quebec. As early as 1947, he was involved in opposing 
censorship in the <I>Les enfants du Paradis</I> affair. He was involved in 
Radio-Canada's strike over the right to unionize. In 1965, he fought 
class legislation concerning authors. He was even opposed to the 
War Measures Act in 1970. He fought for freedom of expression 
during the controversy over the play Les fées ont soif in 1978.
<P>
	Way back in the 1950s he was one of the founders of <I>Cité Libre</I>, 
in opposition to the regime of the day. He was a member of Artistes 
pour la paix, Amnesty International, and the Friends of Simon 
Wiesenthal, which helped people involved in tracing war criminals.
<P>
	Such was the career of this man, Jean-louis Roux, one of the 
greatest artists Quebec has ever known. Unfortunately, he made 
one mistake-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, pardon me, but I 
rarely take advantage of the House, and I am going to continue.
<P>
	This is a most honourable man. Are there two standards in our 
society? He was a federalist as well. I trust that some of those who 
have written things about him today will have the courage to look 
up what was written in <I>Le Devoir</I> during the 1930s and 1940s.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has only himself to be annoyed with. 
He is the one responsible for the present mess.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	He is responsible for the mess and, like it or not, he will still 
have to find answers to a number of questions to which the public 
wants answers.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is so informed about the career of 
Jean-Louis Roux, how can it be that his knowledge does not go 
back further than 1949? It is what happened prior to that which has 
shocked all the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Roux has always spoken of that time in lectures and 
radio or television discussions. He has taken part in public 
discussions on radio and television explaining how Quebec society 
has evolved from the thirties to the present.
<P>
	He himself stated on one such program that he had made the 
mistake of putting a swastika on his lab coat during his student 
days, at the age of 19, and that he regretted this. He has stated 
publicly that he regretted this enormously. He has also said it to me 
personally. This was public, and not a question of a criminal act.
<P>
	When we investigate people to whom we are offering positions, 
we do not go looking into the darkest recesses of their personal 
lives, we look at their record of honour as a citizen, and whether 
they have a criminal record. In my opinion, Jean-Louis Roux had 
an impeccable record, except that he had committed one error at 
the age of 19 years while at the Université de Montréal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister ought to have been more careful, since 
his responsibilities require it, knowing what Jean-Louis Roux is 
capable of saying. The Prime Minister will recall the odious 
comparison he made during the last referendum. The Prime 
Minister ought to have been more careful, more mistrustful.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify the fact that his sole concern 
before appointing Jean-Louis Roux as lieutenant-governor of 
Quebec was the services he had rendered to the Liberal Party of 
Canada, rather than the irreproachable profile he ought to have 
provided?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I invited Jean-Louis Roux to become a Senator, I did 
not even know he was a Liberal. Even when I invited him to the 
Senate, I said to him: ``I do not know if you are a member of my 
party. If you want to sit-''
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I offered him a seat as an 
independent. And, if we need to go poking into everyone's lives, 
could the Leader of the Opposition tell me why people like Camille 
Laurin and Denis Lazure were in Mr. Lévesque's cabinet, when 
they had defended Count Jacques de Bernonville, the right hand 
man to Klaus Barbie in Europe?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to hear the Prime Minister, one would believe that Mr. 
Roux should not have handed in his resignation earlier today. I am 
somewhat surprised. Normally, before important appointments are 
made, there is always an investigation conducted by the RCMP; 
that is the routine investigation commonly called a security check.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us today if he looked at the 
RCMP's investigation report on Senator Roux before appointing 
him as lieutenant governor?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always apprised of the findings of security 
investigations and, like the others, this one turned up nothing. I 
based my decision to appoint Senator Roux on what I knew at the 
time and, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6128"> 6128 </A></B>
<P>
everyone knows, I just  listed a few of the many things he has 
accomplished in Quebec society over the past 50 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has changed his tune a few times since 
yesterday. According to his Deputy Prime Minister, he was 100 per 
cent behind Jean-Louis Roux. According to what his press attache 
said yesterday, the Prime Minister was not aware of Jean-Louis 
Roux's remarks and actions. And today, the Prime Minister himself 
tells us Jean-Louis Roux raised the matter with him.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	It is difficult to follow what the Prime Minister is saying. Let me 
put my question in clear and simple terms: Will the Prime Minister 
rise in his place and tell us today whether or not the routine RCMP 
investigation on Senator Roux contained any reference to events 
that took place in 1942?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I am saying is that this was a routine investigation, 
and no one ever brought anything to my attention that might have 
prevented Jean-Louis Roux's appointment as a member of the 
Senate of Canada.
<P>
	We spoke, yesterday evening. I did not raise this matter since I 
knew nothing about it. He informed me of the facts now in the 
public domain, that I shared with the House a moment ago. This 
morning, he voluntarily tendered his resignation.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Canadian Heritage defended Mr. 
Roux, whom I believe she described as an honourable man. Other 
ministers did the same during media scrums and I stand by that 
position. He made a deliberate choice to put an end to the 
controversy and to resign; we did not ask for his resignation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Jean-Louis Roux has resigned but Canadians are worried about the 
government's mishandling of this issue.
<P>
	They are having a hard time accepting why the government, and 
yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, tried to dismiss the wearing 
of a swastika, which is the most vile symbol in history, as simply a 
youthful prank.
<P>
	What Mr. Roux did in 1942 is reprehensible but so is the 
government's sidestepping of this issue. Instead of trying to deal 
with it head on, incredibly the Prime Minister still defends him. I 
ask the Prime Minister now: Will he admit that it was wrong for his 
government to try to defend the wearing of a swastika? And will he 
apologize to Canadians for his error in judgment?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, nobody at all defended that. In fact, I said that it was an 
error, and Mr. Roux himself said that it was an error which he 
regretted.
<P>
	Nobody said that it was a defensible thing. What the leader of 
the-temporary leader, I guess, we do not see the leader very 
often-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We said that it was an error 
made by a young person 19 years old. We always said that it was an 
error. The deputy Prime Minister never said that it was not an error.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might 
remind the Prime Minister that we had a few questions for him 
yesterday about several things, although he was not here to 
appreciate them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are all even now so we will get on with 
question period.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are even but I was the only one who 
got cut off, you will recall.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is here today and I am really glad to be able 
to ask him a question. He is fond of saying that the buck stops with 
him.
<P>
	The Prime Minister personally appointed Quebec's 
lieutenant-governor and if he did not know about Mr. Roux's past 
he certainly should have. Since the truth has now come out, it 
seems that he would much rather hide and hope things go away.
<P>
	The sign of a good, strong leader is that if someone needs to be 
fired, he gets fired. We never see that here in the House of 
Commons. The Prime Minister always hopes things will go away. 
Will the Prime Minister accept full responsibility for the 
appointment of Jean-Louis Roux and will he admit finally, just 
once, that he has made a mistake?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have explained to the House of Commons all the 
circumstances of the incident. Mr. Roux resigned today and I have 
accepted his resignation.
<P>
	I have to repeat that this man has served the population of 
Canada extremely well. He is a great artist. He made a mistake 54 
years ago when he was 19 years old. It is all in the past. I do not 
believe anybody can take anything away from his great career and 
his great service to the Canadian population and the people of 
Quebec in particular.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we see 
it spotted on the front rows here that this Prime Minister simply is 
incapable of admitting that he has made a mistake. Why is it so 
difficult to say I am sorry?
<P>
	We have to move on from here, of course, because there is a 
vacancy in the lieutenant-governorship of Quebec. Canadians 
would like to think that the Prime Minister will take more care in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6129"> 6129 </A></B>
<P>
appointing the next lieutenant-governor. The public and the 
province should be consulted, and merit alone, not loyalty to the 
Liberal Party, should the Prime Minister's guiding principle.
<P>
	Now that the Prime Minister is ready to make another 
appointment, will he consult with the public and the province 
before appointing Quebec's lieutenant-governor, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will follow the rule that was established in 1867. It is the 
prerogative of the Prime Minister to inform the premier of the 
province but he has to take full responsibility for the appointment.
<P>
	I have taken full responsibility for all lieutenant-governor 
appointments I have made so far. In this case, I will repeat that this 
man made an error when he was 19 years old but his record shows 
very clearly to me and any objective person that he resigned 
because he did not want to be the object of a controversy.
<P>
	However, no one should take anything away from his great 
contribution to the advancement of arts and culture in the province 
of Quebec. He also participated many times at the Stratford 
Festival in Ontario in a very eloquent way. It was fantastic to see a 
francophone perform so well in a Shakespearian play.

<P>
	On the one hand, he tries to justify the former lieutenant- 
governor's actions. He admires his great career and is sorry he 
resigned. On the other hand, the Prime Minister tells us: ``I did not

enough to decide to resign on his own shedding a tear of regret''.

we would like to know, is this: Does he think Jean-Louis Roux's 
resignation in these circumstances is a good thing? Does he 
approve of his resignation, his decision, does he think this is 
proper? That is what we want to know.

the reasons I clearly explained to the House earlier.
<P>

for the Prime Minister and has to do with the use of government 
credit cards by ministers.
<P>
	Canadians are telling us that transparency and accountability are 
fresh ideas they would really like to see in this Parliament. 
Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister said we had all the facts, 
underline all. How strange then that more facts were released 
yesterday to the press but not to us.
<P>
	The former minister of defence unintentionally breached some 
guidelines. He lost his job. The Secretary of State for Training and 
Youth knowingly breached Treasury Board guidelines and she 
continues to enjoy the support of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister decide which guidelines are to be 
enforced and which are to be ignored?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we replied to these questions last week. The money has all 
been paid back. There was the use of a credit card and every time 
that it was used it was checked with the department and the 
payments were made back to the government in a proper fashion.
<P>
	No money was lost. It was just as explained last week. The 
secretary of state made a clerical mistake involuntarily and all the 
facts were submitted to the ethics counsellor who said that there 
was no need for me to ask for a resignation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that 
Canadians still have some unanswered questions. Here are some 
facts that are still needed.
<P>
	Of the $9,700 whited out, $9,200 is still unaccounted for. There 
are two and a half years for which we have no records. There is no 
way of knowing which items were charged to taxpayers. There is 
no way of knowing when personal expenses were incurred, how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6130"> 6130 </A></B>
<P>
much they were  and when precisely they were paid back. There is 
no way of knowing how many other ministers are engaging in this 
same type of abuse of their cards. There is no way of knowing what 
the actual guidelines are-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, with the problems we have with access to 
information and whiteout, will the Prime Minister commit to 
tabling in this House full and complete documentation for the 
entire period without whiteout?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
personal expenditures of the member are information that is of a 
personal nature and is covered under the Privacy Act.
<P>
	It is the role of the comptroller in every department to look at the 
expenditures and to determine what is official government 
expenditure and what is personal expenditure. That is what 
happened in this case. There is no mystery to it. The comptrollers 
have gone through it. All the money has been repaid.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Although the ceasefire declared unilaterally yesterday by the 
rebel Tutsis seems to be holding, Zaire is still in the throes of a 
major crisis, because the principal players hold conflicting views. 
The Nairobi summit does not seem to have produced any concrete 
results today, with Rwanda still opposed to an international force 
being sent in.
<P>
	In a context where Zaire is ruling out any peace talks until 
Rwandan forces leave its territory, can the minister tell us what 
efforts his government now intends to take to help resolve the 
major crisis brewing in central Africa?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I said yesterday, Ambassador Chrétien is now in Africa 
to discuss with all parties the possibility of a meeting or a ceasefire. 
The Government of Canada is prepared to take an active part in 
Ambassador Chrétien's recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, as I said yesterday, we are very concerned 
about Rwanda's role, and I have asked my officials and the 
ambassador to Rwanda to present Canada's positions to the 
government of Rwanda in order to co-operate in all the efforts 
being made to find a solution in the great lakes region of Africa.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all players now agree on two priorities: obtain a lasting 
ceasefire and open up safe humanitarian corridors.
<P>
	Is the minister, or is he not, prepared to support the position of 
the French government, which feels that the best way to ensure the 
creation of such safe corridors is to send in an international force 
by order of the Security Council?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would be prudent that any decision about response into 
the very troubled situation also involve the African states. There 
should be full participation of those who are most immediately 
affected.
<P>
	It is a point of our own diplomacy and that of Ambassador 
Chrétien on behalf of the United Nations to come up with 
recommendations. One of the options or choices could well be 
some form of safe refuge or safe corridor, but until those direct 
consultations of the ambassador are concluded it is probably too 
early for Canada to say exactly what it will do.
<P>
	We are prepared and ready to respond to all requests that will 
provide a solution to the situation and we can only wish God speed 
to Ambassador Chrétien in the work that he is doing.

<P>
	Last week, when we asked the Minister of Finance to table his 
bill that would amend the Income Tax Act, so as to eliminate the 
use of family trusts as tax loopholes, he simply maintained that the 
ways and means motion tabled had already taken effect. Of course 
the motion takes effect when it is tabled, but subsequently, a bill is 
required to amend the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister claimed last week, he must table a 
bill to amend the Income Tax Act. Consequently, when does he 
intend to table this bill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
last week I said that when the ways and means method is used, 
whatever is required in the Act to plug the loophole referred to by 
the hon. member takes effect immediately.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	That being said, we intend to proceed with the bill at the 
appropriate time, as usual, as soon as the House leaders on both 
sides can agree on a time slot.

this bill will provide a statutory and objective method to calculate 
the guarantees required by Revenue Canada of millionaires who 
want to transfer their assets outside Canada, instead of leaving the 
choice of guarantee t the sole discretion of the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we intend to proceed in the usual way. I repeat what I said when the

quote: ``If there is the slightest risk the Canadian government will

on crime law, a man who raped his former common-law wife is 
walking free, a man who pointed a gun at his wife and fired it at her

death and set a truck on fire never even saw the inside of a court

everything else they have done in the area of crime and justice by 
coming to this House and picking facts out of isolated cases, 
distorting their message and pretending they mean something they 
do not.
<P>
	When we came to this House with Bill C-41, which distinguishes 
between violent and non-violent crime, which provides for tough 
sentences for people who harm others, Reformers voted against the

to make it clear that those who use guns in crime would go to 
prison for mandatory minimum time, they voted against them.

commit crimes of violence under the Young Offenders Act will be

``My monthly cheque for $400 has been cut by $110'', leaving only 
$290 per month to live on. ``They have taken away whatever little 
leeway I had left. I cannot make it under these circumstances''.
<P>
	Thousands of low-income earners have been deprived of an 
essential basic income for ten months. What concrete steps does 
the minister intend to take in the short term to find a solution?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
simply to repeat what I said, I am appreciative that the hon. 
member raises this issue.
<P>
	It is an issue that has been raised by many members on this side 
of the House, in fact on all sides of the House. There is no doubt 
that as a result of this action Canadians from coast to coast have 
been unfairly treated.
<P>
	We have brought this matter to the attention of the Americans. I 
have met with the secretary of treasury twice. It is as the result of 
action taken by the American government that this situation has 
arisen.
<P>
	We are negotiating with them. Our officials have met with them 
on numerous occasions and are going down again within the next 
couple of weeks.
<P>
	Unfortunately I am not in a position to say when we will arrive at 
a solution, but it is uppermost in our minds. It is a priority. It is a 
priority I am sure for this House. I will draw that to the attention of 
my counterpart.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The $87 million awarded to Bombardier through technology 
partnerships Canada is supposed to represent one third of the 
contributions required for the RJ-X project. Yet at the time of the 
announcement the board of directors of Bombardier had still not 
given approval to the project.
<P>
	Why did the minister commit $87 million of taxpayer money 
before Bombardier was prepared to make a commitment to the 
project itself?
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not quite sure what his question is intended to show, 
but if they do not want the money we will not force it on them, I can 
assure him of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a serious problem when taxpayers are providing money and 
interest free loans to a company which is profitable and they are not 
provided with the details of the repayment or of the money to be 
gained. In fact, the minister still refuses to provide details on 
previous moneys given to that particular company.
<P>
	Will the minister tell Canadians today when they can expect 
Bombardier to repay the $87 million and what rate of return can be 
expected from the money that has been given to Bombardier?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if it were that simple then we would not be involved in 
this project using technology partnerships Canada.
<P>
	What this program is intended to do is create opportunity by 
participating in risky projects for research and development that 
will create products which will sell on the world market. We 
expect, based on our own projections of sales of the RJ-X, that we 
will be fully repaid and, in fact, that we will be more than fully 
repaid by this project. However, it is a risky project. That is why it 
is important, if we want to create jobs in high risk, high technology 
areas, for the government to be there.
<P>
	If we can sell more than projected we will make more money. If 
we sell less than projected we may not make as much money. That 
is the way business works. However, the important thing is that 
jobs are going to be created. Twenty-seven hundred jobs will be 
created or sustained by this investment. That is the kind of project 
we are looking to support.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	While the stock market is soaring and records are being set on 
Bay Street, Canadians are setting records for poverty. Canadian 
children are going to bed hungry. The unemployment rate is 
unacceptably high and millions of Canadians are looking toward a 
bleak Christmas.
<P>
	What specific measures does the Prime Minister intend to 
introduce in the very near future in order to alleviate child poverty 
and to help the unemployed? The poor and the hungry children 
need help now. The unemployed need help now. They cannot wait. 
Can the Prime Minister indicate what specific measures he will 
bring in before Christmas to give some hope to impoverished 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows that as a result of the tremendous and 
virtually unprecedented decline in interest rates over the course of 
the last year, huge numbers of Canadians are now facing the 
possibility, thank Heaven, of going back to work.
<P>
	The conference board said today that as a result of the decline in 
interest rates, it expects close to 330,000 new jobs to open up for 
Canadians over the course of the next year. At the same time, the 
hon. member knows that last year the working income supplement 
for families with poor children was doubled. Credits for caregivers 
were increased. We made it possible for young single mothers to 
have day care so they can go back to work. We have increased 
possibilities for disabled Canadians.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

signed a contract with Publics Works and Government Services 
Canada to protect Parliament Hill. Part of that contract was that the

might happen. It is fulfilling that commitment because protecting

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIESACT">FISHERIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-62, 
an act respecting fisheries, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Delta has 31 minutes 
remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-62 turns 
Canadian fisheries law on its ear. As I indicated before the break, 
all fisheries law in tidal waters in British Columbia has so far 
proceeded on the principle that Canadians are to have equal access 
to the commercial licences governing the fishery.
<P>
	Apart from a brief period during the war when Canadians of 
Japanese origin were denied this right it has prevailed without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6135"> 6135 </A></B>
<P>
question. The second exception is the recent incursion into public 
fishery affected by the AFS  but that was not provided for in the act 
and is probably ultra vires the act. It would not be ultra vires Bill 
C-62.
<P>
	Clause 17(2) is broadly worded. Fishing industries on both 
coasts which are based on security of fishing licences would be 
seriously destabilized by a whole new licensing regime. There is no 
restriction in clause 17(2) to existing licence holders. Existing 
licence holders in the fishery such as Pacific salmon or P.E.I. 
lobster could be completely bypassed by a new licensing regime 
pursuant to which new commercial harvesting licences are granted 
to others such as aboriginal organizations.
<P>
	Clause 17(4) is garbled in its present form. Is it a condition of 
every commercial salmon licence that measures set out in the 
fisheries management agreement relating to the salmon fishery be 
complied with? Surely that is not intended. The wording should 
make that clear.
<P>
	Clause 18(1) should provide that notice be given to all persons 
likely affected by the bill, so that all persons holding licences with 
respect to the fishery affected by the agreement are given notice.
<P>
	Clause 19(1), publication in any manner the minister sees fit is 
not in accordance with the policy regarding publication of statutory 
instruments. The exception set out in clause 22 is not justified on 
the basis that those affected by it are to be given notice by some 
other means.
<P>
	Clause 20 discloses the true purpose and intent of these 
agreements. They are in fact regulations but do not have all the 
safeguards, including prepublication, to which regulations are 
subject. Here we have a dispensing power which is something that 
was disallowed without express authority of Parliament by the Bill 
of Rights of 1689. It was disallowed then for the same reason that it 
should be disallowed now. It places too much power in the hands of 
the crown. The criminal law, of which all fisheries law is part, 
should be applied equally to all citizens. The crown should not be 
given power to dispense the law.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	The right of equal access to the fishery or the public's right to 
fish is an issue and a guarantee which goes back to the Magna 
Carta. The Magna Carta prohibited the taking of this public right to 
fish without the expressed authorization of Parliament.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1867 incorporates the English 
constitution into Canadian law. The Canadian courts, in a long 
series of cases, have based the public's right of access on the 
Magna Carta and the common law and have held that Parliament 
must expressly remove this right if it is to be a valid taking of the 
right. It cannot be done by the crown acting through cabinet, as was 
done with the native only commercial fishing regulations enacted 
in 1994.
<P>
	The taking of the public's right to fish must be done through a 
specific act of Parliament. I quote from the Attorney General of 
British Columbia <I>v.</I> the Attorney General of Canada in 1913. It 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been unquestioned law that since Magna Carta no new exclusive fishery 
could be created by Royal grant in tidal waters, and that no public right of fishing in 
such waters, then existing, can be taken away without competent legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That same term ``competent legislation'' was used by the 
Supreme Court in three decisions handed down this past August in 
which the justices noted that the public right to fish has existed 
since the Magna Carta and it can only be extinguished or taken 
away by competent legislation, in other words, by an act of 
Parliament. That has not happened.
<P>
	If the government intends to proceed with these management 
agreements, and we think that there is a real danger in doing so 
because those major policy changes should be made only with the 
expressed consent of Parliament, I would recommend a caution be 
put in place with an amendment. I would suggest that what we 
should have here is a clause 17(5) which would state: ``That with 
the exception of agreements pertaining to fishing for food, social 
and ceremonial purposes, pursuant to an aboriginal or treaty right, 
the class of persons or holders encompassed by an agreement shall 
not be determined on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion or sex''.
<P>
	It is worth noting that such wording conforms to section 15 of 
the charter. The point is that such agreements are now being made 
pursuant to the aboriginal fishing strategy and are having damaging 
consequences on the resource and on the industry. If an 
arrangement is to be established by law, Parliament should do it 
expressly so that the impacts are addressed and public input 
provided through the regulatory processes as required by the 
Statutory Instruments Act and by Treasury Board's federal 
regulatory review process.
<P>
	We must ensure that the broad powers given to the minister in 
this bill do not amount to undermining the authority of Parliament.
<P>
	The question must be asked again: Does Bill C-62 address the 
real problems of the fishery? There is a rule of statutory 
interpretation that states that any new statute or law is put by 
Parliament to remedy an outstanding problem, or in legal terms, to 
cure a mischief.
<P>
	We know what the bill does, but does it remedy the problems we 
all know exist in the fishery? This is the most important question 
that can be asked in today's debate. Rather than rush to a quick 
answer, let us examine the facts that are on public record very 
carefully.
<P>
	In the summer of 1994 the department's management of the 
Pacific salmon fishery was revealed to be in total chaos. The 
department's failures were not exposed by its  critics in the fishing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6136"> 6136 </A></B>
<P>
or environment community. The department's failures were 
exposed in its own reports by DFO employees frustrated by the 
failures they saw around them. One of those reports came to my 
attention and I in turn brought the report to the attention of the 
House.
<P>
	Let me remind members of some of the chaos identified by this 
DFO report. As we hear, let us ask if this new legislation will cure 
any of these problems. Steveston noted that the ability to manage 
the Fraser River aboriginal fishery has been seriously 
compromised. The report states that bands have not been able to 
abide by the terms of the AFS fishing agreement. It notes that the 
monitors at the landing sites are unable to properly count the fish as 
stipulated in the fishing agreement. This compromises the 
mandatory landing program agreement and creates inaccurate data. 
Does the new legislation cure any of these problems?
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In Fraser Valley East and Fraser Valley West noted reduced 
capabilities to maintain proper control and accountability of the 
fishery and a breakdown of effective management of the native 
fishery on the Fraser River.
<P>
	It notes that it was not possible to enforce the regulations 
pertaining to this fishery. The following issues were not addressed 
adequately: closure of the fisheries; mesh size restrictions; limited 
mandatory landing site enforcement; and early sets. There is very 
little effort directed toward enforcement of the terms and 
conditions of the fisheries. Figures gathered to date for catch in 
these fisheries should be given a very low confidence level.
<P>
	In Fraser Valley East and Fraser Valley West licences were being 
abused and in fact there was no catch monitoring enforcement done 
on this fishery by DFO officers.
<P>
	Bill C-62 will not address these problems.
<P>
	Summary comments in that DFO document state that issues that 
have received reduced coverage and in some cases no coverage at 
all include: monitoring and enforcement of ceremonial licences; 
illegal fishing and illegal sales activities; monitoring and 
enforcement of the mandatory landing program, and providing 
coverage to ensure the integrity of the program is maintained; 
licensing, participant and gear restrictions verification checks. It is 
impossible to effectively control this fishery.
<P>
	Does the new legislation address these rather fundamental 
problems identified by the department itself? The answer is a 
resounding no.
<P>
	After these and other reports publicly exposed the department's 
mismanagement, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans went to 
Vancouver to meet with his own staff. Here is what they told him:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The only thing conserving and protecting the fisheries is the Fisheries Act. If the 
act is not enforced, there will not be any more fish put on the spawning grounds than 
what is being put there now.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is becoming obvious in this region that information on critical conservation and 
protection issues are not being received at the highest levels of the department-it 
seems as though the only issues that are dealt with are those that are politically 
sensitive and receive much media attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most major undercover investigations being conducted into illegal fishing and 
illegal sales have come to an abrupt end.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Complete habitat investigations and large scale poaching investigations are not 
being done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These revelations led to a major review of the department's 
management of the fishery in 1994. It was conducted by a former 
Speaker of this House, a British Columbian of whom we are 
immensely proud. I would like to quote some of Mr. Fraser's 
comments.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Mr. Fraser noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That message is simple: if something like the 1994 situation happens again, the 
door to disaster will be wide open. According to what the board found, one more 
12-hour opening could have virtually eliminated the late run of sockeye in the 
Adams River. Such an occurrence would have devastating consequences for the 
Pacific fishery, delaying stock rebuilding efforts by years and bringing dire 
economic consequences to the province. The board believes that the solution to this 
problem lies in fixing the system. Unless all parties work together and manage much 
more competently, the tragedy that befell the Atlantic cod fishery will repeat itself on 
the west coast.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What brought us so close to disaster's door? The scenario has its roots in the 
1992-93 DFO Pacific region reorganization. Cutbacks and budget reductions were 
made to the extent that the department was left in charge without the clear lines of 
accountability or necessary tools to enforce its regulations with any credibility. In the 
midst of this confusion, the aboriginal fisheries strategy was beginning to take hold 
and the early evidence suggests that it too was not working as intended. Once again, 
there was confusion as to who was in charge, obviating effective enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Fraser notes that the board makes a number of 
recommendations for improving the system in the area of 
management. We urge DFO to exercise its constitutional 
conservation responsibilities and not abrogate its stewardship of 
resources under federal jurisdiction, something which this act will 
allow for.
<P>
	At page 63 Mr. Fraser notes: ``But to allow commercial sales in 
other areas now would simply add to the opportunity to poach like 
current pilot sales have done''. He confirms as well that these pilot 
projects proceeded as a matter of policy but without any judicial 
authority. Mr. Fraser recognized that these fisheries were taking 
place without proper legislative authority.
<P>
	On page 64 he says: ``There is no question that the introduction 
of pilot sales under the AFS cause many problems and great 
consternation among stakeholders''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6137"> 6137 </A></B>
<P>
	On page 65 he notes: ``Several persons appearing before us 
pointed out there were no problems of missing fish before these 
programs were implemented''. He suggested that the solution was 
to abolish the pilot sales.
<P>
	On page 66 he states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mindful of the Sparrow decision, DFO must negotiate with First Nations on the 
basis of mutual respect, always considering traditional native rights and customs. 
Consultation and co-operation among First Nations should be facilitated through the 
watershed process and in other ways. However, DFO has no right to transfer 
Canada's constitutional responsibilities to protect the resource to anyone, native or 
otherwise. This responsibility must be retained always by the Government of 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government committed to accepting all of Mr. Fraser's 
recommendations. There were no exceptions; it committed to 
accepting all of them. Let us look at the government's record in 
living up to its commitment to abide by Mr. Fraser's 
recommendations.
<P>
	I refer now to a DFO document which was a response to the 
Fraser River Sockeye Public Review Board. It was a critique by the 
department on whether or not it actually lived up to the 
requirements of Mr. Fraser.
<P>
	The first recommendation of Mr. Fraser was: ``We recommend 
that DFO retain and exercise its constitutional responsibilities and 
not in any abrogate its stewardship of resources under federal 
jurisdiction. Conservation must be the primary objective of both 
fisheries managers and all others participating in the fishery. The 
conservation ethic must prevail throughout and be adhered to by 
all''.
<P>
	The reported noted: ``Retaining and not abrogating: DFO 
officials do not believe they have in any way abrogated their 
responsibilities, but recognize there is a perception of this 
particularly in commercial and recreational fisheries. DFO did not 
directly respond to this part of the recommendation or the 
perceptions or concerns that underlie it''. Mr. Fraser's first 
recommendation in my view was probably the most important and 
DFO just ignored it.
<P>
	On the notion that conservation be a primary objective: ``Again, 
from DFO's point of view, this is a problem of perception, not 
substance''. I will deal more with that problem later. In fact, I dealt 
with it earlier when I referred to the number of runs of sockeye 
salmon which have been extinguished in this century.
<P>
	The report with comment on Mr. Fraser's recommendation noted 
that DFO did not achieve its escapement targets for Fraser sockeye 
in 1995. It notes that there can be no conservation of Fraser River 
sockeye salmon in the long run without equivalent care and 
protection for the habitat on which fish stocks rely. In this light, the 
pending expiration of key programs as the Fraser River action plan 
and the funding base that has supported it in recent years is of 
utmost concern.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Again, the government's response to these conservation 
concerns is not to do something about them but to turn 
responsibility for conservation over to the very people who are the 
root of the problem, that being the provincial governments. The 
provincial governments are responsible for urban development. 
The provincial governments are responsible for roadways which 
damage the fisheries habitat. They are responsible for poor forestry 
practices which again damage fish habitat. The government's 
response is to turn the responsibility for conservation over to the 
provincial governments.
<P>
	The second recommendation of Mr. Fraser was: ``We 
recommend that DFO take immediate steps to initiate a process of 
planning for the future of the fishery, addressing all critical 
problems affecting conservation and sustainability through an 
ongoing consultative forum. Among the problems to be considered 
would be overcapitalization, user group allocation and ensuring 
equitable treatment under law''.
<P>
	DFO's own people in reviewing their progress in addressing the 
recommendations of Mr. Fraser noted: ``To date, DFO has not 
established a broad multi-stakeholder consultative process to plan 
for the future and address critical problems affecting conservation 
and sustainability. DFO has not identified the responsibilities and 
composition it should have nor its relationship to existing 
processes''.
<P>
	Recommendation number three: ``We recommend that DFO and 
the Pacific Salmon Commission adopt a risk aversion management 
strategy because of the great uncertainty on stock estimates, 
in-season catch estimates and environmental problems. 
Conservation goals must be achieved before any other priorities are 
addressed''.
<P>
	The government's own people note that a risk aversion strategy 
has not yet been developed. They say: ``We found in our evaluation 
that DFO's actions were not the result of an explicit, well-defined 
risk averse management strategy but rather were a response to the 
unprecedented events of the 1995 fishery''. They note that DFO's 
actions ``were not based on a well-defined risk averse management 
strategy''. They state: ``The question of how DFO defines risk 
averse and how risk averse is expected to promote conservation 
must be addressed. Without this clarity, there is no way to test if 
DFO's activities are in fact guided by well-conceived and 
well-defined strategy or whether their activities in themselves 
define what DFO means by risk averse''.
<P>
	That statement is critical. It clearly demonstrates to the public 
and to any reader just how clear it is that the department is not 
operating from a clear set of principles, but rather making it up as it 
goes along.
<P>
	Recommendation number four: ``We recommend that DFO in 
conjunction with provincial authorities, First Nations, commercial 
and recreational fishery  groups, implements, both in marine and 
in-river areas, a revised system to ensure that catch information is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6138"> 6138 </A></B>
<P>
timely and reliable given that accurate counting and timely 
reporting of catch are fundamental to conservation. The system 
must also include a more stringent paper trail wherein there must 
be stricter control of landing and sales slips and a mandatory 
retention of sales slips with fish through to retail sale or export''.
<P>
	The government's own report notes: ``It is not clear to what 
extent measures taken by DFO provide more reliable and timely 
information and how much closer it brought DFO to the realization 
of its data collection goals. The mandatory hail data still suffer 
from reliability concerns. And while the landings and fish tracking 
plan will improve the reliability, it will not address timeliness. 
Overall, a fundamental problem is that DFO has not defined what 
information it needs or more to the point, how much it is willing to 
invest or demand others invest to get that information''. Again, this 
act does not address this concern. It is not addressing the real issues 
facing the fishery at this time.
<P>
	Recommendation number five from Mr. Fraser: ``We 
recommend that DFO explore the application of new technology to 
collect information on stock levels and ocean areas in order to 
supplement catch statistics''.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	It says again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As with measures taken in response to recommendation 4, it is not clear whether 
and to what extent these measures have brought DFO closer to the achievement of its 
data collection goals. The problem is that these goals are not well-defined.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That leads us to the difficulties. The department in this bill has 
not clearly defined the difficulties which it faces.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-62 gives sweeping powers to the minister 
to manage the fishery through ministerial orders, to enter into 
private fishery agreements and to transfer authority vested in the 
federal government by the Constitution to the provinces. This bill 
should be quietly withdrawn, pulled off the parliamentary agenda 
in the dark of night. Then, in the light of day, in full view of all 
Canadians, discussion should begin to establish the principles on 
which our fisheries resource will be managed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-62, the new 
fisheries law, will substantially modernize and rationalize the legal 
basis for fisheries conservation and habitat management in Canada. 
It is the first major rewrite of the fisheries act since the last century, 
since the original law of 1868 in fact, and it will provide the basis 
for a sustainable fishery for the 21st century.
<P>
	This rewrite is long overdue. Fishery as an industry and as a 
profession for the fisher people is changing. Markets are changing. 
Technology is changing. The science of fishery is changing. The 
law, in turn, must  respond to these dramatic changes in our society 
if it is not to become an unnecessary clog in our economic growth 
and our community well-being.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the House passed the Canada Oceans Act. This 
bill is complementary to the Canada Oceans Act which stakes out 
Canada's clear legal jurisdiction over its ocean areas.
<P>
	With the revised fisheries act we are putting in place the 
legislative machinery and processes needed to ensure that the 
fishery resources of our oceans' heritage will be used responsibly. 
We are moving to ensure that those resources are conserved, not 
only for the present but also for future generations. We are moving 
to ensure that people who work in the fishery can earn a decent 
livelihood.
<P>
	This legislation is in keeping with the best principles of law 
reform. Its revisions are easy to read. It consolidates provisions for 
which consolidation is long overdue. It makes possible a reduction 
of up to 50 per cent in existing regulations.
<P>
	Let us now examine the new fisheries bill in overview. Bill C-62 
will allow for a direct voice for industry in fisheries management 
through partnering agreements.
<P>
	It will allow for a fairer system of administrative sanctions that 
would replace many of the criminal proceedings now used for 
infractions.
<P>
	It will allow for an order power to set fishery close times and 
catch size and weight limits, all these for use by federal, provincial 
and territorial managers.
<P>
	It will allow for the integration of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act with the Fisheries Act. This will create a single 
legislative framework for all fishing in coastal and adjacent waters.
<P>
	It will also allow for a significant and long overdue streamlining 
of regulations, with a reduction in volume by as much as 50 per 
cent.
<P>
	The emphasis in the new fisheries bill is on self-regulation and 
self-reliance. It sets a climate for long term stability in the industry. 
For too long Canada's fishery has been plagued by what we may 
call a gold rush mentality. Self-regulation, self-reliance and long 
term stability will help eliminate this capricious and ultimately 
self-destroying attitude. The revised fisheries act will go a long 
way to ensuring that the fishery of the future will be 
environmentally sustainable and economically viable.
<P>
	There are several other important legislative changes proposed 
in Bill C-62 as we seek to adjust to the needs of a rapidly evolving 
industry.
<P>
	The legislative base of fisheries and oceans will be streamlined 
by repealing statutes which have outlived their usefulness and by 
integrating provisions from those into the fisheries act. The 
Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act, the Fisheries Development 
Act and the North Pacific Fur Seals Convention Act are being  
repealed. The few industry support and development powers from 
the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act and the Fisheries 
Develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6139"> 6139 </A></B>
<P>
ment Act that may still be needed are being incorporated into the 
fisheries act.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Archaic provisions in the fisheries and oceans legislation are 
being eliminated. Much of that legislation has existed in one form 
or another since the time of Queen Victoria. It is no longer 
required. The great queen is long since gone and archaic provisions 
continued too reverentially from the historical epoch now passed 
should be replaced where they are no longer serving a useful 
purpose. For example, many fishing seasons have passed since we 
have needed the rules governing cutting wood and drying fish on 
vacant public lots.
<P>
	Bill C-62 also provides a legal framework for delegating certain 
habitat management responsibilities to the provinces. To ensure a 
consistent national standard for habitat protection, provinces will 
be expected to comply with certain standards of habitat 
management as set out in negotiated agreements. However, there 
should be no misunderstanding about this. The Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans continues to retain full legal responsibility 
for the conservation and protection of the resource.
<P>
	The delegation to provinces of certain freshwater habitat 
responsibilities is a major change from the version of the bill that 
was tabled in 1995 and it responds to the government's 
commitment in the 1996 speech from the throne.
<P>
	The bill will not in itself transfer habitat responsibilities to 
provincial governments. It allows the federal government to 
negotiate on the delegation of responsibilities with interested 
provincial governments. All parties concerned would be consulted 
during these negotiations. The bill will enable the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to delegate responsibility to provinces, to 
authorize certain types of projects and to exercise day to day 
management powers on provincial lands.
<P>
	To recapitulate, this delegation of responsibility would eliminate 
an existing overlap between federal and provincial processes and 
also correspond with changes taking place in other areas of 
governmental activity. The federal government will maintain its 
full constitutional legal authority for prescribed projects.
<P>
	Provinces would have a variety of powers, including the ability 
to require the installation of fish guards, fishways and other 
apparatus designed to protect fish, to require the removal of 
obstructions to fish passage, to provide authorization of certain 
projects of local concern. Regulations will set out a list of projects 
that are to remain within the realm of the federal government. 
Consultations with stakeholders will also take place to determine 
those classes of projects requiring permits. The mandatory permit 
provisions will replace subsection  35(2) authorizations as a trigger 
for the federal environmental assessment process under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	At the present time, the provisions of the fisheries act dealing 
with physical alteration of fish habitat and pollution prevention are 
scattered throughout the act. The amendments will group these 
provisions together for ease of use. Once again we will be making 
the machinery simpler to operate.
<P>
	I should also point out what is not changing in the act. First is 
pollution prevention. An important management tool currently 
found in section 36 is the prohibition against unauthorized deposits 
of deleterious substances. It is not being changed. Along with this, 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may request that ongoing 
monitoring take place to ensure that where deposits are authorized, 
they are carried out in accordance with the authorizations. These 
provisions, administered by the Department of the Environment, 
will not be changed in any substantive way.
<P>
	Second is plans and specifications. The ability of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to require plans and specifications for 
physical alteration or deposits of deleterious substances will be 
retained. Provincial ministers will have the ability to require plans 
and specifications where there has been delegation. The ability of 
the minister of fisheries to halt projects with governor in council 
approval will remain.
<P>
	Third is flows. Also remaining will be the ability of the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, or a provincial minister where there has 
been a delegation, to require flows of water over and through 
obstructions, such as dams, to provide for the free movement of 
fish up and down stream, and for the mitigation of effects on fish 
habitat.
<P>
	Finally, a word on penalties. Since the penalties for habitat 
offences were updated and substantially increased, there is no 
necessity to amend them at this time.
<P>
	Let us now turn to partnering agreements. New powers in the bill 
allow the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to share responsibility, 
decision making and management costs with groups within the 
fishery through long term partnering agreements. Shared 
responsibility creates obligations for both parties, the stakeholder 
and the minister. We emphasize once again that the minister 
maintains ultimate legal responsibility for the conservation and 
protection of the resource.
<P>
	Here are some of the specific matters on which fisheries and 
oceans and any representative organization would be able to enter 
into a management contract: harvest limits and other conservation 
and management measures; the number of licences; fees payable 
for licence issuance and administration; obligations and 
responsibilities of each party; funding arrangements with respect to 
management of the fishery; conservation and management 
programs for the fishery.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6140"> 6140 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	To reiterate, under partnering agreements the responsibility and 
legal authority for conservation protection of the resource remains 
with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. It is both co-operative 
federalism, federal-provincial as law in action but it is also the new 
pluralism: government and stakeholders in community decision 
making. The minister will also continue to establish intersection 
and interregion allocations.
<P>
	In future, fisheries and oceans should be better able to 
concentrate on its core responsibilities relating to setting policy for 
fishers and conservation protection of the resource.
<P>
	In this bill we are recognizing that the industry is capable of 
managing many machinery aspects of the fishery. The Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans is committed to developing integrated 
management plans. Stakeholders will be encouraged to assess 
whether the partnering arrangements meet their specific needs.
<P>
	On the new licence and appeal system I stress only that in the 
new system, the new tribunals are independent, at arm's length 
from the government. It is a new approach to sanctions.
<P>
	The Oceans Act established our international law power under 
international law in the areas we have pioneered over the oceans 
and elsewhere. The fisheries act, apart from its tremendous work of 
codification, rationalization and modernization, provides the legal 
machinery and processes for vindication and enforcement of those 
international law rights in Canadian internal municipal law.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> At the beginning you were not asked if you were 
going to split your time but I have a note here that you are going to 
share your time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, and I apologize for 
neglecting to advise you.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank you for the direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would have 
liked the parliamentary secretary to speak a bit longer because I 
have the feeling that we both could use more than five minutes to 
debate this issue. Anyhow, I will try to get to the point with my 
question, to limit myself to only one thing.
<P>
	In his speech, the parliamentary secretary mentioned fisheries 
management agreements. I spoke before the parliamentary 
secretary and I said that the minister's arguments were flawed with 
regard to the wording of subclause 17(1).
<P>
	I do not know if the parliamentary secretary agrees with the 
minister, but for my part, I have some experience with management 
agreements called partnership agreements; partnership means 
transparency, you must know who your partners are and let them 
know what is up your sleeve.
<P>
	I will give you as an example the crab fishermen in zone 12 of 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, who had negotiated such an agreement 
with Fisheries and Oceans in February. This agreement was broken 
because the minister used his discretionary power to allow new 
players in. I have nothing against the arrival of new players per se, 
but nothing in the act provides for their arrival.
<P>
	What annoys me is that it says ``in the opinion of the Minister''; 
letting in new players is within his discretionary power, it is not 
information known to fishermen. The member opposite is also a 
distinguished lawyer and he must know that to make a partnership 
work, partners must share information.
<P>
	In view of what I have said and given the example I described, 
could the parliamentary secretary tell me whether he agrees with 
the opposition that there are flaws in the bill as it stands now and 
whether he will support the opposition to remedy them? If he 
cannot see them now, he still has the whole second reading and 
report stage to become aware of them.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney: </B>Mr. Speaker, I must thank the member for his 
very interesting and well-researched question. We are now talking 
about a new phase in the development of our domestic 
constitutional law, since formal amendments to the Constitution 
are so difficult.
<P>
	I just spoke about the aspect of new pluralism of our system of 
government, that is, the system of partnership involves very close 
co-operation between different levels of government, between the 
federal government and the citizens in the present case, but it could 
also be between the federal government and provincial 
governments.
<P>
	During my speech, I said a few times that the constitutional 
responsibility lies with the federal minister. However, the spirit of 
co-operation would indicate that the essential element is very close 
co-operation between the two levels and this is exactly what we are 
implementing in the negotiations with the British Columbia 
government.
<P>
	We will examine specific cases when we get to the detailed study 
of the bill but, for now, I agree with the minister on this point. We 
accept this movement, this new pluralism, and we are trying to do 
our best within this partnership with the industry and the 
fishermen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last summer the 
Supreme Court acknowledged that since the time of the Magna 
Carta there has existed a public right to fish. To date the commer-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6141"> 6141 </A></B>
<P>
cial sales portion of the aboriginal fishing strategy has operated 
outside the law.
<P>
	This Bill C-62 will give the minister the right to discard 800 
years of common law and allow for these private fisheries and do it 
without proper debate.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to address that issue, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to return to the 
question of the Magna Carta, of which our distinguished colleague 
opposite has spoken several times.
<P>
	One of the problems is that people quote documents but do not 
read them in the original. This is not the hon. member's fault alone. 
It is sometimes affects judges too. One of the problems of the 
Magna Carta is that there is no single version of it and no single 
language. The original Latin has been translated into Norman 
French and from Norman French into English. However, when the 
Magna Carta is read it does not really support the principle he is 
referring to. I would suggest he go back to the direct sources. It is 
the only source of wisdom.
<P>
	Let us come back to this issue as far as aboriginal fishing rights 
are concerned. This is to misunderstand the nature of this measure. 
As I said at the outset, the oceans act and the fisheries act in 
combination take Canada into the 21st century because they 
establish, in addition to the act of codification, rationalization and 
modernization, the juridical base in Canadian municipal internal 
law with the international law rights that Canadian diplomats and 
Canadian foreign ministers over the years have led. That is the 
triumph of these bills.
<P>
	The hon. member should not worry about the petit point needle 
work at the expense of seeing the large design and the large step 
into the 21st century that this project of the law represents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today and speak to a timely piece 
of legislation, Bill C-62, an act respecting fisheries.
<P>
	I would like to deal particularly with the habitat provisions of 
these amendments to the Fisheries Act and to highlight their role in 
the renewal of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	The federal government currently has constitutional 
responsibility for both marine and freshwater fisheries. It is also 
directly involved in the management of freshwater fisheries only in 
Atlantic Canada, Northwest and Yukon Territories and rivers in 
British Columbia that are home to spawning salmon.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Day to day management of freshwater fisheries has been 
delegated to the prairie provinces, Ontario, Quebec and to British 
Columbia for non-salmon waters through regulation and general 
fisheries agreements. These  provinces play a significant role in 
managing fish habitat usually without formal agreements with the 
federal government. The exception of course is Ontario with which 
we have a memorandum of intent on fish habitat.
<P>
	Federal habitat responsibilities are set out in the Fisheries ACT. 
In this respect the objective of the act is a net gain in productive 
fish habitat. To meet this objective three goals are pursued: 
conservation of existing fish habitat, restoration of previously 
degraded fish habitat and development of a new habitat.
<P>
	Under the conservation goal the department tries to ensure that 
adverse impacts on fish habitat are avoided by assessing projects 
before they are built. These assessments can require the relocation 
or redesign of projects to prevent damage. The Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans strives to ensure that unavoidable loss of fish 
habitat is balanced by habitat replacement on a project by project 
basis.
<P>
	Currently inland provinces manage fish habitat with minimal 
federal involvement and often without clear direction or 
accountability. This can result in several problems.
<P>
	One is a lack of formal agreements with the province over which 
projects should or should not require review by the department. For 
example, one province may refer a small project to the department 
for review, while a neighbouring province may not refer a major 
project with potentially significant impacts on habitat. This leads to 
inconsistent levels of fish habitat and an inconsistent protection of 
fish habitat across the country.
<P>
	Another problem arises from the discretionary nature of some of 
the habitat provisions, notably section 35 of the current Fisheries 
Act which prohibits the harmful alteration, disruption or 
destruction of fish habitat unless authorized by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	To avoid contravening the Fisheries Act, an authorization is 
required only where a project will result in harmful effects to the 
habitat. Therefore an offence can occur only when harmful 
alternation of habitat occurs without authorization.
<P>
	This is the way we have been operating up to the present time 
and it is impossible to supervise. In addressing some of the 
concerns that have been raised by the opposition, the way we are 
operating now, it is impossible to supervise every single thing that 
goes on in these coastal waters that are covered by the Fisheries 
Act.
<P>
	For example, when the Department of the Environment is to look 
at such things as ocean dumping on the west coast we have tens of 
thousands of miles of coastline on that rugged coast, as well the 
islands and all the northern region. I am talking about the Arctic 
Ocean region with the islands.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6142"> 6142 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet the Department of the Environment has only a handful of 
people to inspect each project and all dumping that takes place 
in the ocean. Something has to change.
<P>
	Better habitat protection will result if measures to protect habitat 
were included in project plans and specifications in advance rather 
than through enforcement after damage to habitat has occurred.
<P>
	Some of our opposition is questioning whether that is possible. 
As an example, I was fortunate enough to be in Nanaimo, British 
Columbia at a time when there was a very important meeting 
taking place. Attending that meeting were project supervisors, 
representatives from the federal and provincial levels and the 
ministries of environment, outside objective consultants who are 
experts in environmental affairs, a project engineer from the 
municipality. Here was a partnership sitting around the table and 
discussing the environmental impact on a golf course that that 
community was planning to build. All the concerns of an 
environmental nature were being addressed in advance.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	These people co-operatively, in partnership, came to the 
conclusion that certain major changes had to take place in the 
major plans that were being presented by the company that wanted 
to build a golf course right on the edge of a habitat for a very 
important fish species. To me, that is a democratic model. That is 
what we are pushing in this bill.
<P>
	It is certainly preferable to prevent damage rather than repair it. 
That is what this bill intends. The provinces manage habitat on a 
day to day basis while the federal government retains decision 
making authority. This could create uncertainty over which level of 
government should be doing what.
<P>
	Delegation agreements with the provinces under this bill, by 
clarifying roles and setting out clear responsibility, will reduce this 
uncertainty by improving habitat management and making it more 
consistent across the country.
<P>
	The new fisheries act would enable us to delegate to the 
provinces the responsibility to make all decisions for certain types 
of projects under a number of provisions of the fisheries act.
<P>
	I am aware that some environmental groups are concerned that 
delegation would weaken habitat protection and lead to a 
patchwork quilt of habitat management across the country. I want 
to assure them that the federal government will not delegate to 
provinces that are not capable or willing to effectively meet 
national habitat protection standards. The provinces will be 
required to show that they are meeting these standards through 
appropriate accountability which could include reports to the 
federal government and through periodical federal audits of their 
performance.
<P>
	Agreements could be for a fixed period of time or before the 
agreement could be renewed there could be a review to determine if 
the requirements of the fisheries act had been met.
<P>
	The question of habitat management standards is not on the 
table. National standards will be maintained. However, we are 
flexible about the specific arrangements that would be made with 
the provinces. We are currently discussing the extent and scope of 
delegation with the provinces, industry and environmental groups. 
A major workshop will be held this fall to examine the best 
approach to take in determining what type of projects or activities 
should remain under federal authority.
<P>
	In summary, habitat delegation will contribute to a more 
effective federation by placing in the hands of each level of 
government those responsibilities they are best able to carry out. 
This will end uncertainty over who should be doing what. The 
results will be more effective decision making that will not delay 
development project unnecessarily and will simultaneously yield 
better habitat management.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that I intend to support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe 
my ears. I have run into the previous speaker before in committee, 
but his comments make me feel like I am on a different planet. I 
will try to explain why.
<P>
	He went on and on about his fears regarding habitat protection, 
how the provinces would not be equal to the task. Unless something 
got lost in translation, but that is clearly what he meant.
<P>
	He feared that the federal government might delegate some 
rights to the provinces, thereby undermining federal control over 
habitat conservation. I want to reassure him. Clause 9 in part I of 
the bill-which I find irritating-provides that the delegation of 
powers only applies to licences and related rights, that is to say, the 
money that may go with this.
<P>
	What intrigues me the most-and makes me feel like I am on 
another planet-is the source of the new rights the minister gives 
himself in part II on habitat conservation. They are encroaching on 
the jurisdiction of the provinces, especially Quebec, which owns all 
the water resources and hydroelectric dams within its borders. 
People can figure it out for themselves. Is this his way of 
compromising our entire economic development?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This is not the worst bill of the century, but an attack against the 
provinces.
<P>
	Can the hon. member admit that the provinces have done a good 
job in the past 100 years; that the federal government is interfering 
in an area of provincial jurisdiction; that the provinces have done a 
good job of preserving habitats; and that, if it wanted to make the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6143"> 6143 </A></B>
<P>
new fisheries act fully consistent, the federal government should 
delegate more powers in this area and amend part II as it now 
stands?
<P>
	All he has to do is compare the current version of part II with 
what was in the old law to see there is a huge difference. This is a 
major case of federal interference in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, and they dare tell us that they will seek our agreement, 
that they will work in partnership with us. This is off to a very bad 
start, and second reading is on the principle, and I do not hold out 
much hope for principles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really do not understand where 
the member is coming from. Nowhere in my presentation did I 
make any statement to support what he has just finished stating.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Quebec realizes just as well as I do that, 
as far as fresh water controls are concerned and jurisdiction, it is in 
the hands of the province. His province has been doing an 
admirable job, as have a great number of other provinces, regarding 
fish habitat within those fresh water bodies. That is what I was 
referring to.
<P>
	Most of my speech addressed fish habitats outside the fresh 
water boundaries, in other words those in the salt water. That is 
what I was directing most of my presentation toward.
<P>
	The partnership will exist. There is no doubt about it. In my 
presentation I clearly point out that most responsibilities will be 
handed over to the provinces. There will be a conference this 
coming fall where more clearly defined responsibilities will 
emerge. There is no doubt about it.
<P>
	Responsibilities that lie in the hands of the Quebec government 
will not probably be identical to those that would lie in the hands of 
British Columbia or some other province simply because of so 
many differences, so many other factors that have to come into the 
picture.
<P>
	It is practically impossible to come up with a standard formula 
or a standard set of rules and regulations for each and every 
province. The member knows that and I know that.
<P>
	As more discoveries are made, new information and new 
knowledge emerges on the scene as time goes on. His province, 
with its sense of responsibility, will do the best it can to take that 
knowledge, information and technology and introduce it into the 
environment or situation to be sure that the fresh water habitat, as 
well as the salt water habitat, are protected and maintain a certain 
level of productivity that would be beneficial to the people of 
Quebec just as it would be in every other area of this country.
<P>
	We hope for that, we pray for that and we have to ask the 
member to guarantee that.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I participate in this debate today on Bill C-62, the 
fisheries bill.
<P>
	This bill, which died on the Order Paper in the last Parliament as 
Bill C-115, is back before this House. It proposes an integrated 
approach to fisheries management in Canadian waters and adjacent 
waters. It is the end result of a process to simplify and modernize 
the fisheries legislation. The words simplify and modernize I just 
used were certainly not intended to be taken in a positive way.
<P>
	While these words generally have a positive sense, we do not 
consider them as such and we will not therefore support this bill put 
forward by the Liberal government. The fact is that there are 
serious flaws in the four parts of Bill C-62, which my colleagues 
and myself will address in greater detail in our remarks.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	True to their ways and their vision of Canada, always trying to 
further centralize power and acting unilaterally, the federal 
Liberals are once again breaking their promise to decentralize and 
allow the provinces to play a more prominent role.
<P>
	Last Wednesday, I watched on the Ottawa station of the CBC, as 
Quebec's favourite minister, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, who is also a favourite of cartoonists, was boasting away as 
usual about this great federation whose leaders are so committed to 
carrying this whole decentralization effort through. This is all 
rhetoric coming from the Liberals and their school bag packing 
minister. Those who carry a school bag have to do their homework, 
otherwise they fail. With their Bill C-62, they are flunking the test, 
they are not swimming, they are sinking, which brings us back to 
the fish.
<P>
	The people opposite will not have it any other way, because 
decentralizing and giving more prominence to the provinces is not 
consistent with federalism, with the very basis of federalism.
<P>
	The federal government is certainly not prepared to commit 
hara-kiri. That is why they are all words and no action. It is 
becoming a real joke when the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs uses all the words in his vocabulary, always the same few 
words, to try to persuade us that Canada works.
<P>
	This bill is part of the farce being played out by the ministers and 
their great leader, who only swears by the red book and whose 
promises have gone up in smoke. The first part of the bill clearly 
shows that the regime for the protection and management of 
fisheries undermines the best interests of the fisheries and the 
workers whose livelihood depends on this industry. This part of the 
bill provides for the conservation and management of fisheries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6144"> 6144 </A></B>
<P>
	The various elements of this part of the bill raise a lot of 
questions. The minister should have looked at what is happening 
in this industry in Quebec and the rest of Canada. That would have 
been the logical thing to do. However, the minister chooses to put 
the cart before the horse by first setting the terms of future 
fisheries management agreements, as is provided for in clause 17.
<P>
	Some crucial elements for a relevant and appropriate review of 
the issue have been left out. These crucial elements deal with the 
core of the fisher people that needs to be defined and the 
appropriate fishing guidelines to be applied in the future.
<P>
	The depletion of the fish stock both in the Atlantic, where 
ground fish are being threatened, and on the west coast has led to a 
moratorium on fishing in the Atlantic and forces us to stop and 
think about the difficulties the fishing industry is facing from sea to 
sea. We have to sit down with all the stakeholders and get their 
input to see what the future holds for the industry.
<P>
	This bill ignores several important and even crucial questions for 
the fishing industry and those who depend on it. The people the 
minister had indeed consulted with are complaining because they 
believe nobody listened to them. What good does it do to consult 
the people if you do not listen to them? But we must recognize that 
members opposite are past masters in the art of fake consultations. 
For almost three years now, they have been having more and more 
of them in all fields.
<P>
	They use these consultations as a democratic screen. In fact, it is 
the finance minister who started this new fad of fake consultations. 
You will remember the finance minister getting off a plane and 
running, hair flying, to consult on his first budget. Liberals suffer 
from a ``chronic fake consultation syndrome''. They consult to 
look good while their plans are already drawn and their decisions 
are already made.
<P>
	Ministers keep all powers at the expense of all concerned. The 
whole population of Canada even saw how the Liberal leaders 
acted this way, a couple of weeks ago, at their last national 
convention. A fine democracy where the die is already cast. This 
bill is no exception to the Liberal smokescreen strategy.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, clause 17 really gives the Minister of Fisheries unlimited 
powers, which will make him the sole master of the fishing 
industry. He will be able to sign fisheries management agreements 
with any association that, in his opinion-and I repeat-in his 
opinion, represents a class of licensees or people.
<P>
	These agreements can determine the maximum catches, the 
number of licenses, the rights that can be levied by Her Majesty, 
the obligations, responsibilities and funding measures concerning 
fisheries management and the applicable conservation and 
management programs. The minister can even establish guidelines 
for  the tribunal on decisions to take in case of a severe violation.
<P>
	With clause 17, the minister gives himself all the powers and, 
unfortunately, this is not necessarily in the interest of those 
primarily concerned, since the minister can make almost any 
decision without any consideration for them.
<P>
	If the minister makes a bad decision in terms of resource 
allocation as a direct result of a lack of consultation or findings on 
the fisheries situation, he can always change his mind under clause 
21. This does not seem very serious and shows a patent lack of will 
to provide a really adequate mechanism to ensure an efficient 
fisheries management, which would reflect reality and which all 
concerned would take part in and be satisfied with.
<P>
	Given such a lack of vision for the future of fishing, we have 
every reason to be worried and we should vigorously criticize the 
minister and the federal government for their ineffectiveness. The 
future of fishermen and fisheries is once again threatened. The 
federal government does not do anything in this bill to rectify the 
situation and to reassure fishermen and all the people who rely on 
this industry. The future is becoming more and more gloomy.
<P>
	Because of the troubling situation, this unacceptable bill and the 
vital importance of this issue, we are demanding that powers for 
fisheries management be transferred back to Quebec. Why should 
we trust the federal government in this area any more, when it has 
not done a good job of managing it and has nothing good to propose 
for the future?
<P>
	Even though Captain Canada, who has moved on and is now 
threatening to pull the plug on the Churchill Falls contract, went to 
New York with his nets and his fish, we must not be taken for fools 
with regard to the content of this bill, its impact and the fact that it 
does not even offer a glimpse of hope for the future of the fishing 
industry.
<P>
	I will now turn to part II of the bill, entitled ``Fish Habitat 
Conservation and Protection, and Pollution Prevention'', which is 
of particular interest to me. It is amazing to see the impact of this 
bill in terms of duplication and overlap not only with the provinces, 
including Quebec, but also with other federal statutes.
<P>
	I am thinking about the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the bill that the 
environment minister tabled a few days ago about endangered 
species, among others. All this is getting very complicated.
<P>
	Part II of Bill C-62 includes clauses 42 to 64. It allows the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans or another minister designated by 
the governor in council to take action with regard to the removal of 
obstructions impeding the free passage of fish or detrimental to fish 
habitat, the construction of fish-ways or canals and the control of  
activities or undertakings which are likely to result in the alteration 
or the destruction of fish habitat or in the deposit of a deleterious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6145"> 6145 </A></B>
<P>
substance in waters frequented by fish or in any place where that 
deleterious substance may enter any such waters.
<P>
	So that part of the bill concerns all the water environment and, 
indirectly, the atmospheric and land environment as well, where 
deleterious substances may enter a stream and alter it.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The powers given under the bill to combat or prevent the various 
forms of pollution are considerable: authorizations, permits, 
notices, reports, plans and specifications, inspections, fines, orders 
to close, emergency interventions, and so on.
<P>
	These powers are not entirely new. They are already found in the 
existing Fisheries Act, but they are given greater prominence 
through various titles and groupings. The bill also provides for 
more extensive powers to intervene to protect fish habitat. This part 
of the bill creates a major problem, because it gives the federal 
minister powers that are identical or similar to those available to 
the Quebec Minister of the Environment and Fauna under the 
Environment Quality Act and the Act respecting the Conservation 
and Development of Wildlife.
<P>
	For these reasons, part II of the bill can be considered a major 
irritant in relations between the federal government and Quebec, 
just like other federal legislation, including the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act or the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.
<P>
	The interference of the federal government in areas already 
occupied by Quebec once again duplicates legislation, adds to the 
number of public servants, and increases the constraints on 
businesses and individuals, all of which lead to inflated costs and 
an ineffective system. Where is the minister, with his school bag in 
hand, to tell the fisheries minister that the purpose of Bill C-62 is 
not to achieve efficiency and the grand designs of decentralization?
<P>
	There is no sign of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in 
this debate. He would rather spout nonsense on various stages and 
mouth pious wishes in connection with our supposedly great and 
efficient federation. But the bill we see before us, which is almost 
the complete agenda of the federal government, does not pass the 
test. The Liberals say one thing and do another.
<P>
	I would remind you that Quebec has a fundamental 
responsibility with respect to the protection and uses made of the 
aquatic environment and its resources. It has ownership of public 
bodies of water. It also has exclusive rights over civil rights and 
public property, municipal governments, local structures and 
industries, land development and resource use, and in general 
anything of a local or private nature.
<P>
	It is therefore responsible for integrated management of the 
aquatic environment, and for taking all protective measures liable 
to ensure its quality, by preserving aquatic life and the natural 
processes essential to the species inhabiting that environment, 
primarily halieutic species.
<P>
	It seems exaggerated, therefore, for the federal government to 
use its jurisdiction over fisheries and the management of conditions 
favourable to the maintenance and development of fishery 
resources to end up exercising identical or similar powers to those 
of Quebec over the aquatic environment.
<P>
	With this bill, the federal government is taking no notice 
whatsoever of the concerns that have been expressed at all levels in 
recent years concerning duplication, inefficiency and the dilution 
of resources occasioned by the current situation.
<P>
	On the contrary, Bill C-62 reaffirms and consolidates federal 
domination of an area fully covered by Quebec legislation, which 
directly addresses protection of the habitat of all fauna, including 
fish, and water pollution control in all of its forms.
<P>
	In principle, the department, or any other designated by the 
governor in council, may duplicate or even countermand the 
authorizations required by clause 22 of the Quebec environmental 
control act, and undertake the same impact studies as those covered 
by that act. Similarly, the governor in council has responsibility for 
adopting regulations which more or less duplicate or overlap 
Quebec regulations, as is the case at present concerning pulp and 
paper plant and oil refinery effluent and the liquid effluent from 
metal mines.
<P>
	Even more than the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, this 
bill would provide the federal government with a powerful tool for 
controlling all activities taking place in the aquatic environment, 
whether private property, or belonging to a municipal government 
or the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The problem is that the jurisprudence on division of powers 
tends to favour the federal side, since if there is any 
incompatibility, the federal legislation is generally recognized as 
taking precedence.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that most of the decisions the 
federal minister must make with respect to a new project or activity 
that may affect a waterway require, according to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, prior examination or an in-depth 
study, and in some cases a complete assessment.
<P>
	In other words, part II of the bill would intrude and would 
continue to intrude in the future on Quebec's exclusive or predomi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6146"> 6146 </A></B>
<P>
nant jurisdiction over and  responsibility for development, 
protection and management of waterways within its territory.
<P>
	To the extent that the bill reaffirms and consolidates the federal 
position in this area, it causes the federal government and the 
Quebec government to compete directly with each other and 
ultimately favours complete federal control over environmental 
management, the economy and the use of water. At best, it would 
have the effect of restricting Quebec's ability to define its own 
objectives, priorities and means of action and develop an integrated 
water management policy.
<P>
	I wonder what would happen if a project or structure receives the 
requisite permit and the minister of fisheries were to decide 
subsequently that the structure is harmful to a certain type of fish. 
In this area, we will now have four federal acts and possibly a 
larger number of regulations that, in turn, will duplicate two 
Quebec acts and regulations. A real mess, in which the average 
person will be hopelessly lost.
<P>
	Imagine the number of public servants, bureaucrats and 
ministers who would be able to intervene. The federal government 
is entirely responsible for this situation. It constantly walks all over 
jurisdictions already held by the provinces, especially in Quebec 
and especially in environmental matters.
<P>
	We wish the government would stick to its own jurisdiction, and 
start by harmonizing at the federal level. The environment would 
be better off as a result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her very interesting speech. I think she understands the 
major historical trends in international laws and municipal bylaws 
on environmental protection and pollution control. She agrees that 
the federal government and the provinces can negotiate in good 
faith. So why does she conclude there will be a conflict between the 
two levels of government? We share the same goals.
<P>
	In this case, I have a question for her: In order to reduce the 
possibility of conflict, should Quebec not follow in British 
Columbia's footsteps and negotiate an agreement on fisheries with 
the federal government? Why not? This might resolve the problems 
she raised with respect to the administration and purpose of this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem of overlap and 
duplication does not exist only between the federal government and 
the provinces, but also within the federal public service. I am 
thinking in particular of the department of fisheries and that of the 
environment. The problem has always existed. There have always 
been overlapping laws, and the department of fisheries has always 
used its discretionary power so it could fulfil its duties.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	A bill on threatened species has just been introduced in this 
House, and this morning in committee we were discussing fish 
habitat and protection. While we on this side are working to make 
progress, and I am including the federalists-even though I am not 
one of them, I can still see that some of their initiatives make 
sense-the Department of Fisheries and Oceans now comes up 
with a bill that interferes with the one on threatened species. This 
makes no sense at all. So when federal departments draft a bill, 
they should at least consult with one another so as to make their 
work much more consistent and cost-effective.
<P>
	Federal overlap alone is a shameless waste. Let us start with this. 
As far as Quebec is concerned, I think it is doing its job and it is in 
our best interests to conserve our fish stocks and protect our 
environment and wildlife. I think the Quebec law on environmental 
protection, on the protection of threatened species, was one of the 
most forward-looking we have ever seen. It was even mentioned by 
some of our Liberal colleagues.
<P>
	So we can surely come to some sort of agreement, but not with 
bills like this one, which is another example of the federal 
government's meddling in areas not under its jurisdiction. Federal 
departments cannot even speak among themselves to make sure 
their laws do not overlap those drafted by other departments. That 
is quite simple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address this 
question to my hon. colleague from the Laurentides but first I 
would like to made a comment and take this opportunity to take 
back remarks I made earlier to the previous speaker.
<P>
	I said that powers were delegated only in relation to the issue of 
fishing licences. I was mistaken. I read the bill over, and, under 
clause 58(1), the minister has indeed provided for delegation of 
powers in relation to the environment and habitat protection.
<P>
	Having done my mea culpa about what I said previously, the 
problem lies, and my hon. colleague from the Laurentides is 
absolutely right, with the environmental law. This is a relatively 
new field of law. I realize that it may not have existed 100 years 
ago, when the original fisheries act was drafted in 1868.
<P>
	But it exists today. Quebec has made significant progress in this 
area too, but even if fisheries were its responsibility under the 
Constitution, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did not have 
any power regarding the environment; the law said so. The 
department was not given such powers by the Constitution. 
However, in clause 58(3), the minister decided that, where the 
vision of any given province is inconsistent with that of the federal 
government, federal law will prevail. That is what it says.
<P>
	In other words, the minister is telling those who have delegated 
powers: ``Kiss your powers goodbye. I decide  now''. Which is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6147"> 6147 </A></B>
<P>
more insulting. How could the federal government delegate to a 
province a right that it is no longer entitled to have itself? As for the 
right to protect the environment, Quebec is already looking after 
that, and doing a fine job at it.
<P>
	I find doubly insulting the fact that, on the one hand, the federal 
government would be delegating a power that it does not have itself 
and, on the other hand, where an inconsistency exists, the rule of 
law will be in favour of Ottawa.
<P>
	Perhaps one hundred years have gone by before the Fisheries Act 
was reviewed but, with measures like these and provisions like 
these, I can see one hundred years of quarrelling lying ahead. I 
would like to hear my hon. colleague's comments on this.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pretty sure I will not be around 
for another century. Seriously, such a bill raises concerns. I think 
that the fisheries minister had a chance to redo his homework, and 
to make sure that his bill would not once again interfere in the 
jurisdictions of other departments, such as the environment 
department, or overlap other federal legislation, such as the 
Endangered Species Bill, or the Environmental Assessment Act. 
Why create a statute that overlaps others? It does not make any 
sense.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, we do our homework in Quebec. I think 
that protection of the environment is a responsibility, not a question 
of law. It is our future and that of our children. I think we have a 
duty to protect it. We must also try to administer it effectively. It is 
all very fine and well to make laws, but how will they be 
administered? When a bill of this sort is tabled, there must be an 
assurance that it can be administered. I am telling you it will be 
hell.
<P>
	Even on the environment committee we had problems during 
discussions with witnesses from Fisheries and Oceans, because 
there is a conflict of jurisdiction. There will be more problems 
because now there is discretionary power. We will have many more 
problems, and I will tell you that the more trouble we have reaching 
agreement, the more the process will be held up and the more the 
environment jeopardized.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will use the two 
minutes remaining to make a comment. I know we are at second 
reading stage. We are being told that opposition members should 
speak to the principles. I would therefore say right off the bat that 
as far as part II is concerned-I think my colleague, the 
environment critic, did a wonderful job-you have just been told 
about the potential, but very real, sticking points with the 
provinces.
<P>
	We said that we found it insulting to be delegated authority, 
when we already have it, just as you do. We said that we also found 
it insulting that, in cases of  disagreement between a provincial and 
federal department, the federal law would prevail.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell us that he will redo his 
homework. If he is trying to draft a bill that it has taken a century to 
produce, I would like him to tell us that he is not looking for a 
century of argument, but one of peace and productivity for the 
resource, for the people who make their living from it and depend 
on it. As the bill stands, what we see ahead is a century of dispute.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak to this legislation. I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Davenport.
<P>
	This legislation, an act respecting fisheries, is of great 
importance to the fishers throughout this country. I can speak in 
particular for the fishers and the organizations that they represent 
and the organizations that they have formed in the areas of my 
constituency of Cape Breton Highlands-Canso.
<P>
	Over the last several years that I have represented this area I 
have worked directly with the fishers of Atlantic Canada. I have 
discovered the depth of their commitment to the management and 
the proper stewardship of this resource. They have learned through 
interaction with the government, some good, some bad, that if the 
resource is to be properly managed, if the resource is to be properly 
conserved, the stakeholders, those who are directly involved in 
drawing their livelihood from the resource, have to be intimately 
involved as partners in the stewardship and in the management of 
this resource. That is what I understand to be the fundamental 
principle behind this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I also welcome the fact that Bill C-62 has gone through such 
extensive consultation under the new fisheries minister since it was 
introduced in the previous Parliament as Bill C-115. The Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans has undertaken extensive consultations 
both through his officials and through the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans during the course of the passage of this 
legislation. That is vitally important.
<P>
	If this approach to fisheries management, which is the correct 
and modern one, is to work, if it is to ensure the protection and 
survival of the species and the ecosystem on which the livelihoods 
of so many Canadians depend, then those people who are going to 
be involved as partners with the government need to have a comfort 
level, need to have their questions answered and need to understand 
that they are truly partners in the management of this resource.
<P>
	This legislation signals a major shift in the philosophy by which 
the federal government manages the fisheries in  Canada. Canada's 
fishing industry has indicated the need to get government out of the 
day to day management of the fishery. There is a need to redesign 
our past approach, which has been viewed as paternalistic in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6148"> 6148 </A></B>
<P>
nature. This has resulted, for the most part, in exclusive 
government decision making in the way the fishery is managed.
<P>
	These amendments represent a major shift in the fisheries 
management activities of fisheries and oceans. The department will 
shift away from the business of managing fishers to managing fish. 
The department will take a more focused approach to the 
management of the fisheries resource, concentrating on 
conservation and sustainable utilization.
<P>
	The legislation will support this shift in several ways. The aspect 
that I would particularly like to emphasize is that of allowing 
commercial fishers, aboriginal groups and other stakeholders to 
participate in the shared management, shared discussions and 
shared results of the fishery, and also to participate in the cost 
sharing of services such as data collection and licence 
administration.
<P>
	The legislation will allow for new legally binding agreements 
between the federal government and fisher groups. It will provide 
harvesters with a greater role and responsibility in managing the 
fishery.
<P>
	The government wants to work with stakeholders to develop the 
type of partnering agreements that will benefit all parties 
concerned and enhance the conservation of fisheries resources. 
However, the minister will retain, as he must, responsibility for 
conservation and protection of the resource at all times.
<P>
	New powers in the Fisheries Act will allow the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to share decision making and develop more 
efficient management strategies with groups within the fishery and 
to do so through long term partnering agreements.
<P>
	Fisheries and Oceans Canada and any representative 
organization could enter into such agreements on several aspects of 
fisheries management. A typical partnering agreement would 
clearly set out the harvesting limits and other conservation 
management measures for a fishery, the number of licences to be 
issued, the fees payable for licence issuance and licence 
administration, the obligations and responsibilities of each party, 
the funding arrangements with respect to the management of the 
fishery, and conservation and management programs for the 
fishery.
<P>
	Stakeholders will assume responsibility in choosing programs 
and services which will best meet their business needs.
<P>
	As I emphasized earlier, the responsibility and the legal 
authority for conservation and protection of the resource will 
remain with the minister. Specifically, the setting of allowable 
harvesting levels, the ability to close  fisheries and to ensure 
conservation and protection is not compromised and enforcement 
of the responsibilities and legal authorities will all remain with the 
minister.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I will introduce a short example of what this legislation will 
make possible and what it has already started. In my constituency 
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence a number of groups representing 
fishermen have worked out over the last two years new ways of 
engaging in partnerships to jointly manage and share the resource 
of the snow crab fishery in the gulf. This is quite a lucrative fishery 
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and has caused a great deal of tension in 
that part of Atlantic Canada. With the collapse of many of the 
groundfish stocks in the gulf, many fishermen have looked with 
some envy at those fortunate fishers who were able to draw 
substantial incomes from limited access to the snow crab fishery.
<P>
	Through a process of sometimes difficult negotiation we are 
starting to work out proper partnering agreements that will not only 
ensure the snow crab resource is properly managed but also that the 
groups of fishermen who are stakeholders and form companies that 
harvest the resource will share that resource for the benefit of all 
those in their communities.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his 
predecessor for showing the flexibility of movement that has 
allowed for a better sharing of that resource. That is an example in 
concrete terms of what the notion of partnering and of moving 
forward by involving the fishermen and other stakeholders in the 
management of this resource is all about.
<P>
	I will not be able to deal with all the aspects of this legislation, 
but if we allow the fishermen to take responsibility for the 
resource, for harvesting it in the appropriate way or assuming more 
of a share in the responsibility for the benefits that flow from that 
resource, we will find their good sense will prevail and will be 
demonstrated in a more sound fishery.
<P>
	One of the problems we have had in the past, tragedies in some 
areas, that has led to the virtual collapse of many fisheries is that 
nobody took real responsibility for the fishery. The fishermen had 
no real responsibility because the government took it all. In the end 
when mistakes were made in calculating harvest levels nobody was 
there to take the responsibility and as a result we had tragic 
overfishing.
<P>
	We have to stop this and I think the direction the government is 
taking with this legislation is the right one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the previous 
speaker noted that no one was responsible when the fishery on the 
east coast collapsed. That is simply not true.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible. The beauty 
of the old act is that somebody was  responsible. Under these new 
partnering agreements he is talking about, all that will happen is 
that we will have some sort of a collective to manage the fisheries 
resource. When things do not go right and we start looking around 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6149"> 6149 </A></B>
<P>
to pin the blame, there will not be anybody because there will be a 
committee and it will always be the next guy who is responsible.
<P>
	The department is admitting in this act that it did not have a 
solution to the problems and it is looking elsewhere. It wants to 
delegate that authority to somebody else rather than asking what 
went wrong and what it could do about it.
<P>
	For example, it was recently noted that there were over 400 
violations of the forestry act in central British Columbia which 
resulted in degradation of salmon habitat. The fisheries official 
responsible for the area and habitat made representation to the 
provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	He said: ``There's a problem here. If I can help, let me know''. 
The province never got back to him. The real issue is not that the 
province did not get back to him, it is why did the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the minister not enforce the act?
<P>
	The minister has the authority under the old act to do something 
about habitat degradation. Why was the act not enforced? The hon. 
member who just spoke does not have to answer in the specific on 
this but in general. When habitat is degraded as it was in this 
instance why is the minister not live up to his constitutional 
responsibility under the old act and doing something about it?
<P>
	Second, the new act does not give the minister any more 
authority. In fact, it just takes away authority. How does the 
member think that will improve the situation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I never said that under the old act the government did not have 
responsibility over the fishery. In fact, the minister of fisheries has 
always retained ultimate responsibility for the management of the 
fishery.
<P>
	What I meant to say was that in the old philosophy of 
management, the government was the sole entity that accepted 
responsibility for the fishery. Very often, the stakeholders in the 
industry deferred to the government to make the final decisions on 
the quotas.
<P>
	We saw examples of this on the east coast with overfishing, with 
high grading, with improper mesh size. Nobody was willing to be 
accountable for the fact that those things were taking place. The 
government was unable to enforce the sanctions in the act because 
there was not a shared responsibility for managing the resource.
<P>
	That is the new change in philosophy the government is 
introducing with this fishery. Fishermen have to be  responsible for 
the conservation of the resource. They have to share ownership of 
that responsibility with the government. That is the philosophy that 
we are trying to put forward.
<P>
	I believe that fishermen are happy to accept the responsibility 
provided they are fully involved in the partnership we are trying to 
create. That will be the challenge the minister of fisheries will have 
in implementing these new provisions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Before resuming debate, it 
is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Kootenay East, Telecommunications; 
the hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex, Agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
congratulate you on your appointment. I wish you success in that 
role for which you have been predestined for a long time. We are all 
very glad to see you in the chair.
<P>
	Historically it can be said that the Fisheries Act has played a 
very important environmental role because of its powers to 
regulate the alterations or destructions of fish habitat. Many 
Canadians, therefore, believe it is the most important piece of 
environmental legislation in Canada. For example, the Oldman 
dam environmental assessment was made possible by a trigger in 
the Fisheries Act, section 35(2), which resulted in the 
environmental assessment and review process.
<P>
	This bill makes some important changes to the act. Clause 49 of 
the bill appears to broaden protection of fish habitat by making a 
general prohibition against harmful alteration. By adding the word 
``activity'' to clause 49, certain types of mining found by the courts 
not to be included under the term ``works or undertaking'' used in 
the old act will now be included. Congratulations to the minister.
<P>
	It must be said that in most provinces and territories the 
Fisheries Act habitat protection provisions are the only legal 
protection for wetlands, streams, shorelines and other such 
ecological significant areas. Hence, the most problematic section 
of the bill is clause 58(1), which would permit, by means of 
regulation, the delegation of certain habitat protection and 
management responsibilities to interested provincial governments.
<P>
	This delegation would be limited to waters within the provinces, 
largely freshwater habitat and excludes a list of ``prescribed 
projects'', which would remain under the authority of the federal 
government but have yet to be determined.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation is not a carte blanche transfer of 
freshwater fish habitat responsibilities to the provinces, but instead 
would allow the federal government to negotiate agreements for 
the delegation of responsibilities to interested provinces. However, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6150"> 6150 </A></B>
<P>
because these agreements will have great consequences for fish 
habitat and environmental protection I would like to dwell on this 
part of the bill.
<P>
	One of the reasons advanced for negotiating delegation 
agreements with the provinces is to eliminate ``duplication and 
overlap'' between federal and provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	There is only anecdotal evidence to this effect and this may be 
true in some isolated cases. But in Ontario, after the Harris 
government's revisions of the land use planning act, protection for 
environmentally significant areas such as wetland, woodlots and 
ravines and prime agricultural land has been basically eliminated. 
Thus, in the case of Ontario, there is very little left in the daily 
operations of the ministry to operate, let alone to examine overlap 
and duplication. After Premier Harris' reforms the fisheries act 
now stands as the only significant protection for Ontario's 
wetlands, streams and shorelines.
<P>
	The terms of these agreements are of great importance therefore 
to fish habitat and overall environmental protection. I am glad that 
delegation will occur on a province by province basis. This will 
hopefully allow for the maintenance of high standards across the 
country.
<P>
	Not only Ontario has greatly reduced its ministries of the 
environment and natural resources. In Alberta the environment 
minister's budget will be reduced by $164 million and 1,360 jobs 
by the year 1999. According to the premier, industry will monitor 
and regulate itself.
<P>
	In Ontario, the ministry of environment and energy is being cut 
by $200 million and 752 staff by the year 1997-98 and the ministry 
of natural resources is being cut by $137 million and 2,170 staff 
over the same time.
<P>
	These massive cuts will most definitely impact negatively on the 
ability of these two provincial governments to assume increased 
responsibilities for the protection of fish habitat. Hence the 
agreements between the government and respective provinces must 
incorporate a strong and transparent monitoring system to ensure 
that fish habitat is properly protected. In addition, strong 
accountability mechanisms and penalties for non-compliance 
incorporated into the agreements are needed. Without these 
provisions, delegation could result in the de facto deregulation, 
something the federal government surely does not want to do and 
actually wants to avoid.
<P>
	The delegation of section 35(2) in the present Fisheries Act to 
the provinces also has serious ramifications for the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act passed in 1995. Under that act 
section 35(2) of the Fisheries Act triggers environmental 
assessment. Under Bill C-62 this will not longer be the case and 
instead the government is proposing the negotiation of a list of 
projects which  would require a mandatory permit. The list of 
projects requiring permits will be prescribed in the regulations 
after being negotiated with stakeholders.
<P>
	In order to maintain the original intent and the environmental 
protection accorded through making section 35(2) of the Fisheries 
Act a trigger for the assessment, I strongly urge the minister to 
make the project list comprehensive and representative of 
ecologically diverse areas and find ways of tracking and 
quantifying the cumulative effects of several small projects which 
might fail to come under those defined under the new Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act trigger.
<P>
	Without this capacity our environmental assessment will risk 
going back to a project by project approach instead of going 
forward to account for the cumulative impacts of development 
within a particular region.
<P>
	The track record regarding the delegation of Fisheries Act 
provisions to the provinces has not fared well in the past. In his 
1990 report then Auditor General Kenneth Dye stated: ``In the one 
area where the federal government has already delegated 
monitoring and enforcement authority to the provinces, there has 
been a serious deterioration in compliance. A review of the metal 
mining liquid effluent regulations issues under the Fisheries Act 
indicates that compliance fell from 85 per cent in 1982 to 48 per 
cent in 1988''. This is found on page 28 of the auditor general's 
report.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	While congratulating the minister I also urge him to ensure the 
agreements with the provinces include a very strong and 
transparent mechanisms for ensuring that proper monitoring and 
enforcement will take place. The integrity of the fish habitat 
protection demands such an approach if the Fisheries Act is to 
continue to protect Canadians' health, environment and our most 
precious fisheries habitat.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
problems with the recommendations just made by my colleague 
across the way. Allow me to explain.
<P>
	When he wants to see the links between the provinces and the 
federal government reinforced in order to better protect the 
environment-and no one would oppose such a goal, I too want to 
be sure the environment is protected-in the fervour I thought I 
detected at the end of the member's speech, when he said he would 
like to see mechanisms reinforced in the areas of safety and 
monitoring of implementation, I take this to mean a form of 
partnership with the provinces to ensure that everyone does their 
job and that everything goes well, how will all this work?
<P>
	I keep coming back to the same two points. I would remind 
members that what we are now talking about is  the fisheries bill of 
the century. I would also remind them that, 100 years ago, 
environmental law was not mentioned in the Constitution. 
Therefore, the founding nation, Quebec, has just as much right to 
define its environmental law as does the rest of Canada. But since 
we are talking about partnership, since we are talking about the bill 
of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6151"> 6151 </A></B>
<P>
century, I say that Canada has no more right over the environment 
than Quebec.
<P>
	How dare they tell us, in clause 58(1), that the federal 
government may delegate powers to a province? And how, in a 
context of wanting to reinforce monitoring mechanisms rather than 
dictating how they will be set up, will agreement be reached in 
order to ensure that everyone wants the same degree of purity of 
water, air and the ecosystem?
<P>
	This is immediately followed, in clause 58(3) by coercive 
measures. It says that federal environmental law will take 
precedence over provincial environmental law.
<P>
	This is, I would remind you, the law of the century when it 
comes to the fisheries. One hundred years ago, when the two 
founding peoples came together to write the Constitution, it did not 
exist. Today we are being told: ``Shove over, you little guys, we are 
the bosses here''. I find that the minister has not done his 
homework.
<P>
	First of all, as my colleague for Laurentides has already said, 
there is a lack of cohesiveness, an overlap between the federal 
departments themselves, between the federal Department of the 
Environment and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Now 
what they are planning is to stir up quarrels and to give themselves 
all of the rights with clause 58(3), saying: ``We are going to declare 
the delegation of power mil if we feel it is not right''. Where is 
there any partnership in that? Where is the desire to create stringent 
measures of control, mechanisms to ensure a pure environment?
<P>
	Clause 58(3) thumbs its nose at the rights of Quebec and the 
other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We will not understand each other if one side says ``If you do not 
do what I tell you, I will cut off your rights.'' What entitles the 
provinces to additional rights? This is the law of the century, I say 
again.
<P>
	When the Constitution was drafted 100 years ago, this was not in 
it. Now, if we wish to rejuvenate the Constitution, to get more 
modern, let us speak of how the mechanisms of harmonization 
rather than of coercion will be used.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I only have one minute to answer. I 
wish to thank the honourable member for Gaspé for his question. It 
seems to me that my colleague is living in the obscurity of his 
ignorance. Had he read the Constitution, as he should have, he 
would know that water is exclusively a matter of federal 
jurisdiction. One cannot say that there is no federal jurisdiction in 
that area. Thus, it means there is also a federal jurisdiction on 
fisheries.
<P>
	Naturally, we want to reinforce the links between the federal 
government and the provinces. I gave only two examples, those of 
Ontario and Alberta, to show that at this time, and because of 
budgetary restrictions in those two provinces, we cannot expect 
them to address the issue of fisheries and assume a major 
responsibility in this area. These provinces have reduced their 
budgets and, hence, the ability of their departments to assume more 
responsibility than they have at the present time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a bill of stealth, dressed up as modernization. This 
bill gives the minister and thus the senior bureaucracy all the power 
they could ever possibly want to reward their friends and 
consolidate their strength and powers.
<P>
	All this is coming from what is characterized as the most 
centralized, top heavy and arrogant bureaucracy in the federal 
government. It is amazing to me how the consolidation of powers 
in this bill can be characterized as modernization. Thank goodness 
I have not spent my life in academia to buy this logic hook, line and 
sinker like some Liberals in this place.
<P>
	In 1995 DFO and the coast guard merged. And guess what? The 
DFO senior bureaucracy won the turf war which it was so well 
placed to win in the Ottawa trenches since its last priority was 
serving the public. British Columbians have seen the negative 
consequences to coast guard services on the west coast ever since.
<P>
	There is one thing that I would like to state very clearly. There is 
nothing the government can do under the new fisheries act, Bill 
C-62, that it cannot already do under the existing act except 
extinguish the public right to fish. The central and deplorable 
change with respect to fisheries management is that the minister 
gains unfettered powers to do what currently requires the specific 
authorization of Parliament or cabinet. The power has become the 
intoxicating element of Canada's proposed fisheries act. For a 
minister and department that have singlehandedly mismanaged this 
resource so completely to be handed even more absolute power 
would be a derogation of the trust placed in us as parliamentarians.
<P>
	Bill C-62 is further testimony to the government's inability to 
manage and allocate a resource and further testimony to the 
government's refusal to honour historic common law regarding the 
public right to fish.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Despite Supreme Court decisions to the contrary, this bill will 
also ensure the continuation of a native only commercial fishery. 
This legislation is contrary to any enlightened and cogent advice 
proffered by the fishing industry, unions, commercial and recre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6152"> 6152 </A></B>
<P>
ational fishermen and anyone who knows anything about the 
industry.
<P>
	All the bill really accomplishes is to give the minister complete 
discretion to enter into fisheries management agreements with any 
group. It is a recipe for a patchwork, piecemeal and divisive 
fisheries policy. How in the world could the minister allow his 
bureaucrats to once again snow him by holding him captive to his 
own ignorance and ego?
<P>
	Bill C-62 gives the minister the power to end the public right to 
fish and replaces this time honoured tradition with private fishing 
agreements, or what the bill calls partnership agreements.
<P>
	There is an expression in the banking business which goes 
something like this: ``If you owe the bank $1,000 you are a debtor. 
If you owe it $1 million you are partner''. With the omnipotent 
power Bill C-62 now gives to the minister I can see every good 
Liberal and financial contributor to the party becoming real 
partners with the minister and the government.
<P>
	Ministerial fiats are dictatorial and an abuse of democracy. Can 
we see one town along the Fraser River in B.C. that votes Liberal 
becoming a partner and another town that does not becoming a 
debtor unable to strike a partnership agreement? This is outrageous 
power.
<P>
	These fishing agreements would be similar to the aboriginal 
fishing agreements the government currently enters into with 
native bands. The native only commercial fishery was undermined 
by the Supreme Court's August 1996 R. v. Van der Peet, R. v. NTC 
Smokehouse Ltd. and R. v. Gladstone decisions. The court ruled 
against an aboriginal commercial right, saying they had no right to 
an exclusive fisheries. B.C. natives, to quote, ``do not have a 
constitutional right to catch and sell fish commercially''. Here we 
go again, more appealed decisions leading to Supreme Court 
rulings in order to bring the bureaucrats and their captive minister 
to their senses.
<P>
	Bill C-62 expunges historic common law public right to fish in 
exchange for a privilege dependent on the discretion of the 
minister. This is pure and simple fiat perpetuated by this most 
centralized and arrogant bureaucracy and foisted upon a minister 
and he upon the public.
<P>
	If this is not going far enough, Bill C-62 gives the minister 
absolute discretion to manage the fishery through ministerial 
decrees or what the bill describes as fisheries management orders. 
These orders would replace the regulations made by governor in 
council which are now used to govern the fishery. These fishing 
agreements and management orders are exempt from <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> publication and from its more rigorous regulatory 
requirements. It is sheer arrogance and purely meant to exempt the 
minister from the scrutiny of those who will most be affected.
<P>
	Transparency and review are the hallmarks of our parliamentary 
system. If the Liberal government thinks the Reform Party will roll 
over and capitulate on this attempt to defraud Canadians of their 
rights, it is mistaken.
<P>
	Do the minister and his bureaucrats truly believe that fiat and 
management through patronage will address the problems in the 
fishery?
<P>
	Denial is a wonderful thing and it has become the hallmark of 
this government. According to it, there is no deficit, unemployment 
is not a problem, health care is secure and there is no crime. 
However, the undeniable truth is there are major problems in all 
these areas. If there is one area of endeavour where public 
confidence is weakest in terms of the ability of the federal 
government to properly manage it the fisheries.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	On the east coast much of the fishery is closed due to the 
collapse of groundfish stocks. On the west coast the problems with 
the Alaskan catch of Canadian bound salmon are unresolved. Again 
on the west coast the salmon fishery, the key stock, is in disarray. 
There has been almost no non-native commercial fishery on the 
Fraser River for the past two years and now, should that ever 
change, Bill C-62 will ensure that good Liberals can be awarded 
with the catch.
<P>
	Furthermore, the undeniable truth is that the government's 
native only commercial fishery is a mess. Our brilliant bureaucrats 
and the minister introduced a native only commercial fishery based 
on the expectation that the Supreme Court would hold that natives 
did have such a right. I guess that is why the Supreme Court judges 
and others working at fisheries and oceans regional headquarters in 
Vancouver do not yet work for the justice department.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the Van der Peet, NTC Smokehouse and 
Gladstone decisions highlight DFO's lack of authority to enter into 
exclusive fishing agreements with aboriginals. Now these same 
minds want to carry it a step further and enter into exclusive 
commercial fishing agreements with Liberal friends. Once again 
the legislation before us is an attempt to extinguish the public right 
to fish.
<P>
	Bill C-62 may run nearly 100 pages. It need not have. There is a 
lot of verbiage intended to obfuscate the central element of the 
legislation. Specific to the management of fisheries, there is 
nothing the government can do under the new fisheries act that it 
cannot already do under the existing act, except extinguish the 
public right to fish.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6153"> 6153 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to partnership agreements, the minister has 
absolute discretion to enter into agreements which include 
provisions on allocation.
<P>
	The response to Bill C-62 has been universal in condemnation. 
Fisheries unions fear that this power will be used to allocate fish 
stocks to large corporations. Recreational fishermen fear 
allocations to commercial interests. Commercial troll fishermen 
fear allocations to sports fishing lodges. Corporations fear 
allocations to inshore fishermen. Commercial fishermen fear 
allocations to native interests. It is an all around alienation of 
everyone in one fell swoop. What a statement of mismanagement 
and an undermining of a resource struggling to survive. The death 
knell may have finally rung.
<P>
	Does the minister understand completely what the bill does? I 
doubt it. Does the senior bureaucracy understand completely? 
Undoubtedly.
<P>
	Virtually all commercial and recreational fishing organizations 
in B.C. oppose the new act and wish to preserve the public right to 
fish. While commercial fishermen desire increased security of 
tenure, they feel that the loss of the public's right to fish in 
exchange for a privilege granted by the minister reduces their 
security and transfers too much power to the minister.
<P>
	In the Atlantic provinces opposition appears to be growing for 
the same reasons.
<P>
	Bill C-62 does not address the real problems in the fishery, for 
example, declining stocks, problems with Alaskan interception and 
the need for strict enforcement of conservation measures.
<P>
	Bill C-62 is a desperate attempt to deal with the government's 
political problems, that is, what to do with the native only 
commercial fishery and the growing awareness that the present 
Fisheries Act does not give the minister the authority to enter into 
exclusive fishing agreements. There are some simple solutions to 
the problem. Clear criteria ought to be established for the transfer 
of fisheries management to the provinces. Fish tend not to notice 
political boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	On the east coast chaos could result if one or all of the coastal 
provinces were to take over management of the coastal fishery. 
There is a need for comprehensive consultation, not abrogation, by 
granting the minister such discretion.
<P>
	As well, clear criteria ought to be established for any transfer to 
the provinces of responsibilities for the protection of fish habitat. 
Provinces now regulate forestry, agricultural practices, urban 
development and waste. Why not fish habitat?
<P>
	As usual the minister has chosen the easy route on this, but as 
usual it is ultimately the most divisive and destructive route. Bill 
C-62 expunges equal access to fishing and replaces it with granting 
fishing licences by political party membership. Bill C-62 replaces 
ownership of fish stocks by all Canadians to ownership by the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The unilateral actions displayed in this bill and the lack of 
protection of the public interest coming from DFO are no surprise 
to people involved in coastal marine activities. I will quote myself 
on some recent coast guard initiatives that were promoted by the 
newly merged DFO bureaucracy.
<P>
	On October 24 I said: ``The hole's been patched but the ship's 
still sinking about the coast guard's reprieve for boats in Powell 
River, Campbell River and Ganges.
<P>
	``While the coast guard is leaving the <I>Mallard</I>, <I>Point Race</I> and 
<I>Skua</I> where they are for the time being, nothing has changed 
because we have still not heard a clear vision from the Canadian 
Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans about 
long term objectives. We still have a top-heavy bureaucracy in 
DFO in Ottawa and in the regions that does not appear responsive 
to maintaining a safe waterway on the west coast. Nor do they 
appear to be forthcoming in providing accurate and timely 
information about their intentions.
<P>
	``The coast guard, in August, announced that bases in Powell 
River and Ganges would close, the vessels would be reassigned and 
the 70-foot <I>Point Race</I>, stationed in Campbell River, would be 
moved to Port Hardy. On Tuesday the coast guard announced that 
temporarily Powell River's <I>Mallard</I>, the <I>Point Race</I> and French 
Creek's <I>Kestrel</I> would remain at their current stations, along with 
the <I>Skua</I> in Ganges.
<P>
	``What we want is a world class marine service that enables safe 
and efficient marine operations on Canada's coasts. This latest 
announcement by the coast guard does not deliver this assurance. 
The announced changes are a case of the bureaucracy trying to wait 
out and defuse the most vocal opposition.
<P>
	``The fact that the coast guard did not even mention the issue of 
lightstations in its latest announcement shows that its plans to press 
ahead with its agenda using the `damn the torpedoes' approach. 
The fleet reduction plan is based on a complete focus on 
downsizing and does not address the delivery of a first class marine 
service.
<P>
	``We have been offered a piecemeal solution that addresses some 
symptoms but does not get to the heart of the problem which is: 
Where is this new department headed and what is its vision for west 
coast marine services?
<P>
	``It appears that DFO's bureaucrats have won the fight for 
control of the newly amalgamated department. DFO and the coast 
guard were asked independently about the time of their merger last 
year to offer spendings cuts. Both DFO and Canadian coast guard 
identified the same $30 million in spending cuts. These cuts were 
double counted and the coast guard component of the newly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6154"> 6154 </A></B>
<P>
merged department has borne this $30 million extra cutback from 
Treasury Board''.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I am still quoting myself, just so the House understands the flow: 
``The U.S. has a clear coast guard objective which involves using 
people and technology to ensure their coastline has first class 
navigation and marine services. The Reform Party has addressed 
the whole issue of creating such an environment in Canada in its 
recently announced platform which calls for amalgamating coast 
guard into the Department of National Defence and providing more 
resources for fishery surveillance and coast guard activities.
<P>
	``I urge everyone whose battle for the maintenance of services to 
keep up the fight. I fully credit the efforts of those who have 
pursued the issue tirelessly with having won this temporary 
reprieve which helps us for the time being in the lower coast. 
However, the immediate future for the north coast already looks 
dire with an already skimpy presence having been further diluted.
<P>
	``The coastal communities and advisory groups and stakeholders 
must continue to press for rationalizing the huge bureaucracy in 
Ottawa and the regions and to press for world class marine 
services''.
<P>
	For all of those reasons I oppose Bill C-62.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I take us back to 
the subject of the debate. We began with King John, wicked King 
John. We have referred to Queen Victoria and she of course is dead. 
I seemed to be coming back to Henry VIII when I heard the hon. 
member speak.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that this bill is an act of codification 
and rationalization. All countries do that with their laws. They 
bring them up to date, 1868 to the present. The co-partnering 
arrangements are a response to the requests and demands by 
stakeholders, fisher people, for more effective participation in 
government decision making. This is the new pluralism to which 
we have referred. Also, we seek to complement the Oceans Act by 
incorporating the implementing sections of the international law 
that Canadian diplomats fought for and won in the new Law of the 
Sea developments.
<P>
	My I suggest some clarification. The rules of interpretation have 
been thrown around. Common law yields to statute law. It is 
elementary. The Magna Carta has been incorporated into Canadian 
law in its due process section. It is part of the charter of rights. I 
feel the hon. members opposite should have a look at the Magna 
Carta. Do they really suggest, for example, that sections 10 and 11 
are part of Canadian law? They are the most viciously, religiously 
discriminatory features of the Magna Carta which was, of course, a 
medieval document with all the prejudice of the medieval age.
<P>
	Let us come up to the present. Common law yields to statute law. 
Magna Carta is only part of Canadian law so far as we have adopted 
it. We have adopted the best parts for our charter. Delegation of 
powers is responsible to the ultimate principle, respondeat 
superior; that is to say the delegation is controlled by the law itself. 
The minister when he delegates power is ultimately responsible 
under the act.
<P>
	On constitution and statute law, section 35 of the charter is not 
abrogated or changed in any way by this act. Statute law cannot 
prevail over the Constitution.
<P>
	If we get back to some elementary rules of interpretation it may 
guide us to a more relevant debate in which we do not have to quote 
ourselves when we run out of inspiration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not bring forward Henry VIII, 
Queen Victoria or the Magna Carta. The fact that my colleague 
from Vancouver Quadra brought them forward is fine with me.
<P>
	I do not want to argue about the fineries of technical detail. The 
broad detail and the broad thrust of this bill are the public right to 
fish which has been around forever. It is a very strongly held public 
right and something the public feels very close to. This bill replaces 
it with ministerial fiat and ministerial order. This bill will be 
challenged.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The problem is the government has exceeded its authority time 
after time. It created native only commercial fishery agreements 
which also exceeded its authority. There has been challenge after 
challenge. We now have a circumstance where because the 
challenges have come to the point of succeeding, the federal 
government now wants to change the legislation to allow it to do 
what it has been doing which is inappropriate anyway.
<P>
	Why do we want to create another piece of legislation, Bill C-62, 
that will be challenged by an even wider range of groups? Do we 
want to get into a multiple year challenge that tests the Supreme 
Court once again only to see the potential for a government to 
finally get itself in such a jam that it wants to create another piece 
of legislation? Let us get back to basics, let us get back to square 
one and let us get back to what is actually good for the resource.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, reference has 
been made to the Magna Carta and the fact that some of us here do 
not speak the language of the time that document was written and 
so somehow that document itself is dated. The fact of the matter is 
that the hon. member across who referenced this is ignoring that 
the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Magna Carta 
repeatedly since Confederation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6155"> 6155 </A></B>
<P>
	Earlier this afternoon I quoted the part of the ruling in the 1913 
case of the Attorney General of British Columbia <I>v.</I> the Attorney 
General of Canada. The ruling stated in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been unquestioned law that since Magna Carta no exclusive fishery could 
be created by Royal grant in tidal waters and no public right of fishing, in such 
waters, then existing, can be taken away without competent legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This past summer it was the justices of the Supreme Court of 
Canada who stated again quite emphatically that since the time of 
the Magna Carta there has been a public right to fish and that public 
right can only be removed by competent legislation. So we are not 
dreaming over here when we talk about that. We are talking about 
real issues and real concerns. They are concerns that have been 
addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	One of the other concerns we have, which I am sure my friend 
from North Island-Powell River will share, is delegation of 
authority for conservation issues. I referred to a study earlier this 
afternoon which noted that habitat degradation associated with 
logging, urbanization and hydro power development contributed to 
most of the 142 documented stock extinctions. It was referring to 
extinction of particular salmon runs.
<P>
	We are concerned that what the government is doing in this bill 
is simply transferring the authority for conservation to the 
provincial government rather than addressing the question itself. It 
is obvious that whole area of concern has been neglected by the 
government, but rather than responding to it and trying to do 
something about it, the government is prepared to let the provincial 
government look after it.
<P>
	I wonder if my friend from North Island-Powell River would 
care to give some examples of the inability of the provincial 
government to manage the habitat. Perhaps he could also address 
the fact that what we should be talking about are principles to 
manage habitat rather than simply getting rid of the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly, I do not really know 
where to begin other than to say that one of the most often asked 
questions that I am asked when I am at home on the west coast is 
what I think about provincial authority to take over the fishery.
<P>
	The reason people are asking me that question is clearly that they 
are so dissatisfied with what has happened under the jurisdiction of 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. What my colleague from 
Delta is talking about is the need for the federal agency to fix what 
is wrong, not go about consolidating a whole bunch of power and 
authority that really abrogates the public right to fish and other 
things.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred divisions at 
the report stage of Bill C-34.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURALMARKETINGPROGRAMSACT">AGRICULTURAL MARKETING PROGRAMS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 31 consideration of Bill C-34, 
an act to establish programs for the marketing of agricultural 
products, to repeal the Agricultural Products Board Act, the 
Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing Act, the Advance 
Payments for Crops Act and the Prairie Grain Advance Payments 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, as

	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I think you would 
find unanimous consent to take the deferred recorded divisions on 
the private members' motions at the end of the votes later today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The House has heard the 
proposal of the chief government whip. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	The question is on Motion No. 2. A vote on this motion also 
applies to Motion No. 3.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I declare Motion. No. 2 
defeated. I therefore declare Motion No. 3 defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, prior to the vote the government 
whip was seeking unanimous consent, with the concurrence of the 
other whips, to have private members' votes today voted on last. I 
interpreted that to mean private members' business was not as 
important as government business. If that is not the case and the 
government would like to explain the reasons why it wants it done 
that way I would be pleased to reconsider my objection.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, as was mentioned by our colleague 
opposite, the member for York South-Weston, the intention is 
simply to avoid any confusion, as we have now taken the practice 
of applying votes. Private members' business, giving it the due 
respect it deserves in this House, we felt that we should first deal 
with the government bills and subsequently, simply to avoid 
confusion, we would deal with the private members' motions at the 
end of the process. There is nothing else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept what the government whip 
is indicating. Perhaps we can deal with private members' business 
first and then the government business, and that will avoid 
confusion as well.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I do not sense a consensus 
in the House on this. I think we should proceed as we planned.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the House would agree I would 
propose that you seek unanimous consent that members who voted 
on the previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion 
now before the House, with Liberal members voting yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there consent for the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you would find unanimous 
consent that the members who voted on the previous motion be 
recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House, 
namely Motion No. 6 at report stage and the Bloc Quebecois' 
amendment to Motion No. 13 at report stage, with Liberal members

	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the House would agree, I would 
propose that you seek unanimous consent that members who voted

now before the House. For concurrence at report stage we could 
apply the vote taken on report stage Motion No. 4 of Bill C-41 in 
reverse.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANBILLOFRIGHTS">CANADIAN BILL OF RIGHTS</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 30 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I last addressed this topic I explained why property 
rights need to be strengthened in Canada. I made the point that 
property rights make society richer, that they protect freedom and 
democracy and that they protect the environment.
<P>
	Today I would like to go on to explain that we each have seven 
fundamental property rights. The bill of rights only provides rather 
feeble protection for three of these seven. First, it provides 
protection or the right to the enjoyment of property. Second, in the 
bill of rights there is the provision for the right not to be deprived of 
property except by due process. Third is the right to a fair hearing.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Even these rights can simply be overridden by saying so in the 
legislation, just like the Liberal government did in Bill C-22 which 
cancelled the Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	The Canadian bill of rights does not provide protection of the 
following property rights. Out of the seven there are four that are 
not included. First is the right to be paid fair compensation. 
Second, it is not included that it should be a right to have the 
compensation fixed impartially. Third is the right to receive timely 
compensation. Fourth is the right to apply to courts to obtain justice 
if they feel any aspect of their property rights have been denied or 
infringed upon.
<P>
	This is why we need to improve the bill of rights. This is why we 
need to strengthen the protection of property rights in federal law 
by supporting Motion No. 205.
<P>
	I would like to examine and refute the objections put forward by 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice when he 
spoke in opposition to this motion on June 10 of this year.
<P>
	Here is a brief list of the Liberal government's opposition to 
strengthening property rights as explained by the hon. member for 
Prince Albert-Churchill River in my home province of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The Liberals say this, first, that there is already more than 
adequate protection for property rights. They also said laws already 
provide fair procedures and fair compensation. They said common 
law already provides presumption of compensation. They said 
much of the responsibility for regulating property is provincial. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6173"> 6173 </A></B>
<P>
They said this would establish a hierarchy of rights in the bill  of 
rights. Last, they said it may prevent socially useful legislation.
<P>
	Those were the arguments that my Liberal colleagues used in 
saying we do not need this. These are pitiful excuses at best. They 
can be easily refuted and I want to do that one by one.
<P>
	If there already is adequate protection for property rights, why 
did Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau fight so hard to include 
protection for property rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and denied that? He said we need to have that, but it was 
opposed.
<P>
	If there is such adequate protection for property rights why 
during the 1980s did the House of Commons and the provincial 
legislatures of British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario each 
pass resolutions calling for property rights to be entrenched in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
<P>
	How can the parliamentary secretary stand in the House and read 
exactly what the bureaucrats write for him when there is such 
overwhelming evidence against his position? It is obvious to 
everyone but him that there is not adequate protection for property 
rights.
<P>
	If federal laws already provide for fair procedures and fair 
compensation, how can the parliamentary secretary the explain that 
his government tried to expropriate the investments made by 
individuals and companies that participated in the Pearson airport 
contract?
<P>
	How can the parliamentary secretary explain that his Liberal 
government included a section in that legislation which would have 
denied these property owners the right to a fair hearing and fair 
compensation?
<P>
	How can the parliamentary secretary explain to the Canadian 
people that American and Mexican citizens have better protection 
of their investments in Canada through the NAFTA than Canadian 
citizens have in their own country? That is not right. And that is 
why all people, all members listening to this, should support my 
colleague's motion with regard to this.
<P>
	If much of the responsibility for regulating property is 
provincial, can the parliamentary secretary explain why he is 
objecting to this motion which only proposes to strengthen 
property rights with respect to the laws, activities and operations of 
the federal government, not the provincial governments?
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is concerned that passage of Motion 
No. 205 would establish a hierarchy of rights in the bill of rights. 
There is already a hierarchy of rights.
<P>
	All the other fundamental rights and freedoms have been 
strengthened by their inclusion in the Constitution and the charter 
of rights and freedoms. Property rights were left out of the charter.
<P>
	How can the Liberals honestly explain their refusal to strengthen 
property rights with respect to federal laws as this motion 
proposes? It should be put in the charter, but let us begin by putting 
it in the bill of rights.
<P>
	Finally, the parliamentary secretary is concerned that property 
rights may prevent socially useful legislation. This, for everyone 
listening, is the real reason why the Liberals of the 1990s and the 
party of big government are opposed to the Reform motion to 
better protect property.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary made it clear in the speech he read 
in this House, the speech the justice department bureaucrats wrote 
for him, the speech the Minister of Justice had him read, that 
Motion No. 205 might prevent the Liberals from re-engineering 
society.
<P>
	The truth is that property rights are the only way average citizens 
have to fight the arbitrary intrusion of big government.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 might slow the Liberal government's plans to 
expropriate property arbitrarily like it wanted to do with the 
Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 might slow the Liberal government's plans to 
confiscate over half a million legally owned handguns it banned in 
the passage of Bill C-68.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 might interfere with the Liberal government's 
plans to expand its monopoly powers over property, such as 
produce and products grown by farmers in the west.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 might slow the Liberal government's plans to 
expropriate private property by passing any number of the 
following laws, and I am quoting from the parliamentary 
secretary's speech, environmental laws, land use laws, laws 
provided for establishment and operation of corporations and 
ownership and disposition of shares, laws on banking, laws on 
bankruptcy and copyright laws.
<P>
	The excuses given by the Liberals are completely without 
substance. They are empty. They are void and they have just been 
destroyed.
<P>
	There is so much more to say. Suffice it to say that if members of 
this House support Motion No. 205 the measures will not prevent 
the Liberal government or any future governments from passing 
laws that take property away from Canadian citizens.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 will give Canadian citizens a bit of added 
protection of their property rights which, based on the words and 
deeds of the Liberal government, would seem more than justified.
<P>
	I urge all members to vote their constituents' wishes on this 
motion. Over 70 per cent of Canadians support greater protection 
of property rights. It is time we moved on this.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6174"> 6174 </A></B>
<P>
	They have it right. We need this fundamental protection of 
property in this country. It is totally inappropriate that Americans 
and Mexicans, through the NAFTA, have more property rights in 
Canada than we, ourselves, have. That ought to send a signal here 
that we have a huge problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been down this road before about property rights in this 
House. I might add it is the topic of conversation among many 
people in this country. It is not surprising that many real estate 
people are very adamant about property rights. I had a meeting with 
the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board and this was indeed an issue it 
wanted addressed in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 205 is merely asking that we provide a greater 
measurement of protection for individual property rights by 
amending the Canadian Bill of Rights. I have a difficult time 
understanding why there would be even any reluctance on this 
issue from this government.
<P>
	I want to indicate some of the basic fundamental principles on 
property rights of the Reform Party. Reform principle No. 10 
enshrined in the constitution of the Reform Party states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that the creation of wealth and productive jobs for Canadians is best 
achieved through the operations of a responsible, broadly-based, free enterprise 
economy in which private property, freedom of contract and the operations of free 
markets are encouraged and respected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does the Reform policy actually encompass? The Reform 
Party supports amending the charter of rights to recognize that in 
Canada there existed and shall continue to exist the right of every 
person to the ownership, use and enjoyment of property both, real 
and personal, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due 
process of law. Furthermore, it should recognize that in Canada no 
person shall be deprived directly or indirectly by any law of 
Parliament or a provincial legislature of the ownership, use and 
enjoyment of property unless that law provides for just and timely 
compensation. That is exactly what my colleague just said so 
articulately.
<P>
	Last June the Reform assembly passed the following resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolved that the Reform Party go on record as being opposed to legislation that 
may be enacted by any of the three levels of government which would seek to 
diminish or deprive individuals of their property without adequate compensation, 
whether it be real property, intellectual property, or the opportunities associated 
therewith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What are property rights? Property rights are the cornerstone of 
human freedom. Property rights mean freedom from arbitrary 
interference in one's life by government. Property rights depend on 
the notion that you own yourself and your labour and neither the 
government nor the community exercising its power through 
government may take your property except under three very 
limiting conditions. The taking of your property must be for public 
use; the taking of your property must be through due legal process 
of law; the taking of your property must be with just and timely 
compensation.
<P>
	I have been involved in the appropriation of property for a school 
board which needed property for the purchasing and building of 
more schools. The process involved even from a local basis should 
really be enshrined in the bill of rights. It should be very common 
to all Canadians rather than a province by province or a local 
district by district implementing their own rules and their own 
laws.
<P>
	Property rights guarantee your right not to be deprived of your 
property either by taking away ownership or by restricting your 
use, enjoyment or ability to transfer ownership to another person 
until or unless the three conditions outlined above are met.
<P>
	Property rights also guarantee your right not to be deprived of 
the value of your own labour by being compelled to work under 
conditions not of your choosing or by being forbidden to work 
under conditions that are of your own choosing.
<P>
	We have to go back to the issue of where did property rights 
come from. This is not just an issue that started in Canada. We can 
go back to Britain or to many countries. I would like to give some 
quotes. The following quote goes as far back as 1790 and is by 
Edmund Burke in <I>Reflections on the Revolution in France</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable 
and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that which tends the most to the 
perpetuation of society itself. It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue; it 
grafts benevolence even upon avarice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	In 1937 Walter Lippmann said in the <I>The Good Society</I>: ``The 
only dependable foundation of personal liberty is the personal 
economic security of private property''.
<P>
	These kinds of issues are not something that we have created 
here today; these have been talked about for years and years. It is 
like many other issues in the House of Commons; one has to stand 
here and wonder why it is such an issue. Why is this not just 
accepted by this government? Rather than it being made a political 
issue, why does it not just say that it makes common sense, that it is 
for the good of all people so let us do it? What is the hesitancy?
<P>
	In 1756 Benjamin Franklin said: ``Mine is better than ours''. 
What a great quote. That is truly reflective of property rights.
<P>
	We have to ask why these property rights need to be 
strengthened. It is one of our most important rights. If we did not 
have a written Constitution, the protection of property rights under 
common law which dates from time immemorial would suffice. 
However, since we do have a written Constitution that does 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6175"> 6175 </A></B>
<P>
entrench certain rights, these rights merely protected by common 
law or federal statute are regulated to a subordinate status.
<P>
	Every person's natural and fundamental right to property should 
be protected as our paramount right. If circumstances do not allow 
us to entrench property rights in the Constitution, then we should 
take the next best step and strengthen this right in federal law using 
the legislative mechanisms and constitutional powers available to 
the federal government.
<P>
	One has to ask: What if? Why? How? I will say it again: This 
government has an obligation to act rationally and responsibly on 
all issues. Because this happens to be a motion brought up by my 
colleague on this side of the House does not mean that the 
government has to oppose it. It means that the government should 
listen to the motion, ask if it makes sense and proceed from there.
<P>
	There are times in this House of Commons when politics have to 
be laid aside. There is nothing wrong with entrenching property 
rights in this House of Commons in the bill of rights and the charter 
of rights.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, as it is my motion I wonder if I 
might be allowed a minute to make a brief summation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> A right of reply is 
certainly permissible. Since the hon. member is rising to speak I 
must advise the House that if he speaks now he will close the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
Motion No. M-205 proposes to amend the Canadian bill of rights 
by adding two new sections. The first section would allow citizens 
the right to their property unless the person receives a fair hearing 
in accordance with principles of fundamental justice. The second 
section gives the individual property owner the right to fair 
compensation for the property within a reasonable amount of time.
<P>
	At present the Canadian bill of rights includes property rights yet 
the guarantee of protection is minimal at best. At present there is no 
requirement in Canadian constitutional law that the removal of 
private property is covered by a fair procedure to deal with 
compensation to the owner and there is no guarantee of fair 
treatment by the courts, tribunals or officials who have the power 
over individuals or corporations.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	Individual property rights is a fundamental freedom which must 
be protected. Motion No. M-205 considers giving Canadians 
security that their homes and possessions are theirs and theirs 
alone. This motion is about giving Canadians the right to the 
protection of their own property. I would hope there would be 
broad support within this House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> At the request of the chief 
government ship, the vote on this motion stands deferred until 
tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.
