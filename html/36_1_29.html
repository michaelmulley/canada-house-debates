<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the question 
of privilege raised by the hon. member for Fraser Valley on 
October 29, 1997 concerning a government news release announcing 
the membership of the nominating committee for the proposed 
Canada pension plan investment board. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley for raising the 
matter and for providing the Chair with a copy of the document in 
question, and I thank the Leader of the Government in the House for 
his comments on the matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Fraser Valley referred to a news release 
dated October 23 in which the Department of Finance announced the 
membership of a committee that will nominate candidates for the 
proposed Canada pension plan investment board.  He pointed out 
that clause 10(2) of Bill C-2, the Canada pension plan investment 
board act specifically provides for this nominating committee and 
he reminded the House that this bill had only been taken up by 
the Standing Committee on Finance on October 28.  Thus, the hon. 
member argued, the Minister of Finance had established this 
nominating committee under the provisions of a bill not yet 
adopted by the House and not yet even considered by the standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member drew a parallel between this and two other cases 
raised in the House concerning government advertising on the GST. 
In the cases cited, Speaker Fraser had not found a breach of 
privilege because the departmental information alluded to 
“proposals”, thus it recognized that the legislation had not 
yet been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member, the case he put before the House 
is much more serious.  He argued that, in designating a committee 
defined in clause 10 of Bill C-2, the Minister of Finance had 
acted as if the bill is sure to be passed in its present form. In 
the opinion of the hon. member, to allow the government to 
proceed to act as if a bill has been approved by the House would 
set a dangerous precedent.  He stated this “undercuts the 
authority of Parliament and derogates from the rights and 
privileges of every member to have input into legislation prior 
to its enactment”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the arguments raised, the Leader of the 
Government in the House<B> </B>made the claim that the press release did 
not in any way seek to influence the House in its decision to adopt 
or reject the bill.  He added that the government's action was 
merely a prudent step so as to have sufficient lead time to prepare 
definitive appointments to the investment board if the bill were 
adopted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully examined the submissions from the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley and from the government House leader.  I think 
it may be useful to review the sequence of events on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, on October 8, 1997, the House adopted Bill 
C-2 at second reading and referred it to the Standing Committee 
on Finance. On October 23, the Department of Finance issued its 
press release and the next day, on October 24 during question 
period the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill asked a question on 
the establishment of this nominating committee and its effect on 
legislation before the House.  The hon. government House leader 
replied that the government was simply acting responsibly in 
putting in place the arrangements necessary to proceed if the 
bill were adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first tasks of the Speaker, when dealing with a 
question of privilege, is to determine whether the matter has 
been raised at the earliest possible opportunity.  As I have just 
indicated, the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill brought this 
matter to the attention of the House during question period on 
the day following the issue of the news release.  Clearly there 
was ample opportunity to raise the matter as a question of 
privilege at that time, yet three sitting days elapsed before the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley raised this question in the House.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if I may, I shall move on to the question of privilege 
per se, in order to determine whether any parliamentary privilege 
has been breached. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present case, the Chair cannot conclude that freedom of 
speech has been adversely affected since members will have the 
opportunity to debate Bill C-2 and propose amendments to it, 
either in the finance committee or in the House during report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might further ask whether this action has unduly prejudiced 
debate in committee or in the House.  Like Speaker Fraser in his 
October 10, 1989 ruling on GST advertising, I would say that this 
House has never had any difficulty in expressing its opinions 
when dealing with controversial situations.  The House is a forum 
for debate and the consideration of different points of view. 
Members do not work in a vacuum.  They are constantly aware of 
pressures and factors outside the House itself.  While an action 
like this one may offend some hon. members, it would be hard to 
make a case that it prejudiced debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, in examining the privilege of immunity from 
obstruction and intimidation, I cannot conclude that any hon. 
member has been obstructed in the performance of his or her 
parliamentary duties by the minister's action. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deciding a question of privilege, the Speaker must find 
whether, prima facie, there is sufficient cause to set aside the 
business of the House so that the House can consider a breach of 
one of its privileges or, more generally, a contempt of its 
authority.  In this case, I find that no specific privilege has 
been breached.  The authority given to this House to debate 
freely has not been compromised, nor has there been any 
obstruction or intimidation of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, the Chair acknowledges that this is a matter of 
potential importance since it touches the role of members as 
legislators, a role which should not be trivialized.  It is from 
this perspective that the actions of the Department of Finance 
are of some concern. 
The vocabulary of the news release is subject to varying 
interpretations.  But even if one argues that the subject of the 
news release is properly the creation of the nominating committee 
and not the progress of Bill C-2, the fact remains that the 
reference to the legislative process is cursory at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This dismissive view of the legislative process, repeated often 
enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and 
practices.  That it is the Department of Finance that is 
complained of once again has not gone unnoticed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that today's decision at this early stage of the 36th 
Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his officials 
and that the departments and agencies will be guided by it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After very carefully reflecting on this matter, 
and for the specific reasons explained, I have concluded that the 
matter submitted by the hon. member for Fraser Valley does not 
constitute, prima facie, a breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank hon. members for their contributions to this discussion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did I move this motion? Because we are convinced that Quebec is 
being treated with blatant unfairness regarding the harmonization of the 
provincial sales tax with the GST, compared to the three Atlantic 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is blatantly unfair to the people in Quebec who have had to 
support their share of the cost of the harminonizing carried out in the 
Atlantic provinces, while paying alone for harmonizing their own sales 
tax with the GST. 
It is also unfair, and I am saying so as industry critic, to Quebec 
businesses, out of which the Quebec government had to get more money not 
only by increasing their tax burden but also by putting restrictions on 
input tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such a major restriction that, through its finance 
minister, the Government of Quebec undertook to put up $500 million, if 
the federal government agrees with Quebec's figures, to complete the 
incomplete business harmonizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to mention that, like the Bloc Quebecois' 
position on this matter, this motion in no way constitutes an attack on 
the Atlantic provinces, which benefited from the federal proposal. We 
have nothing against equalization, on the contrary. But this is a 
completely different matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we see it, discouraged at being unable to convince all the 
provinces except for Quebec, which had readily agreed to harmonize, 
signing an agreement to that effect with the federal government back in 
1990, the federal government looked for some way of proving that it had 
acted, in part, on its promises. Finally, an agreement was reached with 
the Atlantic provinces, providing that they would harmonize their sales 
tax with the federal sales tax in exchange for $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, and this is one of our main reasons for presenting 
this motion this morning, the federal government gave the Atlantic 
provinces the means to intensify economic competition, by enabling Mr. 
McKenna, who was Premier of New Brunswick at the time, to compete 
unfairly with Quebec using full page ads announcing that better 
conditions could be found in New Brunswick for businesses. 
Quebeckers were stunned to see him do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the federal proposal allowed the Atlantic provinces to 
reduce their sales tax by four percentage points and to fully refund the 
tax paid by businesses on their input, which Quebec cannot do, since it 
paid for all this without any assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the federal government achieve this result? Simply by 
devising a formula designed to favour the maritimes. Without getting 
into details, the federal government's compensation formula provides 
that only the reduction of the sales tax level is to be compensated, and 
since that level exceeds 5%, it means the formula was tailored to the 
needs of the Atlantic provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> It is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Of course it is true. We are not lying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's formula does not recognize the type of 
losses incurred by Quebec. Yet, these losses are very real, because with 
a harmonized sales tax rate of 7%, revenues would have been $969 million 
less than those generated in 1990 with Quebec's retail sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confirms that the federal government does not recognize the 
costs involved. Over a four-year period, the shortfall will be $1.9 
billion, or $2 billion if you take into account the federal finance 
department's own figures. 
This amount of $2 billion is what the Quebec government and the 
opposition are claiming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we are not alone. All the partners at the economic summit in 
Quebec City supported this $2 billion claim. Moreover, the support does 
not only come from Quebec. When they met in St. Andrews, all the 
premiers supported Lucien Bouchard's claim for $2 billion. So, everyone 
in Quebec and all the provincial premiers support it. What are the 
federal government and the finance minister waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to give a chance to the government, we say “Let us ask 
experts—one appointed by the federal government, one appointed by the 
Quebec government, and a third one appointed by the first two—to 
evaluate the amount”. If the government is so confident in its 
calculations, why does it refuse to establish such a committee? 
And I would also say that, if the Government of Quebec was worried, 
why would it go along with the idea of a committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important issue.  Take the deep cuts 
Quebec suffered in the central government's deficit reducing 
exercise, and add the fact that it was the province that lost the 
most in the UI cuts, and that it was very hard hit by the cuts in 
health, education and social assistance, and two billion dollars 
adds up.  The cost to Quebeckers is phenomenal and it is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if the government thinks it is right, then it should at 
least be willing to submit its figures to a panel of experts for 
review. 
And if it is not willing, we will continue to say, with the support 
of Quebec's partners, with the support of Canada's premiers, that 
the central government treated Quebec with blatant unfairness in 
the matter of the harmonization carried out by that province, the 
first with the federal GST, a promise made by this government it 
will be recalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this motion will be passed unanimously by the 
House as a sign of minimal good faith towards Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline the background for the motion moved today in the 
House of Commons. In 1990, Quebec and the federal government signed a 
memorandum of agreement on harmonization of the provincial sales tax and 
the goods and services tax at 7%. Compensation was calculated for the 
calendar year during which the federal government and the province 
signed the memorandum of understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec did what it had to and harmonized its sales tax. It did so 
without any financial assistance. There were of course considerable 
financial costs involved. 
These costs were absorbed by increasing the tax burden for corporations 
and by applying restrictions to input tax refunds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Quebec sales tax system, large corporations can apply for 
an input tax refund only on certain goods and services acquired to 
conduct their business. For these corporations, this represents 
additional costs totalling $500 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So those who are in fact being penalized by the federal government, 
which refuses any financial compensation for the Government of Quebec, 
are Quebec businesses. These still cannot benefit from the tax breaks 
that harmonization gave to competing firms in the three Atlantic 
provinces. 
This situation is especially unfair when you consider that the tax 
benefits given to corporations in the Atlantic provinces were in part 
financed by the taxes paid by individuals and businesses in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this compensation, the Atlantic provinces were able to 
harmonize their sales tax in one single operation. In Quebec, 
harmonization is not yet completed; it is being phased in over several 
years due to the fact that it is impossible to remit the input tax 
refund to businesses because this would entail, according to 
conservative estimates, a loss of around 10% in provincial sales tax 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1996, the federal government announced the signature 
of memorandums of understanding with the three Atlantic provinces, 
whereby their respective sales taxes would be harmonized beginning April 
1, 1997, at a combined rate of 15%. 
To compensate financial losses in these three provinces, the federal 
government will grant them, under a readjustment program, compensation 
totalling almost $1 billion, the equivalent of $423 per capita. The 
federal government also announced that Quebec, the only jurisdiction to 
have harmonized its tax, could not benefit from this new readjustment 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions are being raised concerning this financial compensation 
program. Was it designed so that only certain groups could receive this 
funding? The financial assistance program that is benefiting the 
Atlantic provinces does so at the expense of Quebec. It only considers 
sales tax revenues instead of the whole tax base representing the 
provinces' global tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the share of provincial sales tax revenues 
compared to total tax revenues for 1994 was 8.6% for Quebec compared to 
12.9% for the Atlantic provinces. These figures are real and can be 
verified, since they come from statistics on government revenue 
published by the OECD and Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government established that the compensation is equal 
to 100% of the cost of harmonisation exceeding 5% of the provincial 
sales tax returns before harmonisation for the first two years, 50% for 
the third year and 25% for the fourth year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec believes it is entitled to compensation and the Bloc 
Quebecois supports that claim. 
On Friday, December 13, 1996, Bernard Landry and Jacques Brassard held 
a press conference to demand that Quebec receive compensation of $2 
billion for having harmonized its PST to the GST. Quebec acted alone and 
without any financial support. 
This compensation would represent an amount of $273 per person, which is 
clearly less than the amount of $423 paid to the Atlantic provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the federal government still refuses to pay compensation to 
Quebec on the ground that harmonization of the PST and GST has cost it 
nothing. Now, one only has to look at the public accounts and budget 
documents to see the magnitude of the costs involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual conference of premiers of August 1996, which was held in 
Jasper, supported the position of the Quebec finance minister by saying 
that all provinces should benefit equally from the agreements on 
harmonization, including compensation. 
We have had support from various sources. Participants to the 1996 
socio-economic summit, even the Leader of the Opposition in Quebec, 
whose political leanings are well known, supported Quebec's position. 
Last but not least, premiers meeting in St. Andrews in 1997 renewed 
their support for Quebec's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the strength of such overwhelming support, the Bloc Quebecois 
would like the federal finance minister to admit his calculations are 
flawed. This is the reason why, during the last federal election 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois leader asked the Liberal government to 
create an independent arbitration panel to put an end to the deadlock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day, the minister has turned a deaf ear to this request. 
He insists his numbers are accurate and says that he has taken the right 
decision. 
Why then is he so afraid to face independent experts and show he is 
right when Quebec's deputy premier and finance minister are willing to 
compare their numbers with Paul Martin's so that justice may be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that voting against this motion means 
that the arguments used so far by the federal finance minister would not 
stand the comparison with Quebec's. We want to settle this dispute once 
and for all so that independent experts may come to a clear and fair 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go so far as to amend the motion. Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK39">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the 
motion be amended by deleting the word “blatant” and 
substituting the following therefor: “flagrant”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>   Madam Speaker, I 
listened with intent to the hon. member for Mercier and also the 
last intervener. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harmonization of the GST is a positive thing economically. I 
will give one example.  My riding is highly influenced by General 
Motors which pays provincial sales tax on its input costs. When 
it exports it does not get a relieving provision which is what 
the GST basically does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that the costs for automobiles manufactured in Ontario 
and landed in the United States are greater than for those 
produced in St. Therese, Quebec, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that Quebec harmonized the GST quickly gave it a 
tremendous economic advantage.  If there is anyone who should 
receive compensation I would argue that it is the laggers such as 
my own province, which has refused to move into the area of 
harmonization. The Quebec economy has received great economic 
advantage for doing that early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if that is part of the calculation, how much benefit 
has been realized from looking forward to export trade which 
Quebec has already received by harmonizing quickly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, the member is right on one 
thing: we had a vision.  We were the first ones, in 1990, to harmonize 
our tax without expecting anything in return.  Speaking of shortfall, we 
feel it is only fair to receive compensation.  A loss of $500 million on 
inputs is a lot of money for Quebec businesses.

addressing all these issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, our colleagues on 
the other side seem to forget one thing when they say the sales tax 
harmonization was profitable for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we benefited from that, but we paid what was required for 
it before we could reap the benefits. I would compare that situation to 
a landlord investing $100,000 in renovations on a house in order to 
increase the rents afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite are saying: “Because the landlord refurbished 
his house, he earned a higher income from the rents, so it was 
profitable”.  But the $100,000 the landlord spent on repairs in 
order to harmonize his building with standards, they refuse to 
take it into account, they will not give it to Quebec.  However, 
they grant it to the Atlantic provinces because they presumably 
suffered some losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of harmonization for the Atlantic provinces are 
reimbursed, but Quebec is denied compensation for the same costs.  They 
will only take into account revenues and advantages obtained by Quebec 
because it implemented harmonization voluntarily but they will refund 
New Brunswick since that province was somehow forced into harmonization 
because the Liberal government wanted to show it had changed its GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When comparing things, one should do it properly.  If the 
government is so certain it was not both judge and jury in this 
instance, it should submit its figures to a committee, as we are asking. 
Let the government submit its data and let the committee look at them 
impartially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to add a comment to 
what my colleague just told the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Government of Quebec began working on harmonization, it 
was wise enough to avoid penalizing people with a tax on fuel and 
tobacco. Had it done so, it might have jeopardized the businesses 
concerned. In any case, consumers would have been very unhappy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that a sales tax is calculated only on the sales tax and 
not on the tax base harshly penalizes the province of Quebec. We will 
get back to this later today. However, we demonstrated a lot of wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The amendment proposed by the 
member for Louis-Hébert is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial 
Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the reason why Quebec and other 
provinces entered into an agreement with Canada to harmonize sales taxes 
is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of two taxes, there is only one; a single tax base, a 
single tax form and a single tax administration.  For small and medium 
size businesses this means an end to the burden of overlap and 
duplication.  This is the reason why Quebec entered into an agreement 
with Canada.  Quebec acted in a very practical manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With today's motion, the Bloc is again shooting blanks. Its motion 
is based on the wrong assumption that harmonization of the Quebec sales 
tax and the GST was unfair to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over some facts which have been pointed out many 
times in this House over the last few years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense, what the Bloc is doing today is really business as 
usual, it is twisting the facts to try to discredit the federal system, 
a system which has no place in the separatists' future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions, our government went over the facts with 
representatives of Quebec and explained to them why Quebec did not meet 
the objective eligibility requirements for adjustment assistance. 
Moreover, officials received a detailed technical brief on this subject 
explaining, among other things, our federal program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, provinces were offered an adjustment assistance if they 
were willing to implement a value added tax which would be fully 
harmonized with the GST and who, as a result, would suffer significant 
losses in sales tax revenues. It has been clearly demonstrated that 
Quebec demands did not meet the factual eligibility requirements to get 
this kind of financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the preset formula, we consider that significant losses should 
be higher than 5% of sales tax revenues. The trigger level has been set 
at 5% for two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, heavier losses between 7% or 8% would be too hard to 
factor in, and the revision of already established fiscal plans a 
difficult exercise. And losses of less than 5% are similar to normal 
revenue variations governments can adjust to when they reorganize their 
programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the same percentage is used, and for the same reasons, in 
the federal stabilization program. With this formula, Ontario, Quebec, 
British Columbia and Alberta would not qualify for assistance. Sales tax 
revenue losses in Quebec would not have been high enough to warrant any 
adjustment assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, it has been just the opposite. Sales tax revenues in 
Quebec have increased significantly. Moreover, the stated goal of the 
Quebec sales tax initiative was not only to avoid any revenue loss, but 
also to generate higher revenues. Since the tax was harmonized, revenues 
have gone up $3.46 billion. They did not drop. Even the Quebec 
government public accounts confirm this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Quebec government is trying to do right now is to include 
annual losses resulting from a reduction in the tax rate on fuel and 
tobacco products. That has nothing to do with the sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these losses excluded, the amount the Quebec government is 
demanding would be $1 billion less. Elimination of other irregularities 
would bring the estimated amount to zero. The Quebec government has also 
underestimated by more than $300 million its harmonized sales tax 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government co-operated fully with Quebec officials in 
these discussions and this analysis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1996, we provided Quebec with the precise method used to 
determine adjustment assistance, the results of our calculations and the 
figures Quebec could use to determine its own eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had numerous discussions and exchanges of 
information in order to clarify its numerous figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again in the history of our great country, facts prove that 
Quebec, far from suffering a loss, benefited in fact from Canadian 
federalism by harmonizing its provincial sales tax with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this matter proves once again that BQ members do not 
know how to add, subtract and multiply; they only know how to divide. 
That is the only role of the Bloc Quebecois.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question to the Liberal member. If he says that this 
legitimate request from Quebec is like shooting blanks, if he says that 
our case is weak, if he says that we have no reason to submit a bill for 
$2 billion to the federal government, why is the federal government 
refusing our offer, which is very reasonable in this case? This is to 
avoid constant wars with numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our offer is to appoint an independent committee of experts that 
would analyze our numbers and the government's numbers. If this 
assessment would show that we are wrong, we would humbly admit it. 
However, if we are right, the committee would have the power to force 
the federal government to pay the $2 billion. That is my first remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second one. If this is like shooting blanks and if this is 
a feeble attempt by the Bloc Quebecois to sow dissension, I would like 
the member to explain to me how it is that all provincial premiers, who 
are not members of the Bloc Quebecois—Mr. Harris and Mr. Clark are 
not members of the Bloc Quebecois—support the Quebec government in 
this request for a payment of $2 billion? I would like him to explain 
this to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is obvious. We openly and on 
several occasions provided the details of our program. According to its 
own calculations, the Quebec government did not incur any loss of sales 
tax revenues. Following harmonization, the province's sales tax revenue 
increased by more than $3 billion. The figures were openly discussed 
with Quebec officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those who remain objective in this debate and really want 
to know the facts, instead of trying to demolish the Canadian 
Confederation, the facts are so obvious that it is pointless to waste 
any time discussing them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
tell the member who just spoke and seems refuse to admit the obvious 
that the Atlantic provinces had chosen. Rather than having a higher 
income tax rates they had chosen, as a way to collect taxes, to have a 
higher sales tax. Of course, in the Minister of Finance's calculations, 
they could lose 5% of their revenue by harmonizing. But it was a 
political choice they had made. Rather than having a fairer tax rate 
they had preferred to have a higher tax rate. 
The fact remains that harmonization has cost and is still costing a lot 
of money to the Government of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question to the minister who just spoke. If 
there had been a sovereignist government rather than a federalist one in 
Quebec City when this deal was signed in 1990 might things have been the 
same? In fact, I put this question to Quebecers: Do you see how a 
federalist government in Quebec City has served us in the harmonization 
process with the federal government? I would like him to answer that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleagues will indicate 
exactly what Canada has given to the province of Quebec. That being 
said, the hon. member opposite is wrong because what we have done under 
the harmonization scheme with those three Atlantic provinces was very 
simple: the sales tax levels in these three provinces, among the poorest 
in Canada, were at 19%, almost 20%. As part of our harmonization scheme, 
we found that it would be necessary to bring this level down to 
something much more reasonable. That is why we established a 15% tax 
rate, reasonable under the circumstances. That is why there resulted a 
loss of revenue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise to this motion today.  I must tell members 
that our party will be standing in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think that my hon. friends from the Liberal Party and from 
the Bloc both missed the most important point.  I want to make my 
argument on three different tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, while we know that the Atlantic provinces did 
receive compensation in the harmonization deal, we should not 
assume for a moment that compensation was the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if it was wrong to give that money to Atlantic Canada, 
then it is equally wrong to offer that kind of compensation, if 
you want to call it that.  I think it is euphemistic to call it 
compensation.  It is wrong to offer it to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we should point out that Quebec entered into this deal 
willingly. It asserted its independence and made this deal quite 
willingly in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to expand on those points.  The first thing is was the 
money that was paid to Atlantic Canada really compensation?  We 
should ask ourselves how this all came to pass.  We look back on 
this, back to 1993, to the deputy prime minister's promise on 
national television about scrapping the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about the sorry episode that followed thereafter. We 
ended up with the deputy prime minister's having to resign and 
run in a byelection.  She was eventually demoted.  She lost her 
job as the deputy prime minister.  It was a sorry episode in the 
history of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what happened when the government was trying to find 
some way to make it look like it fulfilled its promise, it rushed 
out to Atlantic Canada and said “we will give you $1 billion in 
political hush money if you will go along with our harmonization 
deal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do my friends in the Bloc think that comes from, that 
billion dollars?  It does not just come from the mint.  We do not 
just print it.  It comes from taxpayers, including from taxpayers 
in Quebec who already face the highest tax burdens in the country 
almost and probably in certain ways they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that taxpayers had to cough up that billion 
dollars from all across the country.  Just because Atlantic 
Canadians received this money in what I think was kind of an 
unseemly way does not mean we should also offer it to the 
province of Quebec.  Two wrongs simply do not make a right.  They 
never have and they never will.  We absolutely disagree with the 
premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch for a moment on the last point I made which was 
that this money comes from Canadians.  Where is this money 
supposed to come from in the current context? 
The government is talking about a fiscal dividend, however we 
want to define that, but certainly it will have a surplus.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that money going toward reducing the debt, which sits 
at $600 billion, instead of reducing the tremendous tax burden 
that people face in this country, personal income tax rates that, 
relative to our G-7 trading partners, are 52% higher than the 
average, which is absolutely shameful, instead of granting relief 
to those people, including the people of Quebec who stagger under 
even higher burdens than the Canadian average, according to the 
Bloc Quebecois plan we are going to give the money to governments 
to do with it what they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that the money is much better left in the hands of 
taxpayers.  We will make that argument forcefully over the next 
several months as that issue grips the nation.  It is certainly a 
big issue today.  We say let us remember where that money is 
coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to make is that Quebec is the one that 
entered into this deal willingly, presumably because it thought 
it would help its economy.  It asserted its independence, which 
is always the argument of the Bloc Quebecois members, “we are an 
independent nation, we are a people, we will go ahead and make 
our own deals”.  They did make their own deal.  Now they are 
saying “we have decided that we want to change our mind; not 
only did we make a bad decision back then but we want 
compensation for making a bad decision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot have it both ways.  I point out to my friends in the 
Bloc that almost every program we have in this country today is a 
transfer program of some kind.  Inevitably my friends in Quebec 
do extraordinarily well, which is one of the most compelling 
arguments we can make to keep them in Confederation. Why in the 
world would they step out into the great unknown when they know 
that they have not only very generous equalization programs but 
even in programs like the Canada health and social transfer they 
do extraordinarily well. Almost every program has become a 
transfer program of some kind; the harmonization deal obviously 
for Atlantic Canada, but two wrongs do not make a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the infrastructure program was based on a formula that 
included unemployment so that higher unemployment provinces like 
Quebec got more money. What about employment insurance?  Huge 
amounts of money are sent into a province like Quebec because we 
have regionally extended benefits primarily as an inducement to 
keep provinces like Quebec in the fold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have regional development which overwhelmingly benefits 
provinces like Quebec.  Even the cultural grants in this country 
disproportionately go to the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making the point that Quebec has already done 
extraordinarily well by Confederation.  With the greatest of 
respect to some of my friends in the Bloc, this is beyond the 
pale.  They are simply asking too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to conclude simply by saying that compensation to 
Quebec for the GST deal which it entered into sets a horrible 
precedent.  Canadians simply cannot afford it.  If we do it for 
Quebec then we need to do it for every province.  We are talking 
about not a few billion but tens of billions of dollars. Ontario 
would want $3 billion and on and on it would go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is this money supposed to come from?  Where does it come 
from?  It comes from the pockets of ordinary Canadians.  We 
simply cannot afford to tax them ever more to give money to 
provincial governments.  It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first point I want to make in summarizing as we 
enter this whole debate about the fiscal dividend.  Let us not 
give the money away before we even get to the point where we have 
some money to give away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us remember that two wrongs do not make a right.  It 
does not make any sense that because money was paid to Atlantic 
Canada as sort of political hush money because of a dirty 
political promise that the then deputy prime minister made that 
it necessarily follows that we give the money to Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my friends in the Bloc that they entered into 
this deal willingly.  They made that decision in 1991 and rushed 
headlong in.  They undoubtedly will enjoy the benefits of 
harmonization.  They claim they already have.  Are they to argue 
then that if they do better in the long run on harmonization than 
they projected they will turn some of the benefit back to the 
federal government?  I doubt it.  I do not think we will hear 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that Reformers will be voting against 
this motion.  We think it is a foolhardy motion.  We think the 
best solution of all is to take that fiscal dividend and turn it 
back to ordinary Canadians to spend in the most productive way 
possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was 
happy to hear the member for Medicine Hat admit that the 
harmonization system may well be a benefit.  It seems to me it 
was that party that argued against the harmonization in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with intent as the member talked about the importance 
of reducing taxes and getting taxes back in the hands of everyday 
Canadians.  He also asked where the money was coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in this country a program of equalization payments. It 
is a very complex formula but basically the object is to bring 
everybody in the country to common standards in health and 
education.  Through the mechanism of the equalization payments 
certain portions of this country are already sending money to the 
Atlantic provinces.  As a nation we want to build a dynamic 
economy.  One of the features is a harmonized sales tax in the 
Atlantic provinces to allow those provinces to compete 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big features of a harmonization package is to reduce 
sales taxes for Canadians in the Atlantic provinces.  It did just 
what the member is talking about.  It reduced taxes and allowed 
more disposable income in the hands of Atlantic Canadians.  Can 
they not see that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am surprised that the 
hon. member does not recall the debate a little better.  One of 
the reasons that the Reform Party opposed this was precisely that 
it raised taxes in Atlantic Canada on the most vulnerable 
Canadians.  As members of the NDP pointed out, in those provinces 
we were going to see an actual reduction in the cost of a yacht 
but on essentials like fuel for heating their homes and 
children's clothing we were going to see increased prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member stand there and say that somehow this is a 
benefit to the people who are most vulnerable in Atlantic Canada? 
It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out to my hon. friend that part of this deal 
stipulates that it takes only a majority of the provinces to 
raise the rate for the harmonized sales tax but an absolute 
unanimity of all the provinces to lower it.  In having a debate 
today about what to do with the fiscal dividend, we would need 
all the provinces on board to say we are going to lower that rate 
in order for Canadians to enjoy tax relief from the harmonized 
sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world would people who want to see some tax relief 
today stand up and support that type of deal when it essentially 
guarantees they will never see tax relief on the harmonized sales 
tax front?  It is a crazy idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Nipigon, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the member from Medicine Hat a couple of 
questions with respect to the speech he just gave. 
I am a bit disturbed by the tone of the debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi:</B>  I see my colleague opposite, in his 
anger, has not yet begun to pay attention to what is happening. 
If he would wait I am sure he would get an opportunity to speak 
in due course.  That is a rule of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tone of the debate seems to be heading toward divisiveness 
and the fostering the divisiveness in the country that we are all 
trying to correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of what the member for Medicine Hat just said in the 
House, does he agree with the following two points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the House of Commons has a fundamental role when a 
country is as big as Canada.  Some areas are more productive than 
others.  Should we as a federal state be responsible for the 
distribution of the wealth in order to look after people living 
in certain regions who are not as fortunate to have the same 
natural resources as perhaps the people in his province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he talked about the surplus and a tax dividend.  Should 
we not first be looking at improving health care, improving the 
educational system and improving the transportation system?  Are 
they not the best places to put our funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, the most important role 
of the federal government is to ensure equality of provinces, to 
ensure that provinces are treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not rule out equalization.  Our party agrees with 
equalization.  We do not happen to think that three provinces 
should support seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also pay attention to outcomes.  We should ask 
ourselves whether or not it has actually worked to subsidize some 
provinces to the degree we have.  Has it created the type of 
prosperity that will allow them to stand on their own two feet? I 
would argue that it has not.  If it had worked everybody in 
Atlantic Canada would have six jobs.  Most of them cannot find 
one today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians disagree with the hon. member when he says that we 
should pour more money into spending.  Recent poles indicate that 
people want to see the debt paid down.  They want to see tax 
relief.  Only 13% want to see some spending.  Instead of spending 
more money in absolute terms, we should focus some of the 
spending, take it out of unproductive areas of which there are 
many in government and focus it on areas that are important to 
people like health care, education, and research and development.

before the October 95 referendum, when people from English Canada came

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question to the hon. member. In his speech, he made much 
of the fact that Quebec is costing a great deal to Canada, particularly 
in terms of unemployment insurance. 
So let us go then; we want to go away. Let us leave!

taxes, the harmonized sales tax in certain provinces and the GST 
which symbolizes most what Canadian taxpayers feel is the 
ultimate betrayal in recent political history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer back to the election when the Liberals first came to 
power.  I remember local candidate in Kamloops saying that if the 
Liberals were elected they would abolish the GST.  In opposition 
they had spoken about the GST for many years.  They called it a 
hated tax, a payroll tax, a tax that would destroy jobs, a job 
killer.  Then when they were on the verge of becoming government 
they said if elected they would scrap the tax, abolish it, do 
away with it, because it was an evil, bad tax.

the government would actually do away with the dreaded tax. 
Obviously it was one of the most regressive taxes ever levied in 
the country because it did not discriminate between the rich and 
the poor.  When a rich person buys snow tires and a winter 
battery, he or she will pay exactly the same tax as the poor 
person buying the same items.  It does not make any difference. 
Obviously it is a very regressive tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the citizens were betrayed, misled and 
lied to.  I am not saying any individual lied, but a whole group 
of individuals lied called Liberal candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the election the government decided that rather than 
abolish or scrap the GST as was promised it would harmonize the 
GST.  Harmonize is a good word.  We all like to harmonize things. 
We like to sing in harmony or harmonize a community.  The 
harmonized tax was to blend provincial and federal taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked when the Government of Quebec acted so 
enthusiastically. 
It said that this was a great idea.  It wanted to harmonize 
first.  It wanted to be the first to harmonize the GST and the 
provincial sales tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let my friends in the Bloc explain why this sort of 
enthusiastic cheerleader approach was followed.  I never 
understood it.  All the evidence I saw at that time, all the 
evidence I have seen since and all the evidence I have on my desk 
before me today indicate that taxpayers pay more under the 
blended tax.  The short and long of it is that taxpayers will pay 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say that might be the NDP analysis.  Let us refer to 
someone other than the New Democratic Party of Canada.  What 
about the dominion bond rating agencies?  They thought they 
should do a very thorough summary, at least in the Atlantic 
provinces, to find out the impact of the blended sales tax in 
what they called the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read two or three of the summary comments.  They stated 
that there would be a net revenue loss for the provinces.  That 
is not surprising.  That is what everybody predicted.  They 
stated that consumers would not benefit.  They stated that the 
federal government would benefit because it would make progress 
toward complete harmonization and the burying of the GST.  In 
other words, hiding the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably one of the ultimate goals was to hide the GST so that 
people would not be reminded every time they bought a good or a 
service that they were being taxed by the federal government. The 
idea was to hide it from the consumer, and the blended sales tax 
would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analysis of the dominion bond rating agencies goes on for 
pages and pages.  I could quote it until the time I have for my 
presentation runs out.  They said there were two losers: 
provincial governments and consumers.  They said the net benefit 
for business was negligible if at all.  The availability of input 
tax credits was offset by the imposition of new taxes, as well as 
taxation on newly generated income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who benefits from it?  The federal government sees it as a way 
to get off the hook, but it could not fool most Canadians so 
easily as presumably the Government of Quebec was fooled.  I 
cannot to this day understand why the Government of Quebec was so 
enthusiastic to join with the federal government.  I will leave 
that aside.  It must have had its reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Atlantic provinces?  Interestingly enough, there 
were Liberal governments in Ottawa, in Newfoundland, in New 
Brunswick and in Nova Scotia.  I guess the prime minister said 
that they had to help out by joining in on the blended sales tax 
business to get it started.  I guess he said that the Government 
of Quebec had been conned and they had to be onside to get this 
thing happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic premiers thought they would lose money.  The prime 
minister said “What about a bribe?  What about a billion dollar 
bribe?  Would that help?” The premiers could probably be bought 
off for a billion dollars.  They could do a lot of politicking 
with an extra billion dollars, and so they did. The three Liberal 
premiers of the Atlantic Canadian provinces of Newfoundland, Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick accepted a billion dollar bribe to force 
the blended sales tax, the harmonized sales tax, on the citizens 
of the three provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government went to Prince Edward Island, which also had 
a Liberal premier, but there was an election on the horizon.  In 
other words, the Liberal Government of Prince Edward Island would 
have to go to the people soon.  Its members said that they could 
never sell it, that they did not have time to brainwash the 
people of Prince Edward Island, that they could never con them or 
fool them into believing it was good for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence was mounting by the day.  The Liberal Premier of 
Prince Edward Island said they could not be bought, could not be 
bribed, and would not be part of it.  Indeed it is not a part of 
it to this day.  Now there is a Conservative Premier of Prince 
Edward Island.  The last thing he will try to do is jam the 
blended sales tax down the throats of the people of Prince Edward 
Island.  The people of Prince Edward Island know what it will do 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will it do?  The Standing Committee on Finance finished a 
tour of Atlantic Canada.  We went to all the capital cities.  We 
talked to people about the economic and fiscal situation of 
Canada.  A number of them indicated that the fact the average 
family in Atlantic Canada had to pay the blended sales tax meant 
the average family was paying out as much as $600 more a year in 
taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way on the Liberal benches should be 
hanging their heads in shame, running out the back door and 
having a coffee.  The president of Noranda in his speech the 
other day in Halifax indicated that 52% of working Canadians make 
less than $20,000 a year in income.  Those are working Canadians. 
We know that unfortunately a large number of people in Atlantic 
Canada do not have jobs period. If the average working family is 
making less than $20,000, imagine the devastating inhuman impact 
an increase in taxes of $600 a year would mean to those families. 
It means necessities have to be abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most troubling days of my life as an elected 
representative was the day I went into an elementary Christian 
school in my constituency.  We talked about the life of an MP and 
what we did, that part of the job was to raise money to do good 
works.  That was the kind of theme I was trying to develop.  I 
asked if there were any questions.  A little girl in grade four 
or five said  “Every Saturday my mom and I go to the bookstore 
to buy books about Jesus. I have to pay a tax on these books.  I 
even have to pay a tax on my Bible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 20 minutes, Madam Speaker, and I have not spoken for 20 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The little girl felt it was unjust that she was paying the GST 
on her religious story books for Sunday school and on the Bible. 
She asked me to explain why we were doing this to her.  I could 
not explain.  I did not want to say that the Liberals were cruel 
or that they had imposed this regressive tax because I do not 
think it is fair for a young child to hear that kind of message. 
I said that sometimes governments just do odd and silly things, 
inappropriate things.  Many other terms were on my lips at that 
time but I was in a Christian school— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must advise the 
hon. member that his time was only 10 minutes, being the third 
speaker to address this subject.  If the hon. member has the 
unanimous consent of the House, he could go on for another eight 
or nine minutes.  Is there agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for 
this extension.  I will conclude my remarks quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my case.  We can say this is the most 
dreaded tax in the country.  What is more important than what I 
have said so far is the fact that in my judgment the imposition 
of the GST and now the blended sales tax, the HST, is the straw 
that broke the back of the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People knew that our tax system was unjust, unfair and biased. 
There is no question about that. People realized that they had to 
pay taxes in order to get many of the programs we value in our 
country, but the GST was too much.  It pushed people too hard. It 
broke the will of people to comply with the tax system of our 
country so the economy started to move underground in a serious 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most popular books for about three months of the year on 
Canada's news stands are on how to beat the tax man, how to evade 
taxes.  Look in this morning's paper.  On the financial pages 
there were a number of seminars on how to move taxes offshore, 
how to set up an offshore tax haven. These seminars are being 
held in the capital city.  People have lost faith in our tax 
system so they are finding ways and means to avoid paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have seen no empirical evidence I suspect a lot of 
Canadians these days are not paying the taxes they are actually 
obligated to pay, in the underground economy or whatever.  I am 
loath to say these are bad citizens because they know our system 
is so corrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend said earlier, people in Atlantic Canada know the 
tax system is wrong when there are folks who buy expensive yachts 
and get tax breaks while they now have to pay extra taxes on 
their children's winter clothing, on their books and school 
supplies and on heating fuel. 
It penalizes the working poor, the jobless and the victims of an 
economic downturn.  They are punished and treated more cruelly 
under this blended sales tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my friends across the way in the Liberal Party.  They 
are nice people but why do they continue to perpetuate this cruel 
tax on us?  Why do they keep telling people they are going to tax 
children's clothing and books?  We would have to look long and 
hard to find a a country around the world that says, “What we 
are going to do now is we are going to tax reading material, 
books”.  It is silly and regressive in a knowledge based economy 
to be taxing literature and books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize my time is up and I do not want to abuse the privilege 
that my colleagues have given me to conclude my remarks. Suffice 
it to say that we are not at all keen on the GST.  If the 
government is going to listen to Canadians, listen to what they 
said on the weekend when they responded to the poll that asked: 
If there is a tax decrease planned in the next budget, what kind 
of tax decrease should it be?  Overwhelmingly, some 80% of 
Canadians said to begin to lower the GST.  That would put money 
in every community in Canada tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the money being taken out by increased GST premiums, 
increased payroll taxes and so on, every dollar we can put back 
into the small and medium size communities and rural areas of 
Canada would be helpful, to say nothing of the urban areas.  If 
we reduce that level of the GST tomorrow, it means that every 
single Canadian citizen would actually have extra money in their 
pockets to spend. Maybe $1, maybe $5, maybe $20.  Most people we 
know spend the money.  They are not putting it into savings 
accounts.  They need it simply to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the enthusiastic endorsement of the Government of 
Quebec on the blended sales tax was wrong.  We believe that the 
bribe to Atlantic Canada was wrong in principle.  Therefore we 
obviously are not supportive of this motion that would simply 
give another bribe to Quebec to say thank you for joining in this 
rather odd and peculiar tax scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will say, obviously we are not going to be 
supporting this initiative put forward by my friends in the Bloc.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we all know the values that are dear to the New Democratic 
Party. This is a party that promotes more fairness, justice and 
openness. I have to tell you that I find the statements made by the hon. 
member for Kamloops, and particularly his conclusion, rather confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope he was not talking on behalf of his party. I do hope this 
is not the final position of his party. However, I would like the hon. 
member to tell us if he thinks the province of Quebec was treated fairly 
and appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec agreed, in all good faith, to harmonize its 
sales tax in 1991 and never received any compensation for it. 
On the other hand, the Atlantic provinces harmonize their tax and are 
compensated. According to his deep values and principles, does the hon. 
member think this is a fair, normal and acceptable way to treat the 
province of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, my friend makes a very 
convincing argument.  First, I do speak for my party.  No, we do 
not think it is fair.  We think the point being made in today's 
opposition day debate is reasonable.  There was an unfairness. 
The people of Quebec through their government were not treated 
equitably or fairly.  They were not treated in the same fashion 
as the people in the three Atlantic provinces were treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he used the term compensation, which is a fair term.  I 
use the term bribe.  I do not believe that bribes are appropriate 
in any circumstance.  I do believe that the provinces in Atlantic 
Canada were bribed quite frankly.  It is a cruel and very brutal 
term but not believing in bribery I cannot say that knowing they 
were bribed we should probably bribe another province as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend's point is well taken. There was an injustice.  Yes 
some provinces were treated differently from other provinces. 
More particularly the province of Quebec was not treated in the 
same way the other provinces were treated. They were given a 
bribe and Quebec was not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Kamloops as I always do.  I 
suppose that if, when my government showed up at this House in 
1993 there had been no GST, things would have been a lot 
different. The reality is that it had been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about being on the finance committee.  I did 
that trip.  Only we were talking about a harmonized tax at the 
time. The small and medium sized business people said 
resoundingly “Harmonize the tax.  We are dealing with two 
administrations here.  It is ridiculous.  The bureaucratic 
overlap and duplication for small businesses is inefficient”. It 
was that initiative, to make a dynamic economy, to get more money 
in the hands of Atlantic Canadians which we strove for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is not just Canada.  It is Australia.  It 
is the European Union.  It is New Zealand.  All these countries 
have moved toward a consumption tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member when he says it is a retrogressive tax 
in the sense that it affects all income groups the same.  What I 
cannot understand is the member's acceptance of having said that 
and at the same time arguing for a reduction in the rate because 
if it is retrogressive on the upscale, it is retrogressive on the 
downscale. When those reductions are given, they are being given 
to the wealthy just as they are being given to the poor.  Why 
would the NDP members not argue for a more targeted tax cut?  Why 
do they want to reduce a retrogressive tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, my friend's question is a 
very valid one.  I want first of all to say that while there was 
some enthusiasm on the part of business for a blended sales tax, 
I think it was also predicated on the fact that they were 
assuming it would be blended across the country.  Increasingly as 
companies do business across provincial lines and 
internationally, this adds even more confusion in terms of the 
business that they do. However, we will set that aside and I will 
answer my friend's question directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position as a political party is that we would like to see 
the eventual phase out of the GST.  As we get into a more fiscally 
realistic era it would make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts obviously will become a reality one day.  The fairest 
way would be to eliminate and phase out the GST.  The reality is 
to go from its present level to zero in one fell swoop would be 
irresponsible.  We simply cannot afford that as a country at this 
point. Therefore, a phase down to us makes more sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A phase down of the GST would create a lot more jobs than an 
across the board corporate tax cut, an across the board personal 
tax cut.  I agree that some selected tax expenditures would be 
appropriate as well, but the GST phase down would put money in 
people's pockets immediately and hopefully one day we would see 
the end of the dreaded GST. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, we support 
harmonization with the provinces provided they are all treated 
equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Government of Quebec benefited from harmonization at 
the time, there was no discussion about compensation. Now that 
the eastern provinces have followed the same path of 
harmonization at a loss of more than 5% of their revenue, the 
provincial Liberals negotiated with the federal Liberals for a 
compensation of $1 billion total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In retrospect Quebec thinks it should be compensated.  However 
it is not the only province that will not receive compensation 
upon harmonization.  Ontario will not, Alberta will not and also 
B.C. will not.  These provinces pay substantially to those 
provinces that are being compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberal government verbally promised to eliminate, 
scrap and abolish the GST.  The Liberal red book itself was much 
more vague however. 
It only promised to replace the GST with another tax, a vague 
system that was supposed to generate revenue, claimed to be 
fairer to consumers and small businesses, promised to minimize 
disruption to small businesses and promised to promote 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal red book pledged “Give the all-party finance 
committee of the House of Commons a 12-month mandate to consult 
fully with Canadians and provincial governments and to report on 
ways to achieve tax fairness, simplicity and harmonization.  In 
particular, the committee will be mandated to report on all 
options and alternatives to the current GST”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals led voters to believe that they would scrap the 
GST, not hide it in the price in three provinces which they have 
tried to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals used to think the GST was not visible enough.  As 
the former member of Acadie—Bathurst and Liberal finance critic 
once said “The whole idea of visibility was seen by many 
Canadians as being a deterrent to free spending governments which 
would just raise the tax, get the money it needs at election time 
for promises, spend it foolishly and then all of a sudden be in 
extremely difficult times”. Even the Liberal MP for 
Kenora—Rainy River said “To keep the GST hidden from Canadians 
is despicable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said that harmonization is a step toward replacing 
the GST.  The Minister of Finance said “There is some 
possibility that when we take power in 1992 the provinces will 
entrench the GST in their sales tax regimes—It would be 
extremely difficult to undo in that instance, but I would 
consider removing it nonetheless, and in all other scenarios I am 
committed to scrapping the GST and replacing it with an 
alternative”. The minister also called the GST a regressive and 
unfair tax on living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance promised to do away with the tax and 
replace it with an alternative method of collecting moneys. Why 
has he not done so?  Why has he not honoured these promises? 
Because the GST is, in fact, a fair and equitable method of 
collecting tax for this country. It was a well thought out plan 
on the part of the Tory government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1996 the federal government along with Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland agreed to harmonize their sales taxes 
and to bury them in the price.  It was no surprise that all 
governments involved were Liberals. To entice the three provinces 
to participate, the Liberal government paid almost $1 billion in 
compensation according to negotiations struck.  This allowed the 
participating provinces to reduce their sales tax for a combined 
federal-provincial rate of 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they failed to realize, or maybe they did, that far 
more goods and services would now be taxed.  Those living in the 
three Atlantic provinces have been hardest hit.  The HST attacks 
low and low middle income Canadians the most.  Instead of paying 
only the GST, now they must pay the GST and HST, an increase of 
8%, on electricity, fuel, oil, food, children's clothing, 
gasoline, telephone, haircuts and school books.  Those items that 
saw a decline in tax applied were those items high income 
Canadians can more often afford to purchase. Examples would be 
cars, stereos, home appliances and boats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Senator Robertson so eloquently put it “What is more 
equitable about a tax that makes it cheaper to buy a fur coat and 
more expensive to buy a jacket for a child, or more expensive to 
pay for electricity and less expensive to purchase a new car?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers are footing the bill for this agreement.  One 
billion dollars went from the pockets of taxpayers to the three 
maritime provinces to compensate them for lost revenues. Those 
provinces are receiving more than twice the money of their 
anticipated shortfall.  In total the three provinces would have a 
revenue shortfall of $395 million but in fact they are receiving 
total compensation of $971 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was it necessary to overpay these provinces by more than 
$570 million?  Was this a good business decision or just an 
incentive to get the provinces to sign for a bad deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this money was paid up front. 
However, the provinces may end up raising other taxes to make up 
the shortfall in future years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from the provinces.  It is clear that citizens are 
not pleased that the three provinces are being compensated 
through tax dollars. The government has gone so far as to offer 
those provinces that did not collect enough revenue, namely, 
P.E.I., Saskatchewan and Manitoba, their share of compensation if 
they decide to harmonize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the agreement was not announced until the 1996-97 
fiscal year, and even though the payments are meant to cover a 
four-year period, Ottawa booked the entire amount to the 1995-96 
fiscal year. That lets Ottawa play a shell game with its deficit 
numbers. The finance minister said he can do this because he said 
before the end of the 1995-96 fiscal year that he would seek such 
an agreement. The auditor general has slammed this accounting 
trick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has broken its promises over and over 
again. The manner in which it harmonized the sales tax in the 
Atlantic provinces is evidence of this.  Canadians have been 
deceived over and over by the Liberal government. First it 
opposed the proposed GST and now it takes credit for it. Example, 
the Prime Minister in London just a couple weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harmonized sales tax does not even come close to matching 
the red book's fine print. The GST is still here.  It is the 
three provinces which are replacing their sales tax, not Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book promised a tax system that minimizes disruption to 
small businesses. Retailers make it quite clear that tax included 
pricing would have caused major disruptions. Businesses selling 
in these three provinces from elsewhere in Canada will be 
required to collect and remit both taxes.  No such burden will be 
faced by merchants in the three harmonized provinces when they 
sell to the rest of the country. This is both another cost to 
business and yet another barrier to interprovincial trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud our PC senators who were successful in amending the 
harmonized bill. They were able to postpone tax included pricing 
until a time that provinces representing a majority of the 
population agreed. Tax included pricing in only three provinces 
would have driven up the cost of doing business. As a result 
there would have been added costs for everything from national 
advertising to the cost of reticketing items that are normally 
shipped from elsewhere with the price already included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, allow me to quote the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot  “The Liberals have done a patch-up job. 
In the three Atlantic provinces the existing GST and the 
provincial sales tax are being replaced with a single tax, called 
HST.  But the fact of the matter is that it is the same tax.  It 
is the same GST with a different name, with approximately $1 
billion in bonuses for the maritimes. They have done a patch-up 
job to meet their election objectives. They have made a partisan 
patch-up job at public expense and at the taxpayers expense with 
the taxes paid to the federal government every year.”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Kamloops earlier this morning gave a 
very chilling account of the truth surrounding the GST and 
indicated what a regressive tax it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pose a question to the members of the House.  What would you 
think of a tax on going to the bathroom?  Sounds preposterous 
doesn't it?  The truth is we are just inches away.  We pay GST 
for getting our hair cut.  Should this not be a reality check for 
government?  Have we now gotten to the point that we are taxing 
bodily services?  I cannot stop my hair from growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He very correctly indicated that it is a tax on low income 
people.  Everybody has to get a hair cut.  Everybody has to buy 
clothing and books for children.  He said if we did not have the 
tax that money would remain in the pockets of the people and the 
people would spend the money.  He should have finished that. 
When you spend the money it stimulates the economy and it creates 
jobs.  That is the whole point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is a tax on jobs.  It is a tax on the economy.  That is 
why it is regressive.  Furthermore it drives a massive 
underground economy.  The very people burdened by the GST are the 
hard working Canadians, people like contractors who provide 
services for other people.  It is a natural tendency to say “I 
am so overburdened by the regressive taxation system in this 
country, I will tell you what.  I am going to do that for cash”. 
They make cash deals.  So the GST drives a massive underground 
economy that results in a lot of lost revenue for the government. 
If the government would lower taxes, simplify the tax system and 
make it fair, people would not have an incentive to evade taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the GST is a massive burden on small business. 
Instead of contemplating ways to expand their business and 
improve the services they provide to their clients, the guy now 
has to hire somebody to do accounting to help the government 
collect its taxes.  Then the government has a massive bureaucracy 
in Revenue Canada to collect it.  Think of the downsizing we 
could do if we did not have to administer this ridiculous tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compliance and administrative costs of operating the GST are 
extremely high.  Why do we not have common sense and say “Let us 
scrap the GST and simplify our tax system”.  It makes perfect 
sense.  Why can the government not see that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know if I am to 
respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST has been politicized too much.  When it initially 
started out it was to replace the federal sales tax on 
manufactured goods which was 14%.  Maybe there are some items 
that should not be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the benefits the GST has accumulated to this 
country over the last few year. Companies are now more 
competitive because the hidden manufacturers' tax is no longer 
there.  The tax is not included in goods that go out of the 
country.  We have, from a free trade standpoint, benefited.  We 
have enjoyed a $16.7 billion surplus in tax revenues coming from 
free trade. The GST has not been all that bad for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  In resuming debate, 
we will be going in periods of 20 minutes for speeches followed 
by 10 minutes of questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to say a few words to Reform members. I was 
listening to them lecturing us earlier and giving us advice on political 
correctness. 
We do not need that kind of comment on an issue that is very important 
for Quebec, one where Quebec is the victim of a blatant injustice. We 
especially need no lessons in ethics from a political party that wanted, 
only two days ago, to invite a former minister of the Pinochet 
dictatorship in Chile to appear before the finance committee as an 
expert witness on pension reform. We have no lessons to learn from them. 
We do not need their moralizing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the subject at hand, when all the facts are 
considered, it is obvious that a blatant injustice was done to Quebec. 
To help you understand the nature of this injustice, I would like to 
remind you of the main features of the agreement reached by the federal 
government and three maritime provinces more than a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1996, the federal government concluded with three 
maritime provinces, namely Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, 
an agreement harmonizing their provincial sales tax with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the three provinces faced adjustment costs, the agreement 
provided they would receive in the following years a compensation worth 
close to $1 billion, $961 million to be precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the government come up with such a compensation for these 
three provinces? 
This is how it was calculated. Here is what they said, and it was the 
finance minister who set that criteria that suited the three maritime 
provinces perfectly: “Will the maritimes loose money if they go ahead 
with harmonization? If they do, we will compensate them”. He put the 
criteria at 5%. What does it mean exactly? Under the agreement, if there 
is a decline of more than 5% in the tax revenue of the three maritime 
provinces, the federal government will take action and compensate them 
for these adjustment costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important criteria to remember, and we will get back to it 
later when explaining why the province of Quebec is entitled to such a 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What benefit was given to the three maritime provinces with an 
agreement on the harmonization of the GST and the provincial sales tax 
and $1 billion in compensation? That agreement gave them three benefits 
straight away. 
The first one was the possibility to reduce sales tax by four percentage 
points. That was a direct advantage for the consumers in the three 
Atlantic provinces concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one was the possibility for businesses to have more 
competitive prices in these three provinces since the lowering of the 
sales tax rate allowed them to lower the price of their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third one was a major added advantage for companies in the 
Atlantic provinces because, with the full harmonization of taxes, which 
has been completed since April 1, they can claim a direct refund for all 
the taxes they pay on their inputs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was not able to benefit from these three advantages. Quebec, 
which harmonized its sales tax with the GST on its own in 1990 did not 
benefit from these three advantages that were provided for in the 
agreement between the federal government and the three Atlantic 
provinces. It could not benefit from a complete harmonization because it 
could not afford it. It had to pay costs and it is still paying costs 
because it was technically impossible for it to proceed with a complete 
harmonization because, unlike the three Atlantic provinces, it did not 
have the financial support of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in December of last year, Bernard Landry, the deputy 
premier of Quebec, minister of state for the economy and minister of 
finance, and Jacques Brassard, minister of intergovernmental affairs, 
demanded, on behalf of the Quebec government, compensation for the 
adjustment costs it incurred in 1990 and the costs it has been paying 
since then in terms of QST and GST harmonization.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on a fair assessment of the costs incurred, Quebec is 
entitled to an estimated $2 billion in compensation. The Minister of 
Finance told us, and the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions repeated the same thing a few moments ago—there are a 
lot of parrots in that party—“You are not entitled to this 
compensation because your provincial sales tax revenues have not gone 
down since the harmonization of the GST and the QST”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind you of the criterion I was telling you about a few 
moments ago and which is included in the agreement between the three 
Atlantic provinces and the federal government, namely that the $1 
billion compensation given to the Atlantic provinces is due to the fact 
that the harmonization of the provincial sales tax and the federal sales 
tax is causing them to lose over 5% in PST revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been claimed—and the Minister of Finance and the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions understand 
this problem—by using a rationale that has been stretched to the 
limit, that we are not entitled to anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must look at the whole tax base. One must see if, for example, 
the harmonization of the tax has forced the Quebec government to make 
adjustments elsewhere in its tax structure that may have had a negative 
impact on the province's revenues. 
One must do that. One must look at all the facts in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three major facts. First of all, one must take into 
account that, when the harmonized tax was implemented in 1990, there 
were other taxes on certain goods and services in Quebec that had to be 
abolished and replaced by the new harmonized tax. Such was the case for 
fuel and tobacco products. The Quebec government had to abolish the old 
tax when fuel and tobacco products became subject to the new harmonized 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By so doing, however, the difference between the old fuel and 
tobacco taxes and the new harmonized tax meant a loss to the Quebec 
government of $355 million.  This is the first example of data 
missing from the Minister of Finance's assessment, or rejected out 
of hand by him, because he does not want anything to do with an 
accurate overall assessment—and, what is more, he knows he is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major point that must be considered is the overall 
tax structure before and after harmonization of the GST and the 
provincial sales tax in Quebec.  People became aware that the cost 
of harmonizing the GST and the sales tax in Quebec meant that 
corporate tax rates had to be adjusted.  They had to be increased 
in order to raise supplementary revenues for Quebec to finance the 
harmonization of the GST and the TVQ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give two examples.  The first, that the tax on profits 
was raised, from 6.33% for businesses in general, to 8,9% 
immediately after harmonization.  There is a link here with 
harmonization of the GST and TVQ, and the costs of that 
harmonization.  Tax on capital was also raised, from 0.52% to 
0.64%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you look at the preferential tax rates for small 
businesses, the SB program, small businesses saw their tax rates 
raised from 3.45% to 5.75%.  All of this is linked to harmonization 
and to the costs of adjustment or transition from the GST and TVQ 
to a new harmonized regime, which we in Quebec were the first to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third fundamental point is the one I made when I started 
to speak.  Since Quebec was not compensated for harmonization of 
the GST and TVQ, we have not been able to fully harmonize our 
taxation system. 
What that means in particular is that, normally, large Quebec 
corporations ought to be able to receive full reimbursement of 
business input taxes paid, these being intermediary products used 
in production of their end product for sale. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the maritimes, with full harmonization, which has been in 
effect since April, businesses have a competitive edge over 
businesses in Quebec.  They are being reimbursed the taxes they pay 
on the purchase of the input used in the production of their final 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shortfall faced by big businesses in Quebec, which is tied 
directly to the lack of transition measures from the federal 
government to harmonize the GST and the QST—the Quebec sales 
tax—means a loss of $500 million for these businesses.  Because 
there is no compensation, the Government of Quebec cannot reimburse 
the taxes paid on the input of the major firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance tabled his latest budget, the 
Quebec deputy premier and minister of state for the economy, 
Bernard Landry, showed clearly the link between the injustice faced 
by Quebec on the policy of harmonizing the GST and the QST and the 
fact that big business is not being reimbursed the taxes paid on 
input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about $500 million, Madam Speaker.  Do you know 
what that means?  It is 10% of the Quebec sales tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the criteria whose importance I stressed at the 
start of my speech.  The Minister of Finance said that, had the 
three maritime provinces lost more than 5% of their revenues, we 
could compensate them.  This gave rise to the $1 billion in 
compensation to the three maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the big businesses' shortfall alone, in 
terms of a refund for the taxes paid on their inputs, totals $500 
million or 10% of the provincial sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must be consistent. It has to look at the 
overall picture and if it must pay then it should do so. Quebec is 
currently the victim of an injustice on the part of the federal 
government. Members opposite can say whatever they want. We are only 
asking that justice be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will complete my presentation with a situation that could have 
occurred in 1990. At the time, Quebec could have looked at the various 
budget items, including direct and indirect taxes, and made other 
choices in terms of business and consumer taxes, etc., and it could have 
ended up with a completely different tax structure than the current one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, let us consider the direct sales tax revenues in 
comparison with the governments' total revenues. There are huge 
differences between Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratio of sales tax revenues to the governments' total revenues 
is 12.9% for provincial governments in the maritimes. In Ontario, it is 
8.3%, while in Quebec it is 8.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, had Quebec known that the federal government would some 
day offer compensation for harmonizing taxes—something we did without 
compensation or support at a cost of hundreds of millions of 
dollars—it could have said 
“There will be some form of compensation some day”. Using the rule 
mentioned earlier, by which the finance minister decided that the 
government was to step in and give $1 billion to the maritimes in 
compensation after they experienced revenue losses from harmonization in 
excess of 5% of their current sales tax revenue, we could have said 
“If 
that is how it will work, let us reduce personal income taxes, reduce 
business taxes and raise the provincial sales tax so that, when the 
federal government comes to us with its plans for harmonizing and asks 
us to reduce our tax rate, it will have to pay us compensation because 
we will have experienced a loss in excess of 5% of our provincial sales 
tax revenue”. Can you see how it does not make any sense to consider 
sales tax revenue only instead of considering all adjustments that had 
to be made in the fiscal structure, including tax increases and indirect 
taxes, following harmonization in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot look at only part of the equation, decide that there 
were no losses and condemn Quebec to never getting any compensation for 
having made fiscal choices that were different from those in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime provinces depend heavily on sales taxes—they 
account for nearly 13% of their overall revenue, as someone said—and 
because they made that choice, they are entitled to $1 billion in 
compensation.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, on the other hand, decided to reduce sales taxes to only 
8.6% of the tax base in order to boost the level of consumption and 
stimulate employment, and we are out $2 billion because we made 
rational decisions, decisions which, I would remind Reform and 
Liberal members, also served the purposes of a federal regime; that 
should not be forgotten.  We were the first to harmonize because 
the idea was that it could benefit businesses with respect to 
operations, interprovincial trade, and so forth.  We went along 
with the federal government's proposal.  So we are not interested 
in hearing that we are being difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more offensive is that $250 million of the 
compensation being paid the maritimes is coming from Quebec 
taxpayers.  Not only are we not getting $2 billion in compensation, 
and there are actual figures to support this calculation, but as 
Quebeckers we are also being forced to pay $250 million to 
harmonize a tax in the Atlantic provinces so that businesses in 
those provinces can be more competitive than businesses in Quebec, 
can cut in on our markets, take away our jobs, and all with our 
help.  You can see what a ridiculous and unfair situation Quebec is 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not calling for a debate for the sheer pleasure of it. 
There must be no confusing apples with oranges, dragging 
constitutional arguments into a serious fiscal matter, as our 
colleague, the secretary of state for international financial 
institutions did just now.  He often says the first thing that 
comes into his head, but this time he was out of line. 
What we are calling for in our motion is something quite simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have figures and arguments.  We think they are the best 
arguments.  We think we have a strong case.  We think we have been 
treated unfairly in this matter, and we are not the only ones who 
think so, because our view is also shared by the premiers of all 
Canadian provinces.  Last year, at the economic summit in Quebec 
City, this was the unanimous view.  All these people cannot be 
wrong.  But we are prepared to play by the rules and take this 
approach.  The Minister of Finance tells us “You are not entitled 
to compensation”.  Maybe we are wrong.  Maybe all these people are 
wrong.  Maybe our case is not as strong as all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is our proposal, the proposal that our leader, the member 
for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, outlined during the election campaign, and it 
is an ingenious proposal that could resolve this deadlock. Its result 
could be that we would no longer rise every week in this House to ask 
the Minister of Finance for $2 billion, and he would no longer tell us 
we have no right to such an amount. This is a useless debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose is that three experts be appointed—the first by 
the Minister of Finance, the second by the Government of Quebec, and the 
third jointly by the first two—to review the whole issue and analyze 
all of the basic data involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are ready to accept the conclusion. But if the Minister of 
Finance rejects our proposal, it is because he has something to hide, 
because he recognizes his vulnerability, because he is scared to compare 
the technical arguments of the Bloc Quebecois and the Government of 
Quebec with his own technical arguments. If he rejects our proposal, it 
is because he knows very well that following an objective analysis, a 
serious assessment like the one we outlined this morning, he will 
realize that he owes money to Quebec. He will realize that he made a 
mistake. He will realize that he owes Quebec $2 billion, $1.9 million to 
be exact, for harmonizing the GST with its provincial sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are humbly reaching out to the federal government so that this 
deadlock can be resolved and so that we can go forward. As I pointed 
out, we are willing to accept the conclusion of the three experts. 
Government members ought to take this issue more seriously, to be fair 
to Quebec, to show some intellectual honesty, because over the last year 
and a half, I have seen this debate degenerate into demagoguery. This 
makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we and our leader humbly submit this extremely intelligent 
proposal. All that is left to do is to settle the account. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial 
Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, harmonization 
presents many advantages for small and medium size businesses; there is 
only one tax, one base, one document and one administration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, one of the major advantages is for companies, small 
and medium size businesses and large corporations which must all stay 
competitive in the business world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did with the GST is give provinces the opportunity to 
refund any provincial tax paid on inputs. This is the major advantage 
agreed to by the three Atlantic provinces.  Even premier McKenna said 
his increased competitiveness, compared to provinces which had not yet 
harmonized, would highly benefit corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canadian corporations now pay more than $5 billion 
each year in provincial tax on inputs and the best way to avoid that is 
GST harmonization or, in other words, a value added tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, according to the hon. member who just spoke Quebec 
corporations stated they were not benefiting from the credit on inputs. 
They cannot get a refund for the provincial tax paid on inputs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not our fault, the problem lies with the Quebec government 
which is not reimbursing all of the provincial tax paid by large 
corporations in Quebec. It is their problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I told you the member did not make 
any sense, he has just proven me right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said is that under complete, total and general 
harmonization, all aspects of the issue taken into account, when the GST 
is blended with the provincial sales tax, at the end of the day large 
businesses paying a blended sales tax on the inputs they buy are 
entitled to a refund. They are entitled to an input tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime provinces have been able to do it since April 1st 
because the federal government gave them $961 million for that. In 
Quebec, we went ahead with harmonization, without any federal support. 
But we cannot do it, we cannot afford to do it because the federal 
government has been and continues to be unfair with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harmonizing both taxes is a good thing. We believe it is. We 
support efficiency, and the federal government knows it. But it wants to 
draw a red herring across the trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was being fair with Quebec, we could refund large businesses 
the $500 million they pay in taxes on inputs, but we cannot do it 
because of the government lack of fairness in its dealings with Quebec. 
As a result, we are less competitive than we should normally be if the 
system was slightly more equitable with Quebec businesses. 
We are competing in particular with New Brunswick businesses which enjoy 
a $400 million rebate linked to the billion dollar in compensation the 
federal government is giving three maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You talked about Frank McKenna and rightly so. He is still premier. 
I have even harsher words for him. Frank McKenna tried to steal our own 
businesses. He even went to Asia to try to attract Quebec businesses 
saying “Come to New Brunswick. You will enjoy a $400 million tax 
rebate”. This is what the federal government calls a fair system. Wait 
a minute.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened this morning to the debate about taxes and fairness. 
It reminded me of the old cliché which says there is nothing 
surer than taxes and death.  I had this come home to me the other 
day.  I had power of attorney and was official guardian and had 
to deal with the burial of people who were destitute, had no 
money.  I had to step in.  When I got the bill, the thing which 
reminded me of the cliché was that I had to pay the taxes.  These 
people were even taxed in death.  Canadians are used to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a comment for the government minister and the member of 
the Bloc.  Approximately five years ago because of the illegal 
importation of cigarettes into Canada the federal government 
removed most of the federal tax in Ontario and in Quebec.  It was 
a federal tax but it was not removed in western Canada.  Smokers 
out there had to pay the full shot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would either of these members say that maybe Saskatchewan 
smokers should be reimbursed because they had to pay all the 
cigarette taxes when over half the smokers in other parts of 
Canada did not have to pay them? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a short comment regarding 
what was said by the hon. member from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, in a ideal world nobody would pay any tax.  But, I would 
like to bring him back to earth.  We do not live in an ideal world and 
there are taxes to be paid.  Unfortunately, we have to live with that. 
As you said, even death is taxed.  It will take a while before that 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must agree with the hon. member 
from Quebec who just said that in an ideal world things would be 
different.  In an ideal world nobody would smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I would like to add two things to his comments. 
True, the Government of Quebec does not give rebates to companies for 
their input taxes, which amount to $500 million, but this is the fault 
of the Government of Quebec and an indication—

Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only answer that I will get 
back on track, because occasionally we have to return to serious 
matters.  The secretary of state had a good laugh, but it is time to get 
back to serious business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposal is to submit all the data to an arbitration panel 
independent from the government, independent from the Bloc, independent 
from the Government of Quebec, for a full evaluation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this is really unfair.  All we are saying is that 
Quebec should be treated fairly in tax matters, in money matters. This 
should not be too hard to understand. 
Let us try this formula: three independent experts to study the question 
instead of relying on whatever members opposite have to say.  We are 
getting a bit tired of arguing over numbers and of not making any 
headway in this matter after a year and three months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am hoping after having heard 
the first round of debate that we can restore some clarity and 
context to the whole issue of the harmonized sales tax and 
specifically the motion before us that deals with compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do that I want to go back a step and focus on the 
early part of our mandate when the government asked the House of 
Commons finance committee to consider alternatives to the GST and 
to essentially consult broadly with Canadians on some 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from tax experts, business people and 
Canadians.  In fact the committee heard from nearly 500 witnesses 
and received over 700 briefs.  It reviewed about 20 different 
alternatives and found that the broadest consensus by far was in 
favour of harmonization, replacing the current patchwork of sales 
tax with a single tax based on a value added system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you will remember, Mr. Speaker, because you were here in the 
last Parliament, this really became the foundation of the HST, 
the harmonized sales tax.  It was an agreement between the 
federal government and three Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.  Throughout this agreement which 
came into effect last April these provinces replaced a system 
which was in fact quite cumbersome, costly and complicated with 
one that proved to be simpler and essentially more efficient. 
Most important, these changes will add up to a better system that 
promotes a stronger economy and will result in greater job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers in participating provinces are benefiting in a number 
of important ways.  Most important, there has been a reduction in 
the rate of tax.  For Nova Scotia and for New Brunswick the 
combined rate of 15% represents a decrease of essentially 4 
percentage points in an effective sales tax rate. In Newfoundland 
and Labrador the rate decrease is closer to 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about businesses this morning in the first round. 
Businesses are also benefiting from the lower combined tax rate. 
They now have to deal with only one set of tax forms, one set of 
rules and one tax administration.  Essentially it means lower 
compliance costs, and we know that translates into savings and 
those savings translate into the firm's own bottom line and can 
benefit consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants estimated that 
if all provinces were to join in the national sales tax system 
Canadian business could save between $400 million and $700 
million a year in administrative costs alone.  I should also 
point out that a someone who has been part of the small business 
community, and Mr. Speaker, you are also part of the business 
community, the benefits of lower compliance costs will 
particularly be advantageous for the small business community. We 
know that the small business community also bears 
disproportionately the cost of dealing with two separate tax 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further benefit to businesses in the participating provinces 
will be the recovery of the HST payable on inputs, something that 
was not being done before the implementation of the HST.  In 
fact, harmonization will eliminate over $700 million in hidden 
sales taxes on business inputs in the three Atlantic provinces. 
This will in fact reduce the cost of Atlantic exports and 
essentially eliminate the unintentional competitive advantages 
that imports currently enjoy in the Atlantic provinces.  The HST 
adds up essentially to a simpler, fairer system and really a 
stronger economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to what is really the aspect of this legislation 
that has too often been attacked, including today's motion, and 
essentially attacked by those who placed partisan politics and 
narrow regionalism ahead of clear objective thought.  This of 
course is the decision by the government to provide a formula for 
short term adjustment assistance to provinces when they face 
significant structural costs to participate in a new and 
integrated system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation adjustment assistance is available to 
provinces which experience a revenue shortfall in excess of 5% of 
their current retail sales tax receipts by moving to a single 
harmonized sales tax system at a combined rate of 14% or 15%.  It 
is important that we emphasize that this is also a short term 
measure limited to a period of significant transition that these 
provinces will be going through.  It will end after four years. 
It is not an ongoing program which some of the members have 
alluded to in this House as being a subsidy. It will end after 
four years and it provides provinces with sufficient time to 
adjust to a harmonized system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that it is truly a joint program. 
Under the formula there is near equal sharing between the federal 
government and qualifying provinces of the adjustment costs that 
harmonization would entail over a four year period, but what I 
find disappointing is that there are some Canadians who have 
attacked the entire concept of adjustment assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mindset essentially ignores history.  It misreads the 
present and quite frankly it lacks the vision for the future. 
Canadian history makes it very clear that government has played 
an essential role in our economic evolution and adjustment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were tax and land grant support for a national rail 
system, the development of the St. Lawrence seaway, megaprojects 
from Lloydminster to Hibernia, special tax concessions for oil 
and gas development, for research and development, and for small 
business.  I could go on and on.  The list is long and quite 
honourable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These government investments respond to opportunities.  There is 
a long and proud list of federal assistance for sectors and 
regions that face economic difficulties and dislocations or must 
in fact confront some core structural change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments are an essential part of our 
constitutional framework.  They recognize that all of Canada is 
stronger as a society and as a marketplace when we help less 
affluent provinces to provide a basic level of public service and 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some members are not aware of this, but back in 1972, 
when the federal government instituted income tax reform, every 
single province received adjustment assistance totalling more 
than $2.7 billion over a seven year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently the federal government provided assistance to 
farmers following the collapse of world grain prices.  Now they 
are being compensated for the elimination of the Crow rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have provided bottom line support for maritime fishers who 
were confronted by a tragedy of decimated fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We equally shared in the cost of solving the problem of tobacco 
smuggling in Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions were not charity.  They were not partisan 
politics.  They were essentially a reflection of the contract 
Canadians have struck with themselves, a nation building contract 
which says that there is a critical role for government and that 
critical role is to help when help is truly needed and where it 
can in fact be truly effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes me to the present.  Today more than ever we must 
manage assistance with much more rigour, innovation and insight. 
The world of global competition for trade, investment, business 
opportunities and jobs demands that government remain constantly 
conscience of the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that a government which squanders resources imposes 
on the nation the costs of high deficits, high taxes and even 
higher interest rates.  These we all know are job killers and 
investment killers.  More important, they are future killers and 
they are hope destroyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same challenging competitive environment also demands that 
government continue to play a role in helping its citizens, 
sectors and regions to meet the global challenge.  That is 
exactly what we are doing with the adjustment assistance for the 
sales tax harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assistance is a necessary investment in making Canada stronger, 
through helping disadvantaged regions move to a modern tax system 
to meet the modern challenges of today.  It is a 21st century 
type of investment.  It reflects the fact that government must 
change how it involves itself in economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assistance formula which we have developed applies equally 
to every province.  There is no discrimination.  There is no 
favouritism.  More important, let me state very clear that there 
is no bribery involved, as was mentioned earlier by a number of 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any province in the country which faces a transitional revenue 
loss exceeding 5% because of harmonization qualifies for 
assistance.  I cannot make it much clearer than that.  It is 
pretty straightforward. After four years it is on its own.  It is 
a transitional measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario would not 
meet the threshold.  They will not lose money on harmonization, 
just like Quebec did not lose any money when it partially 
harmonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go directly to the heart of today's motion by the Bloc. 
There is simply no truth to the fiction that Quebec incurred 
revenue losses under harmonization with the GST.  That means that 
there are no grounds for its claim that it is being shortchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go with the facts. After beginning its phased in 
harmonization in 1991-92 and 1992-93, Quebec sales tax revenues 
were 20% and 17% higher in each fiscal year, respectively.  These 
figures are not based on my documents.  They are not based on the 
documents of the national government.  They are based on Quebec 
documents.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that annual Quebec sales tax revenues over the 
1990-91 to 1995-96 fiscal years were on average 12% higher than 
the province's preharmonization revenue in 1989-90. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go further.  It is a fact that when we draw the analogy 
with the other provinces over that same period, Ontario with a 
retail tax system similar to the one Quebec replaced had an 
average annual sales tax revenue drop of 3% below 1989-90 levels. 
In other words, when you make the comparison of where Quebec was 
with harmonization, the improvement we saw in Quebec, and look in 
that same period at the experience of Ontario, which has a 
similar retail sales tax system, we see that harmonization was a 
winner for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again be very clear.  It is a fact that compensation is 
available for those provinces that fully harmonize with the GST. 
Let me explain that.  Full harmonization with the GST means that 
you have the same tax base, the same rate and that members of the 
HST, provinces and the national government, would move in concert 
if we see a rise in rates, a reduction in rates or an expansion 
of the tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that the revenue loss because of 
harmonization be significant.  Quebec is not fully harmonized. It 
is partially harmonized.  Quebec's revenues went up after 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that was brought forward this morning by an hon. 
member from the Bloc was that the premiers across this country 
supported Mr. Bouchard when he said they are entitled to $2 
billion of compensation.  That was the message from St. Andrews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clarify what the premiers said in St. Andrews.  What they 
said is that all provinces should be treated equally.  Quebec in 
this instance has been treated like all other provinces that do 
not suffer a decrease in revenue due to harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about who would have qualified for compensation 
under the HST in 1996 since the emphasis has been on the Atlantic 
provinces and that the deal was made with the Atlantic provinces, 
and solely with the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the formula Manitoba would have qualified for compensation 
in 1996 had it decided to participate in the harmonized sales 
tax.  I do not recall there being a Liberal government in 
Manitoba in 1996.  I believe it was a Conservative government and 
still is a Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan would have qualified in 1996 for compensation under 
this formula had it decided to participate in the HST.  The last 
time I checked Mr. Romanow was still the premier of Saskatchewan, 
the leader of the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a deal that was struck solely because we have a number 
of Liberal governments in the Atlantic provinces.  The Atlantic 
provinces saw merit in participating in the harmonized sales tax. 
They recognized the efficiency it would provide for their 
business community and the fact that it would make them more 
competitive and improve their exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to another fact.  André Bourbeau, former Quebec 
finance minister, declared earlier this year that Quebec did not 
lose money by harmonizing its tax rates with the GST.  To the 
contrary, he said that the operation has generated hundreds of 
millions of extra dollars to the Quebec treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comment was made earlier about the fact that because Quebec 
did not receive compensation for this harmonization it was forced 
to increase corporate tax rates to make up for that compensation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot make it any clearer than that.  Harmonization occurred 
and revenues went up.  If there were any increase in tax rates 
for corporations in Quebec it was solely because of the decision 
made by the Quebec government at the time.  It had nothing to do 
with whether or not Quebec qualified for compensation.  Any 
linkage to that is truly false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the three Atlantic provinces, with their less developed 
economies and such problems as fish stocks, harmonization carries 
a painful interim cost.  There is no denying that.  That is why 
we developed this compensation formula and why they will receive 
about $960 million of assistance over four years to deal with the 
structural adjustment they are required to make as a result of 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surprising and quite frankly frustrating that our approach 
has been turned into a political football.  There is tragic 
cynicism at work here, the type of cynicism that always knows the 
price of everything but the value of nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can argue with the value of helping provinces to provide the 
environment to industry to help it thrive, not just one sector or 
two sectors but all businesses in the region?  It is particularly 
true for the Atlantic region, which is why it has moved to accept 
the harmonized approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By what illogical leap can it be suggested that because some 
provinces qualify for assistance it should then be provided to 
every province, even to those who will not suffer major losses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to my example of 1971 when changes were made to 
the income tax system and every province received compensation 
because they were adversely affected.  That was not a 
prescription.  It is a comment we cannot agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I only have a couple of minutes left, let me close by 
saying that I reject the competing point of view so often 
expressed by the Bloc and in effect by the official opposition 
that opposes any compensation.  It ignores the obligation framed 
by 130 years of Canadian history to help disadvantaged regions 
become equal partners in a strong, vibrant and growing country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
heard so many strange things in that speech that I hardly know where to 
begin to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I do not know where the member was earlier when I presented 
some technical arguments. Had he been present, he would have understood 
that one should not get too close to the tree and ignore the forest. 
That is what he is doing now. We must consider all the basic data, the 
overall data in the case and see what happened before and after the 
harmonization at all tax levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he looks at the data—and if he does not know, he should ask 
his finance minister because I suspect there is some ill will in this 
case—he will see that there are increases in tax rates for businesses 
and for individuals. Certain goods were no longer taxed, which generated 
losses for the Quebec government. These goods are now subject to the new 
harmonized tax, but the losses are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was demonstrated to him earlier. If what we are proposing is 
nonsense, what is the government afraid of? The member should ask his 
finance minister. What is he afraid of? What does he fear if his case is 
so strong? He should submit this case to the committee of experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a last brief comment. He referred to a former 
finance minister; I know he referred to Mr. Bourbeau. 
I would tell you that this is no reference. He is the one who left 
Quebec flat broke with an unprecedented deficit of $5 billion. So this 
is no reference. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again the manipulation 
of information is becoming an art form.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it is a fact it should be quite clearly on record that 
harmonization resulted in an increase in revenues for the 
province of Quebec.  The formula put in place that deals with 
structural change to a tax system speaks to giving compensation 
to provinces that suffer a reduction in revenue.  More 
specifically, any province with a loss exceeding 5% because of 
harmonization would qualify for assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec revenues went up after harmonization.  Essentially as 
part of this formula it would not qualify, as British Columbia 
would not qualify, as the province of Ontario would not qualify, 
and as the province of Alberta would not qualify.   If they were 
to harmonize they would not qualify just as Quebec does not 
qualify given that they are partially harmonized and not fully 
harmonized. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, having 
listened to the hon. member's comments I do not know where to 
start.  Because of time restraints in the House it is obvious we 
will not have time to meet all the concerns raised by the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions.  He spoke about the foundation of 
the HST.  For the rest of the members in the House, when the tax 
was originally brought in it was called the blended sales tax in 
Nova Scotia.  However the initials BST were a little tough for 
the government to swallow so it was changed to the HST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made a lot of suggestions about partisan 
politics.  We listened to a certain amount of Liberal propaganda. 
Does the hon. member understand how on a workhorse the reins go 
up through the hames and attach to the horse?  Does he understand 
the commands gee and haw or droite and gauche?  Does he 
understand why those commands are given, that they are given to a 
horse because it is wearing a set of blinders?  Therefore the 
horse listens to the commands.  If the blinders are taken off the 
commands do not seem quite as specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You said that when the HST was brought in it lowered the tax 
rate to 15% in Nova Scotia.  That is not entirely correct. It 
lowered it to 15% on some things, 18% on automobiles and on 
second hand cars the tax is still there.  The tax is not revenue 
neutral.  It gathers more tax than the two combined taxes used to 
gather.  What is the government prepared to do about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon. 
parliamentary secretary has a chance to respond, I remind hon. 
members to address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot profess to be a 
rider of horses.  I am not quite sure what the hon. member was 
talking about in terms of reins.  I will put those comments aside 
and try to deal with the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is saying that in Atlantic Canada the 
provinces are earning more revenue now that the taxes are 
harmonized, compared to prior to the harmonization, the Atlantic 
provinces would not qualify for compensation.  His statement is 
incorrect.  The provinces Atlantic Canada because of 
harmonization are earning less government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is saying that Atlantic provinces are earning more 
money today because of harmonization than they were prior to 
harmonization, that is incorrect.  The reason assistance is being 
provided to the Atlantic provinces is that harmonization has 
brought some structural change to the Atlantic provinces.  As a 
result of that structural change they were to experience a 
greater than 5% reduction in the retail sales tax.  That is why 
they are receiving assistance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard

that from across the House.  We have been saying that for a long 
time and we know it.  The small businesses I have talked to 
complained about filling out one set of tax forms.  If it is 
taken from two to one, what is the difference?  They are still 
filling out a set of tax forms.  It is still taking their time. 
They still resent having to be a tax collector for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they had meetings a consensus was brought to bear that 
businesses wanted a harmonized tax system.  Was a question put to 
them on whether they wanted a tax at all?  Was that ever raised? 
They were to have harmonized taxes.  Did they want two taxes or 
one tax?  What do we do about the GST which the government 
promised to get rid of but is still in place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about increased revenues for provinces and the federal 
government.  Where is that revenue coming from?  It is coming out 
of the pockets of families and businesses. The emphasis should be 
on putting the money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have commented on the consensus and I want you to elaborate 
on that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind hon. 
members, once again, that we must address our comments to one 
another through the Chair.  It tends to keep the level of debate 
more controllable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to a number 
of the points made.  I thank the hon. member for the question and 
for his comment that he agrees with a number of things I have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the actual forms that need to be completed with respect to 
the GST or harmonized sales tax, there is no question I did a 
fair amount of work on the small business sector in the House 
during the last session.  Regulatory burden and compliance burden 
were big issues for the small business community.  As a result 
one form was eliminated by those provinces that harmonized, which 
provided for some reduction in the burden of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I believe it was announced recently by the revenue 
minister that there would be a reduction in the period of time 
small businesses would have to remit sales taxes to the federal 
government.  If they are earning less than $30,000 they are 
exempt.  Over that amount they can now go to a quarterly period 
rather than having to remit it on a monthly basis.  Again this 
speaks to the reduction in the burden of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the pressures in terms of axes there is no 
question that as the finance committee went across the country 
taxes were an issue that spoke to the competitiveness of the 
country.  The finance minister has said over and over again that 
when the government and the country can afford to provide 
substantial and sustainable tax relief to Canadians they are 
committed to doing it.  At the initial stage a very targeted tax 
relief will be provided for those most in need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
moved by my party today shows once more that the Liberal government 
continues to deal with Quebec on a different basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite repeated demands from the Quebec government, it 
systematically refuses to grant any compensation for tax harmonization 
in Quebec. Its repeated rejections of legitimate Quebec demands have 
been condemned time and again by Bloc Quebecois members and the Quebec 
finance minister, Bernard Landry, who has to deal with a $2 billion 
shortfall. In a similar situation, maritime provinces received 
$1 billion. 
Thanks to that money, the governments in these provinces, especially New 
Brunswick, are now better able to compete with the other provinces and 
with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By acting this way, the Liberal government, even when it tries, 
through its federalist propaganda, to sell the merits of the best 
country in the world, is clearly trampling all over Quebec by hiding 
behind the smoke screen of a financial model that results in inaccurate 
calculations by the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever financial method the finance minister is using, we know 
how he views the province of Quebec, a unique province that, since 1993, 
has been hit by drastic cuts, the sole purpose of which is to discredit 
the Quebec government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the tactics of the Liberal government, the 
Government of Quebec would have already presented a balanced budget to 
the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is hard-headed, or he seems to have 
problems understanding our arguments. Last December, two Quebec 
government ministers once again demanded that Quebec receive $2 billion 
in compensation for harmonizing its provincial sales tax with the GST. 
It should be remembered that Quebec harmonized its sales tax on its own 
and without any financial assistance. Quebec businesses bore the 
financial costs of this reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May, in his speech, the Quebec Finance Minister reminded us 
that on April 26, 1996, the Liberal federal government announced with 
great fanfare the signature of memorandums of understanding with three 
Atlantic provinces, whereby their respective sales taxes would be 
harmonized, effective April 1, 1997, at a combined rate of 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this decision by the federal government, according 
to the Minister of Finance, was to compensate the financial losses borne 
by these three provinces. At the same time, he announced an adjustment 
assistance program whereby close to $1 billion, that is $423 per capita, 
would be paid as compensation. But nothing for Quebec, as the federal 
government showed once again that it could not be fair to Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he tabled his budget in the National Assembly, the Quebec 
Minister of Finance strongly condemned this action by the Liberal 
government. 
I would like to quote Minister Bernard Landry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adjustment assistance program gives the three Atlantic 
provinces a competitive advantage over Quebec. Because of this 
compensation, these provinces are able to reduce their sales 
tax rate by 4 percentage points and to give businesses full 
rebates on their input taxes. Because of the federal 
government's financial assistance, they can make their tax 
system more competitive, without having to increase their 
other taxes and without reducing input tax credits for 
businesses in order to finance the cost of harmonization with 
the GST. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After many requests and months of waiting, Quebec finally received 
from the federal government, in August 1996, the detailed results of its 
analytical grid used to review Quebec's request. We are attempting again 
today to bring the federal Finance Minister to admit that his 
calculations are incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote again Minister Bernard Landry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By considering only the sales tax revenues of the provinces 
that have opted to harmonize with the GST and not the complete 
tax burden, the adjustment assistance program fails to 
consider the provinces' global tax policy. In this way, this 
program unduly benefits the Atlantic provinces, which have the 
highest sales taxes in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what their renewed federalism, their more flexible 
federalism, is all about, complete with the homeland of the French 
language and, more recently, the unique character of Quebec and 
Quebeckers which nine other Canadian provinces now want to recognize. 
This is how the federal government wants to define the unique character 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to fight over figures, but let us take the time to 
see how the Liberal government behaves in its dealings with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict between Quebec and Ottawa arises from the fact that 
compensation is calculated based upon an economic model and some kind of 
simulation. The federal government has tried to estimate the amount to 
the losses the Atlantic provinces and Quebec will incur during the four 
years following the harmonization. 
This simulation is applied to all provinces and only takes into 
consideration the sales tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using only the sales tax revenues instead of the total 
provincial tax base to determine if the provinces deserve any 
compensation, Ottawa is treating the provinces and Quebec in the most 
unfair way possible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the federal Minister of Finance is unjustly 
penalizing the provinces for their previous fiscal choices. Indeed, 
eligibility for federal compensation depends on the way the provinces 
choose to structure their taxes. The more a province relies on sales tax 
to generate revenues, the more a change in that tax rate is likely to 
produce major revenue losses, and the more that province is likely to 
receive federal compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adjustment assistance program is arbitrary since it does not 
take into account the fiscal realities in the different provinces and in 
Quebec nor their actual financial capacity to harmonize their sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compensation requested by the Government of Quebec is very 
reasonable. 
I remind you that the compensation paid to the Atlantic provinces equals 
almost $1 billion, which represents an average of $423 per inhabitant 
while the compensation demanded by Quebec represents $273 per 
inhabitant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numbers talk and I submit that the Minister of Finance should be 
competent enough to recognize the difference between the Atlantic 
provinces and Quebec. Since the beginning of this session, the Minister 
of Finance seems to have forgotten a basic rule of etiquette which says 
that when asked a question, one must answer, and more importantly, one 
must tell the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder if the minister still remembers that rule. With 
all his empty answers, we come to question how serious he is. When we 
know that there was a 60% gap last year between his estimates and the 
actual deficit, we can easily see why he cannot really understand 
Quebec's situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to say that the political decisions 
of the Liberal government since it took office in 1993 are being 
criticized throughout Canada and Quebec.  Poverty is on the increase, 
students are in debt and have no jobs, the EI reform is unfair to 
everyone, and social and health services have been hard hit.  And the 
Liberal government dares to talk about a humane approach to finance. 
Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance knows very well what the Government of 
Quebec intends to do with the financial compensation it is requesting 
for harmonizing with the GST.  It will be used over a period of four 
years to cover the cost of input taxes for Quebec businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Lotbinière in Quebec, businesses would put this $2 
billion to extremely good use by becoming more competitive on Canadian, 
North American and international markets.  The Minister of Finance knows 
this, and that is why he is refusing to pay. 
Once again, he sits tight and Quebec pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because we are unique.  There are many examples of the 
Liberal government's bad faith.  Their centralizing tactics pervade 
their every action.  The throne speech was very revealing in this 
regard, and the recent moves by the Minister of Health, as well as those 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development, with his youth strategy, 
represent serious interference in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all a numbers game.  The federal government seems to have 
trouble understanding what Quebec is going through.  As for the GST 
harmonization, in light of the actions of the present Liberal 
government, we have a very good suggestion.  It was announced by the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, during the last election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, Mr. Duceppe suggested to the Liberal government that 
an independent arbitration panel be created to resolve the impasse, 
which is very harmful to Quebec's economy.  Quebec's Deputy Premier and 
Minister of Finance is prepared to challenge the federal finance 
minister's figures.  The repeated refusals by the federal minister say 
a lot about the weakness of his government's arguments.

series of vague and inexplicable refusals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why all members of the House must vote in favour of this 
motion that could, once and for all, shed light on this shady business 
by the federal finance minister, who continues to shirk his 
responsibilities in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the behaviour of the Liberal government merely 
strengthens the argument that the only real solution to all Quebec's 
economic problems lies in sovereignty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think it is all very clear. The Bloc wants compensation for the GST for 
reasons that are not valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that the Premier of Quebec is the former 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois. When Mr. Bouchard was leader of the 
official opposition, he argued in favour of sovereignty. Before the 
referendum, he said that it was possible for Quebec to stand alone. He 
said that sovereignty was simple. Then there was the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Mr. Bouchard is Premier of Quebec and has to deal with an 
unhealthy economy in that province. Unemployment is high, there are 
problems in the business sector, and Mr. Bouchard has made major cuts. 
I think Mr. Bouchard is looking to get money from the rest of Canada to 
pay for the cuts he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It is our tax money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is true. It is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member. Is it true that Mr. Bouchard is 
still the real leader of the Bloc and it is he who is leading the attack 
against the government on this subject? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, the 44 members of the Bloc 
Quebecois are mature men and women who do not need the founder of their 
party to hold them by the hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to come back to the motion, why are we debating this motion 
today? It is very simple. We could talk about financial arguments, 
financial models, figures, billions and percentages, but the members 
opposite do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Health was saying that things were 
clogged up. I have the impression that, on the issue of compensation for 
the GST, the members opposite are pretty clogged up. They have great 
difficulty understanding what they are being told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Their ears are blocked up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> In order to resolve 
this, we in the Bloc Quebecois have a revolutionary suggestion to 
make, an equitable suggestion, as follows: Appoint a representative 
of your government.  We in the Bloc Quebecois will receive the 
Quebec representative and then these two will select a third 
person, and the three will see who is right.  But I am convinced 
Quebec is the one that is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development—Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on this motion by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, however, allow me to point out the extent to which 
the people on the other side of the House are looking down the 
wrong end of the telescope or are failing to look at the other side 
of the coin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the member for Mercier says, among other things: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for blatant 
unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST, the government 
having denied it compensation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever a party failed to look at things objectively, if ever 
a party had the bad and annoying habit of acting and interacting 
only out of political interest, this is it and here it is doing it 
again in the motion by the hon. member for Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might point out in passing that this approach does not serve 
the interests of the people they should be representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the famous GST, it must be understood that its 
harmonization benefited Quebec as a whole.  It must also be 
understood that, since harmonization in 1991, tax revenues have 
risen—and I have the figures here—from $5.11 billion in 1989-90 
to $6.15 billion in 1991-92. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the way, they seem to be playing the victim game, but 
the figures speak for themselves and show that there has been 
substantial gain for the province of Quebec.  On the subject of the 
rules of the game, the Government of Canada acted fairly.  It 
intervened realistically.  It also honoured the needs and the 
realities of each province when it intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of fair share, the issue is the GST, but we 
could look further and more specifically at the issue of the 
Government of Canada's intervention in the whole of Quebec.  I, 
myself, am responsible for issues of economic development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague tells me that my work is rather well received by 
the Bloc members.  Thank you very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is talk of economic development, to paraphrase what 
the Bloc members have just said, I think that indeed the Canadian 
government is doing a respectable job, a job that meets 
expectations and requirements.  Let us look at the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec businesses receive 40% of tax credits for research and 
development.  I see that my colleagues are taking notes on this, so 
they must not have realized that.  These figures are to the 
advantage of Quebec but there has been an attempt to conceal them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec businesses receive 33.5% of direct federal assistance 
for R&D and to date—an important point—57% of investments under 
the technology partnerships Canada program were paid to companies 
in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be taken into consideration that, when we are 
talking taxes, it must be understood that the Canadian government 
also pays administrative costs to the Government of Quebec. And you 
will see, if you look at these, that we are far from being a 
government that does not pay the Government of Quebec its fair 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of that contribution, what is involved is financial 
contributions for administration of the tax, an amount that has 
hovered around $100 million yearly since 1992-93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned economic development earlier. The Canadian government 
is active in quite a few areas in Quebec, but if we focus only on 
economic development, I believe that once again, Quebec comes out a 
winner. Indeed, once again, Quebec is dealt with very fairly and 
equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian government are committed to dealing with the 
province of Quebec equitably and, first and foremost, to ensuring that 
the development of the province's economy can continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about helping and assisting Quebec, seeing that the 
province can develop further at the economic level, you will have 
guessed that I am referring to the federal office for regional 
development. 
At present, the work the federal office is doing in the province of 
Quebec is much appreciated by all stakeholders that we work with and are 
in contact with on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision of economic development is one of respect, a vision that 
sticks to realities and needs. This is therefore a vision, which, like 
Canadian federalism, changes as needs change over time. Right now, our 
vision has to change, as the economy is changing. We are at the 
crossroads between two types of economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All players in the economic field have to start rethinking their 
way of doing things. 
The same goes, naturally, for private sector businesses, which now have 
to carve out specialized niches for themselves, better target their 
markets, seize every opportunity to increase their competitiveness and 
adjust to globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what goes for many players in terms of economic development 
also goes for the Canadian government. That is why, to take appropriate 
action in Quebec, we also introduced a change in our programming. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all began in 1995.  We consulted everyone, we consulted 
the business community, and the message was clear.  People wanted 
us to revamp all our programming.  They wanted us to be more in 
touch with the community and to reduce paperwork to a strict 
minimum.  Above all, and this is the important point, people wanted 
us to make sure that the government was in a position to help 
businesses make the transition to the 21st century by adjusting to 
the new phenomenon of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal office of regional development understood the 
message and we took action, with a view to continuing to be able to 
give Quebec its fair share, but also to continuing to deliver all 
the services of the Canadian government to the public.  We took 
action and created a new program, IDEA-SME, which is for regional 
small and medium size enterprises.  So we are essentially talking 
about economic development in sectors of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we also developed tools for helping in special contexts, 
tools that give us maximum flexibility to meet these needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples of this flexibility.  Members will 
recall the problem of the dwindling groundfish stocks in Atlantic 
Canada. 
The federal office implemented the well known Coastal Quebec 
program, a program I had occasion to report on not so very long 
ago.  The Coastal Quebec program was another example of a flexible 
government able to react in terms of needs as well as local 
urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example of action that is appropriate and 
that corresponds to the situation.  You will have guessed that I am 
referring to the unfortunate events in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean in 
July 1996.  We intervened, along with all the other federal 
departments that were called in.  The Federal Office of Regional 
Development for Quebec set up what we called the federal liaison 
office in Jonquière. 
And we worked in partnership with the other level of government and with 
the municipalities to ensure that, once again, the public would be 
adequately served and that its interests would be looked after. We left 
partisan politics behind, something the Bloc is incapable of doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members are incapable of rising— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Tell us about the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> This is why you are not inviting us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> You see, they are yelling. They are incapable 
of rising to a level where, together, we could discuss the real needs of 
communities. Every time these people are involved in a issue, they get 
into partisan politics, and this is the major difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, there are a number of differences and one of them is the 
ability of Quebec members sitting on this side to serve Quebec well, to 
care about its development and its population, in a positive context, in 
the context of the current federal system which—and I can already 
hear some grumbling from the other side—is evolving, which has proven 
to be flexible in the past, and which will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the program we put in place in the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, we worked in partnership—as 
we on this side of the House know how to do it—with the 
public's interests in mind. We also created a specific program in 
addition to the emergency measures taken. That program had a $50 
million envelope provided essentially by the federal and the 
Quebec governments. This is yet another good example of 
co-operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak for hours about the Canadian government's economic 
involvement in the province of Quebec. Again, speaking of an involvement 
that is focused on specific needs, I will of course mention the 
community development program. What a great program that has 
demonstrated its value locally for close to 20 years. What a great 
program that is aligned to fit in with local realities and that was 
ultimately designed to help us continue to serve not only well, but also 
better, the needs of the business community in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, within the community development program, there are 
also, tied with all this, the community futures development 
corporations. 
There are 54 such corporations across the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> In Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> They are in Abitibi also, as my colleague just 
mentioned. They offer investment funds, and in addition to everything 
else, they have an extraordinary team that people have access to, a team 
that knows what economic development is and that has a lot of 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of community futures development corporations, we 
speak basically of a team that has $82 million in assets. Annual 
investments in Quebec by CFDCs—and this is important when people 
talk about having a fair share, the numbers are there—are in the 
order of $23 million. So we can see that these people are active 
locally. These people carry out business with the local 
community. In fact, speaking of being active locally and of 
conducting business, we have developed recently—the Government 
of Canada in partnership with CFDCs—programs allowing to better 
focus on the needs of regions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just mention the CFDCs youth initiative. This is basically 
a grants program with a budget of $6 million that is intended for young 
people up to age of 34 inclusively. The beauty of this program is that 
it was structured and designed by the CFDCs in co-operation with the 
federal office of regional development, to enable us to respond to the 
needs of young people in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate among young people today is around 17%. The 
statistics are not very encouraging neither, in the area of keeping our 
youth in our regions. 
So this youth initiative is designed to keep young people in the regions 
and also to help them build their own businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area we have developed, in addition to involvement in the 
community, is a new vision of economic development. This is essential 
because of globalization. I often hear other governments and even 
critics opposite speak about economic development and I notice that 
these people, when they succeed in forgetting party lines and when they 
deal with a particular issue, often base their premises on ideas from 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two minutes left. As I said, I could talk all day about 
economic development. 
To conclude, when we speak about economic development today, we must 
stop thinking in terms of geography and we must think instead in terms 
of networking to succeed in competing internationally, and that is what 
the globalization of markets is calling upon us to do. We must be 
capable of networking, not only on a national basis, but also on an 
international basis. This is a positive vision that can help Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, when we speak of fair shares, I think you have 
proof in the few words I have just spoken that not only has Quebec 
received fair treatment as far as the GST is concerned, but when we 
look more specifically at the question of economic development, 
there again you have an example that speaks volumes about the 
services the Canadian government can render and the assistance the 
Canadian government already renders to all regions, all 
entrepreneurs.  The purpose of so doing is, of course, to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my fellow MPs for Quebec have the greater interests of 
their constituents at heart. 
As a result, we can built together, unlike what is happening within 
the Bloc.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is odd to 
hear the Liberals singing the praises of the GST.  I have been 
listening to them since this morning. These are the folks who, back 
in 1993, were carrying on so, promising to scrap the GST, you will 
recall.  Even an influential minister of that party saw fit to 
tender her resignation over it, and to get re-elected shortly after 
on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has just accused us of partisan politics.  This 
morning, I heard a western MP accusing the government of having 
bribed, bought off the people of the maritimes with this $920 
million supposedly given to the maritimes to harmonize their tax 
with the GST, because the shortfall was over 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government, which alone knows the date the next 
election is to be called, goes around waving $960 million for 
fishers hard hit by the employment insurance reform, might we not 
assume that it is trying to bribe the public?  Fortunately, this 
sort of tactic does not work particularly well.  I would ask the 
members of the party in power who come from the maritimes to rise 
and speak to the topic of the day.  I invite them to do so.  We 
would like to hear what they have to say on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister responsible for regional development tells 
us that this subsidy was awarded totally fairly, I would to know 
where he is getting his information from.  What is this 5% based 
on, if it is not arbitrary?  How can the Minister of Finance 
justify this 5%?  Why not 8% or 2% or 1% or 14%. 
Where does the figure 5 come from and how can he justify it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister makes me think of this.  Suppose his car hit mine 
the day my employer announced I was going to get a raise.  I ask 
him for compensation and he says “Well, no.  You just got a raise, 
you can pay for the repairs”.  This is his sort of reasoning.  I 
would like him to tell us what justification there is for 5%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon. 
parliamentary secretary has a chance to respond I would ask the 
House to be careful throwing around terms like “bribe”.  I was 
not here this morning.  I do not know if the term was imputed to 
a specific individual that it would be proper.  It happened 
earlier today, so let us not use that kind of word at least when 
this Speaker is in the chair.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to my hon. colleague's 
remarks brought to mind this old proverb I used to hear as a child. My 
father would always tell me “Martin, there is none so deaf as those who 
will not hear”.  All I can do is repeat the figures, which speak for 
themselves, which I quoted in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding harmonization—I am repeating myself because, from what 
I can see, on the other side, when the figures are positive, they just 
will not hear them. But I am a patient man; therefore, I will repeat 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding harmonization, since 1991, sales tax revenues clearly 
increased, going from $5.11 billion in 1989-90 to $6.15 billion in 
1991-92. And they are complaining about unfair treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get the impression that the word does not mean the same thing 
depending on which side of the House one sits on. We must not be using 
the same dictionary. In terms of involvement in economic development— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
heard a different proverb from my father in my youth, one about losing 
sight of the forest for the trees. I think that this is what our 
colleague, the hon. member for Outremont and minister responsible for 
regional development in Quebec, is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for my colleague, but I wonder how well he 
knows the issue of harmonizing. If he had paid any attention to the 
analyses we have submitted to him, he would have realized that the GST 
is an issue that needs to be considered globally. A global look at what 
the fiscal situation was before harmonization, in 1989, and after 
harmonization, in 1991, shows that taxation adjustments had to made to 
absorb the transitional costs associated with this harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to an increase in revenues. I am sorry, 
but these revenues do not come from the federal government. They come 
from the taxpayers who were forced to pay more, to pay for the 
transition to a harmonized system, actually. This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, respectfully, will he admit that the suggestion made this 
morning by the Bloc Quebecois is totally non-partisan? It provides that 
the government should appoint three experts. The first one would be 
appointed by the federal government, the second one by the Quebec 
government, and the third one jointly by the first two, so as to have an 
objective review that would protect Quebec's interests, which so concern 
the member for Outremont, because there is a lot at stake here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I ask. If the hon. member is protecting Quebec's interests, 
might it not be a good idea to make representations to his minister and 
to convince him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, to go back to the proverb 
referred to by the hon. member, we must not confuse the tree with the 
forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could I possibly say that the Bloc is not strictly motivated by 
political interests given that, in the matter of the GST, harmonization 
has proven very beneficial to Quebec. So, Bloc members are only 
motivated by partisan politics. It could not be any different.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary a 
question.  It is nice to hear the kettle calling the pot black. 
The present Canadian heritage minister said in this House that 
everyone knows the GST is largely responsible for a flood of 
cross border shopping that is costing thousands of Canadian 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the parliamentary secretary pursuing the GST policy and 
killing the jobs of Canadians with a tax that places a heavy 
burden on our tourist industry?  I think the Bloc has very 
legitimate cause for feeling a little hurt by the GST.  That was 
the comment of the present heritage minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary how he 
justifies that comment?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point 
out that the harmonization of the GST by the government is based 
on a process which is equitable and which has been very 
respectful of the need and reality of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the situation per se regarding the province of 
Quebec.  Harmonization not only benefits the Government of Quebec 
in terms of having more revenues but consider also that the 
Canadian government is paying a financial amount to make sure 
that the province of Quebec will manage or proceed with good 
administration of the tax per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the point made by the member of the Reform 
Party considering the fact that across Canada the harmonization 
has been respectful.  Harmonization has been well received by all 
the provinces across Canada.  Even looking at Quebec we will see 
that its minister of finance does not speak much about the tax 
because he knows that harmonization is benefiting the province. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the motion of the Bloc Quebecois, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness 
to Quebec in the matter of the GST— 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition opposes the motion because this is a 
motion which only speaks to one province.  What Canadians need 
generally is tax relief.  Not for one province but for all ten 
provinces.  Not for some Canadians but for all Canadians.  We 
oppose special tax deals which try to create special privileges 
for people based on this kind of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we really oppose most of all is the kind of tax record the 
government has foisted upon Canadians over the past several 
years.  It is a tax record which has resulted in stagnant 
economic growth, declining family income and record high levels 
of unemployment.  I said it before and I will say it again, we 
are now in our 86th month straight of over 9% unemployment, or is 
it the 87th month. I have lost track.  I have lost track after 
seven years of record high unemployment, the longest period of 
unemployment since the great depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am 29.  Even before I got my first real job unemployment was 
over 9%.  My entire professional life, I and people of my age 
have known nothing but record high levels of unemployment. What 
about youth unemployment for my generation, when it reaches 
levels of 25% in some regions of this country, including some 
parts of the province of Quebec.  It is 17% overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's tax record is record taxes.  I would like to 
point out that the government promised not to raise a penny in 
taxes before it was elected in 1993.  I remember because at the 
time I was involved with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a 
group of grassroots taxpayers.  The group was a little bit 
skeptical when these Liberals came calling in October 1993 and 
promised after their brilliant fiscal record of the Trudeau years 
not to raise taxes and not to increase the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were a little skeptical.  We asked the Prime Minister, as did 
Canadians, would the first red book involve any tax increases 
given the manifold promises included in it.  The Prime Minister 
said no, there were no tax increases in this plan, except there 
might be a war and in the case of a war, they might have to raise 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well there was a war, it was a war on Canadian taxpayers.  The 
government decided to raise those taxes 36 times.  It decided to 
piggyback on the most nefarious tax grab of all, the Mulroney 
deindexation of the income tax brackets, something that sucks $3 
billion a year out of the pockets of average Canadians.  Most 
shamefully of all, these Liberals, the government which applauds 
itself as a paragon of integrity, promised, made a solemn 
commitment to Canadians that it would scrap, kill, abolish, 
eliminate, get rid of, trash the GST. 
Well the last time I checked, the GST was still there. Canadians 
are still paying it as much or more than ever.  That I think is 
the mother of all political lies, of all political mistruths ever 
uttered by a politician. The government should hang its head in 
shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Portage—Lisgar in a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the government still claims to be in 
favour of the GST when recently a number of focus groups were 
conducted by one of the Liberal government's favourite hack 
polling firms.  It got a bunch of Canadians together behind 
closed doors and asked them a bunch of questions about the GST. 
The government was trying to find a way out of the impossible 
position it found itself in by defending the Mulroney GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Canadians in those focus groups said they thought the GST 
was an atrocity. They thought it ought to be abolished.  They 
said that there was no way they would let the government out of 
that commitment, the promise it made in the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  The government filed the focus group tests away 
in some filing cabinet in the back of the finance minister's 
office until some enterprising taxpayer decided to find out what 
kind of information about the GST was being generated at the 
expense of taxpayers. What did the finance minister have to say 
when this access to information request was made to release the 
results of these polls and focus groups? He said that no, 
Canadians will not be allowed access to what they said about the 
GST at their expense. Not only did the Liberals lie about the GST 
promise, they would not even let Canadians see what Canadians 
advised the government to do because they knew how humiliated 
they would be if the facts came out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my hon. friends opposite is, what are they afraid 
of?  Why do they not want to let Canadians see what those focus 
groups said?  What are they trying to hide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really shocking.  The one thing this government still has 
not learned is that Canadians want to keep more of what they 
earn.  The Liberal Party has always believed that tax dollars are 
moneys that the government somehow has a proprietary claim on. We 
in the Reform Party believe that the money people earn belongs 
first, foremost and finally to them and their families so that 
they can support themselves and their businesses and help the 
economy to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly Canadians are beginning to realize that the top 
economic priority for this country is tax relief. The government 
said that 50% of any future surpluses would go to new spending. 
It did not think that a party such as ours would be able to 
demonstrate public support for tax relief. The government thinks 
people are greedy because they want to keep a little bit more of 
their earnings, because middle class families want to be able to 
take a vacation every now and then on the money they earn. The 
government thinks that is greedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government assumes that Canadians would be opposed to tax 
relief.  But lo and behold, this past weekend a poll came out. 
Fortunately it was a public poll, one not commissioned by the 
government or we would not have seen it. This polls shows us that 
the number of Canadians who want tax relief now has tripled in 
the last couple of months. Now 35% of Canadians are demanding 
immediate tax relief. Only 9% want to spend any of the surplus as 
opposed to the government's priority to spend only half the 
surplus on useless programs and bureaucracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorities of Canadians are becoming increasingly evident. 
Canadians are calling for tax relief.  They are calling for 
integrity in government.  They are calling for the promise on the 
GST to be kept. My challenge to members opposite is to do what is 
right for a change. Cut spending, balance the budget so that we 
can scrap the GST and maybe they can salvage a little patina of 
their now much tarnished political credibility.

humorous example of a very sad truth in reality.  The reality is 
that the regressive tax regime of this government is forcing 
Canadians to shop outside their own country. If the Liberal 
government cannot see that reality and realize that something is 
wrong, then I suggest it is not just a few sandwiches short of a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  It is true.  But I learned from my 
mistake and I went on the high road.  I decided to no longer 
support the party of taxing and spending and broken promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young Canadian concerned about no economic future.  I 
was a young Canadian concerned about a future steeped in debt 
given to me by this Liberal Party.  I had had it.  When I finally 
saw a party which was willing to stand up against public 
borrowing and tax increases and spending my future, I decided to 
support that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say to the hon. member is that too many Canadians are 
going to shoe stores in Minot to buy their shoes.  Too many 
Canadians are going south of the border because of this tax 
burden.  It is time we kept that business, those dollars and 
those jobs and those futures here in Canada, at home where they 
belong, by giving Canadians tax relief starting with the GST.

whenever the name is mentioned.  I can understand why.  That 
government raised taxes 71 times in nine years.  It was a 
shameful record that increased taxes on the middle class family 
by nearly $3,000 a year.  It was a record that deindexed the tax 
bracket so that middle income earners were pushed into a higher 
bracket.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, not so 
long ago, the government decided to abruptly withdraw its annual 
contribution of $7.2 million to the Tokamak project in Varennes, a 
research project on the development of nuclear fusion.  It 
preferred to concentrate its efforts on Candu reactors, which still 
function with the virtually outmoded technology of nuclear fission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Ontario Hydro decided to close seven of its Candu 
reactors.  Why?  Because after 15 years of use, these reactors are 
no longer safe. 
So now, after billions of dollars in investments, these reactors 
will be replaced by thermal power plants, which increase pollution 
levels by at least 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting all its eggs in one basket, the government tried to 
hoodwink Quebeckers and Canadians. It went for profits in the short 
term rather than looking to the future and showing respect for the 
environment, which would be possible with nuclear fusion.  In light 
of the proposed sale of two Candu reactors to Turkey and the Kyoto 
conference, we must conclude that the federal government has no 
vision whatsoever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
week the finance minister told the House that all provincial 
governments had agreed to the consultation document on gender 
analysis of changes to the Canada pension plan.  That information 
is not correct.  In fact the minister will know by now that 
federal and provincial status of women ministers have agreed that 
the gender impact analysis done on CPP changes was inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the minister knows this, will he conduct a

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is 
mistaken.  Having been at the federal, provincial and territorial 
ministers' meeting in Halifax I can say that the federal, 
provincial and territorial ministers for the status of women did 
not say anything about gender analysis in the CPP phase 1; but 
they did request unanimously that in phase 2, which is coming up, 
there be comprehensive gender analysis done in light of new 
information that has come about with an economic indicators 
project launched at that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know our finance minister is very interested in looking at 
those indicators and doing the appropriate thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the

listen to gender concerns in the next round? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister and the Minister responsible for the 
Status of Women also deny testimony before the finance committee 
that documents precisely how CPP changes penalize women for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

gender analysis it was done in part 1 of the CPP.  All the things 
that affect women positively were retained in the CPP: all of the 
dropout conditions in the CPP, the time off for maternity leave 
and the issue of spousal benefits, survivor benefits.  All these 
were maintained and will be dealt with further in part 2.

governments out of the 12 possible governments that were 
represented in Rio.

explain to the provinces the Canadian position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the government expects provincial 
governments to buy in and implement a position that it will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister's new CPP fund is already in 
trouble.  It turns out its 10 year value will be $41 billion less 
than the figure he gave us just two months ago.  It makes one 
wonder how shaky his other predictions are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell us how much premiums will have to 
increase to cover his $41 billion mistake? 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no change in the premiums.  The hon. member 
ought to know that actuarial assumptions, economic projections, 
are updated.  It is simply a question of projections and indeed 
there will be changes in those projections next year.  It all 
depends on what one assumes for interest rates, for mortality and

plan.  It took only two months before his CPP fund figures were 
wrong by a whopping $41 billion.  Here is the chance for him to 
get it right.  Will he give Canadians his best estimate about how 
long it will be before he hikes their CPP premiums over 9.9%?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

recently we stood in this House and honoured the men and women of 
the junior ranks in the Canadian Armed Forces for their 
outstanding performance during the Manitoba flood.  They did not 
get a pay raise.  In contrast, Canadians are shocked to learn 
today that tainted colonels and generals in the Canadian Armed 
Forces have received so-called performance bonuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain how people the likes of Vanier, Roy,

<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the research from the Reform Party 
is not very good. It was over a year ago that this performance 
pay was allowed. It was allowed in accordance with a Treasury 
Board decision. It reinstated performance pay for people at 
executive levels throughout the public service and included the 
RCMP and the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot comment specifically on who got it and who did not get 
it because that is not in accordance with the Privacy Act. 
Individuals within the forces as within all the public service 
have a right to privacy in this case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is fun to get up to do a few rounds with the latest Minister 
of National Defence.  What he is saying is 100% pure balderdash. 
The minister knows that some of the most infamous senior brass in 
the military not only qualified for but pocketed that performance 
bonus, people like Murray, Boyle, Labbé, all cited in the Somalia 
commission report for lacking leadership capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister stand in this House in front of Canadians 
and justify performance bonuses for these people?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

and who did not get it.  He does not know.  He is guessing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in accordance with a general provision for people in the 
public service.  It was also provided for the people in the 
Canadian forces. I might add that in terms of the rank and file, 
there have been two increases to close the gap between public 
service and Canadian forces personnel this year, one on April 1 
and one on October 1.  We are also working on another economic 
increase which will certainly give the rank and file of the 
Canadian forces a very deserved increase in pay.

that it was a Cadillac when we needed a Chev.  This government is 
on the verge of reversing itself when it announces the decision 
to purchase the Cormoran which is the kissing cousin to the 
EH-101 and if not a Cadillac certainly is a very heavy Chevy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

will be a more modest version of a helicopter.  Without saying

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would ask the government House leader to update us on the 
business of the House for the remainder of this week and for the 
first week that we are back after the break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I would ask him to update the House on any business 
rightfully belonging to this House which has been redirected to 
the Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House 
of the following: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there will be a resolution tomorrow about the report stage 
and the third reading of the bill on warrants to arrest, that is Bill 
C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission, before I continue, I would like to thank the 
House leaders of all parties for their co-operation in achieving 
consensus on what I am about to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, there will be a parliamentary recess in honour of 
Remembrance Day.  Afterwards, on Monday November 17, the government will 
propose consideration of the motion on amendments to the Constitution 
Act concerning the school system in Quebec. An agreement has been 
reached, so it is still possible we could sit until we conclude the 
debate, in order to proceed with the vote on the following day. 
Therefore, the first vote will be taken on Tuesday, November 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 18, we will consider Bill C-11 on customs duties.  That 
will be followed by Bill C-15, an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, 
and by Bill C-18, the legislation on powers of designated customs 
officers.  After that, we will consider Bill C-17 on Teleglobe Canada 
and Bill C-14 concerning the safety of water destined for human 
consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday, November 19, and Thursday, November 20, also pursuant 
to the agreement reached, we plan to consider Bill C-4, an act to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  Votes on that will be deferred according 
to whatever the whips decide at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is the legislative agenda for the rest of this week and for 
the whole week following recess.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REMEMBRANCE DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary 
of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 79 years ago on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 
11th month the guns of the great war finally fell silent.  The 
war to end all wars was over.  The toll in millions of lives lost 
was appalling. Nations were shattered as the flower of their 
youth lay slaughtered on the killing fields of Europe.  And 
across Canada, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons 
and daughters wept at the loss of their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fast approaching another Remembrance Day, a brief moment 
in time when Canadians pay homage to those young men and women 
who have given their lives in service to their country throughout 
this century.  It is a time to remember those whose blood stains 
the soil of nations they have helped to liberate from tyranny and 
oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a time as well to honour and to thank the families of 
those who died and the veterans still among us for their 
sacrifice and their commitment to peace.  We are indeed 
privileged to have two of those individuals with us today, as you 
have recognized, Mr. Speaker:  Mrs. Alice Taylor, this year's 
Silver Cross mother, and Victoria Cross winner, Sergeant Smokey 
Smith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin:</B>  Most of us are familiar with the now 
famous names of countries and campaigns in which our Canadians 
fought and died.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our history books, we read of Vimy and Passchendaele, 
Beaumont-Hamel and the Somme. From our fathers and grandfathers 
we have heard about the disasters of Hong Kong and Dieppe, the 
victories in Italy, France, and Belgium, and the liberation of 
the Netherlands. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the images of the Korean war would be among the first to 
flicker across our television screens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can never really understand is the terrible, terrible 
suffering that our veterans must have endured. And whatever the 
war, whatever the campaign, endure they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the ground forces in the mud, muck and mire of the trenches, 
if bullet or bayonet did not get you, disease would. Whether in 
the freezing cold of the blood soaked European battlefields or in 
the hell holes of prison camps in Hong Kong and Japan, or in the 
rice paddies of Korea, death was never far away. Death by 
dogfight or enemy flak met our airmen. Treacherous seas and death 
by wolfpack awaited our seamen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also read the impersonal statistics of war: over 60,000 
slain in World War I, over 42,000 in World War II, 516 lost in 
Korea.  Nor have our peacekeepers been immune from death and 
terrible wounds.  But they are just numbers on a page. They do 
not tell the human tragedy behind each and every loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter that I think does put a personal face on the 
tragedy, the suffering and the loss.  It is a letter written to 
his mother by a young army lieutenant serving in France on the 
eve of the battle of Amiens on August 7, 1918, very close to the 
end of the war.  He was one of five brothers who served in the 
great war and in the extract from this powerful letter he makes 
reference to three of his brothers. The words speak for 
themselves. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dearest Mother, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the evening before the attack and my thoughts are with 
you all at home, but my backward glance is wistful, only because 
of the memories and because of the sorrow that would befall and 
darken your lives should anything happen to me in tomorrow's 
fray.  Otherwise my eye is fixed on tomorrow with hope for 
mankind and with visions of a new world. A blow will be struck 
tomorrow which will definitely mark the turn of the tide— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no misgivings for myself in tomorrow's encounter.  It 
does not matter whether I survive or fall. A great triumph is 
certain, and I shall take part in it.  I shall strike a blow for 
freedom, along with thousands of others who count personal safety 
as nothing when freedom is as stake— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall strive only to achieve victory. We shall not hold our 
lives dear. The hour is all the more dramatic for me because, for 
the first time since I came to France, I am close to the spot 
consecrated by the blood of our gallant dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was here that noble Raymond fell and Joe and Kenneth shed 
their blood in freedom's cause.   I trust to be as faithful as 
they. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall be my mother and father's son tomorrow. Again God bless 
you all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your son Hedley. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day 110 men would fall in this battle and among the 
numbered dead was young Hedley Goodyear, in his early 20s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War, freedom and peace are not just the business of government 
and the military.  It is a personal concern, it is a personal 
issue, as this testimony of Remembrance Day holds fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget.  N'oublions jamais. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Hear, hear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to join with the minister and other hon. members 
in paying tribute to those brave Canadians who lost their lives 
or suffered injury in the wars of the 20th century.  We also pay 
tribute to those who came home, our veterans and those who serve 
in our armed forces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The veterans that I know face each passing Remembrance Day with 
a combination of pride and sadness. 
The pride of course comes from knowing that they participated in 
the preservation of freedom and democracy, not only for 
themselves but for other generations of Canadians and other 
people around the world. Their sadness arises from the lurking 
fear that no one really remembers or really cares.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a sad, old World War I song by the Australian 
Eric Bogle, sung so well by Canada's John McDermid, which puts 
the following words into the mouth of a crippled vet.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so now every April I sit on my porch<BR> 
And I watch the parade pass before me;<BR> 
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march,<BR> 
Reviving old dreams and past glories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the old men march slowly,<BR> 
Their bones stiff and sore,<BR> 
Tired old men from a tired old war,<BR> 
And the young people ask,<BR> 
What are they marching for?<BR> 
And I ask myself the same question. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who feel this sadness on Remembrance Day, I want to say 
not as a member of Parliament or as the Leader of the Opposition 
but as the father of five children, that we do remember what you 
are marching for and that we are eternally grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago my wife and I took our oldest son to the airport 
from which he was to leave for a year of travel and study in Asia 
and the south Pacific.  It was a time of mixed emotions for us, 
sadness that he was leaving home for an extended time for the 
first time, but excitement that he was now through high school 
and off to see the world before going on with his studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help thinking at that time how different our 
situation was and how infinitely preferable it was to that of 
parents who took their young people to the bus station or train 
station 80 years ago or 60 years ago at the outset of the first 
and second world wars and the terrible emotions they must have 
felt as they sent their young people not off to study, travel and 
work abroad in peace, but to fight in a war from which they might 
never return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because those parents and those young people were prepared 
to make those sacrifices that we have not had to make them.  It 
is because they suffered those terrible emotions that we do not 
have to suffer the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the veterans marching past the cenotaph, even if 
their step is slower now and the bones may be stiff and sore, 
that is the answer we should give to those who ask, what are they 
marching for.  They marched long ago and they march today for you 
and for me.  And for that we owe them our profound and 
everlasting gratitude.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, as the 
Bloc Quebecois critic for veterans issues, I would like to pay tribute 
to our veterans. This week, we will carry out together the promise that 
was made to them by the 35th Parliament, that is to extend the period of 
commemoration of Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, on November 2, 1995, at the commemoration of the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the second world war, Parliament decided to 
honour the courage and sacrifice of its military personnel by 
designating the week preceding Remembrance Day as veterans week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason that motivated Parliament in its decision was to 
educate the present generation, which has been fortunate enough to live 
without any major conflict for more than half a century, on the sense of 
duty and the freedom dearly won by Quebec and Canadian military 
personnel. To preserve the present peace that is still too fragile, we 
must remember the lessons of history and apply its teachings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remind all that democracy has a cost and, as such, it must 
be preserved at all cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 1.5 million Canadians served during the two world wars 
and in the Korean war and, we will never say this often enough, more 
than 110,000 soldiers lost their lives during the two major world 
conflicts, while several hundreds of others died during the Korean 
conflict and in peace missions under the United Nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget either all the civilians who gave their lives 
for the cause and those who, behind enemy lines, steadfastly prepared 
the final victory of the allied forces and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget the scope of human misery, the extensive human 
losses and the horrible suffering endured by all populations during 
these wars. During the second world war alone, civilian losses were 
estimated at more than 40 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to us to remind each new generation of young Quebeckers 
and Canadians of the sacrifices made for a noble cause by an entire 
generation, be it at Dieppe, in Hong Kong, Korea, concentration camps, 
not to mention the deportations, and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary responsibilities of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs is in fact to keep the memory of their deeds and sacrifices 
alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are memories I had in mind when, last August, I participated 
in the ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the landing in 
Dieppe, in Normandy, and with equal gratitude, this weekend, I will be 
attending ceremonies on the old continent with parliamentarian 
colleagues and veterans, as part of the Canadian delegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Humbly I shall pray at the military funeral service for Canadian 
airmen who died in the second world war but whose remains were just 
recently found in Belgium, reminding myself that the future of our 
children was built on the tombstones of our dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, let us pay tribute to our veterans. We must learn from 
these dark hours of history so that never again we will have to relive 
such sad events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our thanks to all veterans and to those who are no longer with us. 
At the going down of the sun, we will remember them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the New Democratic Party across Canada, my 
colleagues and I join with all members of the House in 
recognizing this coming Tuesday as Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that we would do well to pause and reflect on its 
meaning.  I will do so myself.  I had four uncles who served in 
the second world war, three of whom were prisoners of war.  They 
do not discuss those days with me very much but I know that they 
have paid a great price for the freedom that I have to be here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also remember and honour all those who have made the 
supreme sacrifice and who willingly gave everything for the cause 
of peace, and for the cause of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember the sacrifices and commitment of all those who 
pursued peace on our behalf in all of the wars, conflicts and 
peacekeeping missions around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we must not forget the contribution of those Canadians who 
served in the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in the Spanish civil 
war and the members of the merchant marine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remember someone familiar to this 
House who worked tirelessly for veterans and who showed, perhaps, 
what we can do, a Canadian who devoted much of his life to 
securing benefits for those gentlemen and ladies who served in 
the war and their families.  That is the late Stanley Knowles. He 
was a tireless champion on behalf of our veterans and achieved 
much on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is part of our obligation to try and build 
the kind of world for which our veterans gave their lives.  We 
believe this is a time for us to renew our commitment and our 
efforts in the pursuit of peace and democracy around the globe. 
We hope we will find a way to make life better for those who 
suffered and continue to suffer as a result of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are honoured to join in this moment of recognition and 
remembrance for those who died and for those who served and are 
still with us. In the tradition of Remembrance Day, we say from 
our hearts, we will remember them.  Their spirits watch us in 
this House and watch how we deal with the legacy left to us.

Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada to pay tribute to the many Canadians 
who risked their lives, and for those who fell in the cause of 
peace and freedom that we enjoy today in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Remembrance Week commemorates those who sacrificed their 
lives so that we might enjoy the ways of freedom and the many who 
gave their lives at an early age.  Myself and many Canadians at 
the age of 18 or 19 were finishing school, heading off to 
university or starting a career.  Although we share the same age, 
the lives of those who served may have ended. Clearly the 
ultimate sacrifice made by earlier generations in our country has 
helped to ensure peace, security and the opportunity for 
subsequent generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historians often note that Canada is one of the few countries in 
the world that came about peacefully, without bloodshed.  While 
Confederation did not directly result from military battles on 
our soil, Remembrance Week reminds us that today Canada was 
forged by yesterday's battles beyond our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The muddy fields of the Somme, the dark skies over the 
Rhineland, the cold, murky deeps of the North Atlantic, Hong Kong 
at Christmas; these are the many places where our soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, merchant marines, nurses and doctors put their 
lives on the line.  They fought for their families, their 
communities and their country. They defended Canada against 
aggression as members of the army, navy, air force and the fourth 
arm of our fighting services, the merchant navy. Many never 
returned from battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central structure of these Parliament Buildings, the Peace 
Tower, houses the memorial chamber.  In that chamber are the 
books of remembrance which hold the names of every Canadian who 
died for our freedom. Each day a new page is turned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The altars hold the books for the Boer war, the first great war, 
the second world war, the Newfoundland memorial, Korea and the 
merchant marine.  Some of the names on those pages today include 
William Locke, flying officer; Edmund Masters, able seaman; 
Alphonse Roy, soldier; William Worden, private; James Daniel, 
second engineer; Germain Houle, private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember them and honour them not just today, not just this 
week and not on November 11 but here in Parliament each and every 
day. Alexander Yorkton, corporal; William Zorn, sergeant; Richard 
Nankervis, lance corporal; Pierre Joquet, chief engineer; Francis 
Holland, private; Joseph Jackman, able ordinary seaman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These names, along with the more than 100,000 names that appear 
on these tear stained pages are the many reasons that we remember 
our war dead, our veterans and their families, not just November 
11, but 365 days of each year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to say a few 
words on the Bloc motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start into my little speech, I want to commend my hon. 
colleague from Calgary Southeast on his comments on this motion. 
I would like to point out to this House that here is a young man 
who was led down the broad path of taxation and spending.  He 
followed the advice of political pundits who said that this was 
the way their life would be regulated, that this is the direction 
that our youth would have to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He came to the pinnacle of truth, he looked down and saw the big 
debt hole and said, “Hold it, I am not jumping”.  He looked 
back and saw Reform and he said, “There is my answer.  Live 
within your means. Be comfortable. That is the way the government 
should be run”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did this young man do about it?  He became active in 
politics.  And here he is.  Here is the man who is going to 
change the future for many young people down the road.  Here is 
the man who is probably going to be on that other side some day 
and will say, “Look at what those people did.  Look at the 
suffering they have created”. He will fix it like some of our 
other young colleagues who are sitting with me in this House. And 
I am proud to be a colleague of theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to say a few things about the Bloc motion.  I 
kind of feel sorry for the Quebec government, that it got rooked 
into this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree that the deal should ever have been made but I 
know they have been suffering.  If members want to hear what the 
Liberals said in opposition, here is what one of the members said 
and he is still in the House today:  “We created a monster.  Now 
we have an underground economy so big that no one can even 
account for it”.  That is exactly what we heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  He is presently the public works 
and government services minister. Yes, that was his view of the 
GST when he was on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So it definitely was a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Here is another Liberal who 
graduated to that other place after they were elected.  This is 
what he said:  “The GST has undermined Canadians' confidence in 
the fairness of our tax system”.  That is exactly what this 
motion is talking about, the unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying my dad used to remind us of.  He said 
that if you are going to play with fire you are probably going to 
get burnt.  This is what the Quebec government was doing with the 
GST.  It saw the federal government raking in the dollars and it 
figured, why not harmonize it, broaden it a bit and then rake in 
some more money. All of a sudden, it realized that its economy 
was stopping, that it was deadening itself, it was killing 
itself.  That is what was happening.  Then the pain started 
coming and it did not know how to cure that pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of another little incident with my two older 
children when they were about five or six years old.  My wife 
came to me one noon and said, “Jake, we have a pocket gopher in 
our garden eating all our vegetables.  You better get a gopher 
trap and catch that varmint”. 
What did I do?  I went out and put a trap in the hole the gopher 
had dug and covered it up, never suspecting that my two 
youngsters were watching to see how I did it.  That is what the 
Quebec government was doing.  It was watching the federal 
government putting on taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within an hour my kids thought there should be some results. 
When you do something you have to have results.  They tried to 
uncover the hole and they got their hands in the gopher trap and 
ow, it hurt. My son and daughter came screaming home, “Dad, 
help, help”.  That is what the Bloc is saying today, “Help. 
There is pain”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did I do?  I had to reduce my kids' pain.  I took the trap 
off.  But if we look at what the Bloc did to soften the pain, 
they put a gopher trap on the other hand and then they really had 
pain.  And now it is really hurting. They created it themselves. 
How can they blame the federal government?  They looked in the 
mirror to see how it was working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A partner in crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  A partner in crime.  A very good 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did the right thing.  I took the gopher trap off my kids' 
hands which relieved the pain totally and made them happy again. 
That is what the Quebec government should have done.  It should 
have removed the tax.  Instead it harmonized it and created twice 
the pain. If you want to help heal a problem, you do not make it 
bigger, you put something on it to cure it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give another couple of examples of how they could have 
listened to the Liberals when they were in opposition and how 
they could have solved the problem.  This is what the present 
finance minister said in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> on April 4, 
1990:  “I would abolish the GST.  The manufacturers sales tax is 
a bad tax and there is no excuse to repeal one bad thing by 
bringing in another”.  The finance minister admitted that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister had a good idea.  He knew what he was 
talking about.  On June 21, 1994, after he was elected he became 
the finance minister, and this is what he said in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>:  “It is almost impossible to design a tax that is 
more costly and more inefficient than the GST”.  He had the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sitting on this side, waiting for the GST to be killed, 
to be abolished, to be scrapped.  What did the Bloc and the 
Quebec government do?  They said, “Let us jump on the gravy 
train.  Let us get some extra taxes.  Let us make things roll in 
this country.  Throw in another tax.  That is the way to go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what a writer said in 1996 about the GST.  I am citing 
this to show how destructive the GST has been to our economy.  He 
said:  “My message to the Prime Minister comes after yesterday's 
chilling report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
which shows that new home construction across the country crashed 
to a 35-year low last year.  That makes 1995 the worst year for 
our homebuilders since 1960, outstripping the pain of 1994 when 
we hit a 10-year low, and for Toronto it means a loss of another 
10,000 construction jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we surprised why the Quebec government is feeling the pain? 
I am sure it hit Montreal.  I am sure it hit Quebec.  That is 
just in the housing industry.  What did it do to the service 
industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember that in Winnipeg in my own province it killed 
tourism. 
It killed restaurants, small businesses and the service sector. 
As the member said, we cannot even afford to get a haircut 
because we have to pay tax on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> So why did they not kill the tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  I do not know why they did not kill 
the tax.  They were talked into trying to jump on the tax train 
and grab as much as they could, forgetting that it would hurt 
more in the end.  I feel sorry for the Quebec government but it 
is not just Quebec that has been hurt, it has hurt us right 
across the country.  It is the taxpayers who are suffering.  They 
will continue to suffer until we dismantle, scrap, kill or 
abolish the GST.  That will probably only happen when the 
Liberals are back here and we are over there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I could not help but listen intently to the very 
informative speech from my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out west there is a little parasite.  It gets onto human beings 
and livestock and will suck the lifeblood right out of you. We 
call it a tick.  I often wonder if maybe it got its name from 
politics, from governments trying to suck the lifeblood out of 
people through taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that basically we work more than six months out of the 
year just to pay taxes in this country.  That means out of every 
eight hours that a person works, four hours are going to pay 
taxes in order to keep the governments of our country going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think it is fair for the people of this 
country to work so hard and put in the time that they do to pay 
over 50% back in taxes to the government to absolutely squander 
in any way it sees fit without having any input from the 
taxpayers themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Madam Speaker, what I would like to 
point out to the member is that this tick is very dangerous.  If 
there are enough of those ticks they will not just keep on 
sucking that red blood, that Liberal blood as we would say, in 
the tax system, they will kill the animal or the person.  The 
worst of it is that the tick is not that bad.  The pain is not 
that bad.  But we have the darn mosquito that continually sucks 
that red blood.  It continually acts like a tax collector.  The 
more it has, the more it wants.  It becomes habitual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are little ponds sitting around that are kind of 
stale that seems to really attract those suckers.  It seems to be 
what also attracts the Liberals:  “If we can find an elephant or 
some industry that we can keep sucking, let us do it”.  When 
there is a bankruptcy, the Liberals' philosophy is that it will 
create another job.  Their philosophy is that some other sucker 
will come along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to be working too well because the provincial 
Liberal governments have been falling by the wayside like the 
mosquitoes and ticks when we start swapping them left and right. 
That is what is going to happen in the political field as far as 
the federal Liberals and politics are concerned. It happened to 
the Conservatives who invented the GST.  Now the Liberals are 
trying to take credit for inventing it.  I do not know what the 
deal is here but I imagine they are hoping that will give some 
credence to the Conservatives with their philosophy and hope that 
maybe some day they can swap some seats again. However, I am 
afraid it is getting late in the day and these tax suckers, these 
mosquitoes, will finally kill themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am always 
greatly pleased to participate in these debates and today we are 
obliged to respond to this Bloc motion, with which they are trying 
once again to cause instability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is a member of the Bloc, things are easy.  One makes 
all sorts of motions.  All that one has to do is to say it is the 
federal government's fault— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about harmonization, and, once again, the 
Bloc Quebecois is looking for a lifeline.  With all they have done 
in recent weeks, the issues of the biker gangs and drinking water, 
their flailing away in the water, they are looking for something to 
cling to.  They think they have found one more life raft to cling 
to called the harmonization of the GST and the QST, and they say 
they need compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an economist, but I know how to count.  In 1990, the 
governments of Quebec and Canada announced they had signed an 
agreement.  In agreeing to harmonize, they realized over the years 
that revenues increased by over $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You seek compensation because you have been misled.  You seek 
compensation because you have lost something. 
Perhaps they lost their credibility, but for sure Quebeckers gained 
a lot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They started by setting up a Quebec sales tax.  This tax cost 
them over $1.3 billion.  They understood that harmonizing would 
make things a lot more attractive for businesses.  They would 
become more competitive.  What happened?  Harmonization was indeed 
a positive thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are still going after the government, and we certainly 
know why they are.  Why?  Simply because elections are coming up in 
Quebec.  We have seen the disastrous state the PQ government is in. 
It does not know how to administer its own funds and has to come up 
with something.  They need to find ways to get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the PQ separatist stew every time? 
It is the federal government's fault. In order to win votes, they say it 
is the federal government's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a federal election in 1997. What happened? In 1997, the Bloc 
Quebecois lost 500,000 votes and 11 seats. If the Bloc were so strong, 
if it had the absolute truth, it would have won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> You lost your majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> We won in terms of votes and in terms of seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an election were held tomorrow morning, the Bloc Quebecois—and 
I am quoting our friend Jean Lapierre, the former Bloc member, who 
says the Bloc has no reason to be in Ottawa—would take quite a 
beating. It would disappear from the political map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, it was passion that brought Bloc members here. In 1997, it 
is pensions, because they have no other reason to be here. Year in year 
out, they look for reasons to save their leader's political life. 
They have to apologize. They always have to say that errors of judgment 
were made. We saw that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On what was said about biker gangs, I personally would have been 
ashamed. It is sad, so sad. And when we get back to the economy, they 
show us once again that it is just a shot in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain: we were right and, to paraphrase what my good 
friend and colleague, the hon. member for Outremont, said, our 
government acted without engaging into partisan politics. When we choose 
to protect the interests of Quebeckers and all Canadians, we can see 
that we are doing something positive. Why? Because we have the figures 
to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991-92, Quebec's revenues increased by 20,4%; in 1992-93 by 
17.4%; in 1993-94, by 9.1%. It is with this money that, together, we can 
help improve people's quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took some courses in economics. My knowledge of macroeconomics 
tells me this is positive. 
Even editorialists agree. However, when one has nothing to say, when one 
constantly tries to justify one's existence, we end up having to put up 
with things like this. I find it most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures speak for themselves. When Reformers take the floor, 
all Canadians start laughing. Flip-flaps, flap-flops, flip-flops, you 
name it, they do it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, when, unfortunately, a Reformer was elected for the first 
time, he said “We will scrap the GST”. In 1991, the current leader of 
the official opposition changed the Reform Party's position on the GST. 
He said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not be repealed because it would increase the deficit, 
but in public speeches the Leader of the Opposition talked about 
applying part of it to the debt, which would keep it even longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the Reform changed its position again, saying that it 
would reduce the GST in stages after the budget was balanced.  In 
1994 in the finance committee minority report on the GST the 
Reform Party supported harmonization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand. On the one hand, they are saying it is 
terrible, that we are trying to buy Canadians. On the other hand, they 
keep changing their minds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know why we have been elected? Because we look after the 
interests of Canadians and we have a consistent policy. When we all work 
together as partners with the Quebec government, when the separatist 
government understands that we have to co-operate in the interests of 
Canadians, we all benefit from it. Statistics confirm this. More 
improvement is needed. There is always room for improvement. I hope we 
will keep on improving things, but, at some point, we have to stop 
talking about allegations and stick to the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do is make sure Canadians can have a decent living. 
Our policy has been effective. Thanks to its revenues and good 
management, the Canadian government will finally balance its budget. All 
countries that are members of the OECD and other countries throughout 
the world speak about the Canadian miracle. We will balance the budget 
because everything is going just fine, with increasing revenues and good 
management in the government. Obviously, we will then look for ways to 
ease the tax burden. I will certainly be doing that. We have 
demonstrated that we were a responsible government, we have made the 
right decisions, and that is what Canadians think also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, we will have to look for the means to make our businesses 
more competitive. Facts prove it: compensation would mean losses. Once 
more, Quebec has had a winning partnership with the federal government. 
Despite all the partisanship of the Bloc Quebecois, we realize one 
thing: when Canadians and Quebekers are given the facts, they understand 
that the federal government has looked after their best interests.

Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  He talked 
a great deal in his speech about inconsistency and hypocrisy on 
the part of others in the Chamber.  Certainly when it comes to 
understanding the Reform Party there is some merit to his 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we are talking about inconsistency, where there is 
the greatest question, it comes down to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member make those comments in view of his party's 
record with respect to consistency or lack thereof on the GST? In 
1993 his leader, the prime minister of the country, said the GST 
would be gone within two years.  Now, four years later, it is 
still with us.  In fact it is being expanded and harmonized in 
terms of provincial sales tax in parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it consistency in terms of Liberal policy when we have 
such obvious gaps and discrepancies in income tax policy and such 
unfairness in the whole system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member find it consistent that we have a situation 
before us today whereby Revenue Canada has allowed a family trust 
of $2.2 billion in assets to be moved to the United States, 
thereby avoiding taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it consistent that we have today in Canada close to 8,000 
Canadians with incomes over $100,000 paying no tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it ever be consider consistent to have untaxed 
corporate profits amounting to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
more than $41 million every day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it consistent to see such discrepancies in terms of the 
burden being shifted more and more to low and middle income 
Canadians and to see such wealthy individuals and such large 
corporations avoiding paying any taxes at all?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers established a dynamic and strong society within the 
Canadian federation. This explains why recent polls clearly show the 
failure of the separatists' strategy based on lies and fairy tales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is the country we built together is an incomparable 
success, as is evidenced by the United Nations' statistics that show, 
year after year, that Canada is the best country in the world to live 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even on the issue of the financial advantages of federalism, the 
Bloc is mistaken when it describes Quebec as a loser. The facts are 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with today's motion. This motion claims that Quebec is 
treated inequitably because it did not get billions of dollars as 
compensation for harmonizing its sales tax with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this, the Bloc is echoing its provincial masters. It espouses 
the position of the Parti Quebecois government. But I would say to 
members of the Bloc that we are getting close to year 2000 and that in 
a couple, one member is no longer subject to the will of the other, 
nowadays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government referred to the assistance received by the 
harmonized Atlantic provinces, expressed in proportion to their 
populations, to justify its entitlement to adjustment assistance. This 
wrongly implies that federal programs are structured in such a way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us make one thing clear: the federal government 
still pays the province of Quebec for the administration of the GST. 
Quebec has received some $100 million a year since 1992-93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as other speakers mentioned today, the fact remains that 
the only purpose of adjustment assistance is to compensate for part of 
the revenue shortfall experienced by some provinces after they agreed to 
participate in an harmonized sales tax system. Again, its only purpose 
is to compensate for part of the revenue shortfall, not for the revenue 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government programs are designed to meet the specific needs 
of each province and to take into account their particular situation, 
but not to distribute benefits equally among provinces on the basis of 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the equalization program is aimed at providing the provinces 
with a lower tax capacity with the resources they need to pay for high 
quality programs and services for their residents.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this program, Quebec, which has less than 25% of the 
population, will receive this year 48% of total equalization payments, 
or $4 billion in federal transfers, when other provinces like Ontario, 
British Columbia and Alberta are not even eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is not the only direct transfer to Quebec. The 
province also receive its fair share of the CHST, which will reach $6.8 
billion this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997-98, these two transfers to Quebec, that is to say, the GST 
and equalization, will amount to $10.4 billion, which is more than for 
any other province. This amount represents over 27% of Quebec's 
anticipated revenues and almost $1,400 per person, about 25% more 
than the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When faced with a particularly acute cigarette smuggling problem, 
Quebec asked the federal government to reduce its tobacco tax. We 
agreed. We reduced the tax by $10 a carton, more than in any other 
province. Indeed, in giving Quebec what it wanted, the federal 
government lost revenues estimated at $300 million in all of Canada in 
1994-95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec also receive other benefits from the federal government. 
I would like to enumerate a few. Companies established in Quebec receive 
about 40% of research and development tax credits. To date, 57% of the 
funds invested by the Canadian technological partnership program went to 
Quebec companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for middle and long term financing, the Export Development 
Corporation spent 47% of its budget in Quebec, more than in any other 
province. That is strong strategic support for our exporting companies. 
Thirty-seven percent of the Business Development Bank of Canada 
investments are concentrated in Quebec. That is a significant 
contribution to the financing of small and medium size businesses in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian infrastructure program, the federal government 
gave $683 million to Quebec as its 33% share of the cost of 
rehabilitating local infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, to go back to the issue of compensation for the 
harmonization of the GST, I will repeat that the adjustment assistance 
offered to the provinces, who needed it in their transition to a more 
effective sales tax system, was fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec benefits greatly from several federal programs in areas 
where such assistance is needed. With regard to the adjustment 
assistance program put in place as part of the harmonized sales tax 
system, the need obviously does not exist. However, I remain convinced 
that Quebec's initiative to introduce a value added sales tax similar to 
the federal tax is legitimate and beneficial to both businesses and 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, the facts in no way indicate that Quebec was 
treated unfairly. On the contrary. We have convincing proof that federal 
programs are based on equitable rules. 
When Quebec's needs and situation warrant federal assistance, such 
assistance is always provided and often exceeds the share that province 
should receive in proportion to its population.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to address a few comments to the members across the 
floor, particularly to the last two who spoke from the government 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to consider a couple of things with what is 
being put forward with this motion.  We must recognize that in 
Canada today, through the democratic process, Quebec Canadians 
have elected the Bloc members who are here in the House.  There 
is something that has caused them to get frustrated to the point 
where they would choose to elect the Bloc members on this side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not agree with the motion that has been put 
forward by the Bloc, I do recognize some of the frustration that 
Quebeckers feel with the current government.  I was interested in 
hearing some of the comments that members across the way made 
earlier in talking about the integrity of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded again of the GST promise that we have not had 
anything delivered on.  Taxes have increased.  We heard the 
member misquote our leader.  He even said that the figures prove 
the Liberals' good performance.  I refer to a $600 billion debt, 
to taxes that take us six months to pay, $45 billion in interest 
payments every year, 29 new spending increases in the throne 
speech.  With all this he says they are lowering the tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come in here and with this litany of tax and debts, they 
hold up the UN's announcement of how we are the favoured nation 
and the chosen nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are the best of a bad lot, is that the best we can do?  I 
say that Canada has a great potential to do even more than we 
have, but we are limited by the government to the point that 
Canadians in Quebec have become so frustrated that they are 
electing Bloc members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member who spoke previously when will this government 
realize that Canadians are asking for lower taxes and some 
integrity in government instead of the misguided increased tax 
and mismanagement that we continue to see from this government? 
That is the crux of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could have integrity and proper management of the fiscal 
issues in this country, perhaps we would not be faced with Bloc 
motions such as the one we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a hard time 
keeping a straight face.  When I listen to this member of the 
official opposition it makes me think that I am watching the film 
about Sybil.  I am not denigrating people who suffer from 
psychiatric disorders.  Sybil suffered from multiple personality 
disorder, which meant that each individual personality was not 
aware of what the other one was doing or saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a party which has changed its position regarding 
GST numerous times, even before 1990, and its members do not seem 
to remember each individual change.  How many times have they 
changed their position?  Let me count the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1990 they exploited public opposition to the GST to get 
two of their members elected to this House.  In 1991 the leader 
of their party reversed that position, saying it would not be 
repealed because that would increase the deficit, and yet in 
speeches he gave he talked about applying it to part of the debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone with a brain in their head knows that if you apply it to the 
debt it increases the amount of time the tax would be in force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in 1992 they changed their position again.  My God, how 
many times is that?

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to 
the motion regarding the harmonization of the GST and the QST in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness 
to Quebec in the matter of the GST, the government having denied it 
compensation without letting it submit its arguments to an 
independent arbitration panel made up of three experts, the first 
to be appointed by the federal government, the second by the 
government of Quebec, and the third jointly by the first two. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST Act came into force on January 1, 1991. As everyone knows, 
the federal government of the day implemented this new tax in great 
haste without a thorough analysis of its application, causing many 
technical difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, this legislation is still criticized, mainly by small and 
medium size businesses which are forced to collect this tax for the 
federal government, thereby incurring considerable administrative costs. 
A business must collect this 7% tax from the consumer. 
It is reimbursed through an input tax credit.  This tax credit may 
be requested by each individual in the production and distribution 
chain, with the result that it is the consumer, and the consumer 
alone, who pays the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be normal and fair for the consumer to have some say 
over where his money goes, since he is well aware that the GST is 
a very important source of federal revenues.  Furthermore, this is 
why, despite their 1993 red book promise, the Liberals have not yet 
abolished the GST.  Yet this tax adds considerably to the tax bill 
of already overtaxed citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec were good sports.  We were the first to harmonize 
the tax, just as we were the first to defend Canada's interests in 
the free trade issue.  Now that other provinces want to follow 
Quebec's lead and harmonize the GST, the federal government is 
getting generous. 
If the federal government gave $1 billion to certain governments in 
the maritimes, why is it refusing to give the people of Quebec 
their fair share for harmonizing the GST?  Is it the size of the 
cheque required that is scaring it off? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the size of the cheque, in the interests of 
fairness, we in the Bloc Quebecois are suggesting through this 
motion that the federal government create a neutral arbitration 
panel, with one representative to be appointed by the federal 
government, one by the Quebec government, and one to be neutral. 
One of the things this committee would be called upon to do is to 
work out the amount of this cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what the Government of Quebec would do with this $2 
billion it has coming to it.  It could certainly improve its public 
image, which has taken a beating because of the cuts of over $2.237 
million made by the federal government in social transfer payments 
to Quebec. 
And this does not stop the Minister of Finance from tooting his own 
horn in every public forum about the good job he is doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to arrive at a zero deficit with the methods 
used by our dear Minister of Finance; all you have to do is cut social 
transfers to the provinces by 54% and shamelessly dip into the 
employment insurance fund. This money belongs to the unemployed and to 
the employers who contribute to it. In fact, speaking of the employment 
insurance fund, we recommend strongly to the Minister of Finance that he 
lower the employment insurance premium rate from $2.90 to about $2.50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these new rates, small and medium-sized businesses could, 
among other things, start investing in job creation. 
Even with these rates, the employment insurance fund surplus would allow 
the Minister of Human Resources Development to reevaluate the 
eligibility requirements for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it would be interesting if the Minister of Finance, instead of 
digging directly or indirectly into the pockets of the less privileged 
in society, could respect the commitments he made in 1995 to reduce 
departmental expenditures by 19%. It is much easier for the government 
to act as it does than to tackle the real waste problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has this government really taken steps to stop waste? No. Think of 
the billion dollars that this government foolishly let slip from the 
state's coffers when it privatized our air traffic control system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind you of the facts. The Minister of Finance himself had 
estimated our air traffic control system at $2.6 billion. 
As for the Minister of Transport, he had estimated it at $2.4 billion. 
So we can say that the average value of the air traffic control system 
is $2.5 billion. Why was this system sold for $1.5 billion, as the 
Auditor General of Canada asked in his latest report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat the question: How can this government shamelessly and 
without regret justify this billion dollar shortfall that could have 
been used, for example, for our young people, our single mothers, our 
old people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of young people, I must tell this House how appalled I am 
that in 1997, children are going to school in the morning on an empty 
stomach. This does not seem to sadden our Heritage Minister, when you 
consider how freely she is throwing our money to the wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that it is that same minister who was forced to 
resign because of an 1993 electoral promise that was not kept, namely 
that “we Liberals will abolish the GST”. Not only did she come back, but 
she continues to waste people's hard-earned money with her bogus 
projects. We have for instance her flag project, which is blowing in the 
wind and scattering taxpayers' money around. 
In 1996-97, this foolish initiative cost $15.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention only that project, but I can tell you today that 
with all her useless programs, that minister has spent $94.6 million of 
the taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a disgrace! Let us think about hungry children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot go on about this government's shameless wastefulness 
because it makes me ill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before wasting money needlessly, let us think of all our 
people who are living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that any self-respecting government which is 
interested in making proper use of its taxpayers' money should, 
before it spends money needlessly, get the go-ahead from all of its 
elected representatives, without any partisanship.  Second, it 
ought to follow the recommendations of the auditor general to the 
letter. 
We must not lose sight that the auditor general's function is to 
watch out for the taxpayer's interests.  Third, all governments 
ought to follow the lead of the municipal governments and pass 
anti-deficit legislation.  Fourth, they should reform the corporate 
tax structure so that it helps create jobs, and the personal income 
tax system so that it will be more equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, we know that this supposedly sensible 
government is on the verge of spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars on helicopters without having the decency to reveal all the 
pertinent details of the purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am imploring the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services to have the courage to break the chain and to consult his 
colleagues in the House before he issues a purchase order to the 
tune of several million dollars. 
This would offer him a golden opportunity to practice what he 
preaches, the transparency of government operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indirectly, it is GST funds with which the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs is allowing Guy Bertrand to take the case 
of the legitimacy of Quebec's sovereignty before the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and his colleague, the Minister of Justice, must put an end 
to this legal wrangling, which is costing the taxpayer a fortune.

Bourassa himself to stick to the subject. I listened to him and he did 
not say a word on the motion we moved. The only thing he tried to do was

he talked about everything but the motion. He should apply his remarks 
to himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of order. 
The hon. member for Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse has the floor.

speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that in a democracy only a people has the 
right and the obligation to determine its future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must put an end to the intrusion by the federal government into 
areas under provincial jurisdiction and, thus, bring overlap to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will understand that I am referring here to Bill C-14, 
a debate that will make us throw a lot of money down the drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end my speech by inviting all hon. members, without

before I direct a question to the hon. member from the Bloc I 
want to say that I was very shocked to hear about the promises

Canadian people about what they would or would not do with the 
GST.  How many times have they changed their minds just because 
of the political tide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest once and for all that they come out with a solid 
position, quit changing their minds and quit being hypocritical 
with the Canadian people.

to Quebec in the matter of the GST— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us talk about the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
In its electoral platform, the Bloc said that Quebec, which chose a 
phased-in harmonization starting in 1991, has not received the same 
compensation as the three maritime provinces, since Ottawa offered them 
$961 million as of April 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the GST is concerned, the Bloc Quebecois considered that 
the transfer of all federal fields of taxation would create some 
interesting prospects for Quebec.  Also, the bloc proposed a series of 
tax measures in the context of a sovereign Quebec.  For example 
“A 
sovereign Quebec will have the power to abolish the GST and replace it 
with a tax on commercial operations better adapted to free 
trade”. This 
quotation is from the <I>householder</I> published by Roger Pomerleau, the 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> We fixed his fiddle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Since we are talking about GST, let us go back 
to the beginning of the GST. 
We will go back to the Quebec National Assembly on December 14, 
1990.  What I find strange in this vote is that Quebec decided to 
harmonize its tax.  The Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois have 
always told us that this was a unanimous vote by PQ opposition 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you this evening that there were several PQ 
members missing in the National Assembly.  They were not there to 
vote against the GST.  Several of them were missing.  As a 
Quebecker, I thought it was a unanimous vote by the Parti Quebecois 
in the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the Minister of Revenue, Raymond Savoie, told 
the National Assembly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST strikes me as a fairer tax because it is based on 
the consumption of goods and services. 
And the more goods we consume and the more services we use, 
the more justified it is to opt for this method of taxation as 
opposed to the traditional one based strictly on revenue 
ratio. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the funniest thing—because we are still talking about the 
GST, we will stick to that—is that when Ms. Marois, now a 
minister, but then the member for Taillon, spoke to this bill, she 
was completely opposed to the opposition party, to her party, and 
said that for her, the important thing was that businesses should 
be more competitive.  For her—Ms. Marois—it was more important 
that our businesses should be on an equal footing with other 
sectors in the United States. 
In that sense, she was in favour of this harmonization, or the 
movement, and the minister was very happy to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that should be pointed out about the 
GST, because we must go back to where it all began, in 1990.  It is 
important that Quebeckers and the people of Abitibi understand what 
the GST was.  Why is the motion today coming from the Bloc? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Because it is not coming from your neck of 
the woods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> When you lost the election in 1985, the 
difference between the rate of taxation in Ontario and that in 
Quebec was 10.5%—this is still 1990—because today it is only 3.5% 
and on the decrease. 
It is steadily decreasing.  It was not the intention of the 
government in power at that time, the Liberal government,to obtain 
compensation.  They knew there was an agreement with Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the speech by the Quebec Minister of Revenue, he is 
careful to stress the notion of fairness.  We were guided by our 
wish to see that those with low incomes did not pay for this 
reform.  We were not going to foot the bill for this reform. 
Measures were introduced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are getting refunds. The opposition never says that 
low income Canadians receive GST refunds. It never says that the elderly 
and students receive GST refunds. We never hear anything about that, but 
it is good for these people. They tend to consume less that we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures were introduced. These people are getting refunds and 
these changes will cost nothing to families with an income of around 
30 000 $, for instance. They will lose nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing should be said regarding the GST in Quebec, we are making 
changes, reducing it from 9% to 8% and to 7% in 1992. 
The overall impact should be beneficial, good for democracy and I 
believe empowering, or at the very least advantageous for Quebec society 
as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is very important, and that is that the minister took 
note of the change and really sought to be fair. He noticed that the 
government was committed to the notion of economically advantageous 
mechanisms across North America and this is what this bill is all about. 
This is why Mrs. Marois supported free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing in this debate in the national assembly was very 
important, the vote. When it took place, quite a few PQ members were 
absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But one thing should be said, according to my notes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Could the member give us the list of those who 
were present? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, if the hon. member wants to know 
who was there, I can send the list to his office.  I can tell you that 
I have the list of those in favour and those against.  Not bad for a 
member in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the memorandum of understanding between the two 
levels of government.  On August 30, 1990, the Government of Quebec and 
the Government of Canada announced the signing of an agreement whereby 
the federal government fully transferred administration of the GST to 
the Government of Quebec which, in return, would harmonize the tax base 
of the provincial sales tax with the federal tax until January 1, 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had become necessary to replace the federal sales tax.  Before 
the GST, the federal government had a manufacturers sales tax, a tax 
which had become obsolete in many ways, but was never mentioned by the 
hon. members opposite. 
That old tax had 26,000 exemptions.  There were so many gaping holes in 
that legislation that the government of the time had to do something, 
hence the GST.  With the replacement of the manufacturers sales tax with 
a more modern sales tax and the decision to harmonize the two taxes, 
Quebec was putting its economy in a better position to compete with the 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. Is the hon. 
member speaking on behalf of the Liberal Party or on behalf of the 
Conservative Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, I could answer that some of his 
colleagues have been members of a communist party and, today, we do not 
know whether they are speaking for the Bloc Quebecois or for some 
communist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agreeing to harmonize the two tax systems, Quebec was putting 
its economy in a better position to face competition from other 
provinces and other countries. Indeed, in reducing the cost of inputs 
and capital, it was making industries in the province more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also one thing we must talk about: the administration of 
the two taxes should be more efficient and less costly, both for 
business and for governments. As a result of the agreement, retailers 
were finally going to enjoy more uniform tax rules and introduce a 
single accounting system and a centralized administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you are telling me that my time is almost up. I 
thought I had 20 minutes for my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> You have 11 minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Do I have confirmation that I have 11 minutes 
left? Thank you. You see, this side also has learned to count.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harmonization of Quebec's provincial tax with the GST was done 
in two stages. Thus, on January 1, 1991, the provincial tax base and the 
GST base were harmonized for personal goods, that is, personal property. 
As of January 1, I repeat, the base was extended. It now includes 
services and personal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened on January 1, 1992? Quebec, our Quebec, the Quebec of 
Quebeckers, the Quebec of the Abitibi people, the Quebec of Canada— 
because my Canada also includes Quebec—started administering the GST 
collected on its territory. 
In 1992, the federal government helped Quebec take on new administrative 
functions—the opposition is quiet about that—by handing over the 
infrastructure, i.e. facilities and equipment, and providing $20 million 
over three years toward start up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that several million dollars worth of facilities and 
equipment were involved. In addition, federal employees were offered 
comparable positions within the provincial public service. We know that 
people in the Quebec provincial public service are very well paid. They 
are in a very good position to do good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both governments share on an equal basis the cost of administering 
the sales tax. What happened to revenue generated by the consumption tax 
in Quebec over five years? It increased by nearly $2 billion. 
Members opposite often throw figures like $1 billion, $1,000 million, $2 
billion, but now we are going to have the real figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still on the same topic. We were talking about the GST all 
along. Within five years, the revenue generated by the consumption tax 
in Quebec increased by nearly $2 billion, or a 50% increase. Statistics 
show that, while Quebec collected $4 billion in sales tax in 1987-88, in 
1991-92 the new sales tax grossed $6.158 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When discussing sales tax revenue, it is important to known the 
real figures. They are all there. In terms of growth over 1989-90, with 
the GST—not the old outdated sales tax, but the GST—in 1990-91, 
Quebec's revenue increased by 2.7%, or $240 million. In 1991-92, it grew 
by $1 billion, or 20% more. 
And, in 1992-93, $888 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures provided by Quebec officials tell us that, since 
1990-91, the province received $3.463 billion, for an average increase 
of 11.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is once again using the obsolete federal estimate of $4.8 
billion regarding the revenues generated by a harmonized sales tax, 
instead of the revised amount of $4.575 million. So, what do we make of 
the inaccurate statements found primarily in Quebec's public accounts, 
particularly on page 218? It is important to know these facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government says one merely has to look at Quebec's 
public accounts or budget documents to see the extent of the costs 
generated by harmonizing Quebec's sales tax with the GST. 
However, these documents clearly show that revenues from the provincial 
sales tax increased by $3.463 billion following harmonization in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government uses the argument that the $961 million 
compensation to the maritime provinces is equivalent to $423 per capita, 
while the compensation claimed by Quebec amounts to $273 per capita.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comparison does not make any sense, since compensation is not 
at all calculated on a per capita basis. This is where the Bloc 
Quebecois is mistaken, when it refers to $961 million. These arguments 
are only based on the total provincial losses of sales tax revenues 
following harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know where the Bloc Quebecois' mistake come from as regards 
the $961 million? It comes from the fact that, in Quebec, government 
expenditures increased much more rapidly than federal transfers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not 
know what to say about this confused, distorted and erroneous lesson in 
history. You know, I really wondered where the hon. member for Abitibi 
was living today. Was he living in the past, in the present or in the 
future? Was he talking like a Conservative or a Liberal? At times, I 
could picture him here, or in his riding, even at the National Assembly. 
Figures were quoted to us, right and left. Everything is so confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only goes to reinforce our request. All these figures, all the 
unclear statements like the ones we just heard, led us to submit a 
legitimate request to have an independent expert panel that would 
finally shed the light on this issue. I do not think arguments like 
those we have heard since the beginning of today's debate will convince 
us to back down. On the contrary, we will fight and we will get our 
$2 billion in GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, I have a lot of respect for the 
hon. member. I know that the hon. member for Lotbinière has a lot of 
respect for Quebec, but I hope he has some respect for the National 
Assembly. What I have received today is the truth; it does not contain 
any error. The figures I quoted came for the province of Quebec and 
contain no mistake. Based on the assumption that the taxes would have 
been fully harmonized by 1990, and according to the formula applied to 
all of the provinces, Quebec, just like Ontario, Alberta and British 
Columbia, would not be entitled to any adjustment assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process, the Canadian government was very 
transparent. Civil servants had a lot of discussions to clarify some 
data. The latest figures I quoted today, that take into account the 
comments made by Quebec, were submitted in February 1997. I think it is 
important to point that out. 
The hon. member talked about errors being made and said that we received 
this information back in February. The rules are the same for everyone 
and the results are fair to all the provinces, in this area as on all 
the other issues where, very often, Quebec is a big winner, just like 
Jacques Villeneuve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question to the hon. member for Abitibi. He just 
told us that there were figures transmitted between Quebec and Ottawa 
officials, that everybody was getting along fine and that there was no 
problem. Where did he get that? The last figures laid on the table deal 
with a $2 billion claim from the Quebec government stating that the 
federal government has shown blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter 
of GST harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can quote any old figures he wants—and he did come up with 
just about any old figures—the fact remains that, when looking at the 
tax structure before and after harmonization, when taking into account 
the need for Quebec to increase corporation taxes because the federal 
government did not give it any compensation, one can see there has been 
a cost, and this cost has been assessed and duly, seriously, calculated 
by the Quebec government and by the officials, and also endorsed by a 
consensus arrived at by every Quebec participant in the economic summit 
of last year. It has been endorsed also by the Canadian premiers at the 
St. Andrews conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a time when we have to stop talking nonsense here. 
There is a $2 billion claim on the table, there are formulas, there are 
cost assessments that have been made, and now we are asking that an 
objective panel review our figures and those of the finance minister. He 
should understand that. That is not hard to understand. If there is 
something simple for him to understand, it is that an objective, non 
partisan panel can make a serious analysis whereas he says just about 
anything. He should understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am trying to be 
fair. I received these figures today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never know when the opposition will present a motion. We learn 
about it in the morning when we get up with the chickens, at 5.30 a.m. 
The member said: “I do not understand the member across the 
way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> You do not understand a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> In 1990—I am giving you the background, it is 
important—on December 14, 1990, people accepted the GST in the 
National Assembly. A former member said “We will abolish the 
GST”. 
Premier Lucien Bouchard should go to the National Assembly, instead of 
visiting other countries, and say to Quebeckers “We will immediately 
abolish the GST”. The Party Quebecois members could vote on that. They 
can do it. They have a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures I mentioned today are real figures. I can tell you that 
when Quebec's needs or situation require it, the federal government is 
always there to give its financial support to our people, the people of 
Quebec, the people of Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Down with the GST. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing by time with my colleague for 
Winnipeg North Centre.  I do not know if I will be using all 
of my 10 minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have to say about the HST will not take ten minutes. We must 
look at what is going on in New Brunswick and in the other Atlantic 
provinces. It is interesting to hear the Reform members and the 
government members talk about hypocrisy. I would say that if you put two 
cats in the same bag, only one will come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> The Liberals had promised to get rid of the 
GST. In my province, instead of getting rid of the GST, we ended up with 
a tax that makes no sense. 
We have low income families who now must pay 15% on diapers, 15% on 
electricity, and those people are not getting any compensation as was 
mentioned a few moments ago. We must look at how much these people are 
paying and how little they are getting in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a mother is paying 15% more for diapers, the person who has 
money and who wants to buy a $45,000 car is paying less. This is not my 
idea of justice. To me, this is just another tax on the poor, and the 
rich are paying less once again. That is the Liberal way. It is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I was in the human resources development committee, 
and even senior officials in the department were saying that Atlantic 
Canada was affected the most by unemployment insurance reform, by the 
fact that no jobs are being created in our region. And we are hit by 
this tax on top of all that. We are the provinces who pay the most for 
a stamp in this country. 
In the regions, where there are no jobs, there are no longer any 
programs to help people. There are Liberals in this House who are really 
proud of what they are doing. I think they should be ashamed of 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at what the tax really brings. There are people who 
have no more money to buy things and this affects our merchants. Our 
small and medium size businesses are really affected by the BST—and we 
have a good definition for this BST where I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Could you tell me what it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> We are not allowed to say such things in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we really have to go see what happened. The Liberals 
criticized the Conservatives. They got elected on the GST, really. They 
came back and said “Yes, yes, the deficit was bigger”. First things 
first, the deficit—that has to be settled right away. Who has paid down 
the deficit? 
It is the unemployed, it is old people, it is students, people without 
jobs, people receiving social assistance. Those are the people who paid 
down the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any large corporations in this country that put a lot 
of money on the deficit. But nobody mentions that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate these people. Each time I have the opportunity I 
congratulate them for having paid down the deficit because without the 
underprivileged in this country, it would have never been paid down. The 
government did not look elsewhere to pay for it.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the people from the Atlantic region are very disappointed with 
the GST or the BST. It was just another tax. They say they are not 
increasing taxes, but people are paying 8% more for electricity and 
heating. It is not a tax. They did not increase taxes. I would not want 
them to admit that they increased them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad, in our regions, when we see the rate of 
unemployment and the rate of poverty, and when on top of that, we have 
a government that imposes such a tax on us. This is unacceptable. Our 
businesses are being affected. The number of personal and commercial 
bankruptcies continues to rise, and this has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I do not have to take 10 minutes to tell you that the GST stinks 
for me and its stinks for the majority of the people in New Brunswick 
and the Atlantic region. Only Prince Edward Island escaped from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there was a bribe. It is true that the former 
Premier of New Brunswick hurried to collect his $1 billion in taxes in 
an attempt to save the face of the Liberal government. They were trying 
to find a way to say that they had gotten rid of the GST. But who is 
paying for that today? It is us, the people from the Atlantic region. It 
is always the people who have a hard time making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I will end on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the three Atlantic provinces that have the BST are 
very upset.  It is a very unfair tax.  It is the people at the 
lowest scale of income who are paying the most.  They are paying 
tax on electricity.  They are paying 15% tax on children's 
clothing starting from the first dollar.  However, if you buy an 
article that is over $93, you will pay less.  There are not a lot 
of people down home who buy articles over $100.  A lot of 
families cannot afford that.  They buy just the necessities but 
they are the ones paying the most because of the blended sales 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people that I represent, I want it on the 
record that we are very disappointed in the Liberal government 
for their broken promises and a tax that is very unfair to the 
people of my riding and the Atlantic provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to the hon. member and I sympathize with 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the tax was debated in the House I remember speaking 
against the BST being introduced in the Atlantic provinces.  I 
did not call it the BST but I did use two of those initials.  I 
may have dropped the <I>t</I> a few times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things were said by the government. Actually, its members 
were the official opposition when the GST was brought in.  At 
that time Liberals said that public and private libraries would 
have to reduce the purchase of books and newspapers by about 10% 
annually because of the GST.  The present Prime Minister said 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of finance said at that time that the goods and 
services tax was a stupid, inept, incomplete and incompetent tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through the debate today we have heard about hypocrisy.  I 
would think that this is the height of it.  Now we have the Prime 
Minister saying it is his personal tax and how much he loves it. 
When he leaves the country and talks to other leaders around the 
world, he brags about how he introduced it and not the 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member was not in the House during the time of 
the BST and the debate in this House.  I wish she had been here. 
Perhaps we would have had more help. 
I do not recall hearing from her party at that time.  I would 
like to know if anybody from the east has put into dollars and 
cents how much the blended sales tax has really cost the people 
back home.

figures with me but I can say, on a humane basis, that the figure 
is very high.  That is the important part.  It may be millions or 
billions.  The important part is that the people from low income 
families are paying through the nose because of this tax.  That 
is the only thing that is important.  It is a very unfair tax 
that makes lower income people pay more again. That is what 
concerns me and my people.

to congratulate the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac who, unlike 
Liberal members opposite, has impressed me a great deal with her 
respectful, intelligent and heartfelt remarks. She spoke with great 
humanity. She is bringing to this House an attitude of great respect and 
she raises the level of our debates, whereas Liberal members keep 
attacking and belittling Quebec. She speaks about citizens in general 
and she does it respectfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate her.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite shows 
a lack of respect. He should know that we are legitimately elected

We represent a majority in Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will give the

before we proceed to the next speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the 
opposition motion sponsored by the Bloc concerning the GST and 
the harmonized sales tax.  I understand its reasons for putting 
forward this motion and the kinds of concerns that have been 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is putting us all in an interesting position to debate the 
unfairness of some changes to a measure that is inherently unfair 
to begin with.  As my colleague indicated in her comments, we are 
really discussing how two wrongs can make a right. It is 
important for us to deliberate on the very question of the need 
to introduce the GST by first the Conservatives and then the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will raise a couple of points in this discussion.  The GST is 
a very regressive tax measure. 
That has been enunciated by a number of other speakers. It is in 
fact a good tax, but it is a good tax for business.  It is a very 
bad tax for individuals. As we all know, unlike all other sales 
taxes, corporations do not pay the GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are widening the gap between the haves and the have nots, 
creating an ever-widening gap between those who are struggling 
day by day to make ends meet and those who are enjoying an 
incredible amount of profits, dividends and luxury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in our society today who need a break, some real tax 
relief, are the hard working women and men who have been trying 
desperately to make ends meet as real wages keep falling. What we 
are dealing with, and we have all experienced this for a number 
of years, is a tax measure that makes it even harder for those 
ordinary working women and men to make ends meet, who are forever 
left asking the question “Why is there so much month left at the 
end of the money?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an inherently unfair tax to begin with, brought to us by 
the Conservatives and harmonized by the Liberals, a harmonization 
that heaps an even greater burden on individuals, hard working 
women and men, and gives an even greater break to the big 
corporations who are already enjoying incredible profits like we 
have not seen in recent times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not only dealing with an inherently unfair tax, whether 
we are talking about the GST, or the BST or any other terminology 
that describes this harmonized sales tax, but we are also talking 
about a tax measure that was introduced in a most dishonest way. 
We know the idea originated with the Conservatives. Canadians 
will never forget that it was the Conservative government that 
forced the GST through even though at that time fewer than 10% of 
Canadians supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time it was the Liberals who strongly opposed the GST. 
They made very strong public statements about that opposition.  I 
want to quote the Prime Minister who said on October 29, 1990, 
“I an opposed to the GST.  I've always been opposed to it and I 
will be opposed to it always”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote the Minister of Finance who said on April 4, 
1990, “I would abolish the GST.  The manufacturers' sales tax 
which the GST replaced was a bad tax but there is no excuse to 
repeal one bad tax by bringing in another one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals do after making those strong statements? 
They did a double take. They practised deceit and dishonesty when 
it came to the Canadian public and at the earliest opportunity in 
government supported the GST.  It went further and moved to 
harmonize the GST and increased the burden on working Canadians 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That whole move to harmonize, to blend, the GST with provincial 
sale taxes, if applied across this country, represents a shift of 
another $6 billion to $7 billion of the tax burden from 
corporations to people.  As we know from the debate today, 
families in Atlantic Canada and Quebec are suffering very much 
from this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By breaking their commitment, by breaking their word, the Prime 
Minister and other Liberals in this Parliament abandoned an 
opportunity to make Canadian families better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of inconsistencies and shifting positions, let us not 
forget to mention the position of the Reform Party.  Reform 
members are standing in this House today expressing concern about 
the GST, raising concerns about the whole debate we are having 
today with respect to the blending of sales taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Reform Party that said in this House in 1994 in a 
report on the GST that the Liberal Party was to be congratulated 
on its attempts to harmonize the GST with provincial sales taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Reform Party at that time that recommended that 
consumption taxes should be levied on the broadest possible base. 
This of course would mean extending the GST to food, to 
medication and nursing home charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were hoodwinked on this issue.  They did not support 
the GST.  They believed the Liberals prior to 1993 when they said 
they would not move forward on the GST.  Instead, they got hit 
with a double whammy, support for the GST and now a move to 
ensure a blending of the GST with provincial sales taxes across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opportunity today is to suggest to the Liberal government 
particularly that there is an alternative to this kind of 
regressive tax policy.  There are alternatives available to this 
government for both collecting necessary revenues and ensuring a 
measure of fairness in our tax collection system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise in particular one such proposal since it is very much in 
the news currently and very much represents the unfairness in our 
system today. In about a month's time a group entitled Project 
Loophole will bring a matter to the courts pertaining to the fact 
that in 1991 Revenue Canada ruled that one family trust could 
transfer $2.2 billion in assets to the United States without 
paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raised a whole lot of questions about how many other family 
trusts are being provided this option.  How much money earned 
here as a result of hardworking Canadians is being moved out of 
the country without taxes being paid? How much profit is being 
earned by corporations and wealthy individuals without 
contributing to the tax base of this country?  That is but one 
example of the unfairness in our tax system and the need for this 
government to look seriously at alternatives to the GST and the 
BST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people under financial stress searching for 
meaningful work, trying to combine two and three part time jobs 
just to make ends meet everywhere in this country, being faced 
ever and ever with a burden that is just beyond their reach and 
beyond human capacity for responding to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge today that in this debate we come to some consensus 
around the need to look at a fair taxation system and with real 
determination to actually end this harmonized sales tax and phase 
out the GST. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting listening to the 
hon. member opposite discussing the motion, but it does not sound 
like she was discussing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if she supports the merits by the Bloc's 
contention.  The Bloc contends that Quebec is owed $2 billion 
from the harmonization of the Quebec sales tax with the GST. 
Members have heard over and over again that Quebec has actually 
benefited by its harmonization to the tune of $700 million extra 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree with the Bloc motion that Quebec is owed 
$2 billion as a result of having harmonized Quebec sales tax with 
the goods and services tax.  That is the motion.  I would like to 
hear from the member on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect to the Liberal member opposite, I believe I have answered 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated from the outset that two wrongs do not make a right. 
We are dealing with an unfair regressive tax measure to begin 
with. The blending of the GST with provincial tax does not make 
it any better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position has always been and will continue to be to reverse 
the Liberal government's decision to harmonize the GST and the 
PST in Atlantic Canada and in the province of Quebec.  We believe 
we must stop any further negotiations for harmonization in other 
parts of Canada.  We would work to immediately to remove GST from 
books, magazines and family essentials like children's clothing. 
We would phase out the GST in the context of comprehensive tax 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of package is workable.  It provides a real 
alternative to the Liberal government.  I would heartily ask for 
their support for this kind of alternative.

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always 
have a little trouble following the NDP's arguments.  I understand 
that they are bleeding hearts and they are all for motherhood and 
apple pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention two facts, however.  The first is that 
we have seen the results of the NDP government in Ontario.  It was 
an expensive lesson to the people of Ontario.  The NDP supposedly 
represented social justice, but we saw what it cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we can see what is happening in Saskatchewan.  I would 
like her to explain to me, because I am sure she has very close 
ties with the premier of Saskatchewan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B> British Columbia, as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> British Columbia, as well.  Does she share 
the views of the premiers of British Columbia and Saskatchewan on 
harmonization?  And, if they are not in touch, they should pick up 
the telephone a little more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening, Mr. Speaker? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member 
does a great disservice to the vast majority of Canadians who 
share our concerns when it comes to the government's very 
regressive tax policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Liberal member that at the time the government was 
promising to abolish the GST after having seen the effects of it 
under the Conservatives, only 10% of Canadians thought it had any 
possibility of benefiting the economy.  Ninety per cent of 
Canadians knew at the time how harmful such a tax would be on 
ordinary working men and women.  Those are the people already 
feeling tremendous unfairness in our tax system, where the burden 
has shifted so much from corporations and individuals to the 
shoulders of low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments I made today dealt specifically with the needs of 
children who may not have mothers or fathers. Of course we 
support them.  We will stand up any day to support the needs of 
survivors and the needs of children without parents.  I hope the 
member opposite would share in standing up for such individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I end by saying this issue is not narrowly defined and it does 
not affect a few people.  It affects the vast majority of 
Canadians who want to see change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat 
through this debate today as did the other members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I am a little exhausted, extremely exhausted, with 
the partisan rhetoric and the comments from the government side 
and the opposition side.  Perhaps if we could have a bit of 
attention we can set the record straight. 
The comments of the Reform Party leave me perplexed.  The member 
for Portage—Lisgar and the member for Calgary Southeast have 
both stated that the Reform Party would get rid of the GST. That 
is shocking.  It is amazing.  This is the tax critic. I want the 
explanation.  I would like to see the numbers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to this little history lesson.  The history 
lesson is very simple.  We were in a situation in this country 
where we were looking at having free trade with the Americans. In 
order to have free trade with the Americans the Parliament of 
Canada, the government of the day, had to face the fact that 
Canadian businesses were faced with an extremely harmful and 
punishing tax called the manufacturers sales tax.  It was 13%. 
Our companies which exported to the U.S. were penalized 13% on 
everything they sent across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we could have growth in this country, the only way 
we could have any possibility of a fair and level playing field 
to bring in free trade was to get rid of the manufacturers 
sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a simple lesson in economics.  If you have this much 
money in one hand and you have this much money in the other hand 
and you are willing to throw that away, you have to replace it. 
You just cannot draw it out of thin air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the GST was brought in to replace the manufacturers 
sales tax.  We could continue to gather revenue.  We could 
continue to pay down the deficit.  Some day we could even think 
about tackling the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in the situation of listening to a bunch of overblown 
rhetoric about getting rid of the GST.  I am wondering if we are 
going to get rid of free trade too.  Is that the way we are 
headed? I question the wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No partisan stuff coming from over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  What I am saying is very partisan and I 
am not a bit ashamed that it is partisan.  Of course it is 
partisan.  I will tell you what else, it makes sense.  You cannot 
go out there and tell Canadians you are going to get rid of the 
GST and not think you are going to replace it with something. You 
are not going to pay down the debt overnight by snapping your 
fingers.  It takes a plan and it takes action.  You have to have 
both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Liberals flip-flop on the GST.  We have seen 
Reform flip-flop on the GST.  They were going to get rid of it. 
They loved it.  They thought it was a good idea.  We had to have 
free trade.  Now they want to get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be practical.  There has not been any thought provoking, 
innovative ideas on how to replace the GST.  It is just plain 
rhetoric.  There has been enough time wasted on rhetoric here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to the NDP, we have listened to all the 
parties, and there is no replacement here.  There is no magic 
here.  There are a lot of hard decisions to be made and that is 
all.  Part of it is that this country has to continue to move 
forward, and moving backward is not moving forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really enjoyed those comments and I would like to be 
educated a little further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Conservatives really believe in cost cutting.  They 
paid for 212 Conservative members for two terms and then they 
only paid for two members.  What kind of a plan do you have to 
follow to do that? That really helped us here in the House.  That 
relieved the debtload quite a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have to do to follow that plan?  I would like the 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, unfortunately there was

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciated listening to the comments from the hon. 
member to the right.  I know he was not here from 1984 to 1993, 
but his former colleagues were given a strong mandate by the 
people of Canada to get the House in order and to take some 
fiscal responsibility with the country.  However they continued 
in the same vein as the previous government they replaced.  In 
fact they went from such large numbers to two, as my hon. 
colleague mentioned, because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned a plan of action. His former 
colleagues were given a plan of action and they did not follow 
through on it and were reduced to two members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just have to ask my hon. colleague how it is that he can talk 
about the policy of our party when in fact they are not willing 
to even look at the information and see what it is.  To hear half 
truths and to say something does not mean that it is going to 
become true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just ask my hon. colleague to take a look at the 
information and make an informed decision because that is what 
Canadians across the country are doing.  They are taking a look 
at the facts and past performances and asking for a plan of 
action and some vision and people are coming to Reform.  That is 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at the numbers in the House, my hon. colleague, in 
your caucus and in this caucus.  Then we will see what will 
happen in the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just wrap up my comments and question by asking the 
regional party to the right what it is that it would propose to 
do to alleviate taxation in this country and to stimulate the 
economy.  What is its plan because it did not do anything in the 
nine years it was here previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is very 
quick, very simple and to the point.  Where is the plan?  We are 
living the plan today.  The success of this country today is 
directly from free trade.  That is why we are cutting our 
deficit.  That is why the government that happens to sit on the 
benches today can bask in the glory.  However, it is not their 
policy, it is Tory policy that is already in place and here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, am I to understand, and I am sure I did not just hear 
this, that we are all benefiting in this country and basking in 
the glory of parties past because of all of the good things they 
have done for us?  I know it is hard for people watching this to 
understand, but I just wanted to get a clarification from this 
party from <I>Jurassic Park</I> over here. Does the hon. member 
truly believe that we are basking in the sunshine of the Tories 
and Liberals past?  Is the sunshine in the order of $600 billion 
worth of debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, repetition becomes 
boring after a while.  Obviously the member did not listen to the 
answer the last time.  The success of the country today is based 
100% on the fact that the Conservatives brought in free trade. We 
had to bring in free trade.  It is the policies that were put in 
place that allowed the deficit to be cut.  That is why the 
economy is on an upswing.  It will continue to do that.  That is 
not a tough equation.  Take a look at it.

the Reform style mantra, that <I>ABC</I> type of thing that they 
like. I have explained it as best I can.  I cannot explain it any 
more. It is quite simple.  Look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that there has been an increase in the business 
climate and the economy of the nation.  We do have unacceptable 
unemployment, absolutely. Something needs to be done about it, a 
lot more than just talking about it. We have to take some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  But you did not do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>   I can repeat it one more time and then 
maybe we can put it to bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade was brought in by one party.  That allowed economic 
growth.  It drove the manufacturing sector of this nation.  It 
allowed this country to benefit from low interest rates, from low 
unemployment, from low inflation that we have today. If it had 
not been for that, we would have been in three or four times 
worse shape than we are in now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a very interesting debate 
going on over there.  It is quite comical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and 
to describe the many ways that Quebec benefits from the actions 
of the Government of Canada and especially from the social 
spending benefits that Quebec gets. 
One of the most obvious benefits is being part of the country 
that the United Nations has recognized as the best place in the 
world to live.  As Canadians and Quebeckers this is a shared 
privilege, one that we can all be proud of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a respected member of the G-7, of the OECD, of NAFTA, 
of APEC and other international organizations.  Membership in 
these important organizations provides Canadians with the 
commercial linkages that are necessary for success in a 
competitive global economy.  This is something that benefits all 
Canadians and especially Canadian companies doing business in 
world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development recently attended a 
meeting of employment and labour ministers of 29 countries of the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  At that 
meeting his colleagues from these other countries referred to 
Canada as the Canadian miracle.  Our ability to meet the 
challenges of economic, political and social change that so many 
others are going through is quite remarkable and has added to 
Canada's international strength and reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level we have been successful in restoring the 
nation's finances.  The deficit this government inherited will be 
eliminated no later than 1998-99.  The Canadian dollar is sound. 
There is a feeling of confidence and optimism in the national 
economy. Quebeckers have been major beneficiaries of these 
positive developments through lower interest rates for mortgages 
and consumer loans, as well as in many other ways in business and 
improved prospects for export sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the dramatic improvement in our financial situation, 
we have regained some flexibility in our social program planning. 
One of the most significant examples of this is the national 
child benefit that was presented in the last federal budget. This 
novel idea is an example of a new style of Canadian federalism 
that works.  All levels of government of every political stripe 
are working together to bring forward a new social program to 
help children and their families.  This may be the most important 
new program of this generation.  There will be many potential 
benefits for the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanics are simple.  The Government of Canada will 
increase the federal child tax credit and thus the income of low 
income families.  This will reduce demands for social assistance 
payments at the provincial and territorial level.  Each province 
or territory can then take its savings in social assistance and 
reinvest them in programs and services to directly help parents 
on social assistance move into employment, and low income working 
families to stay in the labour force.  Thus each province will 
have new money freed up to use for its special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the program as it is now conceived, beginning in July 1998 
Quebec will have the use of an additional $150 million to provide 
programs and services directly to Quebeckers.  This program 
shares the same objectives as the family policy proposed by 
Quebec and it will help Quebec to implement it.  The national 
child benefit is good for Quebec families and children, but the 
Government of Quebec so far has opposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, Quebeckers are able to fully participate in the 
national employment insurance program and are among its major 
beneficiaries.  The legislation passed by this House one year ago 
to set up the new employment insurance system introduced several 
new measures to improve the employability of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a system of targeted wage subsidies was introduced 
to encourage employers to hire EI claimants by offsetting a 
portion of their wages. 
We expect this will help some 8,000 Canadians to gain valuable on 
the job experience this year and many of these will be 
Quebeckers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new EI program also includes a self-employment assistance 
component to support unemployed individuals who want to start 
their own businesses.  An estimated 6,000 new entrants will be 
supported under this part of the program this year, and many of 
them will be Quebeckers.  Some 35,000 are taking training courses 
while receiving EI benefits, and many of these are Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Quebeckers are benefiting very much from the 
new EI program.  Of the $880 million that will be reinvested 
annually in active employment measures across Canada, by the year 
2002 about $252 million, almost one-third, will be going to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned about providing support for areas of the 
country where unemployment is high and where jobs are hard to 
find.  In these areas employment insurance eligibility 
requirements are the lowest and the benefit entitlements are the 
highest.  A number of these special areas are in Quebec. We have 
introduced the transitional jobs plan to work with local partners 
to invest together in creating lasting jobs in high unemployment 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the national level about 400 transitional job fund projects 
have been approved and 188 of them are in Quebec.  There have 
been 22,500 jobs created and 14,500 of them are in Quebec. The 
Government of Canada has invested a total of $158 million in 
these projects to date, $81 million of it is in Quebec. The 
objective of the transitional job fund is to lever other source 
funds to create long lasting employment in high unemployment 
areas. It has proven to be a very useful program for employers 
and workers in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the labour market agreement that was signed by the 
governments of Quebec and Canada earlier this year.  As well as 
demonstrating that federalism can and does work, this agreement 
signalled a transfer of active employment measures funded by the 
employment insurance account from the federal to the provincial 
levels of government.  For the first five years of the agreement, 
the province of Quebec will receive some $500 million a year to 
offer to its residents a tailored employment program and measures 
that will help them integrate into the labour market.  That is a 
historical agreement, a major change in the way things are being 
done in the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years we estimate that the Government of 
Canada will have made available more than $2.7 billion to Quebec 
under the labour market agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5.50 p.m.,

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-211, an act to amend the Criminal Code (arrest of those in 
breach of condition of parole or statutory or temporary release), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I believe this bill is before us today 
because as members of this House we are truly concerned with the 
need to improve the safety and security of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was not my idea.  It is a product of many discussions 
between police officers and politicians across the country.  I 
hope to be able to influence members of the House enough so that 
we get this bill into committee.  I do hope members opposite do 
not take the view that this is already law because it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers in all of our ridings need our help on this 
issue.  I will explain why.  But first we should know that many 
politicians look at new ideas and ask, why?  Good politicians 
should look at new ideas as a challenge and say, why not? That is 
where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first explain what Bill C-211 does.  The bill establishes 
that a police officer may arrest without warrant, detain and 
bring before a justice a person the officer reasonably believes 
is in breach of a condition of a bail or a probation order, a 
condition of a conditional sentence or a condition of statutory 
release, parole or unescorted temporary absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this necessary?  Today if an offender, perhaps a 
pedophile, is in your community on unescorted temporary absence 
from a prison, and is at a children's playground, where he is not 
obviously permitted to be under the conditions of his unescorted 
temporary absence and someone recognizes him in the playground 
where children are and calls a policeman. That policeman must 
attempt to get a warrant for his arrest before arresting him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us understand the rationale of what it takes to get a 
warrant for arrest.  It is difficult and it is time consuming. 
That is to say the least.  It is abundantly clear that such a 
pedophile will not stay in that area very long knowing full well 
that a policeman is on his track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to apprehend a pedophile on a release, on conditions, who 
is at a playground by getting a warrant signed by a judge 
somewhere in a community is just unreasonable to expect.  The 
outcome of such a story unfortunately is all too often the same. 
The police do not apprehend the individual who is breaking the 
condition because they do not have a warrant.  They know they 
cannot get it fast enough and the criminal gets away.  Worse yet, 
in many cases, some unsuspecting person becomes a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our police need our help and understanding, not our fighting. 
Let us get this bill to a committee and have the police speak to 
it.  They will tell us all in the justice committee exactly what 
the problems are.  We will surely hear stories that will shake 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are today in a situation where I have police coming to me 
describing time and time again situations that are happening. Let 
me give some of the conditions imposed that a police officer may 
operationally find himself confronting when the officer 
encounters an offender in our community during the course of his 
duties. 
In the course of a policeman's duties, he may respond to calls of 
service, traffic enforcement, field interviews, all those sorts 
of things that a policeman does in his everyday business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditions given to a person on UTA, unescorted temporary 
absence or on parole, are like this:  remain at all times within 
the territorial boundaries fixed by the parole supervisor.  There 
are times when policemen find somebody outside those boundaries. 
Obey the law and keep the peace:  they often find a person on UTA 
in a fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person on UTA must at all times carry the release 
certificate and the identity card provided by the releasing 
authority and produce them on request for identification to peace 
officers.  In many cases, police may ask for that identification 
card.  If a person does not have it on them, what do the police 
do?  They have to get a warrant.  They have to say “Excuse me, 
would you wait here for six hours?  I will be back”.  It just 
does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person on UTA cannot own, possess or have control of any 
weapon as defined in section 2 of the Criminal Code, except as 
authorized by a parole supervisor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person on UTA has to abstain from the use of alcohol.  This 
happens in my community many times where a person out on a 
temporary absence or out from one of the many prisons we have in 
my area—at least seven federal and something like 10 
provincial—is found in a bar.  They know they are not supposed 
to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not rational for a policeman to say “Just hang on there. 
Don't drink. Stay there.  I'll be back in a little while”.  The 
reason the condition is put on that person in the first place is 
because that person got into trouble and ended up in a prison 
because they were drinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when the policeman goes?  Typically, the individual 
gets into trouble and it is an unsuspecting individual who is on 
the wrong end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another condition for a person on UTA is submitting to a 
breathalyzer on demand of a peace officer where reasonable 
grounds exist to believe the offender is breaching a condition of 
abstinence from alcohol or abstaining from the use of drugs other 
than prescribed medication and over the counter drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-communication with specified individuals. More than once an 
individual out on UTA is right back with the bad crowd again. 
The police officer comes across the bad crowd in his normal 
course of business, knows the individual is there but cannot do 
anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another condition is not to own or operate a motor vehicle. 
These conditions go on and on but I wanted to give the House an 
idea of all of the restraints or conditions that are on people 
who come out of prison where a police officer is basically 
hamstrung because he needs a warrant to arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, an offender is released on parole with a condition 
to abstain from alcohol.  Some of these examples actually have 
been given to me by police operating in this country.  During 
contact with the police, the offender is found to be intoxicated, 
a direct violation of his parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officer has no authority to arrest the offender as a 
result of the condition of breach.  Instead, the offender's 
parole supervisor must be notified.  The parole may be suspended 
and then the police officer may take action if the offender is 
subsequently located again and arrested on the authority of a 
warrant issued pursuant to sections 118, 135 or 136 of the Canada 
Corrections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see why policemen basically look at the situation 
and say “I just can't get a warrant” and this is going to 
happen.  It is in the process of happening so no action can be 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the offender has posed a risk to the community, 
say most police.  To further frustrate the situation, the 
offender may have to submit to a breathalyzer on demand. If the 
offender is intoxicated and is demanded to submit to a 
breathalyzer but refuses, the police officer has no immediate 
authority to take the offender into custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peace officers are given the responsibility to protect life and 
property, prevent crime, apprehend criminals and enforce the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A peace officer may arrest a person and assist in the 
prosecution of that person.  Where the offence is disposed of by 
conviction, there are several avenues open to the court in 
dealing with the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the person is placed on probation various conditions may be 
imposed on the person.  Section 495 of the conditional release 
act permits the arrest of the person, without warrant, when a 
peace officer finds the person breaching any of the conditions of 
probation.  However, an offender who is convicted and sentenced 
to a term of incarceration in a penitentiary, which is generally 
reserved for those more serious offences and repeat offences, may 
subsequently be released into the community with conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, many of these conditions of release are similar to 
the conditions of probation.  However, a peace officer has no 
authority to apprehend the offender whom the peace officer finds 
in violation of the condition.  They can be actually very similar 
to the conditions of probation, yet they can arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a young policeman in my riding, Mike Novakowski, who 
will be receiving a meritorious award for working so hard on this 
particular bill.  He gives me this example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gives this example. If a person steals a chocolate bar from a 
grocery store and is charged and convicted of theft, it is not 
uncommon that when the person is sentenced they are placed on 
probation.  When the person violates a condition of their 
probation and is caught by the police, police may arrest the 
person without a warrant and detain that person according to the 
law.  That person may be charged and convicted of an additional 
crime, which is breach of probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, says Mike, if a person is charged and convicted of 
aggravated sexual assault and is sentenced to a penitentiary, he 
or she may be released prior to expiration of the sentence on 
parole, on statutory release or unescorted temporary absence with 
conditions.  If that person violates a condition of that release 
and is caught by the police, the police may not arrest that 
person without a warrant. Canada corrections must make an after 
the fact judgement, issue a warrant and then that warrant may 
subsequently be executed by police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what I might hear from the other side, that this can be 
taken care of through other routes.  That is what I am trying to 
explain.  The other routes are going to Canada corrections, 
trying to get action taken for the particular situation the 
police are in and perhaps they might get a warrant or an after 
the fact judgement.  The problem is you could be dealing with, in 
many cases are dealing with in my community, pedophiles, sexual 
offenders.  Policemen cannot wait and even expect the convict, 
the offender, to stay there while they fetch a warrant.  It is 
unreasonable to even ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to protect our citizens even more by 
helping our police.  This is really, and should be, a 
non-partisan issue in this House, an issue that can be resolved 
with the help of my colleagues.  There are no financial 
implications to this bill and no inappropriate power given to our 
police officers; just more protection for you, me and our 
families as a Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in this House that private members bills are an 
interesting subject and the subject of much debate. There is much 
controversy with private members bills because many of us believe 
they do not go anywhere unless the cabinet agrees.  Many private 
members bills are not votable.  Those that are seem to end up 
dying after second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they get to committee we seldom see them get out of committee 
and return to the House for report stage and third reading.  I 
recall very few bills which have been successful.  These bills 
would help ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motivation behind this bill did not come from a politician, 
it came from the police.  They are asking for our assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is wake up to the fact that the people out 
there in the communities, the grassroots people, are going to 
their members of Parliament and asking for private members bills. 
They want them to be debated, voted on and carefully assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen bills enter this House which most people in Canada 
do not relate to in any way.  Quite frankly, they could not care 
less.  Many of the bills I see coming from my colleagues in the 
House are grassroots bills.  They are effective.  They do things. 
They protect.  They change our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 29, I introduced a private member's bill in the House 
on victims rights.  I guess I was a little naive at that time.  I 
thought that when we all accepted it in the House it would go 
somewhere.  Several million Canadians were hoping that one day 
they would see a national victims bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a great debate in the House that day.  Everybody agreed 
with it.  It got stuck somewhere in committee.  Parliament was 
dissolved for an election and the bill died on the order paper. 
No one on the government side resurrected it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an interesting discussion in the House the other day when 
we debated a private member's bill on drunk driving.  It was a 
votable motion put forward by the Reform Party.  My concern at 
the time was what was going to happen next.  Everybody in the 
House agreed with it.  Where will it go?  What assurances do we 
have when these bills go to committee that they will be put into 
effect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constable Novakowski, an Abbotsford policeman, put a lot of work 
into this bill.  He did a lot of research.  He and his colleagues 
believe in the House.  They believe in what we are doing.  They 
believe we can effect change for them and for their families and 
our families.  We cannot disappoint these people time and time 
again.  If truly good private members bills are introduced, 
regardless of who introduces them, we cannot continue to 
disappoint these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a practical common issue.  I hope my colleagues on the 
other side do not once again say that it is already in place, 
that there are laws which affect it and that we can arrest these 
people.  I can assure them that if they let this get to committee 
they will have police from every force in the country come to the 
committees to tell them that it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have change.  There is nothing more frustrating than a 
policeman coming on the scene, knowing that an offender is ready 
to snap, ready to break, ready to reoffend, and there is 
virtually nothing they can do until that person perpetrates yet 
another crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says nothing at all about our willingness.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-211, a 
private member's bill, which seeks to amend the Criminal Code provisions 
relating to arrests without warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate this opportunity to discuss an important aspect of 
criminal law which is not always well understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as introduced by the hon. member, would have two 
consequences. 
First, it would amend the Criminal Code by making a breach of a 
condition of parole or statutory or temporary release an indictable 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the police would have the power to arrest, without a 
warrant, an offender concerning whom it would have reasonable grounds to 
believe that he made or is about to make a breach of a condition of his 
parole or statutory or temporary release. This power is already provided 
in the Criminal Code for breach of probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also amend the Criminal Code by giving a parole 
board the power, following the arrest of an offender, to release him or 
to ask a judge to keep him in custody until it is able to issue a 
warrant of apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government has protection of the public at heart, 
protection from the potential risks of paroled offenders, and it 
has adopted several legislative measures or practices in this 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dispel certain inaccuracies and false ideas on 
which the hon. member's bill is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the breach of conditions of parole, statutory or 
temporary release, as well as the prevention of such breaches,are 
concerned, I would like to point out that the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act already gives correctional authorities all 
of the powers necessary to suspend an offender's parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No, it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> Read the law. 
This makes it possible for the police to arrest the offender and to 
place him in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for an offender who has received permission for an 
unescorted temporary release, an order for suspension may be issued 
if the reasons for which the permission was issued have changed or 
no longer exist, or if there is fresh information which would have 
altered the initial decision if available at the time it was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for offenders on parole or statutory release, Correctional 
Services Canada and the National Parole Board may, at any time, 
issue a suspension warrant if they deem this necessary and 
reasonable for the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a mandate would permit the reincarceration of a 
delinquent until his case could be examined by the National Parole 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might wonder why the police do not have the same 
power of direct apprehension with respect to delinquents under 
federal responsibility who are on parole as they do for 
probationers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify a few points on this matter, by 
explaining the significant differences between probation under 
provincial jurisdiction and parole under federal jurisdiction, 
whether we are talking of conditional release, statutory release or 
unescorted temporary absence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probation is a court disposition which is not granted by the 
parole board.  It is a breach of probation and is a criminal 
offence because it constitutes a violation of a court order.  And 
when a breach of probation occurs, police have the same authority 
to arrest the person without a warrant, as they would any other 
person who is committing a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parole, statutory release and temporary absence, on the other 
hand, are not court orders. They are forms of conditional release 
granted either by the National Parole Board or the correctional 
service of Canada. All three types of releases are designed to 
facilitate the reintegration of offenders into the community as 
law-abiding citizens.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditions of parole, statutory release and temporary absence 
constitute restrictions placed on the offender that assist the 
parole supervisor in managing the offender's risk while on 
conditional release.  Because breaches of these conditions do not 
constitute criminal activity, board members and Correctional 
Service Canada staff are in the best position to determine when 
it is necessary to suspend the conditional release in order to 
manage the offender's risk and protect the community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person on parole, for example, may have advised his 
supervisor that, for good reason, he will be 15 minutes later than 
the time set for his return to the halfway house.  In such a case, 
the supervisor can, in full knowledge of the facts, decide not to 
suspend parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without such information, however, a police officer could 
arrest the delinquent for failing to meet the condition, even 
though he may be no immediate threat to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would conflict with the parole plans approved by the 
National Parole Board and would weaken the board's authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it could be argued that the member's bill is aimed at 
more serious offences, I would like to stress that, when police 
officers surprise an offender on conditional release in the act of 
committing a criminal offence, or when they have reasonable grounds 
to believe that a particular offender has committed or is on the 
point of committing a criminal offence, they already have all the 
power necessary to arrest him again without a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the issue raised by the member's bill is not whether 
the powers of the police should be broadened in order to allow them 
to make arrests without warrants, but rather whether the powers 
they now have, and the correctional practices in effect, are 
sufficient to allow the police to take rapid action in situations 
where offenders on conditional release present a risk to the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority is the protection of the public, as I have 
already mentioned, and our government has taken many measures in 
this regard.  There have also been a number of initiatives in 
recent years to improve the transmission of information between the 
Correctional Service of Canada and the police, in order to ensure 
better management of offenders on conditional release under federal 
responsibility. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One key information sharing improvement is the ability to 
enhance information of the Canadian Police Information Computer 
Network, commonly known as CPIC.  Through a link between CPIC and 
the Correctional Service Canada offender management system, 
police forces have direct access to information on conditionally 
released offenders including their conditions of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enable police to respond promptly whenever they suspect a 
federal offender has breached a condition of parole or unescorted 
temporary absence, Correctional Service Canada has a national 
network of duty officers who are available 24 hours a day seven 
days a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This network is in place in each region of the Correctional 
Service Canada and all police departments have been notified of 
the duty officer's phone number.  Upon being advised by a police 
officer of a breach or potential breach of parole, the duty 
officer can issue a suspension of warrant right on the spot, 
which gives the police the authority to arrest the offender and 
promptly bring him or her into custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to ensure the police can respond as fast as possible, the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act also authorizes the 
facsimile transmission of warrants and gives police officers the 
authority to arrest the offender, without warrant, on the 
knowledge that one has been issued. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. members will note, the police already have the 
powers and the means they need to intervene quickly when they see 
that a federal delinquent has failed to meet the conditions of his 
release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's bill assumes that the police are limited in the 
measures they can take to protect the public or that they are 
subject to unreasonable time frames, but the fact is that this has 
never really been proved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that, in the absence of such proof, 
provisions that would give the police broader powers to arrest 
without warrant people on parole who have not committed a criminal 
offence will most likely not stand up to a challenge based on the 
charter of rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, when there is talk of parole, probation orders and so on, 
I believe that there is misunderstanding among the public and I 
believe that the Reform Party also has a poor understanding, or 
perhaps it suits them not to understand, because it is such a juicy 
topic.  They can drag out specific cases, and really talk 
altogether off topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we have before us is a type of bill that does not 
reflect reality.  I am not saying there are no problems in the 
parole system or in application of the Criminal Code.  On the 
contrary, I believe there are shortcomings. I believe there is room 
for improvement in the Criminal Code and in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. 
I do not believe, however, that Bill C-211 is what is going to 
solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here?  Whether it is the Criminal Code and 
its provisions relating to probation orders, or the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, the criterion is protecting society.  At 
this time, do the courts, the law enforcement bodies in Quebec and 
Canada have the proper tools to do their job properly?  My answer 
must be yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the police officers, the correctional system, the courts, 
making the proper use of those tools, applying them in the way they 
were meant to be used?  Maybe, maybe not.  That depends on the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that, with sections 494, 495, 496 and 497 
of the Criminal Code, a broad range of cases are covered, as the 
Reform Party said just now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot sit by while they distort the facts.  I am a member 
of an opposition party, but an opposition party that is fair.  I 
try to do my job as honestly as possible, to be as realistic as 
possible, and I cannot, even though I am in the opposition, sit 
still and listen to nonsense spouted in the House.  I will give you 
four examples that I heard during the Reform Party's discourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first, and this is a favourite topic of the Reformers, was 
what they had to say about pedophiles.  They say that a pedophile 
on conditional release who is near a playground will jump on the 
first victim he sees.  I know it does not suit you to hear the 
facts.  I know there is an immense gulf separating us, but I would 
ask you as politely as possible to at least listen to what Quebec 
has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, with the provisions of the Criminal 
Code— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, would you please ask 
that bunch of Reform members to keep quiet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Maybe you don't have institutions like we 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Would hon. members 
please give everyone a chance to hear the speeches. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I was saying that there 
are four items of misinformation and I will name them right off. 
Then I will give them the right information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case of the pedophile.  The case of the person who is on 
probation and ordered to stay out of bars, and ends up drinking in 
a bar. The individual who is impaired and is arrested by a police 
officer, who can do nothing because the person is on parole.  That 
is another such case.  The thief who cannot be arrested even if 
caught in the act.  These are all inaccuracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the pedophile is concerned, if there are conditions 
attached to his parole and he is found by a playground, it is false 
to say that the police can do nothing.  The police officer will use 
what I have here, the Criminal Code.  Maybe I should give them a 
copy, as they seem not to have one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It indicates very clearly—under section 497—that a 
police officer, in fact, any person may arrest another person if he 
has reasonable grounds to believe that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provision is made in the Criminal Code for pedophiles and for 
a person in a bar too.  On top of that, the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act contains a mechanism respecting individuals 
released under certain conditions or on statutory release, who fail 
to meet the conditions.  There are revocation mechanisms, the 
police can go and get them and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst I heard concerns being under the influence.  When an 
individual is on parole or statutory release and drives under the 
influence of alcohol, the arresting police cannot take him to the 
police station even if he refuses to take the breathalyser test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Reform Party recount anything more inexact or grosser 
this evening?  I do not think so.  Under the Criminal Code, under 
all the provisions pertaining to driving under the influence, 
anyone refusing to take a breathalyser test is committing an 
offence and can be taken to the station and charged with refusing 
to obey police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it usual to twist the facts in such a way for political 
purposes?  I think it is for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final example is theft, and breaking and entering.  It is 
very true that the police may arrest an individual, as may anyone 
under section 494, whether or not he is a police officer, who 
notices an individual in the act of committing an offence arrest 
that individual, and particulary if he is a police officer.  I 
think that there is a misunderstanding, or that they are 
deliberating distorting the meaning of these sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I do not want to repeat what the 
parliamentary secretary to the Solicitor General said regarding the 
mechanism envisaged.  It can perhaps be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, there is undoubtedly room for 
improvement, but this is not the kind of improvement needed.  The 
more I listen to the Reform Party members, the more I can see where 
they are headed.  In the end, what they want is a justice system 
that is a bit like a robot, that is programmed to apply the right 
sections. 
The judges would be replaced by a computer. All the evidence would be 
fed into the computer and out would come the answer, an inhuman answer 
that does not take into account every relevant fact and serves but one 
specific goal: scoring political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be a sovereignist, a nationalist, a Quebec nationalist, still 
I can recognize that some things work in this system. I think that, all 
in all, as flawed and imperfect as it may be, these things we should 
work at improving over time, our justice system is an excellent system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that amendments like the one proposed in Bill C-211 
before us this evening will do much to improve on the current system. On 
the contrary, I think it would confuse the courts, complicate things to 
achieve what the Criminal Code and the relevant legislation already 
provide for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against private 
member's Bill C-211.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I remind members that this is private members' hour.  I 
regret to say that from time to time we seem to get into the sort 
of debate which assumes that a bill put forward by a private 
member of the Reform Party is somehow a Reform Party bill and it 
is the Reform Party that is being supported or criticized.  I 
would hope that private members' hour would not become 
politicized in that negative sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well be that many members of the Reform Party support the 
bill that has been put forward by the hon. member and it may well 
be that members from other parties will want to oppose that bill. 
But I caution against falling by default into a way of debating 
this bill that replicates the way we debate government 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I am here not to speak on behalf of the NDP 
but to share some of my own thoughts about this.  I begin by 
saying that actually I am quite open minded about this.  I do not 
claim to understand the law in this regard.  I have heard 
conflicting claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who say that the law as it stands provides 
adequate tools for meeting the problem that the hon. member has 
identified and he is bringing forward a bill in order to address 
it.  I have heard the hon. member say otherwise.  I have heard 
him accused of not paying attention to reality in the things that 
he has had to say.  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand enough about how parole is administered and 
dealt with in order to say with authority whether I think the 
hon. member is right or is wrong, or whether he is operating 
simply out of a political agenda, but I do not think so.  I sense 
from the hon. member and from others that there is a lot of 
concern, not just on the part of the hon. member but on the part 
of many Canadians.  They are mystified on occasion by how it is 
that people who are on parole get to be in some of the places 
that they are and get to do some of the things that they do while 
they are on parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police, the courts and the system as it currently stands 
are able to deal with this or have the powers to deal with this, 
it still remains an open question as to why it appears to so many 
Canadians that they do not, and that occasions arise in what 
seems to be a persistent way.  I say seems because I do not have 
the research at hand, but it certainly seems this way to many 
Canadians and they feel the justice system is somehow letting 
them down in terms of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My attitude toward this bill at this point is that I have not 
made up my mind yet. That is why we give votable items three 
hours of debate.  It is so that we do not all come in here in the 
first hour of debate with our minds made up.  Some people's minds 
are made up. That is fair enough.  For my part, I intend to 
review what has been said today, to look at what is said in the 
second hour and indeed in the third hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I just want to indicate that if what the hon. 
member who has put this bill forward is saying is true, I am 
concerned.  I would be concerned when the police identify someone 
who is on parole in a situation which is in breach of those 
parole conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police are saying that they cannot really do anything 
about it, that by the time they do whatever it is the law 
requires of them the person has noticed that the police have 
noticed them and has already been able to move on, then this is 
something that should be of concern.  It should be of concern to 
people who are concerned about public safety, particularly if the 
circumstances of the breach of parole are such that it would 
cause us to worry about the safety of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the hon. member's concern about that situation but I am 
open to be persuaded as to whether or not the law as it currently 
stands has the ability to deal with this.  But even that is not 
good enough in the sense that I would like to know that if it 
does have the ability to deal with it, why is there such a 
widespread perception that it does not use those tools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to say that there is the capacity to do a 
certain thing.  We need to know that the system is designed in 
such a way as to create the will to use that capacity and to use 
the tools that are available to the police and to the courts now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that there is some flaw in the design of the system as 
it now exists which discourages police from using the powers that 
are now at their disposal.  The member's bill might be an answer 
to that or it might not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There might be some other way of addressing this, which would 
argue it seems to me for why it might be a good idea to send such 
a bill to committee.  The committee could report either that it 
is a good idea or that the problem the member has identified and 
which he is trying to address with this bill is a real problem 
but the bill itself for a variety of reasons does not do the 
trick or does not stand the test of scrutiny. There may be other 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things are open to us, and I look forward to listening 
to the debate in this hour and as it progresses.  I hope other 
hon. members will do the same because we are all going to be 
called to vote on this at the end of the day, not at the end of 
this day but metaphorically speaking whenever the three hours is 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope hon. members who speak next will have some light to shed 
on this.  I am certainly hoping that I will be able to learn 
something on both sides of this debate from members who will 
speak after me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this bill which has 
been introduced by the Reform member for Langley—Abbotsford and 
my counterpart as House leader in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by previous speakers, Bill C-211 would amend the 
Criminal Code as it applies to the arresting and detaining of 
individuals who breach their conditions of parole or statutory or 
temporary release. In principle I want to state at the outset 
that I agree with the bill.  In my view it provides our law 
enforcement officers an additional tool in their fight against 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving the police increased power always is a contentious issue. 
I believe in this instance it talks of increased discretion to be 
exercised on the part of the police in their ability to fight 
crime and to do their job as peace officers.  I fully endorse 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that are talked of here in section 495(1)(a) of the 
Criminal Code which would allow peace officers to arrest 
individuals who breach their conditions of parole or release, in 
particular, deserve support by this Chamber and its hon. members. 
I say so with some experience myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the comments of the hon. member 
from the Reform Party who had from the sounds of it consulted 
extensively with a peace officer in his riding.  I have spoken 
personally to a number of police officers as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to Constable Kevin Scott, Constable Dwayne 
Rutledge and other police officers from my riding of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I have sensed the frustration 
that many of our police officers sense when dealing with 
criminals who have gone through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals have been convicted after due process.  They have gone 
through appeal processes and are serving time as their debt to 
society and upon being convicted and placed in an institution, 
having appeared potentially before a parole board, have been 
granted early release often with good reason. The principle to 
recall here is the fact that those individuals are paying a debt 
to society. If released early, essentially they are being given a 
break, a second chance, and while in society and taking advantage 
of the break that has been afforded them, they run afoul of 
conditions which for good reason have been placed upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened again with great interest to the comments with 
respect in particular to pedophiles or individuals who have been 
told to abstain from alcohol.  I would suggest that it is 
extremely important for police officers, who observe individuals 
who have these conditions placed upon them, to have the ability 
to act and to act quickly and decisively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened as well again with great interest to the comments of 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General. 
I agree that in its present form the Criminal Code does have 
provisions for police officers to act in a decisive way to get 
authorization to place an individual under arrest.  The 
difficulty is in the timing.  Officers do not always have the 
time to get the necessary authorization. They do not always have 
the time to get to a justice of the peace who will give them the 
go ahead, or to contact the parole officer involved, particularly 
in rural parts of the country.

simply be out in the barn.  Unfortunately, justices of the peace 
are not always on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very timely debate.  Another bill is presently before 
the House which is the so-called Feeney bill, Bill C-16. It 
touches on much of the same subject matter that is being 
discussed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss another component of the amendment to section 
497 of the Criminal Code.  It would give the National Parole 
Board the opportunity to apply to keep a person, who is in breach 
of his conditions, in custody until the board can issue a warrant 
of apprehension.  This is not an arbitrary detention. We are 
discussing the rights of an individual who has had the benefit of 
due process and has been convicted of a criminal offence.  There 
is an important distinction to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not favour voting rights for criminals, nor do I favour, in 
this particular instance, any sort of special treatment or 
special allotment or second chance.  The individual is paying his 
debt to society.  He has been afforded early release and has now 
run afoul of those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I generally support the change, with some reservations.  Any 
form of arbitrary detention has to be carefully scrutinized.  The 
key word is arbitrary.  The provisions put forward by the hon. 
member of the Reform Party, I would suggest, are not arbitrary in 
any way, shape or form.  The direction provided in this bill for 
detention may be vague and may eventually undergo the scrutiny of 
the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this is true of any amendment made to the 
Criminal Code.  That is part of the process of which we partake. 
It is part of the responsibility which is incumbent upon us in 
this Chamber. Defence lawyers, I am sure, will be ready to pounce 
on any detention of their clients which would later be proved 
unjustified.  This is merely a caution that I raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could clarify the language in the bill.  I am sure 
the hon. member of the Reform Party would embrace that, as long 
as it did not change significantly the principle which he is 
trying to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill is positive.  I am pleased to say that 
we in the Conservative Party support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also embrace another theme touched on by the hon. 
member, and it is that we should strive toward making the law not 
only more efficient but simpler.  It should be more 
understandable, not only for police officers who have legal 
training, but for the public at large.  I believe that the public 
at large is becoming alienated and, to some degree, very 
disgusted with our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall there are changes that can be made to the Criminal Code. 
I believe this is the forum and the place for elected officials 
to partake of that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason I support this bill is that it would open a 
window of opportunity for the National Parole Board to collect 
additional information on offenders when possible.  It would be a 
responsible thing for them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offenders who break their terms of parole or conditions of 
release are once again breaking society's trust in their ability 
to respect the law.  The National Parole Board consents to 
returning offenders to the mainstream of society on certain 
conditions.  If those conditions are breached, then the board, in 
turn, must act responsibly and re-evaluate the risk to society 
posed by the offender.  A convicted person forfeits the rights 
which are afforded to all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the National Parole Board additional authority to 
exercise that responsibility, and there is a larger question at 
play here.  The question concerns the effectiveness of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, especially as it relates 
to the National Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Parole Board is operating as effectively as 
possible, but is it doing so to its full ability and is it doing 
so to the extent where it completely protects Canadians?  I 
suggest there are examples, but I am not going to recite them at 
this time, that suggest that the National Parole Board has to 
re-examine its own effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act is 
established by an internal board of investigation on incidents. 
These incidents should be brought forward and examined at length 
to see if the National Parole Board is living up to the standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention one further positive element of this bill that 
requires parliamentary study, the ability to exercise the arrests 
that these police officers are charged with.  I think we have to 
look most specifically at whether this bill will improve the 
present law.  Will it allow police officers to more effectively 
carry out the very onerous task that is imposed on them to 
protect society?  If this will further the cause of justice, then 
it is something we have to work together in a non-partisan way to 
see carried through to fruition.

Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to address this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill as drafted would do two things.  First, 
it would amend the Criminal Code to make a breach of a condition 
of parole, statutory release or temporary absence a criminal 
offence.  As a consequence police would have the authority to 
arrest without warrant an offender who on reasonable grounds is 
believed to have breached or is about to breach a condition of 
parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This authority already exists in the Criminal Code for breach of 
probation, as the parliamentary secretary did indicate earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would amend the Criminal Code to authorize a 
parole board, following an offender's arrest, to either release 
the offender or apply to a justice to detain the offender in 
custody until the board could issue a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public protection from conditionally released offenders is a 
matter of serious concern to this government and an area where we 
have made several legislative and practical improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify some inaccuracies and misconceptions on 
which the hon. member's bill is founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to violations and preventions of breaches of 
parole, statutory release and unescorted temporary absence 
conditions, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act already 
provides ample authority for an offender's conditional release to 
be suspended by correctional officials.  This enables police to 
arrest the offender and bring him or her into custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to an offender on an unescorted temporary absence, a 
suspension warrant can be issued where the grounds for granting 
the absence have changed or no longer exist or when new 
information becomes available that would have altered the 
original decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to an offender on parole or statutory release, a 
suspension warrant can be issued at any time by the correctional 
service of Canada and the National Parole Board when it is 
believed to be necessary and reasonable in order to protect 
society.  Execution of this warrant provides sufficient authority 
to return the offender to custody until the case can be reviewed 
by the National Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may reasonably question why police do not have the same 
direct authority to arrest conditionally released federal 
offenders as they do for probationers.  I would like to briefly 
address this question by explaining the key differences between 
provincial probation and federal conditional release, be it 
parole, statutory release or an unescorted temporary absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probation is a court disposition which is not granted by a 
parole board.  A breach of probation is a criminal offence 
because it constitutes a violation of a court order, as was 
pointed out earlier.

to arrest a person without a warrant as they would any other 
person who has committed a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parole, statutory release and temporary absences, on the other 
hand, are not court orders, as was pointed out earlier.  They are 
forms of conditional release granted either by the National 
Parole Board or the correctional service of Canada.  All three 
types of releases are designed to facilitate the reintegration of 
offenders into the community as law-abiding citizens.  We know 
very well the position of the Reform Party on that.

constitute restrictions placed on the offender that assist the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on October 29, I raised the question where do we sit as 
government with respect to a bill passed in the last Parliament 
known as the MMT bill, Bill C-29 or Bill C-94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and people watching should know that this legislation 
came forward in the last Parliament for various stated reasons. 
The first time it came in, the government said it wanted to have 
a uniform blend of gasoline.  To do that it had to remove MMT 
from Canadian gasoline because it did not exist in the United 
States.  But the government knew or ought to have known that the 
American Environmental Protection Agency was about to license it 
and indeed it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of pulling the bill at the time, the government 
proceeded to change its rationale.  Instead of saying it was for 
a uniform blend of gasoline, it said it wanted to examine this as 
a public safety matter.  But this was not case.  It was not a 
health matter because Health Canada at that time was issuing 
statements saying there were no known health risks with MMT. It 
could not find any risks and would give a published statement to 
that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government on one hand was saying that public safety was the 
reason, and that is a very laudable and noble objective.  But if 
I were to follow the rationale of the environment department, 
then I am sure there are a lot of other products we could outlaw, 
such as bacon or donuts, because they too are allegedly bad for 
your health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end the bill passed the Commons.  It forbids the 
importation of MMT.  It is interesting to note that the 
environment department proposed a bill that is a trade bill.  It 
is a bill that bans the importation of a product.  The 
manufacturer of that product, Ethyl Corporation, now has the 
Government of Canada before a NAFTA trade tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the outcome likely to be? There are two possible 
outcomes.  How is it going to affect Canadians?  The answers are 
clear.  If we loose this challenge under the NAFTA, we are going 
to pay $201 million U.S. or we are going to have to revoke the 
law.  Second, if we win the NAFTA trade challenge, Canadians are 
going to pay more for gasoline at the pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members here, in particular the parliamentary secretary, 
and those watching, who is going to pay?  Canadians can pay at 
the gas pumps or Canadians can pay through their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the next time parliamentarians want to talk 
about the price of gasoline they tell Canadians that, with 
respect to the increase in the price of gasoline, they 
contributed to the problem.  I think this is the least that those 
who supported this bill can do for Canadians.
