<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STONY RESERVE—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the question of 
privilege raised by the hon. member for Wild Rose on September 
30, 1997, concerning information allegedly denied to him by an 
official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to thank the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, 
the leader of the official opposition in the House of 
Commons, as well as the hon. member for Fraser Valley for their 
contribution to this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his submission, the hon. member for Wild Rose claimed that an 
official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs had 
deliberately misled him and subsequently denied him information. 
This, he argued, constituted a contempt of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member, on September 16 he was invited to 
a meeting with the departmental official to receive a progress 
report on the Stony reserve, a reserve located in his riding. 
Citizens of the Stony reserve apparently accompanied him.  At 
some point during the meeting he was made to leave by the 
official because it seemed that he was not entitled to certain 
information that was about to be disclosed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he raised the question of privilege in the House, the hon. 
member stated that he had requested this meeting to obtain 
information which he contended was directly related to the 
preparation of a question which he wanted to ask the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  He added that he had 
given notice to the minister of his intention to ask such a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 2 the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development made a statement to provide additional information on 
this question of privilege.  This was followed by further 
comments from the hon. member for Wild Rose, the leader of the 
official opposition, the hon. member for Fraser Valley and the 
hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford as well as the hon. member 
for Wentworth—Burlington. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair always takes any matter concerning the privileges of 
members, particularly any matter that may constitute a contempt of 
Parliament, very seriously. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Fraser noted in a ruling given on October 10, 1989 
found at page 4457 of the <I>Debates</I>: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker does not rule on whether a breach of privilege or a 
contempt has in fact been committed.  The Speaker only determines 
whether an application based on a claim of contempt or breach of 
privilege is, on first impression, of sufficient importance to 
set aside the regular business of the House and go forward for a 
decision by the House. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding, the Chair feels that it might be helpful to 
explain to members, and especially to new members of this House, the 
difference between a contempt of the House and a breach of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contempts are offences against the authority or dignity of 
Parliament.  These offences cannot be enumerated or categorized. 
As stated in Erskine May, 21st edition, at page 115: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, any act or omission which obstructs or 
impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its 
functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of 
such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, 
directly or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as 
a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privilege, on the other hand, can be divided into two finite 
categories: the rights extended to members individually, and 
those extended to the House as a collectivity.  The rights and 
immunities that are awarded to members individually are generally 
categorized under five headings.  They are freedom of speech, 
freedom from arrest and civil actions, exemption from jury duty, 
exemption from attendance as a witness and freedom from 
molestation and intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the rights and powers of the House as a collectivity they 
may be classified as follows:  the regulation of its own internal 
affairs, the authority to maintain the attendance and service of 
its members, the power to expel members guilty of disgraceful 
conduct, the right to institute inquiries and to call witnesses 
and demand papers, the right to administer oaths to witnesses, 
and the authority to deal with breaches of privilege or contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When claiming that a certain action constitutes a breach of 
privilege, members must specify which of these privileges is 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose argued that the actions taken by 
the official from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs 
constitute a contempt of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technically, obstructing members in the discharge of their 
responsibilities to the House or in their participation in its 
proceedings is considered to be a contempt of the House. As 
Joseph Maingot writes in his book <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> at page 73: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the member must be exercising his functions as a member in a 
committee or in the House in the transaction of parliamentary 
business.  Whatever he says or does in those circumstances is 
said or done during a “proceeding in Parliament”; in other 
words, while the member is functioning as a member, not in his 
constituency, but while actually participating in parliamentary 
business and saying or doing something necessarily incidental to 
parliamentary business. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in order for a member to claim that his privileges have 
been breached or that a contempt has occurred, he or she must 
have been functioning as a member at the time of the alleged 
offence, that is, actually participating in a proceeding of 
Parliament. The activities of members in their constituencies do 
not appear to fall within the definition of a “proceeding in 
Parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 21st edition of Erskine May it is stated at page 125: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correspondence with constituents or official bodies, for 
example, and the provision of information sought by Members on 
matters of public concern will very often, depending on the 
circumstances of the case, fall outside the scope of `proceedings 
in Parliament' against which a claim of breach of privilege will 
be measured. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In instances where members have claimed that they have been 
obstructed or harassed, not directly in their roles as elected 
representatives but while being involved in matters of a 
political or constituency related nature, Speakers have 
consistently ruled that this does not constitute a breach of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 29, 1971 Speaker Lamoureux, in a ruling on a question 
of privilege concerning rights of members to visit penitentiaries 
at page 5338 of the <I>Debates</I> stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary privilege does not go much beyond the right of free 
speech in the House of Commons and the right of a Member to 
discharge his duties in the House as a Member of the House of 
Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein I refer members to page 3580 of the 
<I>Debates</I> of February 26, 1975, where Speaker Jerome clearly 
stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the classic definition of a question of privilege does not fit 
circumstances in which a Member in his duties outside this House 
finds that his scope is being restricted or attempts are being 
made to restrict his scope of intervention and effective work on 
behalf of not only his own constituents but his point of view as 
a Member of the federal parliament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of a member's constituency duties, Speaker Sauvé 
pointed out in a decision delivered on July 15, 1980, at pages 
2914 and 1915 of the <I>Debates</I>: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—whatever duty a Member has to his constituents, before a valid 
question of privilege arises in respect to any alleged 
interference, such interference must relate to the Member's 
parliamentary duties. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful consideration of the precedents, I conclude that 
activities related to the seeking of information in order to 
prepare a question do not fall within the strict definition of 
what constitutes a “proceeding in Parliament” and, therefore, 
they are not protected by privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to another aspect of the matter before me. In 
the statement she gave to the House on October 2, 1997, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development made 
reference to the Access to Information Act as well as the Privacy 
Act.  Whether the application of these two acts should be 
clarified is a matter for the courts, not the Speaker. I concur 
totally with Speaker Fraser when, in a ruling on March 17, 1987, 
at page 4262 of the <I>Debates</I> he emphasized that “The extent 
of the application of any law is a question that the courts 
should be asked to decide and not the Speaker”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same decision Speaker Fraser further stated:  “The 
Speaker's duty is confined to interpreting the procedures and 
practices of the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I draw members' attention to citation 168(5) of Beauchesne's 
sixth edition, at page 49, which states “The Speaker will not 
give a decision upon a constitutional question nor decide a 
question of law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I wish to remind the House that it is not up to the 
Chair to comment on the behaviour of public servants in the 
performance of their duties. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fulfil their parliamentary duties, members should of 
course have access to the information they require.  On the other 
hand, they should be aware of the constraints under which public 
servants must operate when providing information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is mindful of the multiple responsibilities, duties 
and constituency related activities of all members and of the 
importance they play in the work of every member of Parliament. 
However, my role as your Speaker is to consider only those 
matters that affect the parliamentary work of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose has explained that this matter 
touches upon his preparation for questions to the minister.  I 
accept the hon. member's statement just as I accept the 
minister's explanation of the events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a dispute about the facts of the case and it 
does not fall to the Speaker to settle that dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concluded that this case constitutes a grievance on the 
part of the hon. member, but since this situation has not 
actually precluded the hon. member from participating in a 
parliamentary proceeding the Chair cannot find that a case of a 
contempt of parliament has occurred. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Wild Rose for his intervention and for 
bringing this matter to our attention. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I listened with interest to your 
ruling on the subject.  You mentioned that the member for Wild 
Rose has a grievance, but you ruled that he did not have a case 
for contempt of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could you explain for the benefit of the House what a grievance 
means for the member for Wild Rose, where a grievance goes from 
here, or what that means in this case so he can follow up on this 
further? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As a general rule once a decision has been 
given it should just rest where it is.  A Speaker's ruling is of 
course not appealable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case I will make an exception.  If the hon. 
member has a grievance he should pursue it in my view with the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now prepared to deal with the question of privilege raised 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre on October 1 
relating to the premature disclosure and subsequent publication 
of a preliminary draft of a committee report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member contends that in the 
last Parliament a preliminary draft report of the Standing 
Committee on Industry was divulged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She states that while the industry committee's fifth report was 
tabled in the House on April 25, 1997, the Department of 
Industry's response to an access to information request shows 
that on April 18, 1997 industry department officials were in 
possession of a preliminary draft of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first deal with the question of whether a breach of 
privilege that occurred in a previous parliament can now be taken 
up and dealt with by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May's 20th edition makes clear, at page 168, that a 
breach of privilege in one parliament may indeed be punished by 
another.  This is reflected again in the ruling of Speaker Jerome 
on November 9, 1978 which reaffirms the principle unequivocally. 
The Chair can therefore entertain the question raised by the hon. 
member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her presentation, the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre 
argued that the privileges of the House have been breached in so far as 
the preliminary draft report has been divulged prior to its presentation 
to this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the 
attention of the House as well as the government House leader and the 
hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona for the assistance they have given 
the Chair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this is a matter of utmost importance.  Since the 
standing committees of the House are holding their organization 
meetings and beginning their work in the 36th Parliament, this is 
also a most timely issue.  It reminds us all of the 
responsibilities members assume when they serve on committees of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated in my ruling of February 15, 1995 on a similar 
matter, confidentiality is a key issue for committees.  Members 
of committees and ministers working with committees have an 
obligation to ensure that they themselves and those whose 
expertise they seek, be they personal assistants or departmental 
officials, respect the confidentiality of their documents and the 
integrity of their deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees must address their work processes and be very clear 
about how they expect draft reports and other material relating 
to in camera meetings to be treated.  Everyone present at such 
meetings, including officials from departments and agencies, must 
realize their obligation to respect the confidentiality of the 
proceedings they witness and the material they may therefore be 
privy to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report tabled in the House on December 18, 1987 the 
Standing Committee on Elections, Privileges and Procedure 
recommended that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees should make clear decisions about the circulation of 
draft reports—.  Equally, committees should give careful 
consideration to the matters that should be dealt with in camera 
and matters that should be discussed in public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, however, the Chair has often expressed its 
reluctance to interfere in the affairs of committees unless 
difficulties arising in the committee are put before the House by 
way of a committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer members especially to the ruling of Speaker Fraser given 
on December 7, 1991, which can be found at page 4773 of the 
<I>Debates</I>.  In that ruling he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to our traditions and practices, the Chair does not 
intervene in the proceedings of a committee unless a problem has 
been reported by the committee to the House or in extremely 
unusual circumstances.

all the issues were considered.  Perhaps you could respond to 
this in an answer for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of committee in camera minutes, the 
Chair may or may not be aware that committees are now destroying 
in camera minutes at the end of parliament.  Therefore there 
would be no evidence of any decisions taken in camera by a 
committee on an issue because the minutes would have been 
destroyed.  We would have no record of what exactly happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this part of the decision or part of the input, or would this 
be grounds for the Speaker to intervene in the business of 
committees whereby they do not destroy the minutes but keep them 
on record?

the committees generally set up the rules under which they are to 
work.  As for evidence being carried over from one parliament to 
another, the Chair must deal with the evidence that is put before 
the Chair.  If this evidence does not exist then the Chair cannot 
rule on it one way or another.  Did it ever exist?  I guess that 
is another point that could be discussed at some further time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the time being the Chair must, on the basis of the 
information that is put before it in whatever case, make a 
decision at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is question about how a committee proceeds, I suggest 
to all hon. members the matter should be raised in committee so 
that they provide for this information to be available one way or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to advise the House that I have written to 
the Speaker this morning seeking leave of the House to introduce 
a motion in accordance with Standing Order 52, for the purpose of 
discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the fact that two bills have been introduced in the 
Senate by the government and will be considered by the Senate 
before being considered by the Commons. While I recognize that 
this is an established practice, this practice in today's 
Parliament is outmoded and offensive to our democratic principles 
since the Senate is unelected, unaccountable and unrepresentative 
of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the days when the two dominant parties in the House and the 
Senate were of the same stripe, the introduction of government 
bills in the Senate may have been less offensive. However in the 
last two Parliaments there has been a shift in the political 
make-up of Canada. Three of the five parties in this House of 
Commons are not represented in the Senate at all.  In addition 
the party which represents the opposition in the Senate 
represents less than 7% of the elected members of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the procedures set out in Standing Order 52 will 
enable members of the House to immediately debate and communicate 
to the government that the upper house cannot be expected to 
fulfil the role of sober first thought since the senators 
represent a political composition which is a reflection of the 
past and, in particular, a reflection of patronage appointments 
of the defeated governments of Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I will share my time with the 
hon. member for Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first opposition day for the Bloc Quebecois and the 
issue is the financing of federal political parties. It is all the more 
relevant in the current context, given the influence peddling 
allegations involving employees of the Liberal Party of Canada and of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For about two weeks now, the opposition has been putting questions 
to the government, but the ministers either refuse to answer or give 
evasive or contradictory answers. 
At the very beginning, no one knew anything. Then, thanks to the honesty 
and perhaps the naivety of the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
we learned that a few ministers knew about the case. Later on, we 
discovered that an increasing number of ministers knew. I am convinced 
that, in the days or weeks to come, we will learn that the whole cabinet 
knew, except of course the Solicitor General who, I am sure, was not 
aware of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat surprising since in the Airbus case, which came to 
its conclusion this week, the then justice minister told us that, in 
such cases, the Solicitor General, not the Prime Minister, had to be 
informed first. This was the rule as they explained to us by referring 
to many precedents and to past practice. Today, everything is changed.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set the record straight. On March 6, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development informed the RCMP of a possible case of influence 
peddling. He also told the Prime Minister, or his office—which amounts to 
the same thing, for when the Prime Minister's chief 
of staff is informed of something, he immediately tells it to the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, and 
the President of Treasury Board. The investigation began in mid-June, 
three months later. As you know, a general election was held in Canada 
during that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders whether an election would have been called so early if 
allegations or revelations had not been made to the RCMP. 
Was it not therefore in the government's interest to call an election 
quickly? Alternatively, one wonders whether the investigation was 
postponed until after June 2 to avoid any embarrassment to the Liberal 
Party of Canada during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two questions come to mind, given that the human resources 
minister said he informed those concerned. Just who were those 
concerned? The Prime Minister, since he is the one who calls the 
election. The Minister of Public Works and Government Services, not in 
this capacity—even though he gives out many contracts, 35% of which 
are awarded without tender—but rather as a political organizer for 
the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec. 
He also notified the President of the Treasury Board, not in his 
capacity as President of the Treasury Board but as the federal minister 
responsible for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can wonder if it was not in the interest of the Prime Minister, 
who won his election, winning by a very narrow margin in his riding of 
Shawinigan, to keep this matter under wraps during the election 
campaign. One can also wonder what position it would have put them in if 
the Liberals had had to explain why they were using the same financing 
methods as the Conservatives, whose methods they denounced time and time 
again when in opposition. But they are using the same methods, as we 
have seen in this case. We may discover that the same thing happened in 
other regions of Canada as well. Quebec may not be unique with respect 
to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can just imagine the Minister of Public Works and Governmental 
Services explaining during the election campaign that his government's 
code of ethics is different from that of the Liberal Party of Canada. He 
stated that the Liberal Party was required to comply with the Criminal 
Code. The reverse would have been surprising. The fact is we are not 
sure any more, since these allegations were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about their code of ethics, we must ask ourselves: 
what ethics?  It is like the Lourdes or Fatima secret. Revelations are 
made about something that is never made public. We are aware of the 
existence of a code, but not of its contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also surprising that the matter was not submitted to cabinet 
to ensure government integrity. I am surprised because we are dealing 
with a system that connects the federal government to the Liberal Party 
of Canada as far as financing is concerned. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development told us that confidential 
lists are handed over to the ministers responsible for the various 
regions. The minister responsible for Quebec, who is also the President 
of the Treasury Board, told us, although this was said outside this 
House, he received confidential listings not only from Human Resources 
Development Canada but also from other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to learn about that yesterday, not during oral 
questions however, because the minister would not answer. He had more to 
say outside the House, but what he said was nonetheless interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the minister's staff is under investigation, yet the 
minister does nothing. That is surprising. He did nothing yesterday and 
nothing today.

until proven otherwise, one and the same person.  What one knows, 
the other should know. 
It is strange though that he did not inform his cabinet of the 
allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why legislation on political party funding in Canada 
must be reformed.  This is why the federal government should turn 
to the laws of Quebec for inspiration.  They are, and I use the 
word advisedly, unique in Canada.  These are the laws that the 
Liberal Party of Canada and the other federal parties ignored in 
the last referendum.  They came and told us how much they loved us, 
spending all the money they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated the 
Quebec referendum act, while the federal government, sitting under 
the weight of allegations, has no such legislation.  We can see 
that the Supreme Court, biased as it is, is under the control of a 
regime that puts partisan interests before ethics. 
That is where things are at today.

I was shocked to hear the words of the leader of the party

also potentially undermine the entire legal system in this 
country.  They undermine the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the party leader who spoke these words to 
withdraw them.  In the absence of a withdrawal I think he must, 
like a child, carry these words with him for a very long time.

It would be an easy matter to raise a series of points of order

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, as long as I have more than five 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said this morning, given the serious allegations hanging 
over the Liberal Party of Canada, over the government, was that it seems 
to me that there is an urgent need here for legislation similar to that 
in Quebec so as to ensure that democracy does not have a price tag 
attached to it, that we do not find ourselves with a system in which 
financial interests are more important than the expressed wishes of 
voters, a system in which a court would hand down anti-democratic 
rulings in Canada, the world's greatest country, a system in which 
money, not democracy, rules the day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, knowing 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois' leadership problems, he is 
obviously looking for something to rally his gang around him. And 
what a lovely sight it is to see them all flocking along behind him 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the head of the Bloc Quebecois and the leader of the party 
are one and the same person, I would have some questions to put 
to him. When the father of the Bloc Quebecois, Lucien Bouchard, 
was elected in 1988—different party, Conservative, but the same 
man—he reported $41 000 in campaign expenditures under “other 
parties”, “other organizations”.  There were amounts for 
individuals, and there was the amount of $41 000 from other 
organizations for his campaign.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, does he agree with this?  Second, is it true, as 
is alleged, that the Bloc Quebecois might possibly have received 
funds from financial institutions that are not individuals?  Can 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois tell me whether he has received 
considerable amounts from certain banks, that is corporate entities 
and not individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, if I understand correctly, 
we are speaking of the 1988 election of Mr. Lucien Bouchard, when 
he was in the Conservative party. Is that indeed what we are 
speaking of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite possible that things were going on within the 
Conservative party of the time, as there are within the Liberal 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard has changed, unlike the hon. member for Bourassa, 
who ran against me in 1990.  It took him three or four tries to get 
himself elected here.  I remember when he was passing himself off 
as the reincarnation of Jean-Claude Malépart, over the Malépart 
family's objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the matter of financial institutions, all of the 
Bloc Quebecois' reports have been tabled in this House.  Banks have 
never been shown to be supporters of the Bloc Quebecois.  That is 
public knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, when the reports will have been submitted for this 
campaign—I do not have them myself, since they were all completed 
on October 2 and we have until December 31—my colleague will be 
able to see for himself that the Bloc's rules apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us not confuse matters. There may have been loans 
against a line of credit, but that is not a donation.  It is 
something very different, and I can tell you that the loans are 
being paid back.  Such accounting details may be too complicated 
for my colleague for Bourassa, however.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member from the Bloc stated that financial 
interests are not more important than the interests of Canadians. 
He is asking this government to consider making sure that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that after what we saw yesterday in with Bill C-2, 
obviously this government does not have the interests of 
Canadians at heart.  It is silencing us in this House on some of 
the most intrusive legislation, referring to Bill C-2, by not 
allowing debate and not allowing us to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member from the Bloc would agree that this 
government does not have the interests of Canadians at heart.  It 
is no surprise to us after we saw what happened on the most 
intrusive legislation against young Canadians in this country. 
It does not surprise me that this government is acting in this 
way and we cannot expect anything different from it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, this is not the time to be 
talking about Bill C-2.  We are talking about another very important 
matter today, the financing of federal political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the views of Reform members on this issue.  As 
long as we do not have an act similar to the one which exists in Quebec, 
we will have situations like the present one where there are allegations 
of influence peddling on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and maybe 
the office of the President of Treasury Board, someone of some 
importance within the government.  You could say he controls the purse 
strings.  Moreover, he is the federal minister responsible for the 
province, an interested party, as the hon. Minister of Human Resources 
Development was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it is high time we adopted a modern piece of 
legislation that would guarantee that big bucks will not be what 
matters, nor the very legalistic point of view of those who make 
decisions like the one we had this morning. It would guarantee that 
these people would not be the ones who decide which measures are passed 
here, in ways that have nothing to do with the very essence of 
democracy, I migh add.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the more so that there is presently in my riding a hotly 
debated issue which could literally burn the Liberal government since it 
could involve once more, influence peddling and partisanship in its 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about the much criticized relocation to the neighbouring town 
of Saint-Antoine-des-Laurentides of the employment centre that has 
always been located in Saint-Jérôme, the economic capital of the 
Laurentian area. But to really understand what is involved in this case, 
it is essential to go back over the events from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEC has always been located in Saint-Jérôme's downtown core. 
In 1991, after the public works department accepted the bid of the 
property management company RAMCO Développement Inc., the latter 
invested $1.7 million to expand its building located in downtown, so it 
could accommodate the Saint-Jérôme CEC and meet the department's 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer, public works elected to make use of a one year renewal 
option on CEC's lease ending in April 1998. In June of this year, Public 
Works Canada suddenly informed RAMCO, without going into great detail, 
that there would be a call for proposals on invitation. 
The location perimeter for that proposal call, which is without 
precedent in the history of the CEC of Saint-Jérôme, will be extended as 
to include the town of Saint-Antoine-des-Laurentides, where there is 
space available in a shopping centre. Now rumour has it that those 
premises belong to a friend of the Liberals, someone who had contributed 
to the party's election fund. How peculiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree that this is where the problem lies. Why extend 
the location perimeter of the CEC's premises? Why does the federal 
government feel compelled to get involved, with its not so subtle 
approach, and without any concern for the development priorities 
established by the locals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, on July 26, the Rivière-du-Nord RCM undertook to 
review its development plan in an interim control resolution, 
which provided, and I quote: “That any new government or quasi 
government service be established in downtown Saint-Jérôme”.  The 
resolution was passed by a majority of the mayors of the 
Rivière-du-Nord RCM on September 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development was in fact made 
aware of this in a letter from Gaston Laviolette, the mayor of the 
municipality of Bellefeuille and the reeve of the Rivière-du-Nord 
RCM and Marc Gascon, the mayor of the city of Saint-Jérôme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the relevance of their remarks, the minister turned a 
deaf ear.  On the strength of this we can assume that the minister 
has no sense of what is involved in regional development, since 
this is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too put pressure on the two ministers concerned in this 
matter. On many occasions I called the offices of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and of the Minister of Public Works. 
I finally managed to meet the executive assistant of the Minister 
of Public Works with my colleagues Mr. Gascon, the mayor of 
Saint-Jérôme and Mr. Laviolette, a mayor and the reeve of the 
Rivière-du-Nord RCM.  Here again, nothing came of the contact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unable to meet the Minister of Human Resources Development, I 
took the initiative of stopping him in the Liberal's backroom. 
After hardly a word was said, the minister, who was already on the 
defensive, made it clear he did not want to hear anything about 
partisan politics in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after I added new facts, which, I add, disagreeably 
surprised him, he changed his attitude to some extent and assured 
me that he would look into the matter and would get back to me 
about my concerns. 
However, I still have heard nothing from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still waiting for word from you, Mr. Minister.  I assume 
he is too busy with the RCMP investigation of allegations of 
influence peddling— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member is to address the Speaker and not the minister directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to address the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> To come back to the issue at hand, Madam 
Speaker, even the director of the employment centre deplores the 
minister's decision. He told us that he had always been very 
satisfied with the quality and service of the premises and that 
he wanted to stay in the building located at 222, Saint-Georges 
Street, in downtown Saint-Jerôme.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the director, the visibility and pre-eminent location 
of the employment centre are essential to serve Saint-Jérôme and the 
surrounding area and especially the other cities served by Saint-Jérôme 
following the streamlining of the employment centres by the minister. 
Now, adding insult to injury, the minister wants to relocate the centre 
to the outskirts of downtown Saint-Jérôme, which is the economic capital 
of the Laurentides region. The centre's director was very blunt on one 
point: if it were relocated in Saint-Antoine-des-Laurentides, the centre 
would lose all of its present high profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The support I have received to prevent this move does not end 
there. On September 19, 1997, Mrs. Louise Harel, Quebec labour minister, 
wrote a letter to the Minister of Human Resources Development, asking 
him for a moratorium on this move since it goes against the spirit of 
the Quebec-Canada agreement in principle on manpower training, which is 
aimed at making both federal and provincial service points more 
accessible, not less so as is the case here. As of September 10, the 
minister had only received an acknowledgement of receipt of her letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the firm RAMCO développement Inc., its president, 
Mr. Jacob A. Attias, is rightly surprised and mostly quite shocked by he 
lack of transparency of the Liberal government's process in the matter 
of moving the CEC out of its present location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, RAMCO développement spent $1.7 million to add to the 
building in order to make room for the employment centre. Mr. Attias had 
even offered to lower the rent by close to 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, RAMCO had agreed with Public Works to 
invest a further $120,000 to upgrade and renovate the facilities in 
order to better meet the department's requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine how Mr. Attias feels after such an experience. Not 
only is this businessman being overtaxed, he is being literally fleeced 
and taken for a ride by the very people who manage his taxes. This is 
totally outrageous and despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all these facts, I am entitled to believe and to say that 
partisan interests or influence peddling are behind this unjustified and 
unjustifiable move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more I talk about the issue, the more I wonder. Since it is 
practically impossible to meet the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and to shed light on this vital issue for the socio-economic 
development of the Laurentian region, I urge the minister to take into 
consideration the questions that follow and to provide me with answers 
as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why does his department not comply with the will of our 
community's stakeholders to have public services grouped together in the 
downtown core of Saint-Jérôme, as clearly stated in a resolution from 
the RCM of Rivière-du-Nord on interim control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, why does his department totally disregard the very high 
level of satisfaction of its managers with the current location of the 
employment centre? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, that is the move of the Saint-Jérôme employment 
centre and the RCMP investigation, we find the same silence which truly 
gives us the impression that someone from that party has a guilty 
conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Liberal Party ministers or employees made mistakes or did not 
comply with a basic code of conduct, they will, sooner or later, have to 
pay for their mistakes, because no one will trust them any more, and 
rightly so. As elected representatives, members of Parliament are 
accountable to the public. However, and I deeply regret having to say 
this, there seems to be a blatant lack of accountability and 
transparency on the part of certain individuals working for the federal 
government.

question. I do not want make any accusations, except that decisions were 
made, of course, to move some employment centres to other areas, 
probably to satisfy certain people. These decisions went against the 
opinion regional or local stakeholders had voiced at the time. What we 
are asking this government to do is to make decisions that go along with 
the wishes expressed by the local or regional stakeholders and to stop 
playing party politics with these issues.

three or four kilometres apart. How are we going to offer services to 
people who have no car, who must travel, who will have to go to one 
place and another, while trying to cut costs, to reach a consensus? A 
senior federal official is negotiating with Quebec so that the two 
offices, the employment centre and the unemployment office, are as close 
as possible and even sometimes share the same location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, in my region, the government has decided to move the 
employment centre that is now located very close—some 100 metres away—to 
the office run by the Quebec government. 
It will be moved three kilometres away. This is a totally illogical 
decision. I hope some ministers who are here today will think about this 
so that this decision can be reversed and that, next time, before making 
similar decisions, they will think and consult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee one thing, I will not give up on this issue. I will 
see it through to a satisfacatory resolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember, in spite of what we have been hearing for the last 
few minutes, that the text of the motion that we are debating with a 
minor amendment proposed a little earlier reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the attitude of the Government, which 
refuses to introduce in-depth reform of the legislation on the 
financing of federal political parties, and so on. 
</UL>
<That is the motion put to us by the third party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this morning, the Bloc has been making all kinds of 
allegations against one person or another, sometimes even against 
constituents of ridings represented by Bloc members or other parties. 
They are using this motion as a pretext to do so. For my part, I intend 
as much as possible to limit my comments to the motion before the House. 
After all, that is what the House is dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> You can't possibly do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> I am sorry this displeases the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. Anyhow, I still intend to restrict my comments 
to the debate and to the motion before us, at least as much as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the financing of political parties is an issue of 
interest for a large number of Canadians. Let me say first of all that 
the federal electoral system we have in Canada has been considered for 
a long time as fair for the candidates and for Canadian taxpayers. It 
continues to be the envy of many countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our electoral system has been imitated elsewhere. It is the envy of 
several countries in the world, as I just said. 
It tries to balance public and private financing and allows rich 
people—there will always be some—as well as people coming 
from more modest backgrounds, myself included, to run for election 
and to sit in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect candidates and political parties to raise funds from 
private sources by presenting policies that Canadians wish to 
support. The candidates present their platform and ask people to 
contribute to the financing of their election campaign. In my 
opinion, the system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in recognition of the importance and of the role 
political parties and candidates play in our democratic system, a 
portion of public funds is earmarked for elections. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two major funding tools exist for providing that funding.  In 
part there is the reimbursement of election expenses. We are 
familiar with how that system works. 
There is the tax credit for political contributions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain that for a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to candidates, the reimbursement provided is 50% of 
the candidate's expenditures, providing that the candidate 
receives at least 15% of the votes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, none of my opponents obtained 15% of the votes. 
Consequently, they lost the deposit I just described. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it pertains to political parties, they receive 22.5% of the 
reimbursement.  There is a condition which was added during the 
last Parliament.  I was a member of the committee which brought 
the change, which is that a party that has official status must 
receive 2% or more of the number of valid votes cast at an 
election or 5% of the votes cast in any individual riding where 
the party has a candidate.  This amendment was brought forward by 
an hon. member of the Reform Party during the last Parliament. 
The committee agreed that it was a valid amendment.  I believe 
that member is now the House leader for the Reform Party. It was 
a good amendment and we approved it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political parties may accept contributions if the parties have 
registered status.  They may issue receipts year round for tax 
credit purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Candidates, on the other hand, may only issue receipts once they 
have filed their nomination papers.  At election time each 
candidate also issues receipts for the period after filing their 
nomination papers.  Those receipts are issued by our respective 
financial agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other restrictions.  A person who is not a 
Canadian citizen or a permanent resident in Canada cannot make a 
contribution, nor can a corporation or an association that does 
not do business in Canada.  This is to ensure that it is 
Canadians who fund the Canadian electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign political parties or governments or trade unions with no 
bargaining rights in Canada are also prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is no limit on the size of any contribution, 
candidates and political parties are restricted in their use of 
such funds by the limits which are in place at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a further restriction, which is that the tax credits, 
once a certain amount is reached, become null and avoid.  In 
other words, if someone makes a further contribution they do not 
receive a tax benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Bloc Quebecois, this morning, are saying 
that the system must be changed and replaced by a system where 
political parties will not allowed to receive contributions from 
corporations. I see that the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is 
saying that, yes, that is precisely what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lortie commission, an important commission which published a 
report on electoral financing—I have a copy of the report here, 
but of course I cannot show it to the camera—made several 
recommendations. I must point out to you that the commission has 
recommended neither that only individuals be allowed to make 
contributions nor that a maximum be established for 
contributions. It is important to note that the commission, which 
is non-partisan—I hope nobody says that the Lortie Commission is 
partisan—, never made such recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some members opposite making light of the recommendation 
of the Lortie commission.  However, it is important for us to 
note a few things.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is pontificating today. Indeed, the Bloc leader told us 
earlier that his party does not take any money from companies. 
However, some of the Bloc members here in this House today have 
received corporate contributions. A good many of them. There were 
27 corporate contributions during the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the members who are sitting here, looking at me, received 
some of those contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  Name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  An amount exceeding $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is worth mentioning. So when you want to preach, as some 
of the members opposite are doing, you have to be very careful. The 
funding system for political parties in Canada is simple. It is 
basically a good system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that we will do everything in our power to keep it 
good and honest. Allegations like the ones being made by the Bloc do not 
help to improve democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  We are right, since you no longer accept 
certified cheques, only cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  We have to keep working to improve democracy in 
our country and avoid taking part in a discussion like the one the Bloc 
Quebecois wants to hold today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  Give us some names and figures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have many comments to make on the biased and twisted 
speech just delivered by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I ask him is to give us the names of those who 
received company contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  And the amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B>  Nobody in the Bloc received contributions from 
companies. And do you know why?  Because we are following the lessons of 
Mr. Lévesque, who thought that, by respect for the people and to better 
serve the people, big businesses, banks and trust companies should not 
finance political parties. I think that Mr. Lévesque was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada includes 
the six major banks, which gave more than $40,000. For their part, trust 
companies contributed more than $35,000 each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that situation, nobody will be surprised that the government 
cannot muster enough political will to act when asked to fix the tax 
loopholes which allowed family trusts to transfer $2 billion in the 
United States without paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots financing means that the funds are gathered among those 
who ask us to represent them and do a good job at it instead of 
representing big businesses, like they like to do across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member dare say that his government can represent 
each and every citizen when it is being bribed by big business and 
refuses to take the necessary actions to fix the tax loopholes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B>  That is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> —but maintains privileges— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  Point of order, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is always full of baloney. He 
is talking about bribes. He should know that he must show respect to 
this institution and to all parliamentarians. And when— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I think members on both sides 
of the House should be more careful in their choice of words. I would 
ask you to please continue the debate calmly and peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think all my colleagues 
here in this House heard the derogatory remarks made by the member for 
Bourassa, who called the members of my party hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This word being unparliamentary, I call on you to ask the member 
for Bourassa to withdraw that remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  In this case, I will 
check the blues, but I would ask you once again to remain calm. 
The member for Sainte-Hyacinthe—Bagot has the floor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will repeat my question 
since I was interrupted. How can the member claim to be serving 
ordinary Canadians when his party is being bribed by large 
corporations and banks to the tune of $40,000 in donations to the 
Liberal Party of Canada? How can this government not have its 
hands tied by all this generosity on the part of corporate 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B>  Its hands are tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to say two things. 
First, any small business in my constituency that wants to make a 
contribution to my election compaign has as much right to do so 
than any individual. I do not claim otherwise. The members 
opposite claim they do not take donations from corporations when 
they actually do, and that is what is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B>  We do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  We want names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Liar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Second, I want to tell you about my own campaign. 
Each year, my constituents make contributions to the election campaign. 
I hold a huge fundraiser to which each person contributes $65. That is 
how I finance my election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the finance minister visited my constituency and 344 
persons came to listen to his speech. That is how I finance my 
election campaign. And I can tell you now that my association has 
$100,000 in its election fund. I have no qualms about it; I say 
so publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finance my election campaign by collecting $65 from each of my 
supporters. This is the way I am accountable to my constituents. Each 
and every one of them made a contribution. They bought a ticket, some 
even bought two, to come to my fundraiser. Tickets cost $100, including 
$35 for the dinner and $65 for the contribution. That is how I financed 
my election campaign and that is how I was elected to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I am not ashamed to say this. I am not ashamed to 
appear in front of my constituents. The accusations made by the hon. 
member opposite are irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  Half goes to Corbeil and the other half to 
the other one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I congratulate you and wish you well.  I wonder if you are ruing 
the day you got the appointment to be in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to enter the debate today on the motion.  The House 
leader from the government talked about one part of the motion, 
financing federal political parties.  I would like to talk about 
another phrase which may upset him, the phrase about the existing 
legislation that allows for a wide range of abuses. I think that 
is what we need to look at here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the voters of Edmonton North, the new 
constituency in which I ran in this past election.  It was an 
honour for me to win the election and to voice their concerns on 
the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay tribute to the voters in the now 
defunct riding of Beaver River in northeastern Alberta, those 
people who took a chance and voted on the first ever Reformer in 
the House of Commons back in March 1989.  Although I am away from 
the riding of Beaver River because the electoral boundaries 
commissioners blitzed that riding in the last election, it was a 
tremendous honour for me to sit here for several years on their 
behalf.  I am close to them still in heart and also 
geographically as I am literally the girl next door in the riding 
of Edmonton North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay tribute today to a very special aunt of 
mine, Reta Yerex, who died of cancer two days ago.  I dedicate my 
maiden speech in the House of Commons in this Parliament to her. 
I want to say to her husband Art and family that I love them and 
I will do the best job I can do in the House.  She loved me and 
she supported everything I did.  I want to do this today for her 
and everything else that I do here also because she is not with 
us any more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say how pleased I am today to have my 
mother, Joyce Levy, and my sister Alison Horne with us.  They 
have watched me grow up.  They have watched me make Canadian 
history and they are watching me today in the chambers of the 
House of Commons.  I want to do the best job I can do for them as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my greatest friend and confidant, my husband, 
Lewis Larson, for the support that he has given me over the years 
in the Chamber and at home.  He knows and understands politics 
probably even better than I do.  He is my greatest advisor.  I 
just want to say thank you, Lew.  I appreciate everything that 
you have done and will continue to do for me.  I think he is 
pretty upset right now about some of the ways political parties 
use and abuse their funding powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I want to say several things in the debate today.  We 
never have enough time to talk about all the things that we 
should talk about, but this whole phrase “allowing for the abuse 
of legislation for federal political parties that can in fact 
misuse and abuse the trust of the Canadian public”.   I do not 
find anything more reprehensible than that.  Somebody under the 
guise of a federal political party that looks as if he is on the 
up and up should not be able to bully people into making 
donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government used to be against free trade but now it seems 
it is all in favour of it. “I'll trade my promises, contracts, 
all those kinds of things to you if you vote for me and put me 
in”.  That is shameful.  We have been addressing this during 
question period over the last several days and we will continue 
to address it in question period and every other chance we get. 
We want to make sure that this dirt comes to the surface in order 
to find out what the answers are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making allegations today.  I am not making any 
assumptions of wrong-doing but I am going to continue to ask 
questions so that people in government are not doing the literal 
free trade “you vote for me and I'll pad your pockets later with 
a government contract”.  That is shameful and nobody in that 
situation should ever be voted into office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Liberal bagman who is being investigated 
right now.  He is somebody who raised funds for the Liberal 
Party.  We have to ask the question:  What was the trade-off? 
What was the free trade deal they were talking about?  This was 
even more deplorable than what we have been suggesting the last 
couple of days and asking questions about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a letter that came from the Prime Minister's office 
concerning Liberal fundraising during the election campaign.  I 
thought that was wrong.  In fact, I thought it was not just 
immoral or unethical, I thought it was illegal for someone who is 
the Prime Minister of the country.  That is wrong, but it does 
not seem that the things that he does are wrong.  This letter is 
going to the Liberal national director stating that the election 
has been called and it is the time to start rallying Liberals 
across the country, to get the Liberal message out during the 
campaign. It refers to encouraging all Liberal friends to climb 
on board and show their ongoing personal and financial support. 
This came out of the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever the question needed to be asked in this place about the 
abuse of fundraising for political parties it is this kind of 
thing.  It is wrong at the beginning, wrong in the middle and 
wrong now at the end. People must not be allowed to do that in 
government.  Signing his name, Jean Chrétien, from the Prime 
Minister's office, sending out Liberal stuff asking for Liberal 
money and Liberal donations so they could try to form a Liberal 
government.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Her Majesty's loyal opposition, which we are proud to be, we 
will continue to make sure that we hold these people accountable 
for the abuse of some of the funds.  The timing of these 
suspicious grants is certainly questionable and we are going to 
continue to ask the questions that need to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about federal political parties that become government and 
interfere and manipulate some of these arm's length groups? How 
about the CBC?  It is always said here that these are arm's 
length people.  What is at the end of the arm?  A hand, a great 
big hand that can go around the neck of the CBC or, for instance, 
the Canadian Armed Forces, to say “Here is our free trade 
agreement with you; you support us, give us good coverage and 
talk about us and the military well or else.  You may be at arm's 
length but our hand is attached to the end of that arm. We have a 
stranglehold on you and we will cut your grants for the CBC. 
We will cut your funding for equipment and staff in the Canadian 
armed forces”.  It is wrong.  What is at the end of the arm's 
length relationship with the provinces, for instance with health 
care?  The government was to fund the provinces 50:50 when 
medicare came in in 1965.  Now the federal government is down to 
10% cash donations for transfer payments and it is falling fast.

any way it sees fit, even though it goes against the red book 
promise, yet it turns around and says it is the great champions 
of health care, the great champions of the defence department and 
the Canadian Armed Forces and of public broadcasting and the CBC. 
It is a farce and nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Canadian taxpayers?  How many people have gone around 
in ridings during the campaign saying “You vote for me and I 
will get you this, I will get you that.  I will make sure that 
your company gets a grant.”  Surely those days should be far, 
far behind us. It is wrong, very wrong for someone to go around a 
constituency and make promises that if “you vote for me, I will 
make sure I look after you.”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order. Earlier in her comments, the member 
indicated that she would not mention the Prime Minister's name 
and she did.  She also used the word “illegally ” in reference 
to actions on behalf of the Prime Minister's signing. As well she 
has imputed that members during the election campaign were going 
out and soliciting votes in exchange for some consideration which 
is contrary to the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, all of these items are contrary to the rules of 
this place and I ask you please to enforce the rules of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Given the nature of 
the discussion at this time, I think we can give the hon. member 
a little leeway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   Madam Speaker, I am not begging for 
leeway in the House, what I am begging for are answers to the 
questions that have been raised about some people.  I am not 
stating that something is illegal.  I am not accusing the member 
of going around asking for votes. I am saying that if this type 
of thing is allowed to happen, as we are talking about in 
question period right now, surely to heaven the member would like 
to see it cleaned up.  I do not think he would like his name 
besmirched anymore that I would like mine besmirched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make some fundamental changes so that the Canada 
Elections Act cannot be abused during writ periods.  Further, 
when a government is in full blown operation and is now the 
victim and its members at arm's length in an RCMP criminal 
investigation, it is wrong. I do not think the member is very 
proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let wrap up with this. Here is a little quiz for the House. Who 
said this? “The best party that deals with the issue of morality 
and ethics in government will win the next election.” I bet a 
dime no one can guess.  It was the member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell in November 1987. Does that sound 
like a broken record?  “Integrity and honesty must be restored 
to the political process,” page 91 in the red book.  I do not 
think the Liberals have moved on that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government, do not just tell us, show us.  Do not 
just think about it, do it, do it, do it.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about shameful.  What is shameful is to try to make 
political capital when you do not have any proof.  It bothers me 
that in this specific case she used totally incorrect facts 
without a shred of evidence. She has attacked the reputation of 
an honest and outstanding member of the Shawinigan business 
community.  She should apologize for what she did. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does she have no evidence, but she attacked a member of 
the business community and she sullied a reputation. To top it off, in 
with all the falsehoods she has uttered, as a member of Parliament, she 
has undermined this whole institution. I can see the Bloc's histrionics 
have started to spread to the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on this issue of the financing of political parties, 
the hon. member stated that, because a corporation has given us 
money, we are in the pay of this corporation.  I have a question 
for her. Since, according to the latest report, the Reform Party 
received 925 donations from companies, for a total of $815,520, 
does that mean that the Reform Party is in the pay of those 
companies that contributed money to the official opposition? This 
is nonsense. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member talks about 
me doing this as a violin playing matter.  I hardly think that 
was the best analogy to use.  I do sing although I am not a 
violin player, that is for sure.  Quite frankly, I do not like 
the tune he is singing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses me of incorrect facts.  I am trying to get any facts 
that I can.  That is what the difficult part is, trying to get 
facts from the government.  We are trying to get the facts. 
When he says that we are bringing this up I have to remind him 
and jog his little memory that this criminal investigation was 
launched by the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not something I dreamt up during the campaign.  This is 
not something my party thought would be fun to investigate.  It 
is his own guy. He is the one who decided that this should be 
looked into because he smelled a rat.  I think it is probably a 
good thing that he did.  I have some concerns about the fact that 
we did not hear about it until five days after the election was 
over. I am not making these accusations, I am asking questions. 
If he were in opposition surely he would be doing exactly the 
same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses me also of shirt rending, Madam Speaker, and I want 
to give you this assurance.  What we saw on <I>This Hour Has 22 
Minutes</I> the other night was bad enough.  I promise I will not 
be rending my shirt in here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rose on the point of order earlier because as a backbencher I 
and most hon. members are here to hopefully earn back respect for 
the role and position of members of Parliament.  In this speech I 
did not hear things that I felt very good about. In my view it 
was an attempt to link partisan party activities and the office 
of the Prime Minister in ways which could lead to the perception 
that there was some wrongdoing on behalf of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member, based on information I have 
received, that the letter from the Prime Minister on the Prime 
Minister's office letterhead to which she has referred in fact 
was merely an artist's rendition of it included in a Liberal 
Party fundraising package— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, a reasonable facsimile thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  —and not in fact a letter from the Prime 
Minister's office which was within his role as the Prime Minister 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Madam Speaker, the entertainment just does 
not end.  He talks about the link that I was trying to make 
between bringing back respect to the office and this idea of 
fundraising and linking partisan party activities.  This was not 
my letter.  This says “Liberal fax transmission from Jean 
Chrétien to Terry Mercer, National Director, Liberal Party of 
Canada”, and it says Prime Minister's office at the top.  So the 
link has been made.  It was not made by me.  It was made by the 
prime minister, the PMO having absolutely direct political party 
activities begging for money for the campaign.  I think it is 
wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Bloc 
motion which condemns the attitude of the government in that it 
refused to introduce complete reform of legislation on the 
financing of federal political parties, even though the existing 
legislation allows for a wide range of abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the substance of the debate I wish to take 
this opportunity, my first opportunity, to thank the constituents 
and the voters of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for electing me to 
this assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted for me in the majority because they felt the work I 
was doing was important to them and to our country.  I 
acknowledge their support over the last four years, in particular 
in the last election, that returned me to this assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pledged during the campaign to work hard on their behalf to 
make sure that their voices were heard in parliament.  I will 
continue to do that as long as I am a member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to take this opportunity to thank the workers in my 
constituency who worked hard for me, those who put up signs and 
made political contributions to my campaign.  I would like to 
extend my appreciation to my family who sacrificed a fair amount 
of time, energy and money to see me re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we have before is a very important one.  It is on the 
floor of the House of Commons because of developments in Quebec 
where there were suggestions or allegations of influence 
peddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a first.  We have seen allegations and actually 
substantive proof and convictions in other provinces of influence 
peddling and of patronage, whether it is constituency patronage 
or politicians doing things for money provided to them by sources 
other than the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP believe the regulations which govern party 
financing in Canada are like hunting dogs that will not hunt. 
They are there but they do not do the job they were intended to 
do.  We believe there must be extensive reform in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen across the country, in particular in Quebec lately, 
a practice in backroom politics called tollgating.  Tollgating is 
when a company is either on a list to bid for contracts or is 
actually receiving government contracts and is visited by a bag 
person.  They used to be called bagmen.  We call them bag 
persons. The bag person points out that the company received a 
contract from the government and now it wants a contribution for 
its political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of politics is bad politics in Canada.  It is bad 
politics anywhere.  It is frontier politics that have not seen 
the light of day very frequently except for Quebec recently.  We 
have seen examples in Nova Scotia and in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is not the only guilty one.  The Conservatives 
were very guilty of these practices in the past.  As a matter of 
fact we have a Reform member of Parliament, the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain, who was a member of the former 
Conservative Party and Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. 
Some 20 Saskatchewan MLAs that governed the province of 
Saskatchewan have either been charged or convicted on practices 
that are unacceptable to public and party financing and for other 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is guilty.  The Conservatives and the Liberals 
are guilty of influence peddling, tollgating and doing all sorts 
of illegal things with respect to people's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even have former members of the Socred Party who would know 
what this is all about because they practised it in B.C.  Now 
they belong to the Reform Party.  We also have members from the 
Western Canada Concept Party who are now members of the Reform 
Party that do the same sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want these issues on the floor of the House of Commons to be 
transparent.  We want political party financing to be changed so 
that it is transparent and open; so that constituency patronage 
and regional patronage end; and so that tollgating and other such 
issues end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  Would you ask the member to be intellectually 
honest in the connections he makes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a deprecation of the quality of debate in the House to 
hear him talk like that.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not point of 
order.  I ask the hon. member to continue the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, members will know that 
political parties were originally established to advocate ideas 
based on principle.  They are tied together as political parties 
on the basis of principle.  We put forward the world view on 
issues important to people who support our particular 
philosophies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members who are chirping from their seats are 
concerned about being brought into this debate.  They have track 
records with respect to some of the issues before the House 
today.  It reminds me of the old saying that when you throw a 
rock in the dark and a dog barks, you hit a dog.  I think we have 
a problem here.  I think the Reform is barking because it has 
been hit with the same allegations as the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a political process that is still tied to the old slogan 
of he who pays the piper calls the tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes there must be an inclusive, fair, transparent 
political contribution system to include as many people as 
possible in our democracy.  In a certain way we are on the right 
track.  We have a political tax credit system which includes 
average, ordinary Canadians.  They can contribute money to a 
political party and obtain a tax break on their income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think there must be an extension of that system.  There has 
to be a ceiling of contributions from businesses and other 
organizations so that he who pays the piper indeed calls the 
tune.  We want Canadians to pay politicians.  We want Canadians 
to be involved in supporting political parties so that we are 
accountable to the taxpayers and not to the banks or the oil 
companies that now run the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government must be the balance to the economic powers that run 
our economy.  The Liberals, the Reform and the Conservatives all 
believe they should be funded by huge corporations so they can 
continue to tip the balance against ordinary Canadians and in 
favour of the large corporations that run our economy already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to provide some evidence with respect to what I say on he 
who pays the piper calls the tune.  We are not only talking about 
tollgating, influence peddling and political patronage on a 
riding or regional basis.  We are also talking more insidiously 
about political parties financed by corporations doing their 
bidding in the House of Commons on issues that hurt Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example is the banks.  In 1996 the banks gave a total 
of $544,000 plus to the Liberal Party.  What does this mean?  We 
can look at the bank tax rates, the bank services charges and 
their flexibility in charging interest rates to their customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank Act, passed by the House of Commons and supported by 
the finance committee made up of Liberals, Reform members and 
former Conservative members, allows banks to do whatever they 
want.  Why?  It is because $544,000 in 1996 went from the banks 
and other financial institutions to the Liberal Party.  The 
Reform only received about $68,000.  Obviously Reform bag persons 
were not doing their jobs.  They have been doing the bidding of 
the banks since 1993 when they came to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised the issue of energy pricing and fair gasoline 
pricing.  The Liberals, the Reform and the Conservatives opposed 
it.  Why?  It was because the oil companies contribute to their 
parties.  They support the big oil companies.  Imperial Oil is 
owned 70% by Exxon in the States.  They do the bidding for 
Imperial Oil, Shell Oil and all other huge corporations. This is 
patronage.  It is political influence peddling.  It is worse. 
The NDP oppose that 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder why Bill C-91, the drug patent legislation, has not 
been changed.  We wonder why the Reform and Liberals embrace huge 
international pharmaceuticals in gouging Canadians on 
prescription drugs prices.  It is because they get huge 
contributions of $26,000 from Merck Frosst and $33,000 from 
Glaxo.  That is patronage and political party fund raising at 
their absolute worst.

are here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, some things never change in life.  I have been 
here a long time and a politician in British Columbia a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP get up in the House to talk about other 
parties.  They talk about how nice and clean they are and how 
pure they are.  Obviously the member has never read a paper from 
British Columbia or looked at what happened to his government in 
British Columbia, the New Democratic Party government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who sat in this House who were members of that 
government were under investigation on charges of abusing public 
funds, the Commonwealth Nanaimo federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They used to fund all their constituency moneys through one 
account and run their bingo games, all for charity.  It was 
fraudulent and they will pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we are debating this issue in the House 
today.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the attitude of the government, which 
refuses to introduce in-depth reform of the legislation on the 
financing of federal political parties even though the existing 
legislation allows for a wide range of abuses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties in the House set down the regulations.  We all go 
through the same list.  When anyone donates more than $100 to any 
of us it is recorded and listed.  Anybody can get the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people who made the abuses by offering to peddle 
influence are guilty and are charged, they will go to jail.  If 
any member gets involved, it is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to label everybody in parliament with going out at 
election time to raise money and maybe buy political favours with 
it is very unfortunate in the Parliament of Canada.  It is a 
disgrace to the Parliament of Canada that people make these kinds 
of speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The truth hurts, doesn't it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  They yell out from the NDP side that 
the truth hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the list of donators.  I do not mind.   People 
phoned me yesterday from my riding.  I had calls from newspaper 
reporters.  Obviously the lists of contributions to members are 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question they asked me was about donations to the New 
Democratic Party member.  They said he got $8,000 from the union. 
I said that was too bad.  They should have thought better of him 
and given him a lot more because he is a good New Democratic 
Party member.  He works for MacMillan Bloedel and he was a very 
credible candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that a union can give $8,000 but MacMillan Bloedel 
cannot give that to a free enterprise candidate?  The public has 
a right to know and it is there.  Anybody can look at the 
statements of any member of the House that were filed by October 
2. If anybody has any shame it is just too bad for them.  That is 
the way our system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a democratic system where people have a right to make 
donations to the candidate and the party of their choice.  I hope 
that never changes.  NDP members might like to see that change. 
Because of the way they talk about how they would run the 
country, not too many corporations would give them money. 
Corporations large or small would not want to give them any money 
because they would not do the country any good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the province of British Columbia which has a New 
Democratic Party government.  I am sure its members will not get 
too many contributions from business because they are ruining 
business in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way the system works.  I think it is a good system. 
We take donations.  We declare who they are and the public has a 
right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the odd time we have a problem like we have across there 
right now, the police will solve the problem sooner or later.  If 
anybody in the government is involved in it, they will pay the 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is a good system.  It is a democratic system.  I find 
it very strange New Democrats do not like the system.  They sat 
on the committee that set out the rules.  Now they want to change 
the rules again.  They are a lot different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran in 1972 and 1974 we did not have to declare any names 
at all.  We just took in the money and spent it. There were no 
limits on spending.  That was not fair.  It kept many people who 
wanted to run for the House of Commons from getting here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were good committees of the House that sat and worked very 
hard.  The members of the New Democratic Party sat on the 
committee and recommended the changes we are living under now. 
It is unfortunate they had to get up in the House and try to turn 
this motion around to make it look bad.  It hurts everyone in 
Parliament.  It is fine for them to question the government, but 
they should not knock the parliamentary system.  Their party was 
involved in setting down the rules.  They are good rules and we 
should stick with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to 
the member by saying that since the last time he was a member in 
the House of Commons things have changed a fair amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who is now a member of the Reform Party changes his 
politics like a dirty shirt.  He was a Conservative member of 
Parliament.  He was a member of the Social Credit Party of 
British Columbia.  He was a good friend of Bill Van der Zalm, 
that upstanding fundraiser.  He was a good friend of Bill 
Bennett, that upstanding fundraiser who has been before the 
courts for the last 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now he is a member of the Reform Party. I wonder what he will 
bring to the Reform Party in terms of integrity, in terms of 
fundraising, in terms of cleaning up the system which exists now, 
which quite frankly is not in tune with contemporary politics and 
contemporary thinking in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying to the House of Commons and to the people of 
Canada that the system we have now which provides financing to 
political parties has to be revisited.  It has to be cleaned up. 
Here is an opportunity which was provided to us by the Bloc. I 
congratulate the Bloc for the motion.  I believe all members 
should focus on it and work toward that objective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate that this is my maiden speech in 
the House.  I would like to give the mandatory congratulations to 
you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay tribute and express my thanks to the people 
of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for entrusting in me this very 
sacred responsibility.  I certainly will endeavour to represent 
the people of my constituency in the province of Nova Scotia with 
vigour, honesty and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those words I must say that it is with some regret that I 
rise to speak on the issue which is before the House.  I want to 
indicate that I am in support of the motion which has been 
brought forward by the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at the origin of this debate. I want to 
give thanks to our Conservative member for Richmond—Arthabaska 
for his hard and diligent work in bringing this matter to the 
forefront. I also pay tribute to members of the Bloc and the 
Reform Party for having the good sense to join us in this open 
debate concerning government accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stench of corruption that now hangs over this government is 
something which we have to deal with in a very timely and 
effective manner.  This stench exists because of questions 
surrounding the relationship of ministers of this government and 
their departmental information and agents of the Liberal Party of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that campaign fundraising activities are no 
longer shrouded in obscurity.  Because of the outright refusal of 
the government to deal with the simple, straightforward questions 
that have been posed to it on the floor of the House of Commons, 
we have this sudden shroud and feeling of insecurity on the part 
of people both inside and outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that the government is moving in the direction 
of accountability and responsibility.  These are not just words 
that are thrown around lightly.  I am afraid to say it—and I 
think we are all aware of the fact—but there is a great deal of 
cynicism in the general public, a growing cynicism about 
political practices.  That is why I stress the importance of the 
timeliness of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska and I were asking earlier 
this week what the government has done.  What has the government 
done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development we know filed his 
concerns and complaint with the RCMP back in March.  He did that 
to ensure, and rightly so, that the practices were not going to 
continue. However since that time, the question has been posed 
repeatedly by members of all parties:  What else did the 
government do? Simply reporting it is not enough.  I would stress 
the importance of the government's responsibility to do something 
more than simply bring this to the attention of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions which we have posed in the House of Commons have 
been repeatedly answered with the old chestnut “It is under 
investigation and we cannot comment.  We cannot interfere”. 
At no time are we asking the solicitor general or any member, any 
minister of the crown to actually interfere.  We are asking for 
answers about what they did subsequent to the reporting and what 
other assurances the House has that the practice will not 
continue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former crown prosecutor I do agree with the line that the 
government should not directly partake in an RCMP investigation. 
That is standard and it is not something we are suggesting. 
However Canadians do have a right to know whether their 
government did act properly in response to the allegations that 
are before the Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is in a different position than members of the 
opposition, a distinctly different position in the fact that it 
has direct control over where government funding is directed. 
This is what is at the very root of this question.  Was 
government information used for the purposes of a political 
party's fundraising activities? These are the answers we are 
probing for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, due to the response and the patent answers that 
we are receiving from the government, the issue has now expanded 
and goes far beyond the boundaries of the province of Quebec and 
I would suggest far beyond the boundaries of only the Liberal 
Party of Canada. As has been suggested by members of all parties, 
none of us are squeaky clean in this. There is unfortunately a 
history in the House of parties of all political stripes being 
tainted by allegations.  This again ties into the issue of having 
more openness, more accountability and more responsibility when 
it comes to the issue of political fundraising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again with respect to the specific issue that has been on 
everyone's mind of late, we are looking for information about 
ministers of the crown who accompany fundraisers.  Mr. Corbeil is 
the one name that seems to have garnered a lot of attention. 
However we have information to suggest that there may be others. 
These are the questions we are asking.  Because of the shrouded 
responses we are receiving, the issue has gone far afield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity to set the record straight on 
this issue and perhaps put the issue to rest but it has not done 
so.  It has made no attempt to do that.  People need to know if 
ministers of the crown continued to employ individuals without 
any sanction knowing that these individuals were under an RCMP 
investigation. And while under investigation, were these same 
individuals provided with confidential government information for 
the purposes of political fundraising.  This no doubt is what is 
at the root of the RCMP investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some references made to the fact that the 
investigation is nearing its end. One can only hope that this is 
the case and that there will be no delay or interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and the commissioner were advised of this a long time 
ago. Six months ago they were made aware of that.  The question 
we asked last week was whether the Clerk of the Privy Council was 
also advised of this to ensure the integrity of the government 
and to ensure the integrity of cabinet discussions.  That is not 
undue interference. That is called government accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paraphrase the prime minister's recent comments in the House, 
it is high time that this government put up or shut up on this 
issue.  This is the same government that has promised 
transparency and integrity in bringing its matters before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals promised to bring about integrity by 
appointing an independent ethics counsellor to be accountable to 
Parliament.  They promised stricter guidelines so that the 
government appointments would be based on merit and ability. They 
promised tougher regulations of lobbyists.  Each and every one of 
these promises has not been fulfilled and to this date I would 
suggest they have been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals also promised to close loopholes in campaign 
finance laws. That has not happened. The activities and the 
government's response prove that these loopholes still exist and 
that these loopholes are large enough to drive large kickbacks 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as we would like to dwell on the history of political 
fundraising abuses, I am more interested in getting to the root 
of the problem and trying to fix the problems associated with the 
current system.  The reality is that fundraising is the mother's 
milk of political activity.  The time has long since passed to 
open a meaningful and real dialogue that will bring integrity, 
transparency and accountability, not just these bold words but 
the reality of these words to this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This House and every member of it have been tainted with this 
particular scandal.  It is high time that we got to the bottom of 
it.  My friend in the Reform Party referenced the fact that the 
NDP members themselves have been tainted by bingo-gate and 
raising money that was supposed to be going to charitable 
organizations.  The leader of the Reform Party himself was 
alleged to have dipped into secret trust funds and expense 
accounts for trips, clothes and a private pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Bloc, who is now the current Bloc House 
leader, saw nothing wrong with granting taxpayer funded severance 
packages to former staffers who then quit to go to another 
political venue in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has baggage as well.  I am not going to 
dwell on that because everybody else has certainly beat that one 
to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would suggest is what we have done in our party. We have 
consulted extensively with our membership.  We have had workshops 
and conferences in all the provinces and the territories.  We 
have been united in the need and the cause for accountability and 
transparency collectively in the use of management funds.  We 
have consulted with our members and we have acted on 
recommendations and have enshrined a better degree of 
accountability and communication measures between our PC Canada 
fund and the local constituency associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have broadened and opened public dialogue and we have done 
this for the sole purpose for what this House itself is now 
trying to do.  We are not going through simple machinations.  We 
are trying to get this matter brought forward for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is a public rather than a private process.  The 
standards applied for public fundraising must be given proper 
scrutiny.  As parliamentarians let us restore the lost public 
confidence in our political parties and the democratic process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood—Assiniboine, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to say thank you to the new member who just 
spoke.  He reminds me of his father.  I was here when his father 
was here.  In fact his father was here a good many years before I 
arrived in 1988.  His father left his mark on this institution. 
He made an enormous contribution and I am sure that his son will 
do exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on a couple of things that he did say.  In the 
period of the existence of Canada and going back to 1861, I 
suppose every political party has been tarnished and sullied by a 
financial scandal of one kind or another.  It certainly does not 
bring honour to this institution and certainly does not bring 
honour to politicians.  It concerns all Canadians.  I think all 
of us are very concerned when we hear allegations of financial 
scandal, influence peddling and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that concerns me about the debate that is 
taking place today is that I smell a bit of a witch hunt.  I was 
in opposition once too and this kind of an issue lends itself to 
all kinds of serious questions as to where we are going and is 
the world coming to an end.  Most of the questions are very 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we should keep in mind is that the RCMP 
as far as I know have not yet completed the investigation. As far 
as I know they were told back in the month of March and yes, that 
is a few months ago.  I am not a policeman so I do not know how 
long it takes police agencies to investigate this kind of an 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However before we go off the deep end and make all kinds of 
assumptions, particularly that the government has wronged and 
wronged, why do we not just wait for the investigation?  I can 
assure the hon. member who just spoke that if the RCMP find in 
their wisdom, and if it is confirmed by a court later that there 
was influence peddling, I will be as concerned as he is, and I 
should be.  But why do we not wait until the RCMP investigation 
is finished?  It seems to me that in itself will answer some of 
the questions.  It may raise some other ones later on and we may 
have to shore up the system that we have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the member from British Columbia who spoke a 
few minutes ago.  I do not think the system is perfect, but I do 
not think it is as rotten as perhaps some other speakers have 
suggested.  All I suggest is we just hold on to our hats and wait 
for some of these answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there can be a lot of impatience but let us wait for the 
answers.  I am absolutely convinced, because I think I know the 
prime minister very well, that if this investigation leads to 
some serious allegations by the police and if someone is found 
guilty there will be things done to correct the system.  No 
political party can tolerate this and certainly the voters in 
Canada cannot expect to tolerate this for a minute, if this kind 
of thing did indeed happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must thank and acknowledge 
the remarks of the member opposite in reference to my father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not take issue with the fact that the integrity of this 
House is something we should all value and something we have to 
put a great deal of emphasis on.  I do take some exception to the 
indignation that the member opposite expresses with respect to 
due process and the presumption of innocence when it was the hon. 
member's own party that initiated a witch hunt far across the 
ocean in a foreign land that involved a former prime minister. 
There was very little reasonable and probable grounds.  This is 
very ironic given the fact that we now have allegations involving 
the party opposite. There seems to be a bit of a contradiction 
there in terms of how the approach is taken when it is an 
opposition party as opposed to a government party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question we all want to get to the bottom of this, 
that due process has to kick in and that we need time for the 
RCMP to complete its investigation.  We understand that is coming 
soon.  Let us not have any further delay.  There was an initial 
reporting in March.  Six months have passed.  Let us be open and 
honest about this.  Let us find out what is really rotten in the 
state of Denmark.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in today's debate on the financing of 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first, since this is my maiden speech in this new 
Parliament, I want to take 30 seconds to thank the constituents 
of Témiscamingue for renewing their trust in me and tell them I 
will do my best to represent them adequately during this 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now beginning a new Parliament and it reminds me of what 
happened when we started out in 1993.  One of the first things 
discussed in the House was the cancellation of the contract for 
the construction of a terminal at Pearson airport, which aroused 
a lot of suspicion and brought forth allegations of traffic 
peddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claridge and Paxport were two companies that were mentioned. The 
people involved, who enjoyed close ties with the old traditional 
parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives—or the Conservatives and 
the Liberals, if you prefer—allegedly filled their pockets with 
compensation money paid directly by cabinet. The whole process was kept 
as obscure as possible so they could reward their political friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, at the beginning of this new Parliament, an important issue 
is resurfacing: the Liberal Party is accused of influence peddling and 
of using lists that may have been obtained from influential ministers in 
this government. These allegations of influence peddling are extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some factors must be considered. We must look at the causes. If you 
examine the way federal political parties are financed, you will 
immediately understand what caused the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no limit to how much money companies can give. Do you 
sincerely believe that any major bank who makes a $100,000 contribution 
to a political party does it without ulterior motives? Or do they do it 
to maintain good relations and establish contacts? Those people are not 
philanthropists. They do not give to appease their social conscience.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributions are made mainly to the Liberal Party and the 
Conservative Party, especially when they are in power. Is this a 
coincidence? Contributions get bigger when those people are in power. It 
is easy to see that there is a direct link. Several times in the last 
Parliament, we in this party suggested amending legislation on the 
financing of political parties in order to adapt it to a more modern 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you about a discussion I had with one of your 
colleagues after the 1993 election. 
As we were travelling for a parliamentary committee, he told me 
the following: “when I was asked to be a candidate for the 
Liberal Party, I was told, first, to raise $50,000 and, second, 
to sign up 1,000 members”.  He told me that this requirement was 
impossible to fulfil. I told him that he was right, that it was 
not easy to raise $50,000. And he replied, “No, no, I am talking 
about the 1,000 members.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, those people say they enjoy grassroots support. It is not 
easy to raise money at $5, $10, or $20 a head but this reminds us 
of a hard reality. When you knock on a door to ask for a donation 
of $10 or $20, the people who answer are tempted to say what they 
truly think about politicians, politics and the government's 
actions. This forces us to stay in touch with the people. But as 
we can see, membership is something these people find 
embarrassing.  Money is no problem. Fifty thousand dollars, 
especially in the Toronto area, is not very difficult to collect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reflect seriously on this situation. Today, I heard other 
political parties, other members say that we should indeed examine the 
situation. But obviously, on the government side, they want to avoid any 
debate, to divert it with details or to look at a different aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back on what is happening. The allegations in 
question are very serious and appear increasingly well founded as we 
learn more about the involvement of a Liberal Party activist who was 
able to approach companies with confidential information. It is not true 
that information on projects under study or in the process of being 
approved can be obtained by anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only some of us are consulted because of the dubious practices in 
some ridings. In my case, it is true that we are consulted on the 
approval of projects tied to the transitional job creation fund. But 
when I am consulted, my office does not consider this information to be 
public. I checked with officials from the Department of Human Resources 
Development in my riding and they do not consider this information to be 
public either. The same applies to the Société québécoise du 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre, which is also involved; it does not 
consider that to be public information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the Minister responsible for the Treasury Board 
estimates that this information can be made public, that it is normal 
for it to be released? Is the same thing in all other departments? 
In Quebec it is known that the federal Office of Quebec Regional 
Development is very often an extension of the Liberal party in 
certain regions.  Do these people also provide privileged 
information on the applications under study, the loans from various 
government bodies to businesses in the region in order to ensure 
that the Liberal party bag man passes by right afterward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to describe 
the situation.  One of the four businesses mixed up in the present 
situation and under investigation by the RCMP is the Raglan mining 
company located in my riding. It met with the gentleman in 
question, Pierre Corbeil of the Liberal party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review the approval process on the amount obtained from 
the transitional job fund.  We know that this company was awarded 
$1.3 million for an extremely important mining development in 
northern Quebec, one that is extremely beneficial to the people of 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue in general and one that will have major 
economic impact.  Today, that company finds itself tainted by 
association, because of a Liberal party fundraiser, and because of 
information leaked to him by someone with access to it, which has 
complicated things enormously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  The matter was approved by the local human 
resources development administration on January 22, 1997.  Six 
days later, on January 28, it was given approval by the regional 
Société québécoise du développement de la main-d'oeuvre.  It was 
then passed on to Montreal, because the Canadian department of 
human resources development projects have to be approved in 
Montreal by Quebec division.  On January 30, therefore, it was 
also sent to the Société québécoise du développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre's head office.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 17, a letter of approval from the MP was added to the 
file, in occurrence the letter I wrote to back the project, and it would 
appear that a very important meeting took place on February 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 7, the Minister of Human Resources Development approved 
the project, and on March 21 the SQDM or Quebec manpower development 
board issued a similar positive recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder why the minister, who claims to be waiting for the 
SQDM's opinion before going ahead, gave his approval prior to receiving 
it. This is somewhat puzzling, but it might be justified under certain 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on February 25, a date I want to come back to, what 
happened? Pierre Corbeil, from the Liberal Party, went knocking on the 
door of the Société minière Raglan and met with one of its executives, 
asking him for a contribution, a cash contribution, which does not 
appear anywhere and cannot be traced, to get the project through the 
maze of the government's backrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blackmailing a firm into contributing money to a political party in 
exchange for a grant is unacceptable. Such practices should never be 
condoned in our society. I hope my colleague from Abitibi, who is from 
the same area as I am, agrees with me and is going to condemn this 
practice by a Liberal Party organizer named Pierre Corbeil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many questions remain unanswered, and because my time is running 
out, I would like to mention them before concluding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did people from the Liberal Party of Canada in our area directly or 
indirectly take part in these practices, were they in contact with Mr. 
Corbeil, did they also share this information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps Mr. Corbeil did not come to our area simply to make this 
one and only intervention. Some questions are still unanswered. Who 
provided the list? Who provided the information to Mr. Corbeil in the 
particular case of the Raglan mining company? Who provided him with this 
information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I will not be accused of providing it to him, but someone 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still unanswered questions about these lists. I hope the 
RCMP will be able to do its work freely and to arrive at some 
conclusions that will be extremely important and that will certainly 
implicate people who are very close to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say it is unacceptable for a so-called 
democratic society to tolerate such blackmail, to tolerate the existence 
of a patronage system—I repeat, a patronage system—within the 
government and the defaming of proud people who help build our regions 
and do not deserve to find themselves in the middle of such a 
controversy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to praise my distinguished colleague, the young member for 
Témiscamingue, for his skill as a speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I jokingly asked the new Liberal member for Abitibi, who sits next 
to my colleague who just spoke, and who sat in this House for nine years 
with his former colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party but 
has now changed vehicle—he bought a red car to get elected—I asked him 
if they use the same fundraising methods as those he employed when he 
was a Tory.  He said: It is the same, except the cheques have changed 
colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see how candid the member for Abitibi is; he says the 
method is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal Party is in such a mess right now, it is because 
of its tradition of scheming.  What disturbs me most however is 
that now they ask for cash.  They no longer accept certified 
cheques.  They ask for cash and they say: “Just shut up, or you 
won't get your grant”.  Unfortunately, that is what we have come 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will remember Gérald Martineau from the Union nationale.  He 
was quite something.  In his days, all contractors who could get 
a contract from the Quebec government had to increase the price 
they would normally ask by 10% because Gérald Martineau was to 
receive 10% of all contracts.  It  was standard practice.  At 
that time, the Liberals strongly condemned that practice.  But 
now, we have a similar system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Témiscamingue to tell us if, in his region, 
only one mine or only one industry was approached.  He was very clear. 
He invited the public to put the question to the Liberal members, to ask 
them if they knew some people from the Liberal Party in his region. He 
even sought help from his neighbour, the new member for Abitibi, so we 
could get some names.  However, I am convinced that the member for 
Témiscamingue could shed some light on the issue or could ask a more 
precise question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my hon. 
colleague's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will give me an opportunity to be more specific. Mr. Corbeil, 
who was referred to earlier, is an organizer for the Liberal 
Party of Canada. He arrived in our region shortly before a 
Liberal convention. Were those seeking the nomination at the time 
informed of the situation by Mr. Corbeil?  That is one question. 
Were the individuals looking to run under the Liberal Party 
banner in our region involved in this fundraising scheme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of whether this was an isolated case. 
One company was kind enough to notify the minister and complain 
about a practice it found unacceptable.  I applaud that company's 
courage in deciding to make such a move under the circumstances, 
because we must not forget that its application had not been 
approved yet.  It took a chance by complaining to the minister 
about the harassment it had been subjected to and about what was 
a rather questionable practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about asking for cash donations, which cannot be 
traced. In the words of a former minister, there could be no 
paper trail. They asked for cash because they did not want any 
connection to be made between the favours granted and the 
contributions collected by the Liberal Party. Nobody is fooled by 
what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying there are questions being raised that 
need to be answered. I hope that this situation can be cleared up in the 
local Liberal associations, where individual candidates may have been 
involved as part of the nomination process. I hope they were not 
involved, but it is up to them to provide answers. Everyone from our 
region who is watching the debate today will have noticed something. Our 
Liberal colleague, the hon. member for Abitibi, who is in the House 
today, did not speak on this issue. He remained silent and his silence 
speaks volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He's gone all quiet on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is it a practice in the 
opposition to remark on the presence of another member in this 
House? We all know that under the Standing Orders we are not to 
make such comments, but I am pleased he mentioned that I am here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it astonishing that a former member of the House is not familiar 
with the Standing Orders.  I find this strange, since the hon. member 
has been a member of this House for nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I will proceed directly to the motion by 
the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  I will use my brief 10-minute 
speech to describe the vision that haunts me when I put the terms 
“transparency” and “Liberal Party of Canada” together.  It is 
certainly not the most appealing image and that is why I want 
listeners to know right off the bat that I intend to be very 
critical but realistic in my remarks. This is the sad price 
people must pay when hoping to gain more insight into the 
government they are dealing with today and, unfortunately, for a 
few years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over a week now, members have been trying to shed light on this 
dark side of the Liberal Party organization and, more specifically, the 
federal government.  For over a week now, members of each of the 
opposition parties, particularly the Bloc Quebecois, have been trying to 
find out about this transitional fund scandal in the last election. 
Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister has decided to dodge the 
embarrassing issue and take refuge behind the RCMP investigation.  No 
matter, the Bloc Quebecois is there to ask the real questions and that 
is why we are presenting today an opposition motion on this extremely 
important matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than go all over what has already been said by the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois or other Bloc members who have taken part in the 
debate, I am going to denounce once again the unhealthy situation in 
which the Liberals have landed themselves.  Indeed, who would not do a 
double take on hearing of certain odd doings like those engaged in by 
organizers of the Liberal Party of Canada, who had the lists of grant 
applications in their possession before they had even been approved? 
These are confidential lists.  Who would not protest when we know that 
these same lists were used to blackmail potential contributors to the 
coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada?  Could that be described as 
democratic?  Nothing could be more ethical, we might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at the issue of ethics, which I deeply care about 
and worked very hard for during the 35th Parliament. We discussed the 
famous Liberal code of conduct on several occasions in this House. 
Originally, the code was supposed to restore the government's integrity 
and image. This instrument has definitely, and unfortunately, not been 
overused. The Liberals were so concerned about projecting a positive 
image that they forgot that a code of ethics is not a makeup kit. Its 
primary purpose is to deal with conduct related issues that can hinder 
the proper operation of our democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Liberals do not use their code often, assuming they 
even know it. The scandal surrounding transitional funds shows without 
any doubt that the Liberals tricked us when they drafted this phoney 
code. How can the government claim to be acting in compliance with a 
code of ethics when it stubbornly keeps on its payroll people who are 
said to have deliberately tried to corrupt entrepreneurs for the sole 
purpose of bringing money into the party's coffers? Why was Pierre 
Corbeil not immediately suspended? Why is Jacques Roy, an assistant to 
the President of the Treasury Board, still working for the government in 
spite of the fact that his actions are currently under investigation? 
Mr. Roy is still working for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  He is the scapegoat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B>  And what about the Prime Minister's 
statements to the effect that the code of conduct does not apply 
to the Liberal Party of Canada, but only to the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  Outrageous! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B>  If I understood the Prime Minister 
correctly, what a minister cannot do because of the code of 
conduct, he has his staff or political organizers do it. It is 
just terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I get the impression they are laughing at us, that some 
members opposite are trying to fool the public. How can the Prime 
Minister suggest that the Liberal Party and the government are so much 
at arm's length when ministers of the Crown give confidential 
information on subsidies to Liberal bagmen? That shows that ethics is a 
consideration for Liberals only when it suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What became of the nice principles they were so proud of in the red 
book? If I had time, I would go through the list of the irregularities 
the Liberals have done during the 35th Parliament. We already have a 
pretty long list after only a few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen this week is but the tip of the iceberg. How can 
you explain that the Prime Minister did not issue a directive on an 
ethical conduct to his ministers after the Minister of Human Resources 
Development informed him of the RCMP investigation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could anybody believe that the Liberal government made such 
an omission because it cares so much about the ethics guidelines. 
What are we to make of the fact that the Solicitor General of 
Canada, who is in charge of the mounted police, like the Prime 
Minister calls them—somebody ought to tell him that it is now 
called the RCMP—was the only cabinet minister who did not know 
the Liberal Party of Canada was being investigated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we explain the long delay between March 1997, when the 
scandal was discovered, and the search in the premises of the Liberal 
Party of Canada on June 12, 1997, just a few days after the government 
was re-elected? Something smells funny in all this! 
Perhaps there would have been a different public reaction on June 
2, and perhaps the government would not be where it is today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to believe, and this is an extremely important question 
the public is asking today, that no government minister was aware 
that a certain Mr. Corbeil, a Liberal party staffer, was collecting 
funds at $25,000 a shot?  Do you think that no one in that 
government was aware of it? Come on!  Everyone knows that within 
the very organization of the Liberal party, they knew what was 
going on. They knew the Corbeil fellow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these facts, we are saying that it would have been 
in the Liberal government's best interest to respond favourably to 
the Bloc Quebecois invitation, when it proposed the creation of 
legislation on the public funding of political parties.  Adoption 
of such an act would, of course, have had repercussions on the 
millions in the Liberal Party coffers which come from multinational 
corporations and various lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that would have been the lesser evil, considering that our 
entire democratic system would have benefited in future from 
funding from party members and supporters. Passing such legislation 
would have made it easier for the famous ethics I speak of so often 
to find a place in our federal political mores.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I can already hear those opposite saying that the member 
for Berthier-Montcalm is totally unaware that they have an ethics 
commissioner even.  Let us talk about this ethics commissioner.  I 
was involved when the position was created, but the government 
opposite completely disregarded the remarks and requests of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner is not independent, since he is appointed by 
the Prime Minister, advises the Prime Minister on the sly, on a 
confidential basis, and has no say in decisions.  I therefore have 
little to say for the ethics commissioner, because, between you and 
me, he is not very good at his job and is certainly the 
government's accomplice in keeping silent on a number of matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial weeks of the new Parliament have revealed the true 
face of this patronage government with its taste for light ethics. 
Everything is permitted—from dubious practices to partisan 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have little time left and since I am the 
justice critic, I cannot resist raising the latest and most 
offensive of this government's patronage appointments, while we are 
on the subject of dubious practices and partisan appointments.  I 
am referring to the appointment of the new justice to the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  This appointment of Michel Bastarache is the 
worst of the government's political appointments.   He was 
appointed a justice of the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is Michel Bastarache?  A former colleague in the law firm 
where the Prime Minister did his Liberal Party of Canada purgatory. 
He is a good friend of the Liberal Party of Canada.  He was part of 
a firm that gave thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party of 
Canada in its funding drive.  Michel Bastarache's appointment is 
one of the worst the government opposite has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst of it all is that I heard the Prime Minister himself 
say he did not know Michel Bastarache.  I would remind him that the 
signature on the preface to the book written by Mr. Bastarache in 
1986 was that of Jean Chrétien. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask my distinguished colleague, the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, to go back in time and tell us about the nine years 
that preceded the arrival in office of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, the hon. member for Abitibi must have known former member 
Richard Grisé, who was president of the Conservative caucus in Quebec 
and who, like several other Conservative ministers and members at the 
time, must have been implicated in scandals as shameful as the one which 
the Liberal Party has been covering up for two weeks already.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska, who, as the 
former mayor of Asbestos, presided over the destiny of his RCM's 
economic development corporation, dared mention in this House the 
dubious actions of the Liberal Party. The worst in all this is—and I 
ask the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm to comment on this—that it 
is not surprising to see fundraiser Pierre Gobeil demand cash 
contributions. Was part of the $50,000 or $25,000 he collected in 
Drummondville or in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region going to the party, 
with the rest going somewhere else? Sometimes, there are potholes along 
the way and it is necessary to patch up here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very strange that a fundraiser for the Liberal Party of 
Canada would demand cash contributions. Worse still, that person even 
went so far as to give advice to the human resources director on how to 
cover up the misappropriation of funds, because this is what it is. It 
is criminal. It is a very serious matter to tell someone how to bill for 
false computer purchases. It is a serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I was listening to the former assistant director 
general, who is the new member for Bourassa.  The member rose and 
pretended to be offended by our comments, but I wonder if, in 
fact, the Liberal Party does not agree. All the opposition 
parties could settle the issue within a week by proposing 
legislation whereby only voters could contribute to a political 
party's fund. The government could give, for example, one dollar 
for each vote received by a party during the previous election, 
to make up for the loss of revenues from major companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Laurent Beaudoin, the president of Bombardier, gives $100,000 
to the Liberal Party—as shown in the ledgers—it is not to get 
$100,000 out of it but hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I would appreciate it if the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm 
could elaborate on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I will attempt to answer 
this question. However, I fear it might take the rest of the afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not give a report on nine years of Tory government since the 
people spoke, very clearly, I believe, in 1993. With the exception of 
two MPs, they were all turfed out of the House of Commons. The message 
could not have been more clear, I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with regard to the present Liberal Party, I remember how 
in 1993 it ran on a platform almost exclusively dedicated to government 
ethics, claiming it was going to change the way things were done, and so 
on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who were crying wolf in 1993 turned into wolves themselves by 
1997. They are even worse than the previous Tories. Day after day we 
hear how the system set up by the Liberals had been planned all along. 
This is what is so revolting. This is the most serious aspect of this 
whole affair. One day we will learn that this is not limited to the 
Department of Human Resources Development, we are of the opinion that 
many other ministers are involved in this kind of practice to get cash.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, what is nice 
about my being here today is that I seem to keep certain members of the 
Bloc Quebecois awake. That is nice. Here is my answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois asks the 
House to condemn the attitude of the government, which refuses to 
introduce in-depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal 
political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide 
range of abuses. They want to talk about party financing? Let us do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I did after reading the motion this morning was to 
visit the library of Parliament. 
I have a few books here. What matters is to understand the process of 
party financing in Canada and Quebec. We all know that, on September 27, 
1994, the hon. member for Richelieu, a member of the Bloc Quebecois, 
presented a motion asking that the government bring in legislation 
limiting solely to individuals the right to donate to a federal 
political party and restricting such donations to a maximum of $5,000 a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that limiting donations solely to individuals 
will actually prevent corporations from making donations by giving 
bonuses or instructions to their employees. Company money may get to a 
political party through its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the party financing system is so effective in Quebec, why did 
the Bloc Quebecois change the amount that can be donated to make it 
higher? 
In Quebec the maximum amount an individual is allowed to donate to 
political parties within any given year is limited to $3,000. They are 
asking for a $5,000 limit. That is twice as much. We have nothing 
against it. What matters today is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If according to Bloc Quebecois policy only individuals are allowed 
to contribute to the financing of political parties, how can the Bloc 
Quebecois justify that, in 1994, candidates for the Bloc Quebecois 
accepted corporate donations amounting to several thousand dollars in 
spite of the fact that their internal regulations preclude it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic), BQ:</B> Madam Speaker, 
with nine years of seniority and after a four year absence to recycle 
himself, the hon. member for Abitibi has changed sides.  He is making 
certain allegations and I want to know the names, the amounts and the 
companies who made contributions.  If he cannot answer these three 
questions, then he should pipe down and go for another makeover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, I knew I was keeping him up.  He 
was asleep a while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards these contributions of several thousands of dollars, I 
cannot give members' names because we are not permitted to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will talk about the 1994 election.  It is all public, and is 
available in every library in Quebec and in Canada. In Charlesbourg, 
they received $1,070; in Drummond, $1,500; in Manicouagan, $485; in 
Laval-Ouest, $2,500; and so forth. I have the whole list.  It is public 
information, my friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> The total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> It must be several thousands, but if I answer 
their questions, I will not be able to go on with my speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> He says $7,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> No it is not, it is $7,939.  It seems he cannot 
count.  There are $939 missing from the Bloc Quebecois figures. That is 
not peanuts. It is a few trips to the grocery store for people in my 
riding. There are $939 missing. Get your math straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They think I was born yesterday. But tell me. What is the use of 
having pearly whites if your nose is dirty? Think about it, my friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need we remind members that the Bloc Quebecois received a cash 
advance of $1.5 million from the Mouvement des caisses populaires 
Desjardins to launch its 1993 election campaign? 
The member for Témiscamingue talked about big banks and contributions, 
but he forgot to mention the caisses populaires in Quebec, $1,5 
million 
from small investors for the Bloc Quebecois's election campaign in 
Quebec.  That is what corporations contributed, that is what the caisses 
populaires contributed.  They have two different discourses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, just like 
some members were saying, you would have to tie him up to get him to 
tell the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. member that there is a difference 
between a contribution and a loan.  I would appreciate it if the hon. 
members were honest in what he says in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, to me a gift or a loan is the 
same thing and they know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget that the Quebec electoral legislation does not 
prevent financing activities where some people often pay in excess of a 
$1,000 to sit close to a minister or an MNA they wish to talk to. This 
is how Daniel Paillé, a former PQ minister, became rich.  That way of 
doing things was also used in $2,000-a-plate dinners attended by the 
likes of Jacques Parizeau, Bernard Landry, Jean Campeau.  These are 
back-door contributions, through attendance at fundraising dinners. 
The Bloc may very well idolize the Quebec legislation, it remains that 
it does not prevent minor and serious violations, like the ones 
committed by Marie Malavoy, a former PQ MNA who contributed to party 
coffers although she was prohibited from doing so by the legislation 
because she had not yet become a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc wants to imply that business contributions could have 
an illegal impact on the allocation of government contracts, we could 
remind them that the Quebec legislation does not prevent the PQ from 
rewarding generously those who contribute to the party or serve its 
cause, and we could give several examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Give us some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> I was hoping you would ask.  All together, now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien: </B>Michel Bastarache. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Take, for example, the famous and pathetic 
episode about the Le Hir reports and the improprieties in the contract 
awarding process.  Parizeau finally admitted, in December 1995, that he 
had known since June 1995 about these things, about the backroom schemes 
for the awarding of contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yvon Cyrenne, one of the Le Hir report authors, gave $900 to the PQ 
in 1994.  Yvon Martineau, who became CEO of Hydro-Québec, contributed 
$1,000 to the PQ fund the year before his appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People really want us to discuss the issue of political party 
contributions.  We can do it.  They want us to speak about Abitibi.  If 
the Bloc members in this House go to the library, they will see my 
campaign expenses in the report of the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada. I was a candidate in Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> In what year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> In 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> For which party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> In 1988.  Madam Speaker, they say I switched 
parties.  I know Lucien Bouchard. He switched parties six times.

times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Brown-nosed chameleon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> It happened twice in my case. I am happy to have 
moved from one political party to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us come back to books and history. What did Guy 
Saint-Julien receive during the 1988 election? Oddly enough, we don't 
hear them talk about their electoral contributions in the last election. 
We don't hear them talk about their expenses and the contributions they 
received. I received $23,870 from 109 donors, and they were only 
individual contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> And companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> None. No company at all. But if I take a look at 
Lac-Saint-Jean, during the same 1988 election, Lucien Bouchard received 
$441,388 from 448 individuals. The political organization made a 
donation of $105. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But something bothers me a little. Lucien Bouchard is a friend of 
mine and I worked part time for three weeks in his riding during an 
election. It's too bad he is now in Quebec because I could have asked 
him to tell me the meaning of “other organizations”. What does that 
mean? Does it come from Zimbabwe, from the United States? He received a 
donation of $41,065. A donation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Aren't you a jealous guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Forty-one thousand dollars for one campaiagn, 
under “other organizations”. They don't even have the decency to 
indicate where it came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien: </B>You were in the government at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien: </B>Madam Speaker, it is true that Quebec was the 
first province in Canada to limit the election expenses of parties and 
candidates and to reimburse candidates for part of their expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They then turned around and said, “One of the innovations in the 
financing of political parties in Quebec concerns the contributions that 
can only be made by voters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Canadian Parliament changed the Canada 
Elections Act provisions on election expenses. This was in accordance 
with the increases in election expenses of all political parties and of 
the Chief Electoral Officer in his statutory reports for 1979, 1980 and 
1983. Essentially, maximum election expenses were raised by 30%. These 
expenses can no longer be incurred by third parties. 
Candidates will have their expenses reimbursed. Under a new scheme, 
political parties will have part of their election expenses reimbursed 
also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have been talking about the hon. member for 
Abitibi several times and the financing of his campaign. It is quite 
true that the public cannot be fooled. People in Quebec and Abitibi will 
not be fooled. But maybe— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> They can keep talking all they want, but I may 
be the first member of this House to talk about the campaign preceding 
the June 2 election. That is not so long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the list of contributions to my campaign. No Bloc 
member could hand me his own list right away. I will give them 60 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> I have mine right here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> We are talking about contributions. I do not 
have a single contribution from mining companies, although we have a 
number of them in my area. The Raglan mining company is located in the 
northern part of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> They make cash contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> The hon. member for Rouyn-Noranda is right when 
he speaks about the Raglan mining company. He is dead right. I know 
Michel Rioux of that company quite well. He is a man of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Madam Speaker, would you please remind the 
hon. member for Abitibi that everything that is being said here is 
recorded in <I>Hansard</I>. He should be more respectful of the truth. He 
should know that the Liberal Party collects cash contributions. When it 
is cash, it goes right into the party coffers, and just about any name 
can be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is probably the reason why there are no mines on his list.

nowadays.  My expenses for the June 2 election have already been 
tabled. There was a deadline.  They have been tabled and if 
anyone wants to see them, they have only to pay for copies from 
the returning officer in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of mines, Madam Speaker, I do not think that that 
person has ever visited Abitibi.  Abitibi covers 802,000 square 
kilometres, and has a population of over 92,000.  It stretches from Val 
d'Or, the mining sector, to the Raglan sector in the east.  The Raglan 
mine is 2,000 miles away.  That is the same distance as from Abitibi to 
Tampa, Florida. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I want to get back to Raglan.  The member for Rouyn-Noranda is 
right.  As I was saying earlier, the head of Raglan, of Falconbridge in 
New Quebec, is Gerry Bilodeau.  I visited that mine in August.  I know 
Michel Rioux very well.  It is regrettable that such things are being 
said in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  We are honest folks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  He can say what he wants, but at least I visit 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving along, a single election does not help much.  Let us go back 
to the 1996 by-election in Lac-Saint-Jean.  The Bloc Quebecois said: 
“We want to do the right thing.  We are for individual contributions. 
Individuals must contribute”.  Their principle is $5,000 and under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it strange that, in the 1996 election, there are no 
contributions from individuals, none.  However, we see:  political 
organizations, $5,000; registered parties, $51,154.  We do not know 
where that money comes from.  We do not know where this $51,000 comes 
from. We do not have the list. It is just a $51,000 contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B>  Be honest, now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  We are. The figures are all available from the 
library.  Ask the Chair.  He is asking me to be honest.  I got this from 
the library this morning.  All the figures are public information, but 
I am not saying they are not dishonest, Madam Speaker.  What I have said 
is the truth for everyone to hear.  That is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Abitibi is waving a piece of paper and he 
claims to be honest. I would ask the unanimous consent of the House for 
the hon. member to table this sheet of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> We do not have unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> On the same point of order, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will table this copy only after I am done with my speech. I will 
not take orders from this House before I am done with my speech. I need 
to refer to my notes.This is a directive from the Bloc Quebecois. I did 
not have the time to finish my speech. I need to refer to those notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They hurt because I am really shaking them up today. I need to 
refer to my notes in order to be able to finish my speech. So, I would 
ask that I be allowed to finish my speech before I have to table my 
notes. I will not need to make another trip to the library. I want to 
save myself some running round.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> We normally let members deliver 
their speech without being interrupted. The member for Abitibi, on 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, I knew you would be impartial. It 
is important to conclude one's speech. I have my notes here and I know 
why the member wanted me to table them immediately. He wanted me to stop 
speaking. Truth is funny, sometimes. The member did not want me to go on 
with my notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in 1996, the numbers for 1996 are in this library book. I 
will tell you what book it is. I have it here and I can even table it. 
It gives the official results. I want to finish with this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know what citation of 
Beauchesne's says so, but there is one that says it is forbidden to use 
props like that during a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The member for Repentigny is 
right, so I ask the member for Abitibi to act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, since I have no right to pick up 
props and show them, I will look at them. Take for example the 1988 
election campaign—my two hands are up, I have nothing up my sleeves 
or under my belt, I have personal papers, I have no pay cheque, but I do 
have a pen in my pocket. Props have been mentioned. The truth comes from 
the library, but I have no right to show it. As for the 1997 campaign, 
everything is public and I could come back on several matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get serious. We are having a bit of fun here. We are in the 
House of Commons, but it is as if we were at a hockey game.  It is true 
that some aspects of financing need to be improved. Quebec has good 
legislation on financing.  Many things can be pointed out, but I will 
never be opposed to improving the financing of political parties and the 
government will never say clearly that it does not want to improve it. 
It will always find new ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to have been able to keep the members of the Bloc 
Québécois opposite, who are defending their ridings, awake.  I want to 
tell you one thing: the people of Abitibi are proud of the fact that I 
am here and I have nothing to hide. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not too 
proud of hearing someone from my region make such a speech and talk so 
much nonsense in so little time. And I doubt the constituents from 
Abitibi are proud to see their representative make such a scene in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before asking my question, I would like to go back over parts of 
the hon. member's speech. First, thank God he is not the Minister 
of Finance. Anyone who cannot differentiate between a loan and a 
donation has a serious problem. A financial institution lending 
money to a political party for a campaign and being paid back 
later certainly is not comparable to a bank making a $500,000 
donation to a political party. Saying that there is no difference 
is either very dishonest or very ignorant.  I will let you decide 
which. It is one or the other, but not both, I hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member spoke about the contributions made in 
Abitibi in 1993.  He declared that he never received contributions from 
businesses. The 1993 election report that was published states that the 
riding of Abitibi received 29 donations, for a total of $9,400.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says he has a large riding to visit. Let us talk about 
his visits to his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take 1993, the last year he was a member of Parliament. In 
general, for the eight years he was a PC member, between 1984 and 1992, 
the highest travelling expenses claimed for the riding were about 
$50,000. That was the highest total claimed in a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, for half a year, from April 1 to one month after election 
day, he claimed $72,749 in travelling expenses. In six months. That is 
a 300% increase over the same period in the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot talk through one's hat here. Some day, the member will 
have to answer for his actions and I can assure you that his 
constituents will know the truth and I will condemn this double talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question: Some reference was made earlier to the Raglan 
Mining Company and we will clarify that, because this is one of the 
companies that is involved because of the Liberal Party and that has 
unfortunately been dragged into a messy situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, does the hon. member for Abitibi denounce this Pierre 
Corbeil's schemes? Does he know him or has he ever met him? Another 
interesting question: Has he been aware of these schemes between the 
Liberal Party he represents and the people at the Raglan Mining Company, 
which is a subsidiary of Falconbridge? He must answer those questions, 
and I ask him to correct all the nonsense he has been saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out a number of things a moment ago: the basic difference 
between a donation and a loan, but also the fact that he said he did not 
get any contribution from companies whereas the list shows the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The least the member should do is tell the House the truth. I am 
not accusing him of doing the opposite. I am giving him a second chance 
to correct things. But he must tell the House the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that I do not feel any pride when I see the 
representative of the area I too represent making such a clown of 
himself in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I understood—and I 
apologize if I am mistaken—the caisses populaires made a contribution 
or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now get back to my expenses for 1993. It is an honour for me 
to tell the people of Abitibi and all Canadians exactly what my expenses 
were. On April 19, 1995— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The member for Repentigny 
has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B>  He is waking up after nine years. He 
probably was in hibernation all that time. I would remind the 
member, who is drawing a pension on top of his salary, that he 
cannot use props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  Madam Speaker, if it is a prop, I am going to 
drop it, but I sure hope I do not have to drop anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his point of order, the member mentioned that I am presently 
drawing a pension as a member of Parliament. Is the member allowed to 
mention that? If so, I would like him to mention the amount of that 
pension because, as a matter of fact, I stopped receiving a pension on 
the evening of June 2. Some of your colleagues to your right and in 
front of you are now receiving two salaries from Quebec, at $36,000 and 
$32,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to my expenses, The amount was made public on April 
19, 1995, on page 19 of La Frontière. The member said $72,000, 
but it was $72,749.18 to be exact.  It is important to give the 
correct figure. July and August is the only time of year one can 
take time away from this House to visit the riding of Abitibi, a 
riding that covers 553,000 square kilometres and that includes 
New Quebec. It is also the safest time to travel in these parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member of the Bloc does know New Quebec. I invite him to come 
and visit that area to understand what New Quebec is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of expenses, I sent a letter to the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue and I also sent <I>La Frontière</I>, a newspaper, an open letter 
listing all of my expenses, even those incurred by my wife, including 
$5,851.18 for moving our furniture from our private home in Ottawa to 
Abitibi. Do you know what precipitated those specific expenses? The Bloc 
Quebecois, whose candidate defeated me in the 1993 election. So that can 
be deducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I want to mention in answer to the question put 
by the hon. member for Témiscamingue. He wants the province of Quebec to 
separate from Canada but, when he talks about my expenses, he forgets 
that my family, my wife and my daughter, came to Ottawa, otherwise our 
family would have been separated. We will never agree to Quebec 
separating from the rest of Canada and I will never agree to be 
separated from my family. We have a budget to travel to our ridings and 
to maintain our relationships with our wives and children. Try to take 
away that money in Ottawa, Mr. the hon. member for Témiscamingue, and I 
promise you, you're going to get it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, since 
debate has drifted slightly off on to the extraordinary expense 
account of my colleague from Abitibi, I find it ironic to hear that 
his riding is large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was not New Quebec in his riding a year before, in 1992? How 
is it that he had go there in 1993 only? You will recall that he 
had been a member of Parliament for eight years before that, for 
the same riding, and never had he claimed more that $50,000. In six 
months, in 1993, he claimed $72,749 and, according to him, 18 
¢. I am ready to accept dropping the 18 ¢ and limiting 
ourselves to the sum of $72,749. Something appears unacceptable to 
me, and I will leave it to the people of my region, who are also 
his constituents, to judge this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to a question I asked him and that he 
did not answer. It concerns two things.  First, the fact that, in 
1993, he received contributions from corporations and, second, 
did he come in direct or indirect contact with Pierre Corbeil, 
who is accused of influence peddling, of having solicited 
corporations for cash and of fraudulent practices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be brief. If you allow me, 
I will just have a look, since they do not want me to. I have the answer 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B>  He wants an answer to his question. I have it 
here. If we are talking about 1993, I received donations from 
individuals, it is true, and I received from 29 businesses and business 
organizations— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Aha. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Saint-Julien:</B>—$9,400. In 1993, $9,400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Aha. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> If they let me speak, I could complete what I 
had to say on spending. I want to tell you that in the previous years, 
I was travelling with the Quebec government, the Liberal government in 
Quebec, aboard its F-27. In 1993, I got more invitations to travel to 
New Quebec and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member. The hon. member for Charlesbourg, on debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like 
to begin by thanking the hon. member for Abitibi because he told things 
that I did not know, for example, that we can borrow a donation. He 
taught me something and I thank him for that. But I would like him to 
explain how that can be done, because that would help me understand a 
little better the economic policy of the Liberal Party of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was again listening to my colleague from Abitibi, who 
treated us to some most amusing antics while trying to blacken the 
reputation of the Bloc Quebecois, unsuccessfully as we have seen. 
In English, the only true language of the Liberal party of 
Canada,“it's the pot calling the kettle black”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we are debating today is one of fundamental 
importance.  It is too important to be a partisan one, for it goes 
to the very core of our democratic life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political life centres on our political parties. Whether 
that is a good or a bad thing, that is the way it is, for politics 
cannot operate outside reality, to quote Charles de Gaulle. 
Since political parties are necessary to our democracy, those 
political parties must be healthy, alive and involved in the health 
of our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business of the financing of political parties is dear to 
the heart of the Parti Quebecois, to those of us who are the sole 
true representatives of democracy here, because we are the only 
ones who accept funding only from individuals.  This is a matter to 
which I personally attach a great deal of importance— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.  The hon. member for Abitibi on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Madam Speaker, may I have the permission of 
the Bloc Quebecois to hand my props to the clerk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg to please speak without any props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that the 
Standing Orders of the House require the cameras be trained only on 
the person speaking, because our audience missed a real burlesque 
show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to share with this House some thoughts on the 
distressing performance by the government since the allegations of 
influence peddling became public.  According to the Prime Minister, 
this is a model government.  Since 1993, the party and the 
government have boasted of their honesty and integrity: no scandal, 
clear sailing.  They were lucky, but the good times are finally 
over as we can see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go over the facts, as they were related several times 
earlier.  I will, however, say the following.  It is all very sad 
for the Solicitor General.  The Prime Minister knew, the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services knew, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development knew, the President of the Treasury 
Board knew, but the Solicitor General did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 5(1) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act provides 
that: “The Governor in Council may appoint an officer, to be known 
as the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who, 
under the direction of the Minister—that is the Solicitor 
General—has the control and management of the Force and all 
matters connected therewith”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that the minister responsible for the RCMP 
is practically the only member of the Liberal cabinet unaware of 
the events.  Does the Solicitor General still have any credibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either cabinet has no confidence in him—in which case it 
would be very difficult for the Solicitor General to do any sort of 
sensitive work if his cabinet colleagues did not trust him—or 
the Solicitor General is not on top of the issues.  I am sorry, 
but, if there is one position here in Canada that requires a person 
be aware of the issues, it is that of minister, and especially that 
of Solicitor General. Another possibility, and this is becoming 
downright dangerous, is that the Solicitor General has lost control 
of his responsibilities, which include the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service and the RCMP, which, coincidentally, has been 
in the headlines of late.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Solicitor General is not in control, democracy is in 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kind of scandal in which the Liberals are currently involved—and 
this is indeed a scandal—has not been seen in Quebec for over 20 
years, ever since the Parti Quebecois first came to power. And it is no 
coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Lévesque came of age politically under Maurice Duplessis and 
had grown to despise the dubious financing practices of the Union 
nationale, obviously, but also of the Liberal Party. His feelings in the 
matter were shared by a whole generation of men and women in Quebec. 
Consequently, on August 26, 1977, René Lévesque had the National 
Assembly pass the bill to govern the financing of political parties and 
amend the Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By restricting political party financing to voters only, Quebec was 
sending a very clear message: politics is to serve the common good, not 
the interests of corporations, be they large corporations or major trade 
unions. In the province of Quebec, politics serves the citizens, and 
Quebec is a model of democracy around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleague, the hon. member for Bourassa, I say that we are 
not tearing our shirts. We are bursting with pride, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is incredible is that the situation at the federal level has 
not changed. Remember when the Tories were in power, which was not so 
long ago, all kinds of scandals broke out. 
There was the Sinclair Stevens affair, the Oerlikon affair, the 
influence peddling affair involving MP Grisé, the tainted tuna affair 
and the Airbus affair, which is still causing a stir today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the entire time when the Conservatives were in office, the 
Liberal Party, which was the official opposition at the time, acted 
outraged over all these scandals and strongly condemned the government. 
But what did they do when in government? Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B>  They did worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>  My colleague, the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, is right, they did worse. It is clear today 
that the real reason why Liberal members denounced the 
Conservative government's scandals was that they were not the 
ones at the receiving end.  That was their only reason for 
denouncing these scandals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I walk through my riding and tell constituents on 
Grands-Ducs Street in Stoneham, Vaillancourt Street in St-Émile 
or Mathieu Boulevard in Charlesbourg that federal politics is 
completely clean, as provincial politics is in Quebec? I simply 
cannot, as two of Canada's major political parties have proved 
the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party has made it clear that it does not want the 
current situation to change and is perfectly happy with the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminding the other parties that the Bloc Quebecois has 
already made a commitment to accept only contributions coming 
from voters, from individuals.  Can the Reform Party make the 
same commitment? Can the Conservatives? Can our colleagues from 
the New Democratic Party? I am waiting for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the revelations made just recently show that a major 
cleanup of federal politics is in order. It can be done, but do we have 
the will? Where there is a will, there is a way, as they say. The Bloc 
Quebecois found the way to do it because it wanted to. My question to 
the other parties is: Do you want to? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member 
opposite sounds like Tartuffe who said: “Hide thy bosom from mine 
eyes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at contributions received by the Bloc Quebecois. If 
they want to talk principles, that is what we will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Drummond, someone received a contribution of 
$1,500. Does this mean the person is working for the corporation that 
gave the money? Would Bloc members rather have ten contributions from 
members of the board than one from the corporation? Would they rather 
have preferential rates and a loan from the Mouvement Desjardins? Are

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it despicable to come up with these allegations, to 
continually act like Tartuffe, when we all know that the Canadian system 
is probably one of the best in the world. The Bloc must stop tarnishing 
our institution to promote its separatist dream. The Bloc's own true 
leader, Lucien Bouchard, ran under the Conservative banner. In 1988, he 
received $41,000 from organizations that were not individuals. When I 
see members opposite continually cry murder, I feel sorry for them, 
Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Charlesbourg. Does he find 
it normal that, on the one hand, his colleagues receive 
contributions while, on the other hand, they say that these 
people are not in the pay of those corporations?  Does he believe 
one can be bought with a contribution in return for some assets? 
When will the hon. member talk seriously, Madam Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the former assistant 
director general of the Liberal Party of Canada, who in fact held that 
position when the allegations— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I left my position as general manager in October 1996 and the 
allegations are supposedly about something that took place on March 6, 
1997.  I ask the member to withdraw his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>  Madam Speaker, what took place on March 5 and 
6 is that the RCMP was informed about what was going on and about what 
had gone on earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In true parliamentary spirit, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the member for Bourassa. I had not had a chance to 
do so and his presence in the House today is a measure of his 
tenacity and determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not once, not twice, not three times, but four times he ran before 
winning an election.  And just as a little aside, he might like to tell 
us a little later why, having had to run four times to get elected, he 
does not want to allow Quebeckers to vote a third time on Quebec's 
sovereignty?  That is a good question and one he should perhaps answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I would like to inform the former general 
manager of the Liberal Party of Canada that, during his 1993 campaign, 
his third campaign, which he lost by the way, that he received $13,222 
in corporate donations. So, once again, before casting aspersions, 
before making any accusations whatsoever, let the former general manager 
of the Liberal Party of Canada look in his own backyard, in his own 
party and in his own riding.

Minister of Human Resources Development that they had been asked for 
cash contributions, and asked to keep quiet about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If five have done so, according to the figures I recall, there 
may well be 800 to 1,200 industries, businessmen, who have had 
their arms twisted to contribute very large amounts of money.  We 
have learned that in certain cases, and this is absolutely 
scandalous, amounts as high as $50,000 were involved.  I must 
applaud the businessmen, the entrepreneurs who took the trouble 
to write or telephone the Minister of Human Resources Development 
to tell him that this seemed dishonest, that it had a certain 
odour about it, and to bring it to his attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the minister took the trouble to write to Mr. Murray of 
the RCMP to ask that the matter be investigated.  If five individuals 
brought this to the minister's attention, it means there are many others 
who coughed up large amounts.  And I suspect that certain companies in 
my riding coughed up money.

1995 during the fourth United Nations conference on women held

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that the day chosen to celebrate this day is 
one day before world food day as women in rural areas around the 
world make an invaluable contribution to the production of food 
and the management of other natural resources.

limitations in access to land, credit, agricultural extension 
services and other key resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If governments are to achieve international development goals 
such as world food security and sustainable development we must 
support the contribution of women and their full participation in 
agricultural and rural development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the Liberals took office back in 1993 they spent a 
lot of time talking about integrity.  They made a big show about 
appointing an ethics commissioner and they promised that the days 
of Mulroney style political corruption were over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now reports of patronage ridden contracting, unethical 
fundraising and politically motivated grants keep piling up.  The 
police have even raided the Liberal Party headquarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Prime Minister is, besides calling in the 
RCMP, what is he going to do to remove the clouds of corruption 
that are surrounding his government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the allegation was made that somebody was asking 
people for money, the minister did not wait one day.  He 
immediately on the same afternoon called the RCMP and informed 
them of the allegation.  This is what had to be done and it was 
done promptly.   The RCMP are now investigating a case involving 
one or two people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Leader of the Opposition make an extravagant 
statement like that, I say he should wait for the investigation 
to finish.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was no reference to words like ethics or integrity 
in the Prime Minister's reply, nor was there any reference to 
those words in the Speech from the Throne this year. At the 
operational level those words have been replaced by words like 
influence peddling, string pulling and shakedown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question about the transitional jobs fund, the $300 
million kitty that the federal government doles out with special 
attention to Liberal ridings.

suspicion that now hangs around the transitional jobs program?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the transitional jobs fund is allocated to areas where 
there are a lot of unemployed people.  The program is still 
there.  Most of these ridings, particularly in Atlantic Canada, 
are not Liberal ridings any more and the program is still there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, mere weeks before the election was called this spring, 
millions of dollars from this transitional jobs fund were 
funnelled into the Prime Minister's own riding.  They were trying 
to make sure that his job was not transitional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What influence did the Prime Minister exert to make sure that 
those grants to his own riding were announced just prior to the

Speaker, the Prime Minister of Canada who is the member for 
Saint-Maurice, will always work to make sure that the people who 
live in his riding are treated the same way as people in the 
other ridings in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would urge all hon. members now to be very 
judicious in their choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
judiciously say that on March 5 the minister for HRD sent a 
letter and asked the police to investigate illegal fundraising. 
He knows that.  But just 24 hours before that, the same minister 
approved $3 million out of that same jobs fund to go into the 
Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the minister for HRD this.  Just how is it that he 
signed cheques one day and called police the very next day? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

with chronology.  I could not know on March 4 things that I found 
out on March 5, the very day I called the police in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are so cynical.  They do not understand a thing 
about integrity in government.  I will say one thing.  All 
projects have been approved based on merit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is something strange here because on the Tuesday the 
minister approved $3 million for companies in the Prime 
Minister's riding, paid from the transitional jobs fund.  On the 
Wednesday he wrote to the RCMP as if there was some amazing new 
revelation that he had received to blow the whistle on corruption 
in that fund. The ink was not even dry on those cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask him this and please come up with a better defence. 
Did it just hit the minister that something might be wrong as the 
clock struck midnight? 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, all the projects in the 
Prime Minister's riding or in any other riding have been approved 
by the province of Quebec.  They have been approved by the 
department and are based on merit all the time, so much so that 
after I called the police in, I asked my deputy minister to 
review the whole process in which my department was proceeding. 
My deputy minister conferred with me that our process was

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> The Mr. Roy

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before rising in the House and saying he is under

</I></B></P><P align=left>As to our course of action, in all such cases I consult the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
can the Prime Minister tell us whether on or about March 6 he 
consulted his ethics commissioner and whether the commissioner told 
him that he should not take any action with respect to the 
permanent employees of the Liberal Party of Canada or the employees 
of the President of the Treasury Board and that he should wait for 
charges to be laid in connection with allegations made regarding an 
employee of the Liberal Party of Canada around the middle of June, 
after the June 2 election, as perhaps the member for Hamilton is 
aware?

I can only add that the person whose integrity was attacked by the

the CBC make a retraction, because he is not under investigation by

suggestion of irregularities would undermine the confidence of Canadians 
and that it would be better if the suspect were to hand in his 
resignation. At the time, the Prime Minister was quick to criticize 
another government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he explain today how incredibly tolerant he is in this

under investigation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will repeat that there is simply no RCMP investigation, as mentioned in 
the letter Mr. Roy's lawyers sent on this issue. So, no employee from

investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, one fact remains. 
Given everything we have found out these past two weeks about this

following question: What good is a government code of conduct that 
nobody knows anything about and that has no appropriate provision for 
this type of situation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

everybody, and everybody consults him. He is a very honourable and 
highly respected man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, as I always do, referred the issue to the counsellor, who 
will determine if the guidelines that apply to the government and

question is for the Prime Minister.  On his way to today's

arrogance and the audacity to tell Atlantic Canadians not to 
expect a fair hearing from this government because they made a 
“mistake” when they fired Liberals in the last election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister's Office confirmed this government

will condemn thousands of families to continuing poverty and 
hardship. Even longtime Liberal backbench MP Russell MacLellan 
admits the Liberal cuts have been excessive and brutal.  Will the

strongly despite the fact that the opposition Reform Party blamed 
us for giving money to people who could not fish.  The program is 
to be terminated next year because it is a program with a

timing is everything.  The government is now suggesting that the

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.

political friends to manage over $100 billion of taxpayers' 
money.  That is scary.

friends in the new Canada pension investment board will be 
subject to access to information guidelines?  Yes or no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would really suggest that members of the Reform Party hire better 
researchers.  If they did, they would know that in terms of the 
investment board a nominating committee has been put together of 
members named by the provinces and the federal government.  The 
nominating committee, in turn, will name an arm's length board of 
experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the hon. member has to do, rather than standing here and 
making a bit of a dope of himself in the House of Commons, is a 
little research and he would understand what is going on.

my question is for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, the Minister of Public Works admitted that more than 
35% of government contracts, totalling some $3 billion, were untendered.

public tender.

<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already answered this question in 
the House. Yes, the vast majority of contracts awarded by the Government 
of Canada are awarded by public tendering. A number of other contracts, 
amounting to approximately 35%, while they do go to tender, are awarded 
to sole source suppliers. This is done for national security reasons or 
in an emergency. In each case, the information is made public and 
everything can be checked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should check and see what the procedure is, in the 
Government of Canada, for awarding contracts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister admit that the fact that more than one third of all contracts 
are awarded without going to public tender is giving the business 
community the message that they better make generous donations to the 
ruling party if they hope to get a share of the pie? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government

trying to score political points, but if she looked at the facts, she 
would see that even the auditor general stated clearly in his reports 
that my department and this government are making tremendous progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office, 50% of government contracts were sole sourced. 
Now there are only 35%. We are currently putting measures in place, and 
our objective is to reduce their amount to zero if at all feasible.

when the Liberal government introduced TAGS four years ago it

it is perfectly clear there is a continuing problem in Atlantic 
Canada with respect to the fishery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that there is a surplus of over $12 billion in the unemployment

<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

told us in his report and we have also noticed that he asked us for 
certain information that already appears in the government's budget each 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we were told that they did not know what we were doing with the 
employment insurance surplus.  I wish to take issue with this approach, 
because this information is clearly indicated in the budget we table 
each year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les

to credibility, in my opinion, the auditor general's word is certainly 
as good as that of the Minister of Human Resources Development right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present case, when all Canadians are wondering how there can 
be a $12 billion surplus, when seasonal workers and new entrants to the 
labour market are being penalized, will the minister finally agree to 
shed some light on the situation so that we can finally learn where the 
money workers contribute to the fund, money the government used to 
reduce the deficit, is going?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  But I would like to tell you that we 
have inherited an employment insurance system that did not work, that 
did not meet Canadians' current needs. The new system is supposed to 
help these people back into the job market, so that they are no longer 
dependent on it. This was a very important reform, something we are 
taking care over to ensure that we are measuring its impact everywhere 
that we said we would.  That is what we are doing in the department.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we get closer to the Kyoto conference this December, more and

can carry on as before.  On the other hand, some people would 
have us believe the sky is falling.

voluntary measures will help Canada meet its emission reduction 
goals?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is indeed a vital role for voluntary action on 
climate change.  The members of the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum Producers have to date shown a six million tonne 
improvement in reducing CO2 emissions.  Pan-Canadian generated a 
four fold improvement between 1995 and 1996.  The Canadian 
pipeline industry achieved a 2% reduction between 1994 and 1995. 
By the year 2000 Consumers Gas will improve by 25%.   EPCOR will 
improve by one million tonnes per year.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege in regard to the matter of 
introducing government public bills in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My leader raised the issue with you under the provisions of 
Standing Order 52.  It should be noted that since my leader's 
application for a special debate, a third bill has appeared on 
the Senate order paper today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this to your attention at this time, not as a matter of 
ministerial responsibility and not as a matter of debate, but as 
a matter of our procedures and practices which only you, Mr. 
Speaker, can entertain under the guise of privilege. The 
situation is unique to this Parliament, so I ask that you be 
patient and consider my arguments carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is unique because three out of the five 
recognized parties in the House of Commons do not have 
representation in the other place.  The Prime Minister's use of 
the Senate as the first house to consider his government's 
legislation is insulting and offensive to the dignity of this 
elected House. It is also disrespectful to the new political 
reality of this House and its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 28, states  “Parliament is 
a court with respect to its own privileges and dignity and the 
privileges of its members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Erskine May's 21st edition, at page 115, it states that an 
offence for contempt “may be treated as contempt even though 
there is no precedent for the offence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time that the Senate will consider government 
public bills prior to the House at a time when the party 
representation in the Senate is so out of sync with the wishes of 
the electorate. While there is clearly no precedent for this 
situation, we are not precluded from finding that the action of 
the Prime Minister is in contempt of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I refer you to Beauchesne's citation 3 which 
describes some elements of the Constitution Act as follows “If 
the electorate so wishes, the system presupposes an opposition 
ready and willing to attack the government in an attempt to have 
its legislation altered or rejected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system presupposes that the elected members be the real 
opposition to government legislation.  The electorate has elected 
its government and its opposition.  The role of the Senate is for 
sober second thought and must not be the front line of opposition 
to ensure government accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might argue that the procedure the Prime Minister is using 
is in order.  What they fail to recognize is the changing 
circumstances that guide our practices. I refer you, Mr. Speaker, 
to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 11, which reads  “The 
House is to adjust the interpretation of its precedents and 
tradition in the light of changing circumstances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we claim the right to consider government public 
bills first.  The Prime Minister's conduct in introducing 
government legislation in the Senate is offensive to the dignity 
of this elected House, disrespectful to all of its members and is 
a contempt of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say a word in support of the question of privilege before the 
House and to welcome the Reform Party to the feeling we have been 
having for years.  There has always been something out of sync 
and out of character in the history of the CCF and the NDP in 
that we have never had representation in the other place, nor did 
we want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more pronounced now that three parties in the House 
have no representation in the other place.  That is the new fact 
which makes this a very legitimate question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to make is that we also have a duty in 
representing our constituents to offer constructive criticism to 
government bills.  Since three parties do not have a voice in the 
other place, that is very difficult to do at the important 
initial stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that there is a history of technical bills 
being introduced in the other place.  I believe that practice 
will now be expedited by the government. Just because those bills 
have been introduced in the Senate in the past does not make it 
right. There has been an evolution of thought in the country over 
the last number of years and people want more input.  They want 
their elected members of Parliament to play a more meaningful 
role.  In view of that fact, we must have evolution in the 
practices of the House as well.

think you should give positive consideration to the proposed motion 
because, in our evolving parliamentary system, it is extremely 
important to give more authority to the elected and less to those 
who are backward-looking and who do not reflect today's reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that elected representatives as a whole and the people

be the responsibility of the House of Commons and that this be the 
only way to proceed.

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to add to this point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a small thing to some people, but normally in the 
course of our day's Routine Proceedings, bills are routinely 
brought before the House of Commons, the elected house in this 
Parliament, for printing and for examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bills which are introduced in the Senate are not introduced 
that way to this body.  We only see them after the fact, after 
debate of whatever depth and degree that the other place decides. 
Only then are they brought to this House for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders have gone through an evolution since I have 
been here.  For example, on referral after first reading, we have 
tried to increase the influence of this place and of ordinary 
members on legislation in committees and otherwise in an attempt 
to bring the new political reality we are all talking about to 
bear on the 1990s and into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice that is obviously taking place now, which is to 
short circuit the normal, the average, the common way of 
introducing bills by sending them off to the Senate to be talked 
over and agreed to in the old boys club and then brought here 
only after it is a done deal is an affront to Parliament.  I 
think it is affecting our privileges as the elected body in this 
Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this was not so silly it 
would be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>   Hon. members across the way have, in 
fact, tried two methods, each one as unsuccessful as the 
previous. Today there was a call for an alleged emergency debate 
on the same issue and now an alleged question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing before the House today on which a question of 
privilege can be raised.  Hon. members will know that any 
proceeding in the other place is totally out of bounds in terms 
of raising it in this House.  We all know that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well happen some time in the future that the House will 
receive a message from the other place informing us that it has 
passed a bill, or a number of bills for that matter, and inviting 
us to consider those measures. Some of those measures will be 
sponsored by ministers and set down for consideration under 
Government Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders of the House explicitly provide for the 
introduction of Senate public bills and the subsequent 
consideration thereof.  As a matter of fact, I will read the 
Projected Order of Business for today.  Members I am sure will be 
familiar with the document.  It is not something that happened at 
some point in our history.  It states the following: Tabling of 
Documents, Statements by Ministers and so on.  Just before 
Motions is First Reading of Senate Public Bills.  This is today's 
Order Paper for the House of Commons. Therefore, under today's 
standing orders this applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All measures will be considered by this House in the same 
manner, whether they are initiated here and debated in the other 
place subsequently, or initiated in the other place and debated 
here subsequently. The alleged argument made by members is that 
somehow this sequence constitutes a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  What are you afraid of?  The fix is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we just heard a remark 
from someone who I think had better brush up on the rules. 
Whether a bill is introduced in one House or the other, they are 
of course debated in both Houses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a reversal of policy for the Reform Party.  I invite 
hon. members, especially him, to pay attention because in the 
last parliament and in all parliaments we have had Senate public 
bills debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament government Bill S-2 respecting a tax 
convention, which was very similar to one of the bills presently 
before the Senate, was passed without any recorded division.  In 
other words members of the Reform Party voted for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today they issued a press release saying that introducing bills 
is undemocratic, yet they have voted for what they considered to 
be undemocratic bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government Bill S-9 respecting a tax treaty with the United 
States was also introduced.  There were two divisions on that 
bill.  There were two division bells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was on an amendment proposed by a member on this side of the 
House.  It is recorded at page 2020 of the <I>Journals</I> of 
October 17, 1995 that Reformers thought so highly of the Senate's 
legislative work they voted against the proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, this is against an amendment proposed by a 
member of the House and in favour of the version proposed by the 
other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, on page 2021 of the <I>Journals</I> for that day we see 
on the motion to concur in the Senate government bill that the 
Reform Party voted in favour of the bill, once again telling us 
that the procedure is quite correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament Reformers were so comfortable with 
government bills being introduced in the Senate that they 
specifically voted on them when division bells were rung. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the Speaker to the October 17, 1995 
<I>Journals</I> at page 2022.  In that division a number of Reform 
members voted for the bill:  the hon. member for St. Albert, the 
hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia, the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill, the hon. member for Macleod, the hon. member 
for Cariboo—Chilcotin and a number of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these members and a number of others from the Reform Party 
voted in favour of a division supporting a Senate bill and 
against an amendment made by a member of the House.  They cannot 
today claim that the Senate procedure is illegitimate when they 
fought so valiantly in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question of privilege.  This is a concocted 
argument by the Reform Party in a desperate attempt to find some 
way of getting pubic attention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have several points that will constitute new 
information to assist you in making your decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader's defence of this practice just given rested on 
two points.  The first one, and he quoted a number of references 
to support it, is that what happens in the Senate is out of 
bounds in the House.  That notion is completely out of sync with 
the reality in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if our constituents want us to make what goes on in the 
Senate the business of the House?  Are we not under an obligation 
as members to bring that to the House, including the relationship 
between the House and the Senate?  Surely the will of our 
constituents takes precedence over these earlier precendents he 
quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that he made reference to the last 
parliament and instances in which members of the current 
opposition received and supported bills that had originated in 
the Senate.  We simply reply to that by saying that was then and 
this is now.  The composition of the House is moving further and 
further away from the composition of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the last election the composition of the House passed the 
point where three of the parties, including the official 
opposition in the House, are not represented at all in that other 
chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of the arguments raised by the House leader are extremely 
weak.  We are simply standing before you, Mr. Speaker, to claim 
the right to consider government public bills first in this 
place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As always when questions of privilege 
are raised I am very much interested in them and how they affect 
the House.  You have empowered your Speaker to specifically 
interpret the rules of the House and to give rulings on the rules 
we have agreed on as an assembly of the House of Commons 
collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the standing orders that were referred to by the 
hon. Leader of the Opposition and by the government House leader. 
Standing Order 69(2) at page 36 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When any bill is brought from the Senate, the question “That 
this bill be read a first time” shall be deemed carried, without 
debate, amendment or question put. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have adopted our standing orders from proceedings in the 
British House of Commons in which there are ways to introduce a 
bill.  It may be brought in upon an order of the house.  It may 
be presented without an order under the provisions of Standing 
Order 58(1), which is what we base it on.  It may be brought down 
from the House of Lords which is our Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have asked me to rule on a procedure on which the House 
collectively has decided.  Unless and until the House 
collectively decides that it wants to change the standing orders, 
as your Speaker I am bound to follow the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rule that in this particular case there is no question 
of privilege.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have checked all the documents the member for Abitibi tabled

Repentigny, but my second term in this House. So I have the honour of 
being the first member of Parliament for Repentigny and I hope I will 
also be the last since that riding will soon disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the whole team who helped me get re-elected and who 
worked very hard throughout the campaign. I want to thank the members of 
my family for their support and the people of the five municipalities of 
my riding, namely La Plaine, Mascouche, Lachenaie, Charlemagne and 
Repentigny, who have placed their trust in me for the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate was a bit chaotic this morning. Therefore, it is very 
important to read the motion again just to know what we are supposed to 
be debating and put aside the kind of outrageous remarks we have heard 
from some members, namely the member for Abitibi—if he does not 
agree, he can stand in this House and say so—as well as the member 
for Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the attitude of the Government, which 
refuses to introduce in-depth reform of the legislation on the 
financing of federal political parties even though the existing 
legislation allows for a wide range of abuse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that the members opposite agree, even the member for 
Abitibi who spoke out against this motion earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that public financing has been part of our 
tradition for more than 20 years now. It is important to note that all 
political parties, even federalist parties in Quebec—and by that I 
mean the Liberal Party—have adopted that type of financing to achieve 
a healthy democracy in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud that, in 1977, the Parti Quebecois passed a law 
that says that only a voter can make a contribution.  This 
legislation eliminates possible political influence from pressure 
groups whose objectives are more to change the direction of 
public policies than to allow a party whose ideology is close to 
that of their members to assume and retain power.  The 
legislation limited contributions to $3,000 per year per voting 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of the legislation were to limit to voters—and 
this is true democracy—the right to contribute to political parties, 
because we speak on their behalf and we should not be influenced by 
companies roping us in with lavish contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying for a long time to make the government 
understand that this legislation is something normal that should 
also apply to the federal level, the Canadian level.  As early as 
March 1994, our colleague from Richelieu tabled a motion that 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation limiting solely to individuals the right to donate 
to a federal political party, and restricting such donations to a 
maximum of $5,000 a year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that at the provincial level the ceiling is $3,000.  We did 
not want to be too restrictive and we set the maximum at $5,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may go through a lot of debates and often try to skirt the 
actual facts, but we have to wonder why the Liberal Party voted 
against that proposal.  Clearly, they had something to hide. 
This is quite obvious, since they say that contributions to party 
financing should not be limited to individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a while, I will give you some figures on the contributors to the 
Liberal Party.  Then we might be able to understand why the party does 
not want to depend only on individuals for its financing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would anyone oppose a bill which specifically seeks to clarify 
and to improve the fundraising process for federal political parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is suspicious to say the least. When people will know who is 
making contributions to the Liberal Party fund, perhaps they will 
understand why Liberals are opposed to such and such a bill or 
why they are against a motion like this. An article published in 
<I>La Presse</I> on July 22, 1993, revealed that Bombardier had given 
$29,932 to the Liberal Party.  Air Canada gave $957 to the 
Liberal Party and $31,000 to the Conservative Party, after 
receiving a subsidy and being awarded contracts worth $75 
million. Imperial Oil chose a more balanced approach and covered 
all the bases by giving $34,000 to the Conservatives and $34,000 
to the Liberals. They were covered in any case. Following these 
generous contributions, the company was awarded contracts worth 
$186 million. Canadian Airlines gave $11,415.08 to the Liberal 
Party, while Pratt & Whitney made a $7,500 contribution to the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I will continue to tell the 
House who is giving money to this generous party. In 1994, the Royal 
Bank of Canada gave $88,700 to the Liberal Party; RBC Dominion Security, 
$99,000; the Toronto Dominion Bank, $77,000; Wood Gundy, $106,000; 
Richardson Greenshields, the investment firm, $99,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have thought that, after coming to power following 
the 1993 election, the Liberals would have gained some wisdom.  We 
would have thought that, after having written in the red book that 
it wanted to increase the voters' confidence in their elected 
representatives, the Liberal Party would have changed its ways and 
accepted a bill on the financing of political parties that would 
make things a little more transparent for the public.  But no, the 
Liberals did no such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, when they were in power and getting ready for another 
election, they continued to collect money.  Another article from <I>La 
Presse, </I>this one dating back to 1996, states that it was business 
which made it possible for the Liberals to collect more money that 
the previous year.  The most generous ones, Nesbitt Burns for one, 
gave $88 000, $81 000, $73 000.  We are not talking here of normal 
contributions, Mr. Speaker, we are talking of donations of more 
than $75,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to ask a few questions of my Liberal 
colleagues, and I would like the answers from the hon. member for 
Abitibi.  Could it be that the Liberals called an election more 
than six months before the usual time, and a year and a half 
before the end of their mandate, because the government feared 
that the RCMP investigation was going to break? How does the 
Prime Minister explain that the code of ethics has nothing in it 
about influence peddling?  Why did the Prime Minister not give 
his ministers any guidance on ethics after the minister 
responsible for human resources development alerted him to the 
RCMP investigation?  How is it that the Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Public Works, Pierre Corbeil, and the director 
general, Mr. Béliveau, were informed of the allegations by the 
Minister of Public Works himself?  Why does the code of ethics 
not apply to the Liberal Party of Quebec when it applies to the 
government?  Why was Pierre Corbeil not suspended from his duties 
as soon as this information was learned?  I would like all these 
questions answered, Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in question 
period this afternoon, we saw the bubble burst as we say back home. 
I do not know whether the leader of the Bloc Quebecois will be 
laying people off, but we discovered that some had not done their 
homework properly.  They sullied people's reputations.  They named 
people.  There was talk of an investigation, when none existed. I 
hope they will do the honourable thing and prove their integrity 
and their honesty by rising and apologizing to Jacques Roy and to 
the President of the Treasury Board.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear, there are two sets of rules. We are used 
to that, in the Bloc. That is how they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can get loans at preferential rates to finance their 
election campaign. They can get millions of dollars because they 
need cash. But does that make them dependent on the Mouvement 
Desjardins? Does that mean, since the Mouvement Desjardins loaned 
them money at preferential rates—I could not get preferential 
rates, but the Bloc did, I do not know why, but it did—,that 
they are in the pay of the president of the Mouvement Desjardins? 
To answer is obvious, since the president of the Mouvement 
Desjardins is a well-known separatist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about contributions. We are talking about all 
sorts of things. We saw that the Bloc quebecois also received 
contributions from corporations that were higher than $10,000. The 
member for Drummond received a $1,500 contribution. Is she in the 
pay of the contributor? The answer is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's motto is “I remember”. Looking back at past actions, 
they might do well to remember that if one spits into the wind, it 
blows back into one's face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 3, 1993, we read this headline in <I>La Presse</I>: 
“Témiscamingue enumerators complain about being held for ransom 
by the Bloc”. The article read, in part: “The methods used by 
the organization of Pierre Brien, who was running for the Bloc 
quebecois in Témiscamingue, led to strong protests by Elections 
Canada enumerators who, apparently, were pressured to hand over 
half of their salary as political contributions”. They were told 
this: “If you want to work for Elections Canada, give us half 
the cheque that you will get and we will give you a job”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have principles. They are real Tartuffes, as I said earlier. 
They try constantly to tell us how we should behave, and yet they bring 
this kind of pressure to bear on people who have almost no money—as 
we know, enumerators also need their wages. I hope this does not happen 
in every riding but the current member for Témiscamingue should really 
be ashamed of using this method for his own financing. He should be 
ashamed because those persons need this money. And that is how the Bloc 
Quebecois gets its financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Repentigny agree with this method? That is 
what we want to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I remind all members that they must refer to 
each other by constituency and not by name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Repentigny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to answer all 
the questions of the hon. member for Bourassa, who has proved quite 
resilient because he ran three times before winning on the fourth 
attempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has said that maybe we should be looking at the relevancy and 
shortcomings of our research services. I could tell him exactly the same 
thing. When he clipped that story from a newspaper, he should have known 
that that criticism had been levelled by the man who was running for the 
Liberals in Témiscamingue, and that it proved unfounded. It is all right 
to make foolish remarks in this House, but one should at least consider 
what is actually going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about contributions to candidates— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Could we have some respect, Mr. Speaker? The 
hon. member should at least have learned some manners in the four 
campaigns he ran before getting elected to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a second point, concerning contributions to the Bloc Quebecois, 
I do not think there is any comparison between a total contribution of 
$7,000 to five or six candidates, or a $1,000 contribution in one 
riding, and contributions of $100,000 by Air Canada, $90,000 by the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank and other contributions of about $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Abitibi alone, nine individuals and 29 
corporations made contributions to the 1993 campaign. In that same 
riding, 397 individuals contributed to the Bloc Quebecois candidate's 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I notice that the hon. member for Bourassa has 
learned something from his colleague for Abitibi, because he does not 
make any distinction either between a loan and a contribution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on your 
appointment since this is the first opportunity I get to do so. For the 
next few minutes I would ask you to be patient because, as this is the 
first time I have had the opportunity to take part in debate, I would 
like to offer a few thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you mentioned, I am the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine. First, I would like to thank my 
constituents.  Then I would also like to thank the team of 
volunteers who worked with me during the election campaign. For 
most of them, it was their first experience in politics and all 
of them marvelled at our political process, our political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank my family, my husband Luciano, my 
daughter and all the other members of my extended family who supported 
me and will continue to do so during this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to give you some of my background to explain what 
I am going to say about the Bloc's opposition motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the daughter of a Black American man from Alabama who 
emigrated to Canada in 1944 and who was able to vote for the first time 
in his life in Canada, thanks to our democratic system and to the 
election system we had at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother was a French Canadian from Manitoba, of Belgian, French 
and Metis descent. The Metis background is Cree, Montagnais and 
Attikamek. So, my roots in Canada go back to the natives, to the first 
nations, and my French roots go back to an ancestor who came from France 
to Canada, to Quebec, to New France, in 1868. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I give you this description, these details on my past, 
on my life and on who I am, is to point out that, if it were not for the 
election system we have in Canada, I would not be here today. I swear, 
I would be willing to bet with anyone in this House, that the vast 
majority of members here in the House today would not be here either if 
it were not for the election system we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the pillars of a real democratic system is the election 
system that allows residents, citizens to make themselves heard and to 
decide which political party will form the government and which 
political parties will sit in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This political system must allow the widest access possible to all 
citizens, not only to make themselves heard on voting day, but even also 
to participate in the process, whether as candidates, organizers or 
volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system allows this. I was able to see that myself during my 
first experience in politics in the last election campaign. About a 
hundred citizens came to work as volunteers, the vast majority of them 
working for the first time in an election campaign, and they did it 
wholeheartedly.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois contends that only by limiting to individuals, 
private persons, the right to donate to political parties will it be 
possible to ensure integrity in our election system. I must say that I 
beg to differ, in fact I completely disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Bear with me, I will be glad to explain. My 
family always said I had the gift of the gab and that it is not easy to 
get me to shut up, but I do respect authority. So, as soon as the 
Speaker will indicate that my time is up, I will stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political system is such that it encourages thousands and 
thousands of Canadians to do volunteer work. That is right, even 
Canadians living in Quebec.  In past elections, including the 
last federal election, these thousands and thousands of Canadians 
played an active role in the political process, as campaign 
workers for the candidate of their choice and the political party 
of their choice. Our electoral system allows and promotes this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, if we in Canada did not have the legislation 
that this government passed, many of the members of this House would not 
be here today, and this is true for our colleagues opposite as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any discussion about a democratic electoral process with integrity 
must address the principles openness, transparency and accountability, 
and that is what we have today with our electoral system in Canada. 
It is precisely because the Canada Elections Act guarantees a 
transparent process by providing control over the amount of 
contributions. Anyone can have access to a candidate's report and check 
the figures. It is because such measures are provided in our legislation 
that the process, and democracy, are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does transparency mean? It means precisely what took place 
last week and today in this House. Had it not been for our election 
system and the Canada Elections Act, those who reported these alleged 
offences under the act would never have openly talked, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development would never have been informed, and no 
police investigation would ever have taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just look at countries that are known for being corrupt. Their 
citizens, whether they are company officials or ordinary individuals, do 
not dare inform authorities of any alleged corruption, because they know 
their system condones and covers up such acts. It is not the case here. 
A police investigation is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, unlike Bloc members, I believe that the mere fact we are 
discussing alleged fraudulent practices, and I insist on the word 
“alleged”, shows the integrity of our institutions. I am a 
lawyer by training, and having worked in Quebec on a code of 
ethics for the police, I have some knowledge of the issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a thing or two about the integrity of our institutions, 
professional conduct and ethics. That is why I choose my words very 
carefully when I talk of “alleged” practices during the last election 
campaign. So, the very fact that we are having this discussion proves 
the integrity of the existing Canadian electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps you are wondering who I am—I just said a few words about 
myself and my professional background—to be stating so confidently that 
our Canadian electoral system is open and transparent and makes sure 
that all who are governed by the elections act are accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before taking up politics this year, as I said a moment ago, I 
worked in police deontology in Quebec. And, by the way, I was not 
appointed only by the Liberal government. The PQ government saw fit to 
reappoint me on the basis of my qualifications and to suggest that I get 
involved at the national and international level on the issue of 
civilian monitoring of law enforcement, at my own expense and not at 
public expense of course. They had enough confidence in my expertise in 
these matters to reappoint me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am coming to the motion, so you should be happy now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Finally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B> Yes, finally. It was said time and again that 
the very fact the solicitor general had not been informed by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development of the allegations to the effect 
that fraudulent actions were allegedly committed proved there was 
something fishy about the whole thing. 
On the contrary, this demonstrates the system's transparency and 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members say Quebec must serve its citizens. If so, how can the 
Bloc Quebecois justify its mission to partition Canada, given that 
Quebeckers have twice said they wanted to live in a united Canada? All 
the questions asked by opposition members lead us to think they do not 
believe in the integrity of a police investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true? For years, surveys conducted across the country have 
been showing that the public has a high level of confidence in our 
police forces and in the integrity of their investigations. 
I find it reassuring that these allegations are being investigated by 
the police, and I hope other members of this House will also find it 
reassuring. Given the professionalism of the RCMP, I am confident the 
investigation will shed light on the whole issue and will establish 
whether there is enough evidence to lay charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we be protecting our democracy by allowing only contributions 
to political parties from ordinary taxpayers, from individuals? Let me 
point out some facts. If the financing of political parties works so 
well in Quebec, why did the Bloc Quebecois change it to increase the 
amount of eligible contributions? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Bloc Quebecois justify that, in 1994, Bloc Quebecois 
members and candidates accepted 27 corporate donations of over $10,000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois can sing the praises of the Loi québécoise sur 
le financement électoral, but that does not mean there are not serious 
discrepancies. If the Bloc Quebecois wants to suggest that corporate 
financing can have an unlawful impact on the awarding of government 
contracts, perhaps we should remind it that, despite Quebec's 
legislation on financing political parties, the Parti Quebecois still 
manages to reward contributors and sympathizers generously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, we have only to recall the sorry episode of the 
Le Hir report and the irregularities observed in the contract 
awarding process.  Yvon Cyrenne, one of the authors of the Le Hir 
report, contributed $900 to the Parti Quebecois in 1994.  Yvon 
Martineau, who was appointed president of Hydro-Québec, made a 
contribution of $1,000 to the Parti Quebecois in the year 
preceding his appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> He is an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B> Now you get my point.  It is not by limiting 
individual contributions that we are going to guarantee the integrity of 
the system of financing political parties.  Rather, it is by ensuring 
that, first of all, the legislation itself contains adequate provisions 
for ensuring control of all contributions and the accountability of 
political parties and individual candidates receiving contributions, and 
for ensuring that they are properly and openly reported and that this 
process is open to taxpayers, voters, the public and residents of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now you get it.  It is not by limiting the contributions to party 
financing to individuals that you will ensure the integrity of the 
system.  That is the point of my speech.  Now I am sure you see what I 
mean.  I will close with that point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to comment on what my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party 
has just said. I was absolutely bowled over by my colleague's 
eloquence and her enthusiasm.  I was particularly fascinated when 
she waxed eloquent on the beauty of the parliamentary and electoral 
system that is ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, just like to point out to you, and my hon. 
Liberal colleague, that no one on the Bloc Quebecois side has ever 
disputed the democratic system, the parliamentary system under 
which we are operating at the present time.  She devoted the bulk 
of her long speech to that aspect, when no one over here has ever 
questioned that part of her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did say, precisely, was that we had concerns about the 
way political parties were being funded. 
In this connection, I am still amazed that the Liberal government 
chooses MPs from Quebec to oppose this motion on public financing 
of political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, sometimes when I am sitting here in the House of 
Commons, I feel as if I were on Mars. If I were in the Quebec 
National Assembly, sovereignists as well as federalists would agree 
unanimously on the value of public funding of political parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am outraged to hear my colleagues from Quebec questioning 
the worth of the Quebec law on public funding of political parties 
when all parties in the National Assembly regard this law highly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues see the mote in the eye of the Bloc Quebecois 
and are horrified.  The Bloc received 27 contributions in 1993 from 
businesses.  In contrast how many hundreds of contributions did the 
party opposite receive from business?  The federal law as it stands 
permits this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois set itself strict rules in keeping with the 
law on public funding of political parties.  So, how do these 27 
small contributions stack up against the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars contributed to the party opposite, which is giving us the 
lesson today?  Consider the beam in your own eye instead of 
looking for the miserable mote you might find in ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When political parties receive hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from corporations, can we reasonably expect that the day 
the president of the corporation shows up on the doorstep of the 
Prime Minister he will be turned away?  When the individual who 
contributed $100,000 to Liberal Party coffers knocks on the Prime 
Minister's door, he will be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This form of funding, where businesses can fund political 
parties and where no limit is set, opens the door to corruption and 
to influence peddling, and this is what we have seen in the past 
two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear colleague 
opposite for his complimenting me so profusely today. I am almost at a 
loss for words, but not quite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that my whole speech was on the democratic 
system and how our electoral system ensured that democracy is at work. 
True, but I also addressed the main issue of your motion suggesting that 
only by limiting to individuals the right to contribute to party 
financing will we be able to ensure the system's integrity. I quoted 
very specific instances where financial contributions were made by 
individuals under the Quebec party funding act, the Loi de financement 
politique au Québec. I am not the one who said the integrity of Quebec's 
electoral system was sullied, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that if I were to follow the logic of my dear colleague 
opposite and say that the elections act should be changed to limit the 
right to make contributions to individuals, this would mean that the 
system in Quebec is weak, and I gave a few examples. Under the Quebec 
system, only individuals are allowed to contribute to party financing, 
yet that did not prevent fraudulent action. It did not prevent 
questionable situations. So, it is not logical, nor well founded  and I 
will conclude on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to refer to the comments by the member from 
the government a few moments ago.  What we are debating today and 
what I think the Bloc is getting at is the Liberal influence 
peddling with reference to campaign funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find most troubling though in listening to this whole 
debate are the words that are being used and that are flying 
around so loosely.  I hear from the member on the government 
side, a transparent process, accountability.  A few minutes ago I 
heard democracy, something that is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this House only a few weeks.  This is my first 
time elected and I have a lot to learn after witnessing what has 
happened in the House yesterday and today.  Words like 
accountability the government does not know. Democracy it does 
not know.  This government is trying to silence the people of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sent here to represent the constituents of Saanich—Gulf 
Islands and I come with their voice.  I came here to speak on 
various issues and every time I look in this House, this 
government is trying to silence it.  Whether it is sending a bill 
to the Senate first, whether it is trying to bring closure on a 
bill, whatever it does it is trying to silence it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not have a clue about democracy or 
accountability or transparency.  They talk about fraudulence.  I 
have no doubt in my mind about the accusations that are coming 
forth and we will have to wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have witnessed in this House the last few days absolutely 
confirms in my mind what has been coming forth.  It frustrates me 
to hear these words used so loosely by the other side, that those 
members are democratic, that they are accountable and then they 
pull the kind of stunts we have seen in this House is absolutely 
a disgrace.  It is shameful and it should not be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. 
member opposite might want to think a few times before 
denigrating the use of the term democracy. The very fact that we 
are here in this House and the hon. member as well is in this 
House shows that we have a democracy, one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I mistaken or is there an actual debate going on right now on 
a motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois?  Is there not a debate? 
Therefore I fail to understand my colleague on the other side of 
the House who claims that we are stifling debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to know whether it is in order for the hon. 
member to make the statement that a particular party in this 
House broke the law when, in fact, there is no evidence of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thought that he referred to 
lawbreaking in general. I did not take the hon. member's 
statement to mean that someone had broken the law.  I know that 
he would not want to suggest that unless he has a charge to make, 
which is the proper way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he said those words I would ask the hon. member to consider 
withdrawing them, if that is what he said.  However I thought it 
was a more general reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not recall having 
impugned the integrity of any member of the House, but there are 
allegations regarding an employee of the Liberal Party of Canada 
which are on the record.  The allegations are very troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members seem to pop up every time a member mentions 
those allegations.  They seem to be pretty prickly about the 
issue.  They seem to be a bit defensive.  I can imagine why. It 
appears to be a replay of the old Mulroney scandals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember when the Liberal Party of Canada was in opposition. 
You were one of those members, Mr. Speaker, a very vociferous and 
effective member of that opposition.  Whenever there was the 
slightest hint of wrongdoing by the Tory government, Liberal 
members were on their feet complaining bitterly about the lack of 
integrity in Tory party fundraising exercises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It behoves opposition parties to point out that there are many 
unanswered questions, one of which came up today as a result of 
the documents filed by the RCMP regarding the activities of Mr. 
Corbeil.  We discovered, among other things, that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development notified the RCMP about this 
potential scandal, about the allegations of the Shawinigan 
shakedown, a day after he authorized millions of dollars in pork 
barrel grants for the Prime Minister's riding where that employee 
of the Liberal Party was operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not troubling I do not know what is.  It looks like 
“Shawinigate” to me and it should be investigated very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the confidence of Canadians in Parliament, in 
politicians and in political parties is in question.  I recently 
read of a poll where 82% of Canadians indicated low or very low 
confidence in politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the day after I announced my intention to seek election 
to this Chamber picking up a local newspaper and reading an Angus 
Reid poll which ranked the respectability of different careers in 
the eyes of average Canadians.  At the top were hard working 
people like farmers and clergymen.  They are highly respected by 
Canadians.  Then it got down toward the dregs of society, with 
lawyers near the bottom.  The second last category on the list, 
just above arms' dealers was politicians.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House, regardless of our partisan affiliation, 
should have as a common objective restoring the public's trust in 
the democratic institutions of the country.  Unless we do that we 
will see more of the corrosive cynicism that sees voter turnout 
rates going lower and lower and volunteer participation in 
elections diminishing year after year.  That kind of cynicism 
eats away at the guts of democracy and the operation of our 
political parties.  It is a serious problem which strikes at the 
heart of what it means to live in a liberal democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  We think there is need for the reform of 
electoral financing legislation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which is close to my heart.  It is an issue on 
which I have focused much attention over the years.  When I was 
in my previous position as president of the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation I made a considered submission to the Royal Commission 
on Electoral Reform, otherwise known as the Lortie commission. 
In that submission I advocated what I think was a very sensible 
policy, seconded by the Reform Party of Canada. I would like to 
read into the record the policy of the Reform Party with respect 
to the reform of electoral financing legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blue book of the principles and policies of the Reform Party 
of Canada states that it opposes any assistance to political 
parties and political lobbies from public funds, including any 
refund of candidate or party expenses, government advertising 
during the election period, the renting of parliamentary staff 
for reimbursement, tax credits for contributions to federal 
political parties and the transfer of tax credits to leadership 
or nomination campaigns or to provincial or municipal parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, I think, is a sensible policy.  It is that kind of policy 
which we are advocating in terms of this motion put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want to end public funding of political parties? 
First, there is a very important principle, one which I regret is 
not shared by other members of this place. The principle is that 
it is inappropriate in a democratic society, one founded on the 
primacy of conscience, the rights of conscience and the rights of 
individuals, to coerce people, sometimes against their will, to 
fund partisan activities, to fund the promotion of political 
ideas and programs which they do not themselves hold, which is 
precisely what the system of public financing of political 
parties does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle was best expressed by Thomas Jefferson, perhaps 
the greatest intellectual father of liberal democracy who said in 
the preface to the Virginia statute on religious freedom that 
“to compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas 
he disbelieves and abhors is both sinful and tyrannical.” 
Strong words from one of the seminal thinkers of modern democracy 
who said an idea that was enshrined at the beginning of the 
American constitutional experiment that individuals ought not to 
be coerced against their will to fund and promote activities 
which they do not themselves support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my constituents and I am sure many millions of Canadians 
find it profoundly abhorrent that they are forced by the long arm 
of the state, by the coercive power of government, to hand over 
the fruits of their labours to support the promotion of ideas 
which they find abhorrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that there are a plurality of political views in 
this country which we ought to respect.  But if people really 
believe in the policies of a particular party they ought to be 
able to support that voluntarily out of their own cheque book 
rather than reaching across to unsuspecting taxpayers and forcing 
them to fund activities of parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are Canadians who are deeply opposed to the 
policies of the Reform Party.  I think there are a few on the 
opposite side of the House.  I do not think they should be 
compelled or forced to advance our party's program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me anticipate some of the objections to our argument against 
public funding of political parties. Some say that this is merely 
a means to open up the floodgates to all sorts of corruption, 
vote buying and influence purchasing on the part of corporations 
and major donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out one thing to the House.  The Reform Party acts, 
it does not just talk, it walks the talk of integrity in 
fundraising.  I refer to the 1996 statistics for fundraising for 
the various registered political parties which tell us that the 
Reform Party had by far the highest percentage of funds raised 
from individuals and the lowest percentage of funds raised from 
major corporations.  Of the contributions made to the Reform 
Party, 68% of the nearly $5 million in contributions came from 
individual donors, as opposed to nearly 53% for the Tory Party 
and 43% for the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party which claims to be the spokesmen for the poor, 
the under trodden, the great voice of compassion and equity, 
where did it get its money?  It came from its big corporate 
friends on Bay Street. Whereas 12% of Reform contributions last 
year were corporate contributions, get this, 55.4% of the Liberal 
Party's contributions came from corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the members opposite and for the Government of 
Canada is why can they not raise money from individuals to 
support the activities of their party?  Perhaps it is because 
individuals are not interested in buying the kind of influence, 
the kind of pork barrel grants that we have heard about the past 
few days.  Our friends in the old decrepit fifth party received 
46% of their funding from the corporate sector, four times more 
than the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributions sent in to the treasury of the Reform party are an 
average of $73 as opposed to $190 for our rich friends in the 
Tory party and $164 for the caviar and champagne set across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party supported by the hard won contributions of individual 
Canadians, we are the only party standing on principle against 
this rip-off of taxpayers which has constituted $79 million since 
1979 that has gone into the coffers of political parties and 
candidates through candidate reimbursement and registered party 
reimbursement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 election alone $22,894,443 went into the coffers of 
political parties and candidates, money that Canadians would 
rather have in their own pockets to take care of their families 
and their businesses rather than the salaries and perks of 
professional political hacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this whole design of pork barrel support for political 
parties maintained?  It is principally through three different 
legislative vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is candidate reimbursement with which all of us in the 
House are familiar. Those candidates for registered parties who 
receive over 15% of the vote are entitled to receive a rebate 
from the public treasury.  It is called a rebate.  My 
constituents think a rebate is getting money back from something 
that they have contributed to. These candidates are getting money 
from the taxpayers by law, 50% of all expenses if they win over 
15% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political parties, the registered parties who spent more 
than 10% of their total allowable maximum, get 22.5% of their 
expenses back from the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the infamous tax credit for political parties 
of up to $500 contribution.  It is a 75% tax credit on the first 
$100 on a sliding scale up to a maximum of $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every one of our constituencies across the country hard 
working, compassionate volunteers go from door to door trying to 
raise money for important social and charitable causes and they 
are able to offer a bit of a tax break for Canadians.  The 
charitable contribution tax credit pales in comparison to the 
shameful 75% tax credit that political parties in the House have 
given to themselves.  We stand opposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will say these subsidies are necessary to maintain 
the partisan process and that parties and democracy would somehow 
waste away were we not to maintain this multimillion dollar 
rip-off for political parties.  That just is not true.  Canadians 
are too smart to be bought by votes.  It is not necessary to 
spend money to form government.  Our friends opposite do not know 
that because they are the richest political party in the history 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me bring to their attention the Charlottetown accord debate 
in 1992.  In that debate you had the great parties of the 
political establishment of the centre left in Canada, the old 
Tory party, the fifth party, and the Liberal party of Canada, and 
you had our socialist friends all supporting this massive 
constitutional amendment against the wishes of ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one political party that had the integrity to stand up 
for Canadians and oppose the Charlottetown accord.  We were 
successful against all of the financial odds in defeating that 
accord.  While the other side and their big money-bag men on Bay 
Street raised $20 million to spend in support of the 
Charlottetown accord we were able to scratch together a few 
hundred thousand dollars from our grassroots supporters.  David 
defeated Goliath in 1992 at the Charlottetown accord.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not bought by slick TV ads put together by 
well-paid partisan hacks.  They are persuaded by ideas and 
convictions. That demonstrates that we do not need big money for 
the democratic process to further itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the election of the Tory party in 1993.  The 
old fifth place party spent $10.4 million in the 1993 election. 
How many of its MPs were elected then?  Do we remember?  Two 
seats. It cost them $35,000 per seat while the Reform Party, the 
grassroots party, the populist party in Canada spent $1.5 million 
raised from farmers, homemakers, small business people, retired 
folks and students, and we had 52 members elected to this place. 
The per capita cost of those seats was $7,300, a tiny fraction of 
what the old party spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not necessary for parties to spend, spend, spend to elect 
seats. That we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-four per cent of the candidates elected in the 1993 
election—we do not have the most recent figures but I suspect 
they are about the same—already had a surplus in their campaign 
accounts before they cashed the cheque for reimbursement from the 
taxpayers.  What does that tell us?  They do not need the money. 
They are already raising the money.  The other 46% that did not 
have pre-reimbursement subsidies darn well should have.  They 
should have gone out door to door and raised the money as the 
members of my party did to run surpluses before receiving that 
subsidy. It is not necessary to get that kind of reimbursement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very troubling about this.  When I was in my 
former capacity I wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer to ask if 
there was any kind of regulation of what happened to the moneys 
that were received by constituency associations of the various 
parties from the candidate election reimbursement.  His response 
based on the Canada Elections Act was that no, there was no such 
accountability.  In fact there are hundreds of riding 
associations for the various parties which receive tens of 
thousands of taxpayers' dollars out of this reimbursement who 
have to account to absolutely no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember in the last scandal-ridden Tory government that 
members of constituency association executives were flying on all 
expense paid, first class trips to Mexico to sun themselves on 
the sunny beaches of Mexico with the tax dollars that ended up in 
the constituency association accounts courtesy of the Canadian 
taxpayer. That is how the system works in too many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of the rules that we want to build into the system 
through legislation and regulation our friends in the Bloc and 
the NDP would like to try to monopolize the political process by 
forcing every dollar to be funded by the taxpayer with pages and 
pages of regulation. That does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does work is cutting the parties off from the public trough 
and that is what we propose to do today.  That is why we will be 
supporting this motion.

more than twisting the truth and making inaccurate statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious if in fact he returned his rebate cheque as he 
professes to be such a champion of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just did a quick calculation based on his $75 average donation 
to the Reform Party.  It would have taken about 4,000 
contributors of the Reform Party simply to pay for the Leader of 
the Opposition's suits. Do not call the kettle black. Those 
people are not being truthful with us.

Liberal Party never ceases to amaze me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, our party decided that we would not engage in the 
kind of unilateral disarmament that the Liberal Party would like 
us to.  We will not engage in unilateral disarmament but when we 
form the government, one of the first bills we will introduce in 
this place will be to eliminate the system of public financing of 
political parties. One of the things we will introduce will be 
legislation prohibiting the kind of leadership slush funds that 
the old establishment parties run for their leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right hon. the Prime Minister receives $300,000 to $400,000 
a year for entertainment expenses, travel expenses, personal 
expenses, money that is subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer.  I 
say shame on the Liberal Party. The old Tory party has its own 
leadership slush fund.  We do not know how much goes into those 
funds because they are not reported to anybody.  They are not 
required to be reported.  Who knows whether there is influence 
peddling going on through those leadership slush funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member opposite is will the Liberal Party of 
Canada table the books on the leadership slush fund of the Prime 
Minister and when will it do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Tempting as it may be to ask

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
benefit of those listening at home who are perhaps not really familiar 
with the political system, when a group of individuals has a certain 
ideology and wishes to promote it politically, they get together and 
decide to form a political party.  This is when the need for money 
arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step is to form a group and begin collecting money, prior 
to going to the polls:  buying advertising, getting known, publicizing 
the party's ideology, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where things get complicated.  Our party has a certain 
ideology.  We do not want to be linked to business.  That is why we form 
small teams. 
That is how it works in our ridings in Quebec.  We form small teams and 
we collect contributions in amounts of $5, $15, $20 and sometimes $100 
at a time.  Once in a while, there are large donors.  The members across 
the way talk about $1,000 contributions, but that is another realm 
entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will calm down a bit.  There is a world of difference between 
getting ready for an election when you are the Liberal Party of Canada 
and getting ready for an election when you are the Bloc Quebecois.  Both 
parties have to get out in the ridings, get to know people.  We, 
however, collect money by the sweat of our brow, while the other side 
has only to organize a few corporate financing activities.  They do not 
worry.  The money comes in and things are not complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is easy when you have money, but we believe in our 
principles. 
We have our own values and we will continue doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is interesting because it gives us the 
opportunity to hear such nonsense from the other party. For 
example, this morning, the member for Abitibi said, paper in hand, 
that when I was elected in the 1995 by-election, I had received 
funds from an unknown source. The money was simply given by the 
Bloc Quebecois' national organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be treated like a fool when it is so hard to 
collect money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of people like them that people are so cynical 
about politics. It is because of incidents like this one, because 
of the corruption going on, that they do not want to hear about 
politics. And you don't have to wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> According to our Standing Orders, comments 
must pertain to the speech of the last speaker, not to something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean to comment on 
what the hon. member for Calgary Southeast has just said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank, that 
will bring my blood pressure down a bit. I find this very interesting. 
I do not know whether I am turning red, green or whatever party color, 
but— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, all that I want to say is that I think there are 
people here who suffer from the Pinocchio syndrome and that today's 
debate is tinged with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> I know, Mr. Speaker, that certain words are 
not allowed in this Chamber. I find it somewhat absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague of the Reform Party. Does he not 
believe that financing by businesses should be abolished? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my goodness and I thought 
I could rant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's question.  It is a question that 
was very much to the point.  I would like to reiterate because he 
obviously did not hear the full extent of my remarks.  I did 
point out that the Reform Party is alone among political parties 
in Canada in relying so heavily upon the individual financial 
support of ordinary Canadians rather than the big money 
contributors to the old corrupt parties opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do appreciate quite sincerely the sentiment expressed 
by the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean that members should raise 
money from individuals and not from big business.  I would turn 
that around on the member and his colleagues in the Bloc to ask 
that perhaps he and his party should not ask Canadians to raise 
money from big government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are in favour of raising money from individuals let them 
do so, but what they propose to do in emulating the campaign 
finance laws of the province of Quebec is to increase massively 
the taxpayers' support and subsidy for political parties.  That 
is something that conscientious Canadians cannot support.  There 
are those who do believe that if political parties are to be 
funded they should be funded by voluntary individual 
contributions and neither by big labour nor by big business nor 
by big government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have some very clear questions for the member.  He 
refused to answer the questions when they came up before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party established a fund for their leader's 
personal expenses, did that portion of the contributions that 
were raised which resulted in a tax rebate refunded back to the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is opposed to corporate giving.  Was the 12% or 14% of 
corporate giving that was given to the Reform Party returned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Opposition said that he would not live in 
Stornoway, that he would turn it into a bingo hall.  Now that he 
is living in it and it is costing taxpayers money, is the Reform 
Party going to repay the government for that as he indicated it 
would? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that there should not be public financing 
of campaigns, are the Reform members going to write a cheque back 
to the government for the rebate?  Is the Reform Party going to 
refuse the rebate?  Is it going to return it? I ask that the 
member opposite who just gave the speech answer those questions 
very specifically. Will he return the money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I attempted to do just 
that in response to the hon. member from Cambridge.  I said that 
our party does not support unilateral disarmament politically. 
We are already at a huge disadvantage because we do not have 
influence to peddle.  We do not occupy high office in government 
at this point so we do not get the kind of $500 a plate big 
business dinners that the Liberal Party sells out across the 
country.  We have to rely on individual contributors.  We are not 
going to engage in unilateral disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If every other party gave back their rebates and reimbursements 
and tax credits, we would do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order. It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Employment Insurance; the hon. 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
Transitional Jobs Fund; the hon. member for Sackville—Eastern 
Shore, Canada Post.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois needed an issue to shore up his leadership. The leader of 
the PQ branch office dragged the governement and several individuals 
through the mud, in short, he belittled this whole institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But after oral question period, we realized that his research 
department was nothing more than a newspaper clippings department. And 
since they were somewhat insulted when they realized that maybe the 
Conservative Party had a foothold, he decided that it was the ploy he 
needed to strenghen his leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their balloon went bust, they need a plan B. This morning they were 
talking about allegations, and now they are saying: “No, no, this is not 
in the motion. 
The motion says that the issue of public financing should be reviewed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they do not have anything more to say on the matter of 
allegations, they are trying to patch things up; as we know, the only 
purpose of the Bloc is to play havoc with people's reputation, to do 
anything they can in favour of separation, their nice principles are 
nothing but double standards; the only thing they are interested in is 
in promoting separation, by every means at their disposal, and i do mean 
every means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the allegations made by the member for 
Laurentides. She claimed that the employment centre had been moved from 
Saint-Jérôme to Saint-Antoine supposedly because of some contributions, 
that it was suspicious, that there was a consensus in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will set the record straight, and it is important because if we 
want to create a relationship based on trust between voters and the 
House, if we want to regain the credibility the Bloc is undermining 
daily, it is important to set the record straight. They talk about 
allegations, but I will talk about facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Human Resources Development tried to find 
premises for the Canada Employment Centre in Saint-Jérôme because the 
lease expired on May 31, 1998. The Department of Public Works called for 
tenders. The lease was allocated in an open, equitable and transparent 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, our goal was to accommodate the needs of the client 
and get the best value for money for Canadian taxpayers. Therefore, we 
chose the lowest bidder. 
By doing so, we will save $280,000 over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they say: “This is terrible”. They accused me of being narrow 
minded, they used strong words. When they have no point, they use strong 
words. They claim that there was a regional consensus. To begin with, I 
would like to remind you that Saint-Antoine-des-Laurentides is located 
1.4 kilometres from Saint-Jérôme and is still in the riding of 
Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they were moaning and groaning, the government said: “It is 
important that the population have an employment centre; it must 
therefore stay in the riding”. But those on the other side do not 
mention that, it bothers them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a news release dated September 25, 1997, from the office of 
the mayor of Saint-Antoine, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign that some members of the MRC of 
Rivière-du-Nord have been waging for three weeks is giving the 
Municipalité régionale du comté de Rivière-du-Nord a 
reputation for partisanship and we therefore have an 
obligation to condemn this situation and the actions of those 
involved immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public's perception of elected officials in each town 
and municipality is very critical and rightly so. Our 
perception is all the more critical when the nine mayors of 
the MRC are grouped in the council that forms the MRC. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can read this or table it if you wish. They said, among other 
things, that the important thing was to get better value for money for 
the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we believe that as the letter from Minister 
Pettigrew on September 16, 1997 indicated, the decision 
regarding the Canada Employment Centre must be a business 
decision based on the best value for money. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is signed Normand Plouffe, mayor of Saint-Antoine; Gilles Cyr, 
mayor of the municipality of Prévost; Denis Y. Laflamme, mayor of the 
municipality of Saint-Hippolyte; Gilles Papineau, mayor of the 
municipality of New Glascow; and Hervé Gagné, acting for the 
municipality of Saint-Colomban at the MRC.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what that means? For those who do not know the riding 
of Laurentides, I can speak about it because I come from the nearby city 
of Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that not only there was no consensus, but that almost a 
majority of the regional council's members thought it was a good thing 
because the change was necessary. Again and again, those members make a 
fuss. There is moaning and groaning, low-down party politics about some 
allegedly partisan changes, but that is not true. Once again, the 
government stood up for the population. It wanted to save that 
employment centre for its users and, above all, wanted to save money to 
benefit taxpayers. What does that mean? It means that in these difficult 
economic times, we have no money to waste. That is my answer to the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much foolishness and stupidity, how many false allegations did 
we hear from the Bloc Quebecois?  You have to understand one thing. 
They are trying to find a ploy, any ploy, because their leader is 
threatened. He fears that he might get the same medicine his predecessor 
got.  I do not understand.  The Bloc had a good leader in the hon. 
member for Roberval, but now the same thing seems to be starting all 
over again.  I can hardly wait for Christmas.  Things will probably 
happen.  Some hon. members here, who are looking at us, played a little 
political game.  They might play it again because things are not going 
very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they are supposed to be talking about donations to political 
parties.  We are accused of being the puppets of the corporations. 
Questions are being raised about our electoral system, which is probably 
one of the most highly regarded in the world.  Why do we keep sending 
delegations around the world? 
Bloc members know it, they are included in the delegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, they didn't miss any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> When we send a delegation abroad, they are glad 
to come along.  The system works when it suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> With Canada, as Canada's representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> They represent Canada, how ironic.  I am glad. 
But now, we are being told we are the puppets of the corporations.  You 
cannot put a number on a principle.  You cannot put a price on a 
principle.  Whether you accept one, 27 or 100,000 contributions, it is 
all the same.  If you agree with the principle you should set an 
example.  They say: the legislation is there, we accepted only 27 
donations.  Does it mean they are the puppets of those who donated to 
their party? 
When the member for Drummond gets a contribution of $1,500, when the 
candidate in Laval West, Michel Leduc, gets a contribution of $2,000, 
are they the puppets of the contributors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Bloc members have a short memory. When we do some research, 
when we do not read the papers, just to prepare for our period of 
questions, when we do some real research, we realize that, on the Bloc 
side—I do not know if this is customary, I hope not. On October 3, 
1993, an article said that enumerators, not the Liberal candidate, 
because what was said earlier is false, not the Liberal candidate, but 
enumerators who were to be employed by Elections Canada, had some 
complaints about the member for Témiscamingue and his team. I will read 
this, this is too serious. 
I am disappointed by this sort of things. Yes, I have been running for 
election for a long time, but I am in politics to represent the people 
and to get rid of the cynicism that we constantly see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article reads as follows: “The methods of the organization of 
Pierre Brien, a Bloc Quebecois candidate in the riding of Témiscamingue, 
have led to protests by enumerators for Elections Canada, who were 
allegedly under pressure to give up half of their salary as a voluntary 
contribution to this same political organization and, most important, it 
demanded postdated cheques because it needed some cash”. Not only it is 
poor, but it wants postdated cheques drawn on public funds. This is 
appalling. This is unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can find many examples of people screaming blue murder as well 
as of whited sepulchres, an expression so dear to their spiritual leader 
René Lévesque. Some people should look at themselves in the mirror. This 
does not come from a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So you want names? Five enumerators in Authier-Nord and Macamic; 
Pierre Boucher and Martine Lefebvre are mentioned. They say “He asked 
$160 in my case and $200 in mine”. If I were in their shoes, I would be 
ashamed. This does not make any sense. They should start reading their 
polls and asking themselves why people rate them so poorly on 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all been elected, we know how it works. Most of those 
people who work are needy, they need a little money to be able to 
finish paying for their food.  And what do we see? We see the 
people opposite doing this sort of things. They should be ashamed 
to prey on people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the whole issue of contributions and see that, to 
make ends meet, all they have to do is accept a loan, because they need 
cash, so they go to the Mouvement Desjardins and get a $1.5 million loan 
at preferred rates. I for one am not able to get preferred rates. 
However, because the chairman of the Mouvement Desjardins, Claude 
Béland, is a committed separatist—we have seen it, he has said so 
often on television—well, he told them: “This can be arranged. We 
will arrange that for you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they said: “OK, but this is not a donation, it is a 
loan”. Yes, but it is cash, it is preferred rates. What does it 
mean? Are they in the pay of the Mouvement Desjardins? 
Does that mean that, because of the Mouvement Desjardins, each time we 
have a legislation on banks, they will all take position for the 
Mouvement Desjardins? Is that what it means? Then they y get their 
marching orders from the Mouvement Desjardins. That is pretty serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been whining once more because it does not 
understand a single thing. They must be from another planet or from 
another galaxy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has received 925 contributions from corporations 
for a total of $815,520. And now, they want to fool around with the 
repayment of expenses. I would like the Reform Party to move a motion to 
the effect that they will hand back all the money they were reimbursed. 
Give that money to us. We will give it back to Election Canada and it 
will be invested in job creation. That should be all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Bloc is nothing but a branch of the Quebec 
government. Many questions beg to be asked. Once more today, Bloc 
members have played holier than thou. 
When they realized there would be no allegations—I hope they will 
apologize. I hope they will apologize to Jacques Roy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had a whole series of questions, but when they realized a 
letter confirmed Jacques Roy was not being investigated, they scrapped 
their oral question period and resorted to plan B. They started to talk 
about financing for political parties by the public again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been allegations from businessmen in the Outaouais area 
to the effect that they were pressured by PQ organizers to contribute to 
the PQ campaign after getting contracts during the construction of the 
casino. The question is not whether a minimum of $3,000 was set. The 
issue is that they were pressured to contribute. Who is their leader? 
The real Bloc leader is Lucien Bouchard. I hope they will give me an 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their good friend, the member for Richelieu, the Minister of 
International Relations, who begs for yes votes abroad with 
taxpayers' money, who is responsible for the Outaouais region, 
awarded a lavish contract for professional services, at a cost of 
$577,328, to a political sympathizer, Jean Fournier, Jean Rochon's 
former chief of staff. I understands why he left. I hope that Jean 
Rochon, the health minister, will do the same. Since August 14, Mr. 
Fournier has acted as consultant on new technologies for Quebec's 
general delegation in Paris. They created that post to get that 
amount. We are well informed. We did our homework. Do you want 
other examples? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Le Hir report was put aside because it did not suit their 
purpose. 
Do you remember all the irregularities that were found in the 
procurement process? Oops, I forgot. Poof! like today's balloon, it 
is gone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yvon Cyrenne, one of the authors of the Le Hir report—it 
was quite the profitable venture, as a lot of money went into it— 
gave $900 to the Parti Quebecois in 1994. Yvon Martineau, who was 
appointed president of Hydro-Quebec when Mr. Parizeau was in 
office, contributed $1,000 just before he was appointed. That is 
the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> How much did he give after? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> We do not know, he left. The Parti 
Quebecois MNA, Marie Malavoy, was not even a Canadian citizen. 
Not only did she vote, but she contributed financially to the Parti 
Quebecois. How many dinners did they have—we know perfectly well how it 
works—with Landry, Bouchard, and particularly Chevrette because he is 
the one who awards grants? “A $1,000 or $2,000 donation will fix 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth may come as a shock. Again, I may expose myself to some 
low blows for my efforts, but the truth must be told. If grassroots 
financing is to be seriously discussed, I am all for it. But let us not 
trade four quarters for $1. Too many times have I seen board members 
make contributions on behalf of a company. They had conveniently 
forgotten how to add. It was not $1,000, but ten $100 donations. They 
received many such donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes my blood boil is that they are ready to do anything in 
the name of separation. They should be ashamed. They are ready to do 
anything. 
How many lowdown dirty tricks and so-called policy statements have we 
seen or heard in the last two weeks? They should have done their 
homework and they should wait for the RCMP to complete its investigation 
so they can know the truth. What irritates me most is to see those 
people pounce on one victim after the other under some convenient 
excuse, like a pitbull on a bone, because if you believe in their cause, 
you simply do not count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the members of the Bloc should engage in some serious 
soul-searching and add an item to the agenda for their next caucus 
meeting to discuss how to treat individuals, and our legal system, with 
respect. Our society is based on the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that, maybe question period will be less interesting but it 
will be more significant because people's integrity, and that of this 
institution, will be preserved. 
I am not surprised to see the shame on their faces. You should have seen 
their faces. Unfortunately, our viewers did not see them when we 
produced the letter establishing that Jacques Roy was not under 
investigation. They lost their only chance to save their leader, Gilles 
Duceppe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People's reputations were sullied. I hope that during the question 
period that will follow my speech we will hear excuses, and that efforts 
will be made to restore people's integrity. They have shown their true 
colours. Many dishonest things were said, but I remain confident. Those 
people across the way were elected democratically and they have some 
intellectual integrity. I remain confident—I hope—that they will 
put their meanness aside to preserve people's integrity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am a 
little surprised to hear the remarks made by the member for 
Bourassa, who portrays himself as the champion of democracy in 
Quebec and in Canada. If my memory serves me correctly—he will 
correct me in his response—he was the one who told one of our 
colleagues, the incumbent candidate in Bourassa, to go back home 
if he did not agree with his political option. I do not consider 
that to be a very democratic gesture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not recall hearing him apologize, but I am sure that, if we 
give him the opportunity to apologize in this House today on his own 
behalf and on behalf of Canadians, because people are entitled to their 
opinions, 
he will certainly take this opportunity and apologize for these nasty 
remarks. The member sitting next to him will certainly join me in urging 
him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He named two individuals, Mr. Martineau and another man, who gave 
$900 and $1,000 respectively. As a matter of fact, the provincial 
legislation on the financing of political parties says that only 
individuals can contribute to election funds, which is perfectly legal 
and honest. I do not think that a person should be denied the right to 
contribute to a political party's coffers because he or she holds a 
position in a company, organization or institution. 
The law gives everybody this right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about two people. I would like to ask the very 
determined member for Bourassa, who tried four times to join us because 
he liked it so much, what he thinks of David Berger being appointed 
ambassador to Israel so that he could make room for a new candidate? 
What does he think of Lucie Blais, the Liberal candidate who was 
defeated in Abitibi in 1993, who was appointed to the board of directors 
of the National Council of Welfare? What does he think of Margo 
Brousseau, the Liberal candidate who was defeated in Louis-Hébert, who 
was appointed to the board of directors of the Quebec Port Corporation, 
with a per diem of around $300? What does he think of Gaétan Dumas, the 
former member for Richmond-Wolfe, and of Pierre Gravel, Delton Sams and 
Maurice Tremblay, who must have got their smiles back after landing some 
very generous contracts with Justice Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of the hon. member for Laval West and of Joan 
Kouri, who were defeated in Laval East and Brome—Missisquoi 
respectively in 1993 and are now earning $86,400 as immigration 
commissioners? What does he think of Angéline Fournier, a Liberal 
candidate and a good friend of Guy Bertrand, who was awarded a major 
contract by the Council for Canadian Unity? What does he think of 
Aurélien Gill, the Liberal candidate who was defeated in Roberval, who 
was appointed to the National Economic Development Board, with a per 
diem of $500? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of Senator Hervieux-Payette being appointed to 
the Senate so that she could let another candidate have her seat? 
What does he think of Rita Lavoie, the Liberal candidate defeated in 
Manicouagan, being appointed to the board of directors of the Business 
Development Bank of Canada? What does he think of Eric Lemieux, the 
Liberal candidate defeated in Bellechasse, being appointed to the board 
of directors of the National Museum of Science and Technology with a 
salary of $300 a day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of André Ouellet's appointment to Canada Post 
with a $160,000 salary? What does he think of the awarding in 1993 to 
the hon. member for La Prairie, who was then an election candidate in La 
Prairie, of a CIDA contract worth $99,500, since a $100,000 contract 
would have required a call for tenders? What does he think of the 
awarding to Michelle Tisseyre, the Liberal candidate defeated in 
Laurentides in 1993, of a seven-month $60,000 contract from the Privy 
Council? Not too shabby, is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of the appointment of Kimon Valaskakis, the 
defeated Liberal candidate, as ambassador to OCDE with a $115,000 
salary? 
What does he think of the appointments to ministers' offices of defeated 
candidates like Claire Brouillet, Guy Chartrand, Benoît Chiquette, Jean 
Pelletier, Camille Samson and himself. Is this partisanship?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I would rather see Kimon Valaskakis appointed 
ambassador to the OECD than see Richard Therrien, a former member of the 
FLQ, sit with his PQ friends as a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I opened the door to them. I gave them the time to apologize. But 
they won't apologize, after all. I was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not question the competence of people. Most of these 
people are great Canadians. These are people who have done and will 
continue to do a lot for the Canadian people, for the Canadian 
government. Certainly, we will never be able to appoint a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois Canadian ambassador again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the bubble has gone bust, now that they have shown their 
true colours, I hope that they will take the opportunity to apologize. 
They resorted to low blows. Some people told me: “You should speak up, 
Denis. A Bloc member has used wiretapping in the past”. I will not get 
into that. I find this appalling. I will not speak about that. I will 
forget about the methods of the MP for Témiscamingue. He is older now 
and I hope he has learned his lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the legislation on the financing of federal 
political parties. We could make some amendments. They can play at 
holier than thou and act outraged, but one thing is certain, I'd rather 
have an imperfect system in place than a perfect system in limbo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it has been an interesting afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering why the hon. member from the government side 
would give such a compliment to the Reform Party.  He said we 
were on a different planet.  I am sure he means a higher planet 
because I am sure they would not want to degrade a member of 
Parliament.  We really accept that type of adjustment.  It is 
encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just wondering what influence peddling means.  We had a 
flood in Manitoba as members know, and as soon as the election 
was announced we saw 12 Liberals paddling down the river with 
$5,000 cheques and vote, vote, vote Liberal.  Well six of them 
have floated right down the river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funny part was that all of a sudden, because there was an 
election and the Conservatives, Reform and NDP were running, they 
decided that this honest, accountable Liberal government had made 
some mistakes in accounting from the floods of 1993 and 1995 so 
they just handed us a little cheque for $1.25 million.  Boy, we 
loved that.  Finally the Liberals admitted they had made a little 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I do not know what is happening.  I received a letter from a 
constituent here in Ontario suggesting that she feels sorry for 
the Liberal members who made these huge pledges or influence 
peddling during the flood, but these poor people are still 
waiting for that promise that was made.  They are living in house 
trailers because their homes still have not been redone.  She 
recommends that these hon. members from the government side 
should move into trailers for the winter in order to see how it 
feels, to see if that is influence peddling or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So thanks for raising us to a higher planet.  We really 
appreciate that.

issue, I come to the conclusion they are no better than the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, with your permission, I will share my time with the member 
for Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today in the context of the first 
opposition day of the Bloc Quebecois in the 36th legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my first speech here since the House reconvened, I 
would like to thank the voters of the riding of Laval Centre for 
re-electing me to represent them in the federal Parliament.  The 
Bloc Quebecois has the majority of Quebec members in this House. 
Together with the other 43 members of the Bloc Quebecois, I will 
defend the interests of Quebeckers, and especially those of my 
constituents in Laval Centre, with pride and determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on the motion tabled earlier by  the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois and amended by my colleague for Laurentides, 
which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the attitude of the Government, 
which refuses to introduce in-depth reform of the legislation 
on the financing of federal political parties even though the 
existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With allegations of influence peddling within the Liberal 
Party and the government appearing in the headlines for over a week 
now, everyone in Quebec will recognize the importance of this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, to begin with, I will briefly review the facts. 
Last October 1, following up on a question asked in the House, the 
Solicitor General of Canada, the minister responsible for the RCMP, 
stated that he was not aware of an RCMP investigation concerning 
the fundraising practices in Quebec of the Liberal party of Canada. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development had to admit publicly, 
a few minutes later, that he himself had informed the RCMP of the 
allegations of influence peddling, and that this had been prior to 
the election call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the days that followed, we learned that the Prime Minister, 
his executive assistant, the President of Treasury Board and the 
Minister of Public Works were all aware as well of allegations 
involving a Liberal Party of Canada staffer and an assistant to the 
President of Treasury Board. 
In the next few days, will there be anyone left in the Liberal 
Party and in the government who will not be implicated in this dark 
story of Liberal Party of Canada fundraising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get the impression that we are watching a rerun of what 
happened to the Conservative Party in connection with influence 
peddling.  Everyone will remember all the influence peddling 
scandals that surrounded the Conservatives when they were in 
power. At that time, the Liberals took delight in denouncing 
them.  Now the Liberals find themselves in a similar situation, 
one that is equally uncomfortable and the morality of which is 
dubious and then some.  Proof of that, the Prime Minister is not 
embarrassed to admit that his famous, still secret and rather 
nebulous code of ethics does not apply in this case of alleged 
influence peddling. This is corroborated by the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, who is himself responsible for 
organizing the Liberal Party in Quebec. The latter has even 
stated that the only code respected by the Liberal Party was the 
Criminal Code.  That is at least some reassurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government cleaned up the rules regarding the financing 
of federal political parties, such a situation could not occur.  In 
this House, only the Bloc Quebecois adheres to clear rules for 
financing, for it has chosen to respect the wishes of Quebeckers on 
the democratic financing of political parties. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the spirit in which the Bloc Quebecois abides by the Quebec 
Act to govern the financing of political parties. You will recall that 
the Quebec National Assembly passed this act during the first mandate of 
the Lévesque government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to many observers of the political scene in Quebec, it 
contributed to cleaning up the financing of political parties and as a 
result reduced considerably the influence of big corporations on 
political parties and governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its arrival in the federal arena, on several occasions the 
Bloc Quebecois has defended the principle of democratic financing of 
political parties. Already in 1994, my colleague for Richelieu moved a 
motion to the effect that only voters be allowed to contribute to 
political parties. 
We raised the issue again during the debate on Bill C-63, an act to 
amend the Canada Elections Act and the federal Referendum Act. It was a 
good opportunity, you might say a golden opportunity, to review the way 
federal political parties are financed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, every single amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois in this 
regard was defeated by the Liberals as well as the Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you some data to illustrate the fundamental 
difference an act such as the one in Quebec can make. Any given year 
between 1983 and 1990, 40% of the 500 biggest corporations in Canada and 
35% of the 155 biggest financial institutions in Canada made a financial 
contribution to a federal political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1974 and 1990, less than 2% of voters saw fit to contribute 
to a federal political organization in any one of those years.  No need 
for an extensive analysis to see that, unlike individuals, businesses 
are very interested in funding federal political parties who flirt with 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can easily imagine that the influence of big corporations on 
the government far exceeds that of citizens.  Nobody in this 
House will be surprised to learn that in 1995, not so long ago, 
the Liberal Party of Canada collected $7.51 million from 
businesses: for example, Nesbitt-Burns gave $88,424, Bombardier 
contributed $62,884 and the Toronto Dominion Bank, who was more 
restrained, gave a mere $40,234. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members respect the rules prevailing in Quebec.  Our 
party is funded by voters. 
In 1996 for example, the Bloc Quebecois received $1,159,685 from 17,030 
voters; that means an average contribution of $68.08 for my colleagues 
from the other side who like accuracy so much.  In my riding, Laval 
Centre, 345 individuals gave $19,141.25, for an average contribution of 
$55.50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, it is with great pride that I thank these men and women who 
believe in the Bloc Quebecois and who democratically contribute to our 
party because they believe in democracy.  These men and women 
financially support a party which expresses their hopes and not one 
which promises proximity to power in exchange for a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see that the Quebec legislation makes place for the 
citizens by keeping corporations away from political party financing. 
This contributes highly to a more democratic political life and ensures 
healthier political practices than those we have seen at the federal 
level, particularly over the last few weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure you will agree with me: political virginity is very 
fragile.  However, it seems this government is not even interested in 
restoring its own image.  It is too difficult a task evidently.  Secrecy 
has become an institution, with the approval of those who should be 
protecting democracy.

bad shape.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
speeches about the various systems, whether in the federal government or 
the Quebec government.  When I was in the National Assembly, there was 
always a lot of criticism.  Whatever system we have it will draw 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the situation in the United States and in most other 
countries.  Stop any ten persons in the street and ask them, whether in 
Ontario or Quebec—not in the United States, but in Canada—if they 
think that our system to raise funds for political parties is honest, 
equitable and free from interference.  Nine out of ten will ask you: Do 
you think I am naive?  No one believes that the system works honestly. 
This is sad, but it is possible in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two or three years ago, I tabled a private member's bill based on 
a study of the financing of political parties in Canada, done by a New 
Brunswick University student working for his Ph.D.  I got in touch with 
him and, together, we prepared something.  The problem with my bill was 
probably its simplicity.  I proposed to prohibit anyone—companies, 
unions, individuals—from contributing to political parties. It is up 
to us, the people, to give the various political parties the means to 
finance their activities.  I have done some research with the Department 
of National Revenue and, considering what it is costing the government 
right now, it would be cheaper to pay the political parties directly 
according to a set formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to introduce a similar bill again and I would like to ask 
the hon. member this question. 
Do you think that you and your colleagues could support a bill that said 
it is up to the government, that is the people, to finance political 
parties.  No money from companies, no fundraisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral: </B>Mr. Speaker, if I understand 
correctly what my hon. colleague from Gatineau said, I have every reason 
to believe that he will very strongly support the motion put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government should take the time to take a good long 
look at party financing. Nothing is perfect. It is quite obvious that 
the very poor opinion voters in general have of party financing comes in 
part from the ease with which, at the federal level, companies can 
finance the government party and the various parties that may take 
office some day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I count on the hon. member for Gatineau, of course, to convince his 
colleagues to vote in favour of the opposition's motion. 
In doing so, he would clearly demonstrate his sincerity and the 
importance he gives to intelligent, logical and reasonable party 
financing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
start by congratulating my hon. colleague from Laval Centre on 
delivering an excellent speech. Its dispassionateness and logic was in 
sharp contrast with the very passionate, demagogic and, I would add, 
acid and acrimonious remarks made earlier by the hon. member for 
Bourassa. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Bourassa went to great lengths in his remarks to 
sidetrack the debate, first by trying to sully the Bloc Quebecois 
when he should be looking at the mistakes made by his own party 
or allegations concerning them, and second by saying that the 
“balloon” had busted, when the party he represents is still 
facing allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague, the hon. member for Laval Centre, 
if she does not also make a direct connection between allowing political 
parties to be financed by companies and the risk of influence peddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer very 
quickly.  It is very clear that if a large company—I mentioned Nesbitt 
Burns—telephoned my office and they had really made a very large 
contribution to the financing of my party, I can tell you that I would 
take the call very quickly if I were the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I am certain that, since the Prime Minister is a very efficient 
man, as is well known, he would pick it up very quickly, as though it 
were a red phone. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I usually begin my 
speeches by saying that I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to 
whatever the topic is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that today I listened carefully all day long to the 
various speeches from the members opposite, particularly those from the 
member for Abitibi and the member for Bourassa.  I am not sure that I am 
really pleased to be speaking after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now look what they are waving instead of the Canadian flag— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> —to break our concentration. 
Could you please get serious? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure hon. members are well aware of the 
Standing Orders.  Props are not permitted in the House.  Perhaps 
the member could leave that under the desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely important issue 
and I congratulate the hon. member for Gatineau, even though he sits 
across the floor. I clearly remember speaking to his motion and, in my 
opinion, his point of view makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he had talked to a lot of people in his riding and 
elsewhere in Quebec. He said that 90% of these people had lost 
confidence in the financing of political parties in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Bloc Quebecois members want to convince this House to do like 
Quebec and to pass an act limiting the financing of political parties to 
individuals, as opposed to businesses, given the risk of influence 
peddling or undue influence. It is a difficult thing to do, as the hon. 
member for Laval Centre explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times, when large sums of money are involved, and I will discuss 
these later on, it is difficult to say no to someone who wants to make 
a contribution to a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member goes further and says that perhaps the financing of 
political parties should be provided exclusively by the government. He 
did not have time to elaborate, but I understand his point of view. What 
is the purpose of his proposal? It is to achieve a balance between 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financing of the New Democratic Party is no better, in the 
sense that it is provided by unions.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting it is illegal. Under the present legislation, 
it is perfectly legal, but the NDP has very often taken positions that 
are influenced by union demands. In a way, their position is not any 
better, because it is biased the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to achieve a better balance, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
suggest political parties should be financed by small contributions from 
individuals. Hundreds or thousands of individuals would be financing the 
various political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last report, the one for 1996, we are told that the Bloc 
Quebecois received contributions from more than 17,000 individuals in 
all ridings. So, we should not show any undue preference for one group 
or the other. 
Contributions of $100 or even as low as $5, $10, or $15 in many cases 
are not going to influence a member or a party in any way. It is the big 
contributions that have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Quebec legislation on political party financing, 
contributions over $3,000 are not allowed. If the same thing applied at 
the federal level, we would see some improvement. That was the second 
goal of the legislation on political party financing, Bill 2. The first 
legislation that was passed by the Parti Quebecois in 1977 was Bill 2. 
The first bill was on linguistic matters. But Bill 2 was passed first 
because it needed less extensive consultations. It was passed in May 
1977 by the Parti Quebecois. René Lévesque, whose memoirs I have been 
reading for a second time recently, was really insisting on that piece 
of legislation. It was really standing out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did René Lévesque want to make this a priority? Those who know 
something about his political career will recall that he is the one who 
nationalized power companies in Quebec, and he has been put under 
intense pressure at that time. He did not want other democratically 
elected parties to be put under undue pressure by companies trying to 
protect their interests. He did not want governments that would be bound 
and gagged by legal entities like corporations, groups, businesses or 
unions. Individual citizens were to make the decisions in a very 
democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to the hon. member for Gatineau because his 
suggestion deserves some consideration. 
I invite him to reintroduce his bill so we can look at it, because it 
would a step in the right direction. The goal is to achieve a balance, 
to avoid abuse and, more importantly, to restore public confidence in 
federal and provincial political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the process has already been completed. All parties 
agree with it. The idea of going back to the old system never occurred 
to the Quebec Liberal Party which, led by Mr. Bourassa, came back to 
power for nine years. The Quebec Liberals know—and so should the 
member for Bourassa, who worked with them, and, for that matter, all 
Quebec MPs—how proud Quebeckers are of that change. Perhaps there is 
room for improvement. Anything can be improved. 
Perfection may be an unreachable goal, but this is a major step towards 
a better democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I want to talk about two particularly painful 
experiences as a Quebecker. I am referring to the two referendums held 
in 1980 and 1995. In both cases, some major companies influenced public 
opinion in Quebec and had a bearing on the political future of 
Quebeckers. If you look at the report on the last federal election, you 
see amounts such as $61,000 from Microsoft Canada, $53,000 from Nesbitt 
Burns Inc., $50,000 from Charman Securities Co., $70,469 from Scotia 
McLeod Inc., and $66,000 from the Toronto Dominion Bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, in all reports, even going back ten years, it is 
often the banks who are the biggest contributors to the federal 
political parties.  Curiously, they are doing well these days, 
making record profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to make any changes to the monetary system, because 
there is the Bank Act.  The Liberal Party says it is hard.  But 
when it comes to cutting the deficit, for example, to changing the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, to bringing the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund up to close to $14 billion, then there 
is no hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if the Liberals were limited to collecting contributions 
only from Canada's unemployed, I can tell you that they would not 
have raised much in the last election.  They would not have got 
much from the unemployed in the Maritimes.  But they did get a 
nasty message, they were nearly wiped out in the Maritimes.  The 
New Democratic Party got a pretty good showing, the Conservatives 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were messages the Liberal Party did not get.  I think 
the hon. member for Gatineau go the message, when he admitted that 
90% of the population no longer has confidence in the present 
system of corporate funding for political parties, and he is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, further to 
the remarks by the member for Lévis, I tried the system in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at my notes for the 1988 election, I see I had 109 
individuals contribute $23,870 to my riding fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> And how much from business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:</B> Nothing, zilch.  I tried this system of 
public funding.  It is true.  It is in my notes and in the books in 
the library. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wanted to answer the member for Témiscamingue.  Earlier 
he said that nine individuals had contributed to his campaign fund 
in 1993.  In the 1984 elections, I received $8,015 from 
individuals.  In 1988, $23,870; in 1993, $1,950.  In these three 
elections, I received $33,835 from 198 individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, from business, I received $17,940; in 1988, nothing; 
and in 1993, $9,400.  I received $27,340 from 126 businesses.  That 
means I was a better candidate.  I got 198 donations from 
individuals and 126 from businesses.  That is a matter of record. 
It is in the library. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to the comments by the member for Lévis and 
what the Liberal member for Gatineau said on funding.  It is true, 
but we should go a little lower than $5,000.  If there were a free 
vote in the House, I would be the first to vote in favour, because 
I think it is a fine method.  You look to the people and find the 
way to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted. I do not know if it 
was just my speech or the combined effect of all the speeches made by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, as well as the one by the hon. member for 
Gatineau, but I have been listening to the hon. member for Abitibi and 
I find he has come a very long way. At this rate, we stand a chance of 
having him vote with us on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not be his first about-face, mind you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> He has switched parties once already, at least. 
If we listen closely to what he is saying, without interrupting, we 
notice that the more he speaks, the more he makes our case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “I changed my mind to some extent. I tried the other 
system, where individuals finance political parties”. It sounded as if 
it had not worked. So much so that he switched parties. But we must look 
at the reason for that. That is when this system becomes important. 
When he was defeated, he was running as a Conservative candidate. You 
will recall that, when the Conservatives were in office last, they 
really did a job on the unemployed, if I can put it that way. 
I understand the people from the Abitibi. He voted against the 
bill, but people were still upset at him because he was a Conservative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a member of the opposition for a while. Then he did some 
thinking and came back on the government's side. Things were a little 
better this year, but he still not convinced. When you think of it, he 
agrees with us. He is becoming more and more reasonable. It is 
encouraging. It means we are not wasting our time talking in this House. 
We are succeeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leaves the member for Bourassa, who has finally put his little 
toy and flag away. 
Things are also improving on that front. We must take action, with the 
help of the Chair, but things slowly change. It encourages us to keep 
going.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member for Lévis. I 
am a new member in this House, but I agree with him that it is sometimes 
annoying to see people trying to distract those who are speaking. 
Whatever happened to the freedom of speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lévis gave a great speech and I also 
appreciated the comments made by the member for Gatineau, who made a 
very intelligent presentation. I hope we will continue in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my new colleague, the member 
for Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he says is important.  Parliament is a place where we may 
exercise our right to speak, but in order to do so properly, we must 
respect the right of others to speak.  Sometimes, people are aggressive 
in their remarks, but they are always respectful and use parliamentary 
language, and when there are small lapses, the Speaker may intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like this, but when people get carried away, and trade insults 
back and forth, particularly the member for Abitibi and the new member 
for Bourassa today, he should take another look at what he said in 
<I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, at his heckling during other members' speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rare that I make this sort of remark.  I hope, along with the 
member for Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, that, in future, things will 
continue to improve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened carefully all day to this debate on the funding of 
the electoral system in Canada.  I really regret that the members 
opposite, in the heat of the moment no doubt, seem to have 
forgotten that we are debating one of the foundations of one of 
the most successful democracies in the world, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is a Bloc motion, I know that the Bloc has no interest 
in the future of this great country, but I do believe that the 
members of the other parties opposite, like ourselves, do believe 
in the future of Canada and do believe that Canada is successful 
because of the strength of its democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in the debate I would like to ask all members to 
take a step back and think calmly about the strength and 
integrity of the electoral process here in Canada.  Let us 
consider some of the many facets of our electoral system that 
give it the reputation it so richly deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in so many other fields, Canada is internationally 
acknowledged as a leader in electoral management.  This 
acknowledgement is also evident here at home at the provincial 
and municipal levels. 
Our electoral system serves Canadians well as they exercise their 
democratic right to vote. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750
<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on some specific illustrations to support this 
point.  First, I point to the independent and non-partisan nature 
of the office of the chief electoral officer.  We consciously set 
this officer apart to ensure the electoral process is fair and 
non-partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the case, as members know.  For example, in the last 
two general elections there have been no election scandals 
reported to the commissioner of Elections Canada.  Canadians 
elections are not tainted by the machinations we so often see in 
other countries, machinations which rob the citizens of those 
countries of their vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, should there be any complaints they would be 
considered and prosecuted if necessary by an independent 
commissioner.  Every system set up by human beings has its 
limitations and every good human system, if it is well designed, 
has to have a mechanism for dealing with problems as they arise, 
and that is the case here. We have an independent commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally fundamental to the strength of our democracy are the 
principles and key elements which imbue the Canada Elections Act 
and speak to excellent elections management in this country.  The 
principles of the act are fairness to candidates and electors, 
participation to encourage candidates to come forward and 
electors to vote, and transparency in financial contributions and 
elections costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit no election system in the world is more transparent 
than that of this country.  The four key elements of the 
electoral regime further support the lofty but for Canadians 
attainable objective of fair and effectively managed elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first element is spending limits to ensure an equal playing 
field among candidates. The second is public funding, that is to 
say partial reimbursement of expenses and tax deductions to 
enhance participation. This has been discussed today. This public 
funding is a balance of private support and public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element is public disclosure of expenses to enhance 
transparency.  The fourth is access to broadcasting to ensure 
that all parties' messages are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress among those the spending limits.  In my mind these are 
very special elements of our system. Even if you have the money, 
even if you are very wealthy in this country because of the 
spending limits you cannot buy your way to elected office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles and key elements are reflected throughout the 
Canada Elections Act and give us a system we can all be proud of, 
one that works well for Canadian democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the interest of many other countries in our 
election process as a reflection of our own ability to manage 
elections.  Elections Canada has worked with over 80 countries 
providing expertise and advice in electoral management.  In some 
instances Canadian election officials travel to these other 
countries to provide on the spot expertise.  Russia is one good 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other cases our ability to manage elections has led to our 
providing operational support for actual elections. We remember 
Bosnia and South Africa as good examples of that.  As well, 
Elections Canada is engaged with the Mexican and Czechoslovakian 
governments in electoral management questions at the present 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think hon. members will agree that this is a most worthwhile 
facet of our foreign policy, helping other countries to better 
manage their elections at the same time as exchanging election 
management information and gaining ideas from those other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another dimension of this international reputation that we have 
is the frequency with which Canada is asked to provide observers 
to elections in other countries.  Often we see countries coming 
out of long periods of strife anxious to develop a sound 
electoral process.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is frequently there as part of an international observer 
team to provide a measure of reassurance to voters and to advise 
the national government.  As we speak, a team of members from 
this House is doing exactly that, supervising elections in 
Romania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ability to manage elections is also acknowledged closer to 
home by a number of provincial governments.  They reached 
agreements with Elections Canada that provide for elections 
management co-operation that will save taxpayers money and 
provide for more effective elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements exist, for example, with the governments of 
British Columbia, Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick and, dare I mention, with the province of Quebec 
where we help conduct elections and where we have been asked to 
conduct elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements with the provinces flow from important changes 
that Elections Canada discussed with this House last fall and 
which were voted into law in the last general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief among these further modernizations in election management 
was the national register of voters.  Drawing on voter 
information gathered during the last ever federal door to door 
enumeration and information gathered by other federal and 
provincial sources, Elections Canada can now provide a list of 
electors at very short notice for general or byelections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means no more costly door to door enumerations, faster 
access to lists for all parties once an election is called and a 
shorter, less costly elections period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This election, too, which was carefully reviewed in this House 
by the last Parliament is of great interest to the provinces that 
I mentioned.  By agreeing to share voter information with 
Elections Canada, they will have access to the register for their 
own electoral purposes.  This saves them the cost of door to door 
enumerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operation does not stop at the provincial level.  Under 
the Canada Elections Act, voter information exchanges can take 
place with municipal governments, as they do, and even with 
school boards on condition that they use the register data for 
electoral purposes only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a clear indication of approval of federal elections 
management from provincial governments.  This is an unheralded 
example of the kind of intergovernmental co-operation Canadians 
expect in this era of tight budgets and technological 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members need only consider their own experiences last summer in 
earning the trust of their constituents to know how well 
elections are managed in Canada.  Despite the many changes and 
improvements introduced at very short notice, the election was a 
success.  Thousands of people were recruited and trained to 
provide parties, candidates and electors with advice and 
assistance which contributed to the success of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among those thousands were the couple of thousand volunteers who 
helped me in Peterborough riding.  I want to thank them for their 
contributions of all sorts to my campaign and their contributions 
to the elections process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that they do have and will play an important 
part in ensuring that Canada's elections are well managed. 
Through debate and committee work we will be able to contribute to 
the electoral system, as have our predecessors as recently as 
last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the Canada Elections Act are to be emulated. 
The central elements of the act provide the foundation for a 
quality electoral regime.  Our electoral process serves the needs 
of Canadians, parties and legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the best electoral system in the world but, as I said, 
no human system is perfect.  That is why all good systems have 
fail safe mechanisms and review mechanisms built into them.  That 
is so with our fine electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have built in the referral of problems to an 
independent commissioner and, if necessary, to the police and the 
courts.  Also we have public review of elections matters 
following elections, between elections here in this House and in 
its committees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is the first time that I comment on another member's speech in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really stunned by what I heard today in the House. I 
believe the member across the way does not know how to read or has 
not seen the motion moved by the opposition. Either he has refused 
to read it, or he cannot read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not come to the House of Commons to observe all the 
clowning around that has been going on in the House today.  We are 
here to speak about the real issues. While people are unemployed, 
while young Canadians have no job, what are certain members doing? 
They are clowning around. They are making fun of issues that really 
must be raised. What I have seen here today is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation of every democratic party is its financing, how 
it grows. Everything the members of the government said today is 
lies and foolishness. I am sorry, but the word is not strong 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask our illustrious member across the way what 
he thinks of the real issue raised by the member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie. What does he think of the financing of 
federal political parties with the fund they have now? As for us, 
members of the Bloc, our fund is open to everyone, and our 
financing comes from simple voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
for Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent three extraordinary weeks in the city of Jonquière 
during an immersion course. The course was excellent, even though 
the student was not that good. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member on her first reply to a speech in the 
House.  She mentioned the important issues that are before us, 
and she is absolutely right, the unemployed and the environment 
and other important issues are what we should be discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind her that we have spent a whole day in the House 
debating a motion put forward by the Bloc because this is an 
opposition day, and the Bloc gets to choose the topic. We have 
done it willingly because democracy is at the base of dealing 
with the problems of unemployment and other important matters 
that the member raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should not blame us for the silliness that has taken 
place in the House today.  However, I will relay to her that the 
answer to every single one of her questions is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say to her that in the House we try and respond to 
the interests of all Canadians, not just the people of one 
region.  In my remarks I was trying to involve Canadians in the 
idea that they have a fine election system and that we do not 
need a day of debate to fix something which is not broken.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address the last statement made by the 
member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more than a day of debate in the House to correct a 
system that is not flawed but badly broken.  I would like to 
mention a few things about the speech of the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned provincial governments.  Is the member aware of 
what is going on in B.C. in regard to its NDP government, the 
so-called sharing and caring government of our society?  It had a 
habit of raising funds through charity organizations which were 
supposed to go toward the blind, the disabled and the 
handicapped. It ripped them off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where did the money go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Right into its pockets, to help fund 
its campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case is coming before the B.C. courts right now regarding the 
NDP government, a different NDP government, about misinformation, 
or what could be called lies, that it put out during its 
provincial campaign in order to get elected.  These are just a 
couple of cases in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has been in the papers lately in regard to the 
fundraising tactics of the Liberal government. Whether it is true 
or not, it is in the papers right now and it is before the 
public.  If what is written in the papers is true, the Liberal 
government makes Al Capone look like a child when it comes to arm 
twisting to get money for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is proven to be correct about the way the money was 
raised, and if this member believes in democracy and I believe he 
does, would the member opposite not agree this is a perfect case 
for the right of recall in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member 
opposite that the cases he has cited became known and were dealt 
with because of our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the rumours, which he admitted were rumours, possibly true, 
possibly not, are in the public domain.  Not only are they in 
whatever newspapers he reads but here in the House of Commons in 
a debate on the funding of our electoral system. I think the 
member should be very careful about this, but to me that is a 
part of the system about which we are all so proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human beings are fallible.  NDP governments are fallible.  If an 
NDP government has concerns about bingo funds, I have heard talk 
that the Reform Party is considering a bingo parlour here in the 
national capital region.  I see it in the media but I do not jump 
to conclusion and ban bingos all over the country.  I look at the 
case.  In the election system there are mechanisms for looking at 
those cases.  That is the best we can do.  Next year or the year 
after it might be something that the member has not anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What you need is the mechanism for dealing with it, not 
something which is so intricate that every one of these things is 
dealt with immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to touch on one issue in the short time I have and ask the member 
what his beliefs are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched on one particular area that is very fundamental to 
our system and that is the spending limits and the balance 
between private and public in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends opposite like to think that the best system is to 
have all private sector funding with no limits.  This is one of 
the major faults in the American system where all the scandals 
occur. 
I have many friends in the American houses.  My riding borders on 
the U.S. and we meet on a fairly regular basis.  They tell me 
that the system is so bad that they have to spend almost all of 
their time raising funds in order to be able to compete to get 
re-elected.  They get millions of dollars in order to compete.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's opinion on why it would be a good 
system to have in Canada rather than the one we do have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you one quick example.  Because of my financial 
situation, I could never have been elected in a system like that 
because I could could never have competed without the public 
system.  I would like to know what his comments are in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I picked out the spending 
limits as the parliamentary secretary just noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall in a recent state election in California someone 
with private money spent $30 million, all presumably earned 
legally.  I have no reason to believe he did not amass that 
fortune himself.  He was allowed to spend $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of our system is exactly what the parliamentary 
secretary has pointed out.  We control in a transparent public 
way how money is collected.  There are limits on donations and 
the way it can be done.  At the other end and equally transparent 
we control spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the Reform member who spoke previously, in both 
cases it is entirely transparent and there are mechanisms to deal 
with the wrongdoing in the event something goes wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I believe there is agreement that the 
debate will proceed until 6.30 p.m. and the question is then 
deemed put.  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues in the House for extending the debate until 6.30 p.m. 
to enable me to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the mover, the hon. member from Laurier—Sainte-Marie. 
The motion before us is that the House condemns the attitude of 
the government which refuses to introduce in-depth reform of the 
legislation of the financing of political parties even though the 
existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good motion and it should be debated again.  I join my 
friend from Shuswap in saying that we need more of this 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how my Liberal friends feel when they open their 
newspapers.  They must shudder because the newspaper headlines 
are talking about Liberal sleaze, kickbacks and pay-offs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, page after page— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  They are not talking about the bingo 
scandals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend can laugh and say “Isn't this 
funny”.  I am not saying it is only the Liberals.  I can talk 
about the long list of Tories that are in jail in Saskatchewan 
for all kinds of misdeeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's face it, to a certain extent there are problems across the 
political spectrum.  Today we are talking about Liberal 
kickbacks, Liberal tollgating and Liberal fundraisers going to 
people and saying “If you contribute to the Liberal Party of 
Canada prior to this election I will ensure that you get a 
government contract”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not new.  It has been going on probably since the first 
election in this country.  That is one of the reasons why people 
are so cynical about national and provincial politics.  They know 
that certain people have undue influence and they obtain that 
undue influence by, if you like, bribing political parties or 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of books written.  I remember Stevie 
Cameron's book <I>On The Take</I>.  By the time you finished 
reading the book you were disgusted with that government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not people who just made a few thousand dollars on a 
kickback.  They were making millions of dollars.  There were 
pages and pages of accusations against backbenchers and cabinet 
ministers and not a single person has taken Stevie Cameron to 
court.  All the accusations were there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was Claire Hoy who wrote <I>Friends in High 
Places</I>.  It was on the same theme, that if you knew the right 
people in the Mulroney government you could make lots of money. A 
lot of the wealth of today's millionaires in Canada, the people 
who are on their yachts in the harbours or driving Jaguars, can 
be traced back to well connected friends in the Mulroney 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have things changed with the Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  No, sir. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says no.  Should we be 
surprised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the 1996 results of political contributions.  Guess what 
political party got a lot more money from business than any other 
political party in Canada?  Yes, it was the Liberal Party which 
got $7.8 million in business cash.  What does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we believe that people who spent nearly $8 million to fund a 
political campaign will not have any leverage in terms of policy 
making, we must believe pink elephants are floating around here 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge a certain trend which has developed over the 
last number of years.  I trace it back again to the beginning of 
the Mulroney government.  A decision was made to start phasing 
out very professional people at senior levels. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  I bring it to your attention that no one can 
wave any instrument while they speak.  I believe the hon. member 
was waving an instrument while he was speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thought the hon. member might have 
been waving a book.  I thought he was about to quote from the 
book and that is why I did not interrupt him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows it is improper to use props.  I have reminded the hon. 
member of that before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he would not want to do that and break the rules of 
the House.  He would want to set a good example for all the new 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you were absolutely 
correct.  I was going to start quoting from <I>On the Take</I> and 
<I>Friends in High Places</I>, but I was so disgusted by reading 
them that I did not want to bring the debate down any lower than 
it is at the moment.  Therefore I will not quote from those 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a prop.  It is just facts that I had in my hand.  I 
want to identify what I believe is a very dangerous trend which 
has developed in Canadian national politics and government during 
the last 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Mulroney government was elected it started to phase out 
some senior professional bureaucrats.  These people had dedicated 
their entire lives to developing good public policy for Canada 
and Canadians.  One of the reasons we had such good public policy 
over the years was because of the professional dedication of 
these men and women.  They were professional and they worked long 
hours.  They were motivated by one thing only and that was to do 
a good job for the people of Canada and for the government of the 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid to say that most of those people are gone.  They 
have been let go, laid off or were so demoralized they quit. 
They just could not take the lack of leadership and the sell-out 
to the private sector that has occurred over the last 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still some very good people around, but by and large 
the best have left and most of them have left because they were 
forced out of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That created a huge vacuum at the senior levels of the 
bureaucracy in terms of public policy creation.  Who has filled 
that vacuum?  The paid lobbyists, the people the government hires 
on contract from the banks to develop amendments to the Bank Act 
or lobbyists from pharmaceutical corporations to change laws 
regarding the pharmaceutical sector and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Or the CAW. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I look forward to the day when the 
government hires the CAW for anything.  The government is against 
working people.  It has demonstrated time and time again that it 
is against working men and women.  To suggest that it would 
consider even talking to a senior union is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This void has been filled with paid lobbyists.  Their priority 
and motivation is not the people of Canada.  It is the clients 
who are paying for them.  They are the people who are advising 
the government. 
I hate to say it but it is true.  They were advising the previous 
government and look what we got.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we got NAFTA.  All my Liberal friends across the way 
were saying this was bad for Canada.  Then they switched across 
the aisle and now they are saying this is good for Canada.  It is 
so good that they are going to introduce a NAFTA in steroids 
called the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is behind the MAI?  The Canadian Manufacturers' Association, 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council on 
National Issues, and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The people who can create the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I thank the member for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list here that goes back to 1996.  This was not an 
election year.  I can imagine when we get the figures for 1997 
that they will be hot stuff.  Who contributed to the Liberal 
Party of Canada in 1996?  There was the National Bank, CIBC, Wood 
Gundy and the Royal Bank of Canada.  We are not talking about 
thousands of dollars or tens of thousands.  We are talking about 
many, many tens of thousands of dollars of political 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  The Toronto-Dominion Bank coughed up $66,000.  I 
have a list of all bank and financial institutions that 
contributed to the Liberal Party.  The total comes to almost half 
a million dollars for last year.  Does it not seem that they have 
some access that other firms do not have because of that pay-off? 
Of course they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  How much did labour give to the NDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My hon. friend raises the interesting 
question on how much organized labour contributed to the New 
Democratic Party.  It is a fair question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree first that before any union makes a contribution to 
a political party, regardless of whatever the political party 
might be, the decision is made by officers elected by the 
membership.  How many bank presidents contact their bank 
shareholders before they make a contribution to the Liberal Party 
of Canada?  Not many.  Therein lies a pretty fundamental 
difference in terms of who is contributing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could refer to my friends in the Conservative Party, but they 
only obtained 46% of their financing from business.  Reform is 
quite far back in the pack at 12% and 3% of New Democratic Party 
federal contributions for 1996 came from small businesses across 
the country.  The numbers are 55% for the Liberals, 46% for the 
Conservatives, 12% for the Reform and 3% for the New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to know who pays for the Liberal Party's 
operations.  I mentioned the banks and financial institutions. 
Every one, from what I can gather from the list, contributes 
significantly to the tens and tens of thousands of dollars 
annually.  Bell Canada of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third on the list is Bombardier.  Remember the big contract 
Bombardier got and gets repeatedly and repeatedly.  When we look 
at the top echelons of Bombardier and the lobbyists who work on 
their behalf, they are all well connected to the Liberal Party. 
They coughed up $85 million.  BrasCan is in there.  BrasCan is 
always in there supporting the Liberals.  Canada Trust is in 
there.  The CBA, the Canadian Bankers Association, makes a 
healthy contribution.  The CNR, CPR and all major accounting 
firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have Glaxo Wellcome and Merck Frosst, two of the large 
multinational pharmaceuticals.  These are the ones that are well 
connected.  They have as their top lobbyist a former member of 
Parliament and cabinet minister, Judy Erola.  She does a 
wonderful job.  From what I can gather, looking at the 
legislation that governs pharmaceuticals, they write the 
legislation.  Perhaps the minister puts the final signature on it 
and maybe crosses the odd <I>t</I> or dots the odd <I>i</I>, but 
basically the legislation is written by the pharmaceutical 
lobbyists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the kind of country that Canada wants to be?  Is that 
the kind of country that Canada has become?  Unfortunately yes. 
That is why this nonsense has to change.  We need a full 
investigation into how political parties are funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stand here and say the funding of the New Democratic 
Party is perfect or anything else, but let us open up the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend did an excellent job in saying that our system is 
better than the American system.  That is praising with very pink 
praise.  That is the most bizarre system where everybody just 
buys influence in the United States. 
We are far removed from that, but when we read the headlines and 
listen to the accusations and comments from across the aisle, it 
appears that people are buying influence from the Liberal Party. 
We know they bought influence from the Tories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Tory cabinet ministers ended up in court, some on 
their way to jail and some backbenchers who made their living on 
kickbacks and saying “Listen, give the local association a 
political donation, give the party a political donation, and we 
will ensure that you get government contracts”.  It went on and 
on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go as far as to say that every significant major contract 
offered by the government and the Parliament of Canada under the 
Mulroney era probably involved kickbacks of one kind or another. 
I could list all sorts of examples that I am aware of personally, 
but I do not have the facts.  I just heard people tell me that if 
they did not pay the kickback they were laid off, lost their 
jobs, lost the contract and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making those accusations on the floor of the House of 
Commons.  I hope to hear some people say that is not right. 
Stevie Cameron made them in her book, 600 pages of accusations, 
and not a single Tory has taken her up on her challenges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  This is <I>Friends in High Places</I>

my hon. friend if she has not read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> I have read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  We will leave it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw the debate to a close by simply saying that we can 
stand here for hours on end and point out all the horror shows 
attached to financial support for political parties, whether they 
are kickbacks, tollgating, bribing or whatever.  We all know it 
takes place.  No honest member of Parliament will stand and say 
that this does not occur in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For goodness' sakes, why not open it up to a major public 
inquiry?  Let us do the right thing.  We hope to bring 
credibility to this institution.  We hope to bring credibility to

changes.  We cannot simply turn a blind eye and pretend that—

happen to have several documents which refer to contributions

Air Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at United Steelworkers.  Yes, indeed it is lovely. 
There is no question that United Steelworkers was a chief 
contributor to the NDP campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the United Auto Workers.  NDP raised $3.8 
million, mostly political donations.  There is no question the 
NDP can claim that other parties receive donations, but it did 
not mention once its millions of dollars in donations.  I wonder 
why.  I wonder if it was just a slight memory lapse or if there 
was another reason that it missed all these huge donations.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is in 
response to the answer the Minister of Human Resources Development gave 
me on September 25, 1997 when I asked him a question on employment 
insurance.  He said that he was proud of the changes to the employment 
insurance program. In my mind, this shows how disconnected this 
government is from its constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a statement my predecessor made in the 
<I>Acadie Nouvelle </I>on July 31, 1989. 
He said: “According to the member for Gloucester, taxpayers in New 
Brunswick should vigorously oppose all the proposed changes, which will 
have a negative impact on the area”. He is the very person who five 
years later went after the employment insurance system, thereby directly 
attacking people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many problems are associated with the administration of the 
employment insurance as a result of the changes made by my predecessor, 
the former MP for Acadie—Bathurst. One of the particularly difficult 
issues is the problem of seasonal workers. They are one of the groups 
which have been hurt the most by the changes to the employment 
insurance. These changes ignore the particular needs of these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula used for calculating the weeks of entitlement to 
benefits penalizes seasonal workers.  Because of the changes implemented 
by this government, these workers are without income for several months 
out of the year.  By reducing the number of weeks when benefits are 
paid, the government has plunged these people into poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere in the country, from B.C. to Newfoundland, from 
northern Ontario to New Brunswick, the economy relies on natural 
resources such as mines, forestry and fisheries.  For the last 
two, the industries are seasonal. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people work very hard during part of the year, but when the 
weather is adverse or the level of fish stocks too low, they must apply 
for EI.  It is not their fault if Mother Nature decides that one season 
will be shorter than the other.  The very purpose of employment 
insurance is to help workers make it through difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what does this government do?  It punishes the workers and 
turns a blind eye when they need help.  The government should know that 
the logging and fishing seasons do not overlap and should therefore 
implement programs to meet the specific needs of those industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers are waiting for the Liberals to keep their promise 
and create jobs. In his answer, the minister told me that he preferred 
active manpower measures. Well, I urge the government to develop long 
term active strategies to deal with the very real problems were are 
experiencing throughout Canada. I realize Liberals have a hard time 
setting up long term programs. Very often, they carry no immediate 
political reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need leadership on this whole issue. We need short, medium and 
long term strategies to deal with the structural problems in our 
economy. But we also need immediate programs to alleviate the suffering. 
It is not good enough to examine the situation, as the human resources 
development minister said he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to like active measures, but I urge him to take 
action to help people who are suffering.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
respond to the member's question and the issue as it relates to 
the new EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the same type of region as the member does. I am a 
little bit surprised that he continues to suggest as other 
members in his party have, that the new EI system does not help 
seasonal workers.  In fact it is just the opposite. Northern 
Ontario is very similar to northern New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new EI system allows those workers who previously could not 
collect EI because of the way the system worked to now collect 
EI. For example over 45,000 seasonal and other workers are now in 
the system who were not in the system when this legislation came 
into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we went to the hours based system has made a big 
difference to part time workers.  There were approximately 
350,000 people who did not quality for EI before the new system 
came into place, but now they do qualify for employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat ironic that the member continues to suggest 
that the system does not have a lot of merit and that it is not 
an improvement over the last one.  Is it an income security 
system like social assistance?  No.  It is an insurance system 
intended to help people who need that push.  It is not intended 
to be an income supplement system as some members would like it 
to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I would like to say is that this is a brand new 
system.  One of the main recommendations made by the committee 
was to put in place a monitoring system specifically to look at 
the system every year to see if there are any particular problems 
with it.  If changes need to be made we will look at that because 
it is a new system and we may need to look at some changes. 
However the overall changes which were made are for the better 
and not for the worst as is being suggested.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to point out that it is not the projects 
that are the subject of the investigation, but the influence peddling 
linking the Liberal Party of Canada with ministers of this government. 
That is the subject of the investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not table the projects as planned?  I find it most astonishing, 
particularly since the transitional job creation fund, as part of 
employment insurance reform, was supposed to be the way of transforming 
regional economies, so as to help them achieve a rate of growth and 
effectiveness equal to that of other more industrialized regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the government is using the transitional job creation fund 
today, it is causing it to lose its credibility, by making it a tool of 
patronage, when the fund should be helping to promote the development of 
regional economies and offsetting the devastating effect of employment 
insurance reform now being felt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister says there are 45 000 new seasonal workers, 
this means not 45 000 seasonal workers who will be entitled to 
employment insurance, but 45 000 workers who will contribute to a 
plan they will probably never be able to draw on, because they will 
not have accumulated sufficient hours according to the government's 
new requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand that the present government has not got 
the very clear message sent to it by the voters in eastern Quebec, 
in the Maritimes, in all of the regions, particularly those in 
which there are seasonal workers and many young people coming on to 
the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it aberrant that today, right under the noses of 
the entire population of Canada, the federal government prefers to 
conceal the list of projects that will be affected by the influence 
peddling affair, and in so doing does away with any appearance of 
justice. 
They are contributing to the public's belief that transitional jobs 
fund projects can be obtained only through political intervention 
and influence peddling, and this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the government will eventually table the list of 
projects, to clarify things a little for those citizens who are 
questioning the way the government administers the public purse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
transitional jobs fund was another program that was put in place 
under the new EI system. That program was put in place with some 
$300 million to help high unemployment areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the discussion at the time was going on about the 
Government of Canada and the provincial governments as it relates 
to education and training and who has jurisdiction, we put in 
place a system that this member and all members should be aware 
of, which suggested that no projects would be approved in any 
province without the province's concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that Minister Harel in the province of Quebec 
approved all these projects. To suggest that there is some 
influence peddling going on when a PQ government is the one that 
is signing off on these particular projects, it is almost hard to 
believe that even a member from the Bloc would suggest that in an 
open forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make this very clear, because we do this in northern 
Ontario as well and we have a Conservative government in northern 
Ontario, when we put in these particular projects that create 
long sustainable jobs in the particular area that we are dealing 
with, we at the same time put the proposal in and ask individual 
groups within the area to approve it or not approve it.  Then it 
goes up the system and the minister signs off on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it even clearer for the member, yesterday the minister 
put a list together and put it out to the press.  There were some 
181 proposals that were accepted in the province of Quebec.  I am 
sure if he takes a look at that list he will see a number of 
projects in his own riding. He will feel very good about the fact 
that those projects help individuals in his riding with long term 
jobs and help the unemployed.  That is what the transitional jobs 
fund is for.  It is a very good project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly I want to say one thing.  This project is one of the 
first of its kind.  Out of every dollar that is spent on a 
project, 80% of it is private money and 20% of it is public 
money.  It is one of the most successful programs ever put 
together on average. To think that we can get the private sector 
to put forward 80¢ on a dollar for sustainable jobs in this 
country is something we should be all proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member to suggest it is some sort of slush fund, I think 
he should say that outside and see how long he would last if he 
made those kinds of comments and accusations when nothing at this 
point is proven. When the RCMP does its investigation, we will go 
from there to see what he then has to say in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been quite a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to further question the Liberal government, in 
particular the minister responsible for Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to him was as follows:  The U.S. postal service 
handles 40% of the world's mail while its postmaster general 
Marvin Runyon earns a salary of $205,000 Canadian per year. The 
Canadian post office handles 3% of the world's mail while its 
president Georges Clermont just had his contract renegotiated for 
another two years for $380,000 Canadian per year. As the minister 
was so willing and capable to quickly settle the services of 
Georges Clermont, then why does he and Canada Post not show the 
same consideration toward the Canadian postal workers? His 
response was for me to get back to my friends within the union to 
get back to the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured for the minister to say that I and the NDP 
are friends of not only the union workers but all workers 
throughout Canada.  It is just this point that we defend the 
rights of those workers against scandalous practices of the 
management of corporations such as Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogance displayed by the minister by announcing Georges 
Clermont's contract during a time when negotiations between 
management and union are at best a very tense situation is what I 
would always fight against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without consultation this government has directed Canada Post 
Corporation to ignore its original mandate and to start realizing 
a return on equity of 11% which would represent profits of around 
$175 million to $200 million per year. Interestingly enough, a 
government commissioned report released earlier this year said 
that with this kind of financial return, Canada Post would be 
capable of privatization by an initial public offering of its 
shares in the future if government should decide to pursue this 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that if the government had not interfered in 
the original bargaining process, and if it had not promised John 
Gustavson of the Canadian Direct Marketing Association of Canada 
that in the event of a labour stoppage he would introduce back to 
work legislation within eight days of a strike, I believe that 
Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers would have 
reached a collective agreement by now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern to Canadians is why the government is insisting 
that the corporation, after making a $120 million last year, has 
taken an additional $200 million in concessions from the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything I have mentioned is going against the Canada Post 
Corporation Act.  It is my opinion that the corporation should 
make enough profits to finance operations and for the purpose of 
reinvestment into improving and expanding services like door to 
door delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians enjoy the second lowest postal rates in the industrial 
world.  An example how Canada Post can make additional revenues 
needed is as follows.  Every penny increase for a stamp realizes 
$25 million profit to the corporation.  If the government reduced 
the GST on stamps from 7¢ to 2¢ and raised the price of stamps by 
5¢ the corporation would realize an additional revenue of another 
$125 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would call this a win situation.  The workers at Canada Post 
win because they would not have to be sucked into giving any 
concessions of any kind.  The post office wins with additional 
revenue.  The public wins because there would be no additional 
costs to them in the purchase of stamps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the government and the Canada Post Corporation will in 
all honesty sit down with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers 
and, for once in their lives, bargain in good faith. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians can be proud of the best postal system in the world. 
They have some of the lowest postal rates in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians owe this, in part, to the competent management at 
Canada Post headed by Mr. George Clermont.  Canadians also owe 
this to the Canadian postal employees who provide a very valuable 
contribution to the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wages, benefits and working conditions of Canada Post 
employees are among the best in the country.  The corporation has 
recognized their valuable contribution by extending an offer 
which proposes a reasonable wage increase above the standard 
reached in other industries this year.  It offers 500 new full 
time jobs and above all maintains job security for those who have 
it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To maintain these jobs Canada Post must respond to the challenge 
presented by fax machines, satellites, courier companies and the 
Internet.  It must respond by being efficient, flexible and 
progressive.  This is what the present negotiations are all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post wants to negotiate with the Canadian Union of Postal 
Workers and it welcomes the labour minister's appointment of a 
conciliation commissioner. The government sincerely hopes that a 
negotiated settlement can be reached.  A financially healthy 
business is the best way to protect the jobs of Canada Post 
employees, managers and workers alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be proud to have a postal service that has not 
received taxpayer funding since 1988.  As an independent, 
self-financing commercial crown corporation, Canada Post last 
year paid a dividend of $10 million to the federal government. 
This past fiscal year it returned a profit of more than $112 
million and expects to remain profitable in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As profits continue to grow, we can look forward to a very good 
postal system.  The important message is that management and 
employees must work together to make sure the Canadian public is 
well served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
