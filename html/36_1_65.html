<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROPERTY RIGHTS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms should be amended to recognize the right of every person 
to own, use and enjoy property; and to not be deprived of that 
right without full, just and timely compensation and the due 
process of law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to lead off debate on 
Motion No. 269. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion seeks to amend the charter of rights and freedoms to 
include property rights.  At present there is no mention of 
property rights and therefore no protection from confiscation of 
personal property by the government. There is no requirement for 
the government to provide compensation to an individual if Ottawa 
confiscates their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has become a master at violating the 
property rights of Canadians.  Whether it is gun control, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, endangered species legislation or direct to 
home satellite systems, this government has demonstrated a blatant 
disregard for the property of Canadians.  All Canadians should be 
concerned that the Liberal government so easily and so quickly 
tramples on their rights in order to achieve certain specific 
policy goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the actions of this government that it has no 
regard for the property rights of Canadians.  As a result I have 
introduced Motion No. 269. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Red flags surrounding this issue were first raised during the 
35th Parliament when the Liberals introduced Bill C-22.  This 
bill dealt with the cancellation of the Pearson airport 
development contract. The Liberals attempted to annul binding 
contracts and then exempt themselves from liability.  In short 
they tried to confiscate property and then place themselves above 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, pressure from the Senate, threatened lawsuits and 
questions concerning the constitutionality of the bill led to its 
collapse.  All the while the former justice minister, now our 
health minister, insisted that everything was above board and 
that Bill C-22 was totally conventional.  This gives some insight 
into the mentality of Liberals and their position on the rights 
of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Liberals backed down on Bill C-22, they went on to 
introduce Bill C-65.  This bill dealt with endangered species in 
Canada. Serious concerns were raised about the effect this 
legislation would have on the property rights of landowners. 
Specifically some landowners were afraid that the government 
would confiscate their property in an attempt to protect 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the Liberals downplayed the legitimate concerns of 
landowners and treated those questioning excessive government 
powers in Bill C-65 as environmental terrorists. Thankfully Bill 
C-65 died on the Order Paper as a result of the 1997 election, 
however it is still waiting in the wings and there is little 
doubt that the government will reintroduce the bill in the near 
future. Before it does so, our debate here today gives all 
opposition parties the opportunity to go on the record as to 
where they stand on the property rights of landowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberals' legislative assault on property 
rights did not end with Bill C-65.  They went much further with 
the introduction of Bill C-68. More than any other initiative, 
the Liberals' misguided gun control legislation has sparked a 
national discussion on property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed with the provisions contained in Bill C-68, the justice 
minister is able to pass order in council regulations and 
confiscate the rightful property of Canadian firearms owners. I 
am speaking of property which has been duly acquired.  The owner 
has paid taxes on the firearm and complied with all other 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of this, along come the Liberals who say to 
law-abiding gun owners “We are going to take your property 
because we know what is best for you. 
We are socially re-engineering Canada into a gentler, kinder 
society”.  That is what the Liberals say. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that these same Liberals have created a justice 
system where rapists walk out of courtrooms because of 
conditional sentencing.  Young offenders who kill are sentenced 
to a few months at youth internment centres.  Serial killers are 
given the tools through section 745 of the Criminal Code to 
revictimize their victims' families.  That is the record of this 
government when it comes to engineering a kinder society. 
Criminals are given the gold mine while law-abiding gun owners 
get the shaft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will know that C-68 is being challenged in 
the courts with respect to its infringement on provincial 
jurisdiction in the area of property rights.  Four provinces and 
the territories had the good sense to stand against this bill and 
its attack on the fundamental rights and freedoms of law-abiding 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating ordinary Canadians worse than violent criminals is 
nothing new to this government.  David Bryan, a Saskatchewan 
farmer who tried to sell his grain outside the Canadian Wheat 
Board has been led around courtrooms in shackles. His heinous 
crime:  trying to sell his own crop, his own property without the 
permission of the Canadian Wheat Board.  In the eyes of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, David Bryan does not own his grain, Ottawa 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Russ Larson who attended Mr. Bryan's trial said “It is like we 
are peasants who are supposed to grow grain, turn it over to them 
and shut up”.  In other words, you work for the Canadian Wheat 
Board not for yourself.  The grain is the property of the 
government, not the producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, only farmers in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba 
are subject to the violation of their property rights.  Farmers 
in other provinces can market their crops however they see fit. 
That is why farmers on the prairies are increasingly referring to 
the wheat board as the OWB, the Ottawa wheat board, because it is 
run by bureaucrats, lawyers and politicians in Ottawa instead of 
by western farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 269 allows all parties in this House an opportunity 
to rise and defend the property rights of farmers.  I also 
challenge members of this House to rise and defend the rights of 
Canadians who choose to watch what they want on television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct to home satellite owners have been compared to drug 
pushers by the industry minister simply because they are using 
American hardware and services.  Direct to home satellite owners 
have been threatened that their equipment may be confiscated by 
the RCMP. Customs officials have seized direct to home satellite 
equipment that is being imported from the United States of 
America, equipment on which all duties have been paid and which 
rightfully belongs to the Canadian retailer or wholesaler. “No 
matter,” say the Liberals, “in the interests of cultural 
protectionism, that is, government knows what is best for you, we 
will trample on the property rights of Canadian citizens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the strong protection of property rights, the social 
engineers have the upper hand.  It is in their power to decree 
what is acceptable and what is not, what is safe and what is not 
and what we should do and what we should not do.  Property rights 
are not just about firearms or land or satellite dishes; property 
rights are about freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But do not take my word for it.  Listen to the comments made by 
our present Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa.  In 
1985 he delivered a speech in Edmonton where he said “I believe 
we must entrench the right to property in our Constitution.  The 
right to hold and enjoy property provides one of the checks and 
balances against undue concentration of power in government at 
any level”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the creator of big government, Prime Minister Pierre 
Trudeau, was an advocate of property rights during the 
repatriation of the Constitution.  However, property rights did 
not make it into the final draft of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be interested to know that property rights are 
entrenched in the United States constitution.  Article 5 of 
amendments to the U.S. constitution reads in part “no person 
shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due 
process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public 
use without just compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of my motion may argue that property rights are 
already guaranteed under John Diefenbaker's bill of rights but 
that is not true.  The bill of rights is simply a statute which 
can be overridden by any government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament concluded that “there is no 
requirement in Canadian constitutional law that compulsory taking 
of property be effected by a fair procedure or that it be 
accompanied by fair compensation to the owner”.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a March 1995 paper on property rights the Library of 
Parliament determined that “in Canada there is no constitutional 
guarantee for compensation and that the power of the government 
in this area is unlimited”.  Motion No. 269 seeks to place 
limits on the government and Ottawa's ability to simply strip 
Canadians of their personal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time property rights have been discussed 
in the House, and I know it will not be the last.  My hon. 
colleague from Yorkton—Melville led the charge on this issue in 
the 35th Parliament.  I am pleased to help advance the cause of 
property rights in this parliamentary session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members that this issue strikes at the heart of our 
rights and freedoms in a democratic system.  I look forward to 
the rest of the debate on this motion.  I encourage members to 
speak in favour of Motion No. 269 so the House can move to 
protect the property rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the importance of entrenching property rights in the 
constitution and despite the fact that the subcommittee did not 
find the motion votable, I seek unanimous consent of the House to 
deem the motion votable so we can have a full three hours of 
debate instead of one and can put the issue to a vote as to 
whether or not we entrench property rights in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent of the House to move such a motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will stick to the motion and not raise every hodgepodge piece 
of legislation that has been passed in the House.  I will talk 
about the due process of law, which opposition members probably 
do not understand or do not respect.   I fail to understand what 
the gun legislation, the wheat board legislation and other pieces 
of legislation have to do with this important motion.  I will 
only speak to the issue and will ignore the blatant partisan 
remarks of the hon. opposition member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment of the Canadian bill of rights stems from our 
desire to ensure the atrocities that occurred to millions of 
Jews, ethnic minorities, political dissidents, people with mental 
and physical disabilities and homosexuals do not happen again. 
That is the reason we have a bill of rights.  The bill of rights 
already protects an individual's rights to the enjoyment of his 
or her property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations responded to some of the atrocities during 
the second world war and to some of the other issues I brought 
forward by drafting the United Nations declaration of human 
rights.   The parliament of the day in Canada enacted the 
Canadian bill of rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Bill of Rights has quasi-constitutional status. 
A number of its provisions were repeated in specific provisions of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since the Charter 
contains no specific clause on property rights, it may be held that 
the following clause in the Bill of Rights continues to protect 
property rights: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there 
have existed and shall continue to exist without 
discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, 
religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, namely, 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, 
security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the 
right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of 
law— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be held that this clause provides protection to 
property rights in that a person cannot be deprived of his rights 
except by regular application of the law.  The Bill applies only to 
federal laws, unlike the Charter which applies to provincial laws. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous laws also regulate and protect the ownership and 
enjoyment of property in Canada.  For example, real and personal 
property laws regulate the acquisition and disposition of all 
kinds of property.  These laws protect individuals from fraud and 
other mistakes that may result in someone losing property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an evolution in what we think of as property and 
protecting individuals in a fair manner from losing their right 
to enjoy property.  The federal Divorce Act and provincial and 
territorial family law acts ensure that women are not deprived of 
their right to a fair share of matrimonial property and assets 
regardless of who has legal title.

subject to some limitations in society.

territorial family law acts ensure women are not deprived of their 
right to a fair share of matrimonial property and assets regardless 
of who has legal title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are laws to govern the use of property in the public 
interest.  For instance, there are land use and zoning laws with 
the power to limit the type of construction allowed in a 
residential area.  Environmental legislation establishes a whole 
body of regulations governing everything from the disposal of 
hazardous waste to felling trees. 
There are laws that govern ownership of shares by limited 
companies, bankruptcy, and ownership of land by non-Canadians. 
Cultural heritage laws guarantee respect for the interests of 
native peoples with respect to use of their lands, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these laws place real limitations on property ownership 
and use.  Everyone recognizes the need for these limitations. If 
the government were to consider amending the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, sight should not be lost of the important limitations on 
the enjoyment of property. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure for amending the constitution is quite complex and 
would require the following elements if we chose that route: a 
resolution of the Senate and House of Commons and a resolution of 
the legislative assemblies of at least two-thirds of the 
provinces that have a least 50% of the population of all the 
provinces.  Obtaining approval for this type of constitutional 
amendment, as we have know from the past, can be quite difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of property is far greater than real property.  Given 
the broad notion that can be applied to real property, we must be 
careful if we are able to alter the existing protection for 
property rights in a quasi-constitional document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that women's advocacy groups have had a 
number of concerns with the further entrenchment of property 
rights.  A man's home is his castle is a disturbing concept to 
many women who have been denied their share of family assets.  It 
has only been a few years since Mrs. Murdoch was denied a share 
of the family farm where she had worked for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a complex society with many interests and competing rights 
from the division of the matrimonial home to environmental laws 
and zoning bylaws we must recognize that rights are not absolute. 
In many countries of the world women are legally and effectively 
denied the right to own, inherit or control properties.  In 
Canada today this is not the case.  Women have the right to enjoy 
property to the same extent as men.  There are many existing 
protections for property rights in Canada both in the Canadian 
bill of rights and other statues and through common law, as I 
stated earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other challenges facing the government are more pressing than 
the need to provide additional protection for property rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must deal with more pressing challenges than 
providing additional protection for property rights.  The 
government is determined to protect our social safety net, our 
health system, and youth employment, to name just a few areas of 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of property rights is important for Canadians' 
prosperity.  Property rights are, in our view, already protected by 
existing legislation.

Speaker, I would like to share my time with another member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of property rights is certainly bigger than 
physical property as in land and other things we own and are 
physically able to touch.  It is important to protect the other 
property rights and intangibles such as the property rights my 
friend was talking about with regard to land, Bill C-68, guns and 
other property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have security of property, it brings into the 
question the security of a lot of things. 
We will be debating the MAI which will have to do with foreign 
investment in Canada.  Once again property rights will come up as 
part of that discussion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member on the other side was talking about the 
protection of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The question 
of property rights has to be entrenched in the constitution, 
because we feel that having that right should be fundamental to 
being a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was certainly mentioned in the U.S. constitution that it was 
a fundamental right for Americans.  I think we can look toward 
the way its society has evolved.  There is no reason we could not 
have evolved in much the same way.  In keeping with that theme I 
would like to point out there is still time for us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion would have been made votable, it would have been 
an indication from the House of whether or not Canadians across 
the country were concerned about the issue and whether or not 
there was more support for it than what the members opposite and 
the government indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confiscation of property tends to leave the person from 
whom the property is taken without adequate compensation for what 
is being done to him.  As a result it takes away from basic 
rights.

presentation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the issue we are speaking about today in the private 
member's motion my friend has introduced is entrenching property 
rights in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something I also agree is extremely important.  A number 
of issues are an example of why all Canadians need to have it 
protected and to ensure it is enshrined in our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the example of gun control.  This may have been 
talked about before but it is worth repeating.  I have spoken to 
hundreds and hundreds of people.  One example of where their 
firearms are to be taken away is collectors' items which they 
have saved for a long time and which are very valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding a number of seniors have been collecting firearms. 
In order for them to keep the firearms because of whatever type 
of weapon they are—I am talking about veterans and all types of 
people who collect firearms—the bolts have to be welded shut and 
have to be disabled.  These are antiques they are being forced to 
destroy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  I hear a member from the other side of the 
House telling me that this is not true.  I can tell the member 
that I have spoken to a number of organizations, antiques 
collectors' clubs and veterans who have already been forced to 
have some of these weapons and antique firearms, of which there 
are very few around, changed and altered.  The bolts were 
permanently welded shut.  They are very distraught about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to every one of these groups it brought me back to 
the whole firearms issue.  They are as concerned about crime and 
justice as anybody else in the country.  They want to make sure 
our streets are safer.   We have the government saying that this 
will solve our justice problems and look after crime.  It brings 
me back to why we need these rights enshrined in our 
constitution.  It is absolutely fundamental.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way the government is going to solve crime which is 
not going to make one iota of difference to crime.  It is not 
going to make a difference.  There are many other ways to solve 
the crime problem.  These are taxpayers, the best citizens in our 
communities, role models in our communities, who are being faced 
with this legislation. They are saying “we need constitutional 
protection, what is happening to us is absolutely dead wrong”. 
This is one example and there are many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just seen the debate on the wheat board.  The farmers 
are coming forward.  They feel their rights are being trampled 
on.  The government is suggesting there will be some elected 
officials on the new wheat board, but still it is a government 
anointed and appointed board, the president, the CEO and the 
people running this organization.  Farmers really do not have any 
true input. They want to make sure that their rights are 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this can be done most effectively is to ensure that 
their rights are enshrined in the Constitution, that they are 
guaranteed and they are protected.  That would go a long way to 
making sure that Canadians feel secure without the government 
being able to trample on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as the Bloc Quebecois's justice critic, I am pleased to 
speak to this motion.  Some of my colleagues may find it amusing to 
see the Reformers trying to use a run-of-the-mill motion to bring 
in by the back door what they could not get in through the front, 
as if parties are going to be asleep at the switch, and will not 
voice their opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand the motion, which I will read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms should be amended to recognize the right of every 
person to own, use and enjoy property; and to not be deprived 
of that right without full, just and timely compensation and 
the due process of law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that a member of the Bloc Quebecois is in a good 
position to talk about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
given that, for us, it is part of the 1982 Constitution, which was 
imposed on us even though we never signed it, but which nonetheless 
contains rights and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the good citizens we are, Quebeckers of various political 
stripes, we are looking at it and trying to find out its scope. In 
in Quebec we have a Quebec charter of rights and freedoms, which 
was passed even before the Canadian charter and which contains 
certain obligations and rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I am way off the mark and am horribly wrong, both the 
Quebec and the Canadian charters accord Quebeckers and Canadians 
the right to own what they will.  I think this is a now considered 
to be fundamental right, unless the Reformers have been reading 
different texts than I have. I think both charters contain 
provision for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even if I wanted to, I would not be permitted to have 
a tank at the bottom of my garden or grenades in my kitchen in a 
free and democratic society.  This annoys me a bit.  The Reformers 
are trying with this motion to do what the firearms registration 
legislation precludes and to fire up a debate where none exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no debate in Canadian society, I would hope, and 
there is certainly none in Quebec society.  I think there are far 
greater concerns within our system than that of having rights and 
freedoms under the charter to own firearms or whatever.  This is 
what the Reform Party is after with this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the person who tabled the motion; it was 
the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt.  We have to know what he wants; 
to do that, I looked at the member's various statements under 
Standing Order 31. 
We have to look at what this sort of motion means to the member. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not read everything he said, only a few passages. The member 
made the following statement under Standing Order 31: “Once again the 
Liberal government is way off target”.  It is true that the Liberals 
across the way are off target every now and then, in fact more often 
than not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He added “Rather than cracking down on the use of firearms to 
commit crimes, and rather than strengthening enforcement measures along 
our borders to stop the illegal flow of handguns, the minister would 
prefer to continue to harass ordinary law-abiding Canadians, even going 
so far as to deny them use of their own private property”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see where the Reformers are going with this. In another 
statement he made under Standing Order 31, he said that the Liberal 
government should be ashamed of trampling the property rights of 
Canadians. The Liberals should be ashamed of many things, but perhaps 
not of what the Reformers are accusing them of in this particular case. 
I can hear them laughing across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> That is the former Liberal showing through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> A leopard cannot change its spots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More seriously, through their motion, Reformers are trying to sway 
members, but we must realize what their ultimate goal is: the sacrosanct 
debate held in this House on the gun registration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As flawed as it may be, I think that this legislation has become 
generally accepted by the public at large. 
This morning I inquired about the registration process on behalf of a 
constituent, and I was told that the forms will only be available in 
October. So, let us first see how the system is working. Let us give it 
time to show its flaws, its weaknesses and its strengths. Because there 
is surely some good in the legislation. Then we can try to make it 
better. But let us not try to block a law that has yet to be 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put things in perspective, before challenging such an act or 
making proposals in this House, we must first look at the purpose of the 
charter, at what may be enshrined in it. The whole issue must be looked 
at in light of the specific objective of the Reformers, which has to do 
with the gun registration legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the purpose of the charter, the relatively recent 
constitutional entrenchment of human rights in charters shows a tendency 
to protect individual rights. However, such efforts must respect the 
essential balance that must exist between the rights of individuals and 
those of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without this balance, it would, for all intents and purposes, be 
impossible to administer the state. The rights of the citizens of a 
state must be in harmony with the common good of the community. This is 
why it is essential to respect individual rights, to the extent that the 
community's safety is not jeopardized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is a principle recognized by any person of good 
faith, by any person who examines a bill or anything else, 
correctly, intelligently, using common sense, and sees that it can 
be applicable and appropriate to its intended objective, within a 
framework many may find suitable, in this case the constitutional 
framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual rights must not prevail over collective rights, or 
vice versa. A balance must be sought and I believe the 
legislator—by which I mean all of the members of this House, 
whether in government or in opposition, all of us together—has 
this desire for balance in mind when passing legislation, 
proposing amendments or voting for or against a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the firearms registration legislation, which as I have 
already said is the real object of this motion, I believe that 
balance has been achieved.  The future will no doubt prove whether 
anything needs to be changed or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you that the Bloc Quebecois introduced a series 
of amendments.  It called for the government to make changes on a 
number of specific points.  The government, it must be admitted, 
did agree we were right on certain points.  In committee, the 
Minister of Justice at the time agreed that the Bloc Quebecois was 
right about certain amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are grateful to him for that, because I believe it was best 
for the public, best for the legislation involved, that the 
minister listened to the Bloc Quebecois at that time. However, some 
of the changes and amendments we suggested were rejected.  Perhaps 
the future will prove once again that we were right and that the 
Liberal government ought to amend its legislation along the lines 
of what the Bloc Quebecois was proposing at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, however, and that is that the 
legislation was passed and is now in effect. It has gone through 
all the stages of the democratic system in Canada and Quebec, 
and you can be sure that not a single Bloc Quebecois member of 
Parliament will oppose the proper workings of democracy in this 
country called Canada, and in the emerging country which will be 
called Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to tell you a little story and it starts back around 
1215.  King John came back from a war in France and his coffers 
were empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went to his barons and his lords and demanded taxation moneys 
from them to fill the coffers of the lands so that he could once 
again wage war.  His lords and his barons at that time said that 
this was inappropriate since they were receiving nothing in 
return from the king.  He was merely taking tax money from them 
with no benefit derived whatsoever on their part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They forced the king to sign the Magna Carta in 1215.  That is 
the first time that we know of in modern western history of a 
recognition of the right to own property.  There have been many 
other precedents since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly noteworthy is when in 1776 a large part of the 
colonies on this new continent broke away from the United Kingdom 
and British rule because they did not believe in taxation without 
representation.  They believed in the right to hold and to own 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to hold property has several important components, 
many of which are touched on in this private member's bill. It 
recognizes that people have the right to own property, that they 
use and enjoy it, that they not be deprived of that right without 
full, just and timely compensation in due process of law. If we 
do not have a process of law in terms of the recognition of 
property, it is merely at the caprice, the will of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that laws and statutes are important.  Indeed 
that is why we sit here today.  That is why we have this 
assembly, this commons, so that the people of Canada understand 
the laws, the regulations and the rules.  Without that there is 
anarchy.  As a result, point one is that the process of law must 
be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point number two is that people have timely, just and fair 
compensation.  Without fair compensation there is no true value 
in property or for what people hold.  For example, the Bloc 
member spoke to Bill C-68 and gun registration.  It touches on 
many others such as Bill C-4 and the wheat board act. There have 
been several others that have been passed in this House that 
touch on this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people do not have a sense of fair, timely and just 
compensation, then indeed things can be taken from them. 
Something worth a dollar can be taken from them and they are 
given back merely pennies, a dime or a nickel in exchange for 
what its true value or worth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in our history not long ago where that was done.  It was 
the Japanese internment during the second world war.  It has been 
widely recognized in this House I think by all parties that those 
Japanese Canadians were done a wrong. Why they were done a wrong? 
Property was taken from them without fair, just and timely 
compensation, something we recognize happening less than 50 years 
ago and yet we see the importance of it.  We make corrections at 
a later date.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important criterion is that it is transferable because 
if the property is not saleable or transferable, if I cannot pass 
my ability to own that property to another, then indeed is it 
really mine and do I have full jurisdiction over it?  This 
touches on the jurisdictional aspects of private property. 
Someone should have complete and full jurisdiction of their 
property in order for it to be considered private property.  With 
this comes the whole idea of transferability.  Therefore the 
state should not be able to regulate or restrict an individual's 
ability to transfer that property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recent developments in this country that call attention 
to the whole idea of the right to own property.  One of these is 
the bill of rights which included the right to own property.  It 
is interesting how later on when we tried to constitutionalize 
this in 1982 there were objections to including the right to own 
private property in the Constitution which later became the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the provinces that opposed that right but claimed it was 
not involved in the final negotiation of the Constitution was 
Quebec.  Prince Edward Island was another. Unfortunately due to 
the objections of a few of the provinces we did not see the 
inclusion of private property entrenched in the Constitution of 
this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, what have we seen come down the pipe?  Bill C-68, 
the gun registration act, speaks to this.  In Bill C-68 there are 
provisions for the confiscation of private property.  Somebody 
can own a collection of firearms and be unable to pass that on to 
their children, nor even be able to sell it.  Why? The government 
has made provisions for confiscation, confiscation without fair 
compensation.  There is not provision for what the real and true 
value or marketable value of those firearms may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, the Canadian Wheat Board Act, which was recently 
passed in this House, does not recognize the right of farmers to 
own the grain they produce by the sweat and toil of their own 
labour, to be able to sell that freely as they so choose.  It 
violates their transferability because they are not allowed to 
sell that to whomever they wish.  It violates their fair, just 
and timely compensation because they cannot get the full value 
and true market value of their grain.  They are forced to sell it 
through the wheat board.  They are also deprived of what I 
consider to be a fundamental process of law when we have people 
who want to exercise the transferability right and the 
compensation right and yet they are jailed and shackled and 
deprived of their machinery, fined and cannot work the family 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three of these fundamental tenets have been violated with 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  As I say, they were also violated 
with Bill C-68, the gun registration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that these things have been done in the past because 
that is water under the bridge.  If we form government we hope to 
repeal some of those pieces of legislation.  More than that, this 
government is also proposing and considering ideas on endangered 
species legislation. I would like to enlighten the House in terms 
of what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that in a given section of land that somebody may own, 
if it is found to be that there is a habitat they did not even 
know existed and they are found to have potentially violated that 
habitat by driving in, around or near it, they can have that 
entire section of land quarantined from their use even though 
they did not know it existed.  They can also face heavy fines and 
jail terms as a result of violating that habitat according to the 
way the law is defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that going to encourage?  It is going to encourage 
people to go ahead and decimate their lands and get rid of any of 
those special habitats rather than to go ahead and protect them 
with some form of incentive.  Using only disincentives will 
encourage people to go ahead and obliterate those lands and get 
rid of any of those special habitats that may exist.  As a 
result, I do not think that helps the populations that we are 
trying to protect in terms of endangered species or any wildlife. 
I do not think that does anything to help the owners of the 
property.  I also do not think it does anything to help advance 
the cause the government claims to be supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at all these things, I do not think the government 
has learned the fundamental lesson.  I hope at the next election 
it pays the price for that.  It so sorely does not understand the 
whole idea of private property.  Nothing violates someone so 
badly as having their private property taken from them. I will 
speak about a personal experience, the reason my family came to 
this country.

269 put forward by my colleague for Saskatoon—Humboldt.  I 
indicate at the outset that we are in support of this motion for 
reasons I will outline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right away I state uncategorically that the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada has always supported the principles 
of individuals' unencumbered rights to own property.  The best 
guarantors of prosperity and well-being of the people of Canada 
are found in the freedom of individuals to pursue their 
enlightened and legitimate self-interest within a competitive 
economy.  That goes further to say that the freedom of individual 
Canadians to enjoy the fruits of their labour and to the greatest 
extent possible to have property lies within that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently no provision in the charter of rights and 
freedoms that prevents the government from taking away a person's 
property, something that is owned rightfully by them.  There is 
nothing there to restrict the government in any way from passing 
laws which prohibit the ownership, use and enjoyment or further 
the reduction of the value of property owned by an individual. 
That is very frightening thing to think that those violations 
could occur without the protection of our charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight the fact that the provisions of the charter 
of rights and freedoms require that the government provide fair 
and timely compensation.  That again is drawn into question 
without the entrenchment of property rights within our 
Constitution.  Surely we do not want any restriction on the use 
and enjoyment of property or the government's ability to 
interfere with the value of a person's property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is trite and perhaps goes without saying that it is a 
fundamental human right to own and use property in the way which 
a person deems appropriate, with the stipulation that as long as 
it does not infringe on the rights of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights are natural and fundamental and are based on 
hundreds of years of common law.  One might suggest that common 
law in itself is sufficient protection.  I disagree.  For that 
reason among others it is necessary that we have these rights 
entrenched in our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the government may have intentionally left property 
rights out of the Constitution in 1982 for fear that there would 
be some detriment to Canadians' democratic rights and economic 
freedoms.  This motion is a step in the right direction. It is a 
step toward bringing about a change, a much needed and necessary 
change to our charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the only legal protection that does exist in federal 
law rests in the Canadian Bill of Rights which was introduced by 
Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Section 1(a) of the 
Canadian Bill of Rights states specifically: “The right of the 
individual to life, liberty, security of the person and the 
enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except by due process of law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Canadian Bill of Rights is a federal statue which can 
be overridden by any other federal statue, mainly the charter, 
this protection is not enough.  Why does this omission exist? 
Why is there an omission of property rights within our charter of 
rights and freedoms?  It is a significant omission. Aside from 
the poor guarantee of the bill of rights, there is no requirement 
in Canadian constitutional law that compulsory taking of property 
can be effected by a fair procedure or that it can be accompanied 
by a fair compensation for the owner.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point I quote a well known professor of constitutional 
law, Professor Peter Hogg: “The omission of property rights from 
section 7 of the charter greatly reduces its scope.  It means 
that section 7 affords no guarantee of compensation or even a 
fair procedure for the taking of property by government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This again is a frightening situation when it happens to any 
Canadian who rightfully owns property.  As has been suggested 
throughout some of the remarks, an individual who may have 
inherited property that was passed down through generations, that 
a family has saved for and done without, is suddenly faced with 
this type of confiscation of property. There is a real need to 
ensure this does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we did not have a Constitution the protection of property 
rights would then revert to what I spoke of earlier, the common 
law.  But since we have a Constitution with entrenched rights 
within our country it only makes sense to broaden the net to 
include specifically the property rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights are recognized from time immemorial in common 
law but with our Constitution in this country this omission is 
something that has to be remedied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To not make sure the law protects property rights would leave it 
upon the courts to address this situation when it arises.  Again, 
I suggest that it is incumbent upon this House and members of 
Parliament and this procedure to address this inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other Canadians and I have waited long enough for this to 
happen.  All members of the House appear for the most part to be 
in support of this. But what are the exact property rights that 
we are talking about?  Property rights mean freedom from 
arbitrary interference by one's government.  They mean a 
guarantee that one's rights will not be deprived, that one's 
property will not be taken away or restricted in any way by undue 
government interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also sets out three very limited conditions where a 
government might infringe on that right in this piece of 
legislation.  The taking of property must be for public use. 
There are instances that we are all familiar with where there may 
be an expropriation of property for a throughway, a pipeline, a 
power line or some legitimate use.  In those cases there are 
easements available and the law can address it in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another instance where government might deprive an individual of 
a property right would be the taking of the property through due 
process of law, that is, a confiscation based on a bill that is 
owing, an outstanding debt that has to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the taking of property must be done with just and timely 
compensation.  That is, an arbitrary seizure of property without 
compensation or done so in an unfair and arbitrary way would be 
outside the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this issue 81% of Canadians consider either very 
or fairly important the right to include property rights in our 
charter of rights and freedoms, and 81% of Canadians are not 
wrong in this. The Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce, the Canada Real Estate Association as well as many 
other organizations support the inclusion of property rights 
within our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Including property rights also follows the fine example of many 
other countries around the world.  Some of those countries, the 
United States, Germany, Italy, Finland, have seen the need and 
have done so within their charters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights are an issue that transcend any partisan 
politics.  They have widespread application and appeal and are 
something that all members of this House should consider very 
seriously before casting their vote against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following prominent Canadians have voted in favour in the 
past on property rights being included in our Constitution: John 
Diefenbaker, Lester B. Pearson, Paul Martin Sr., Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, Brian Mulroney and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would suggest there is a tradition to be followed. There 
is an opportunity now for this House to put these rights in place 
to ensure that inequities as they arise from ownership of 
property are going to be addressed and addressed in the proper 
forum, which is this House. 
For these reasons and many others, I support this motion as do 
the members of my party.  I encourage all members of this House 
to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the motion by my colleague on the other side of 
this House calls states that the charter of rights and freedoms 
be amended to recognize the right of every person to own and 
enjoy property— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  The standing orders indicate that the member 
who moves the motion has the right to speak for five minutes at 
the end of debate.  We have about five minutes left so the time 
should revert to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The rule pertaining 
to this states that the member who has proposed the motion has 
the right to five minutes only if another member does not rise to 
complete the hour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, Standing Order 95(2) says 
that “provided that the member moving the item may speak for not 
more than fifteen minutes”—that is at the beginning—“and 
provided that the said member may, if he or she chooses, speak 
again for not more than five minutes, commencing five minutes 
before the conclusion of the hour during which the said item is 
to be considered”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear in the standing order that it is the choice of 
the member.  The member has chosen to exercise that right and I 
ask that he be given that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Speaker of the 
House has already ruled on that issue and has stated very clearly 
that the member can only use the last five minutes if nobody else 
rises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was stating, 
the motion of the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt asks that 
the charter of rights and freedoms be amended to recognize the 
right of every person to enjoy and own property and not be 
deprived of that right without full, just and timely compensation 
and due process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member has not read the charter of rights and 
freedoms.  Perhaps the hon. member is not cognizant of our 
Canadian Bill of Rights, but property rights are already 
protected in the Canadian Bill of Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the coming of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
in 1982 which duplicated many of the provisions of the Canadian 
Bill of Rights, it is important to understand how the bill of 
rights enacted in 1960 fits into the larger scheme of human 
rights protections in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill of rights remains in force but is substantially 
different from the charter as it does not apply to provincial 
legislation or actions.  It operates as a federal statute which 
is applicable to federal laws and actions.  Whereas the charter 
expressly overrides any act, whether it be federal or provincial 
that is inconsistent with the charter, the Canadian Bill of 
Rights does not have express provisions that permit it to 
override other federal statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the difference between the bill and the charter is 
that the bill does not have a limitation clause as provided by 
section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What 
does the lack of a limitation clause mean for the protection of 
property rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the hon. members on the other side of the House 
who are supporting this motion listen carefully to what I am 
about to say.  They might actually learn something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I have to 
interrupt the hon. member.  The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for: (1) failing to 
explain why it is negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment (the MAI); (2) failing to explain what benefits and 
costs it foresees for the Canadian people; and (3) failing to 
take part in public discussion on the Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to lead off this debate 
today.  A number of my colleagues will be speaking as well 
because this is a very big concern in their ridings.  Some of 
them will be speaking from their critic area, such as fisheries, 
culture and other areas where there are some concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out at the outset that the multilateral 
agreement on investment which is being negotiated is a Liberal 
government initiative to make Canada a part of the negotiations 
at the OECD in Paris.  Our negotiators have been there since 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that during the election campaign in June 
there was hardly any mention of the multilateral agreement on 
investment.  In fact some Liberal members when contacted denied 
that negotiations were going on.  People who heard about the 
negotiations were concerned and they raised the issue during the 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we in the Reform Party were asked what our stand would be 
we said that we did not know much about the negotiations, but 
that we were in favour of free trade in principle and free trade 
in investment.  We supported the free trade agreement and also 
the NAFTA, both of which have substantial investment sections. 
In principle we are in favour of the MAI, but we want to know a 
lot more of the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, the government had to name a new cabinet 
after the election.  In September when the government returned, a 
new minister was appointed to the international trade portfolio. 
We thought that he would explain what the MAI meant to Canadians. 
In fact we asked the minister if we could meet with the chief 
negotiator, Mr. Dymond, to explain it to us because we wanted to 
be up to speed on the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dymond told us that the directions from the new minister 
were to be a lot more open and to tell people what the deal was 
about.  The minister himself when he came to committee assured us 
that the government would be much more active in explaining the 
deal to Canadians. As a result of that we gave the new minister 
the benefit of the doubt.  We expected that he and the chief 
negotiator would be addressing the concerns being raised across 
the country. However we were surprised when that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer in mid-November was to ask the 
Sub-Committee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and 
Investment to do a study.  We were told that we had a very short 
time to do that study.  The government wanted the report before 
the House rose in the middle of December.  By the time we 
factored in a week to put the report together, it only gave the 
subcommittee three weeks to hear witnesses.  It did not give us 
time to travel across the country to places like British Columbia 
where the concern seemed to be the greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note whose job it is to inform the public.  I 
would submit that it is the government's job.  It is the Liberal 
government's job to inform the public of what the benefits are 
and what the downside may be in negotiating a multilateral 
agreement on investment.  It is the government's job to take it 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we condemning the government for its failure to explain 
why it is negotiating the multilateral agreement on investment? 
Why is it failing to explain the benefits and costs to the 
Canadian people?  Why is it failing to take part in public 
discussion on the agreement? We will endeavour to smoke out the 
government today and try to engage it in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been negotiating the agreement for two years at the 
OECD.  Largely the negotiations have been secret. 
There was no mention during the election campaign, except for 
some groups that came that were getting wind of it like the 
Council of Canadians.  The NDP started to raise it as an election 
issue.  Some Liberal members, even cabinet ministers, were in 
denial.  They said that Canada would not be doing that.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we were in favour in principle of an agreement 
depending on how it came out.  We recognized that investment 
leads to trade and trade leads to jobs but we wanted to see what 
was being negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really ironic.  There was no mention of distrust back in 
1993 in red book No. 1 or in red book No. 2 for that matter. 
There was no mention in the throne speech.  These were all areas 
where the government had a chance to outline what its initiatives 
were going to be for the upcoming mandate.  There was no mention 
of it.  Why not?  It is difficult for us to understand why it 
would not be trying to inform the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result there was growing interest in what the MAI really 
meant.  Many of our members, and I am sure government members, 
must be getting a flood of mail in their offices. There are a lot 
of people out there who are spreading what I think is false 
information, but nonetheless information and accusations that 
have to be met head on by this government in answers to things 
such as Canada is going to lose its health care, Canada is going 
to lose sovereignty as a result of this, government will no 
longer be able to make laws and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is a major initiative yet requires support building from 
this government.  That simply is not happening.  As a result the 
public is only getting one side of this issue.  Those from the 
flat earth society would have us believe that the free trade 
agreement with the United States, which contained an investment 
chapter, expanded to NAFTA in 1992 were bad for us and it would 
roll that back.  The same group seemed to be lined up on the side 
of the MAI debate saying no, do not go ahead with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the minister in all this debate?  Is he out doing talk 
shows?  Is he doing radio presentations to Canadians? Television? 
Where is he?  He is nowhere at all.  No town halls. I should not 
say that. He actually gave a presentation last week to a bunch of 
business executives at the Chateau Laurier hotel. That is 
important but it is vitally important that the minister explain 
this deal to Canadians and he is simply missing in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister points to the subcommittee and says he gave it to 
the subcommittee on international trade to study.  That is true. 
He did.  He gave us a very short time frame, but he did.  Three 
weeks.  What did we hear from witnesses at the subcommittee? Let 
me just read a few of the quotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elizabeth Smythe from Concordia College in Edmonton said “More 
public consultation on negotiations should take place.” We heard 
all kinds of comments like that from almost every witness at 
committee. Elizabeth Smythe also said  “It is not enough for 
citizens to get a chance to vote for a government once every four 
years if the kind of trade-offs and choices on important 
international investment rules are never outlined during an 
election campaign”. Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard all kinds of that.  What was the government's response? 
Let me read it.  The committee of which I see a couple of 
members here wrote a report as a result of the three weeks of 
hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation was that the government should stay 
engaged at the OECD and try to achieve an agreement.  The number 
two recommendation of the committee, an all-party committee, was 
the government should continue to increase its efforts to inform 
Canadians of the merits of negotiating an MAI while addressing 
the concerns brought forward by this committee in public 
hearings.  Exactly what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the few people that had a chance to come to the committee, 
the 75 groups or whatever, many of them raised concerns.  They 
said that they were not hearing enough about it, that they did 
not know exactly what the government was intending to do. The 
committee recognized that and made the recommendation that the 
government should explain this deal to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Reform Party, while in general agreement with the 
thrust of trying to negotiate an agreement said in the second 
paragraph of its dissenting opinion “While we believe a good 
agreement will be in Canada's best interest, we acknowledge the 
apprehension felt by many Canadians in our country.  Given the 
amount of genuine concern around the MAI, we are perplexed that 
the Liberal government has not put a concerted effort into an 
information campaign”.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many witnesses before the subcommittee commented on the need for 
much wider public consultation.  At least the three weeks of 
hearings by the subcommittee should have been extended to include 
a week or more of hearings in the west.  It simply did not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It even got worse.  That committee report came down in December. 
Where was the minister after that?  As I said, at one appearance 
at the Chateau Laurier for breakfast.  He expects people from 
Victoria, Kamloops and Grande Prairie to come to the Chateau 
Laurier for breakfast with him.  What kind of consultation is 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Liberal members say when they were in opposition?  What 
did they say about this kind of approach to big government?  They 
said that in the red book that the Liberal government would 
govern with integrity and that open government would be the 
watchword of the Liberal government.  What does open government 
mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also went on to say that the most important asset of 
government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens to whom it 
is accountable.  There is evidence today of considerable 
dissatisfaction with government.  They talk about the Mulroney 
government and a steady erosion of confidence in the people and 
the institutions of the public sector.  This erosion of 
confidence seems to have many causes.  Some have to do with the 
behaviour of certain elected politicians but others have to do 
with an arrogant style of political leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are irritated with governments that do not consult 
them or that disregard their views or that try to conduct key 
parts of public business behind closed doors.  Is that not deja 
vu?  Why have they not learned their lesson?  They said they 
would consult with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to briefly review where we have been in terms of 
investment in Canada in the last 30 years.  We had a Liberal 
government under Pierre Trudeau that actually tried to discourage 
foreign investment with the Foreign Investment Review Agency.  It 
had the effect he wanted.  It discouraged investment.  Then Brian 
Mulroney came in, in 1984, and changed the style.  The 
Conservatives said we needed investment in Canada, that 
investment was good for us.  They instituted Investment Canada 
and tried to encourage investment.  Then we went as far as 
signing the free trade agreement with the United States in 1988. 
A big section, chapter 11, dealt with investment and the rules 
needed for investment.  We expanded that in the NAFTA in 1992 to 
include Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we were negotiating at the Uruguay round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  We were trying to get an 
investment section there, but there was something like 130 member 
countries, not all of whom were interested in investment.  Their 
economies were simply too small.  The Ivory Coast and many 
countries in the third world have economies that are simply not 
ready for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It failed, but there was still a need to have a common set of 
rules for investment in the same way as we have rules for trade 
in goods and services.  They tried again and the initiative went 
to the OECD in 1995.  It was all great; there was no problem with 
it.  The only problem I see is that we had a Liberal government 
that did not want to explain it to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at stake in this multilateral agreement on investment? 
We need to know.  There is growing interest.  Other people want 
to know what is at stake and there is concern.  It is entirely 
possible the entire deal may fall through. Countries like the 
United States have said that there is not enough in the agreement 
for them to sign it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP would love that.  We saw what happened in British 
Columbia when the NDP government was in power from 1991. 
Investment dropped off every year the NDP was in government in 
B.C.  All of a sudden I see big ads in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
and other places advertising for investments.  I guess the NDP 
government now recognizes it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deal may fall through because too many countries are saying 
they need broad exemptions for this and broad exemptions for 
that.  Exemptions are fine if they are in our national interest, 
but let us define them as closely as we need to, to protect that 
interest, not take a broad brush and try to paint it so we 
essentially have a shell deal here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit is that Canadian investors are investing abroad 
in increasing numbers.  We had $170 billion of Canadian 
investment outside our country last year.  That was almost equal 
to what our investment is in Canada.  They need the rules that 
some kind of international agreement would provide, rules that 
say we have to treat foreign companies in the same way as we 
treat domestic companies.  We can still make regulations and 
rules, but we have to treat them in the same way.  In the event 
of an expropriation it would be done in a just and timely manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a couple of quotes of people who appeared before the 
committee.  First is a quote by Steven Stinson of the Canadian 
Pulp and Paper Association, a pretty big employer in Canada: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—evidence of increasing trade and investment flows among the 
three signatory countries suggests (NAFTA) has been of broad 
benefit. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>George Miller of the Mining Association of Canada said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade follows investments.  Because of the expertise gained in 
Canada and the entrée provided by Canadian mining 
investment—our suppliers of mining equipment and services are 
welcomed to Latin American countries and other parts of the 
developing world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment is the lifeblood of economic development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is something like $7 billion of Canadian mining 
investment now in countries like Chile.  Alan Rugman of the 
University of Toronto, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would logically seem to me—that if we can get an MAI—that 
has the same rules as in NAFTA, we will have better access for 
the outward investment in which Canadian firms engage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Percy, dean of business at the University of Alberta, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live and die by competing in international markets.  Our 
standard of living depends on our ability to be competitive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the remarkable things that has happened in western 
Canada...is the tremendous expansion in tradable 
services...—business services, environmental services, oilfield 
services—(that) have been directed not only to the U.S. market 
but worldwide. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are gaining confidence in investing outside our 
country, Canadians like Canadian Fracmaster in Calgary where 
there are people I know personally working in places like Russia 
and China and bringing paycheques and dividends home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Reform position in terms of investment?  We 
recognize the linkage between investment and trade.  We recognize 
the linkage between trade and jobs.  It has been very good for us 
to be part of a NAFTA type arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that Canadian companies need a physical presence 
abroad.  To make trade work they have to make some kind of an 
investment in another country usually before trade can take 
place.  We support free trade in principle.   We believe in the 
protection of private property.  We supported the free trade 
agreement and NAFTA which both have investment rules.   We also 
supported GATT and the Uruguay round.  By the way, GATT has been 
in place since 1947. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we support a NAFTA style expanded investment 
agreement, but we want to know that it is a NAFTA style 
investment agreement.  We want to know what we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of an investment agreement we want to see these 
principles:  transparency and openness in multilateral 
negotiations, and there is no reason why this should not take 
place; a national treatment, investment protection and effective 
dispute settlement mechanism; the elimination of performance 
requirements; the freedom to transfer payments and after tax 
profits; free movement of key personnel and minimum sectoral 
exemptions.  If we need exemptions, let us define them as clearly 
as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wonder why the Liberal government is not trying to 
sell this deal.  I am not sure what it is afraid of.  We know it 
was very much opposed to the free trade agreement.  It fought the 
free trade agreement and NAFTA.  In fact the present trade 
minister was one of the biggest proponents of not signing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a couple of quotes from what he said in the past. 
I wonder if that is why the Liberals are so lukewarm to the 
agreement.  In 1992 he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend (the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca) for suggesting 
that this House condemn the government for its failure to be 
completely open with Canadians about its principal goals and 
objectives in the current North American free trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, it is a shame that we have to rely on our 
newspapers to begin to enlighten not only Canadians but elected 
Canadians who are supposed to deal with issues on behalf of the 
26 million shareholders of this company called Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the House of Commons not debating the parameters of what 
it is that Canada should be pushing for or what Canada should not 
be encouraging? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet back home, on an issue that is fundamental to the 
livelihoods of all Canadians, there is silence and ignorance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government.  Why is it not involved?  The 
present Minister for International Trade said all those things in 
1992. These were very good questions.   Why were there not open 
negotiations?  Does the same thing apply in 1998 on the 
multilateral agreement on investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not really believe in free trade.  It is either 
that or an awful lot of arrogance on the part of the government 
we are facing across the way, the Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same kind of deal we had with the Kyoto summit.  There 
were no negotiations with the provinces until the last minute. In 
fact we had that again with the MAI.  The minister did not meet 
with the provincial counterparts until last week.  Does that not 
sound familiar? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arrogance, that is what I believe it is.  It is shameful.  I 
challenge the government to get off its butt and get out there to 
explain to Canadians why this deal may be good for them, or at 
least meet the challenges head on of what people like Maude 
Barlow and the Council of Canadians are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they cannot meet those, if they cannot dispel stories that 
these are very bad for Canada, maybe it is not a good deal for 
us.  I think it is, but the Liberal government has to take up the 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection for Canadian companies is at stake, Canadian 
companies that have increased the amount of foreign investment 
outside our country by 50% in the last 10 years.  That will 
continue, but we need some rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that investment leads to trade and trade leads to 
jobs.  Mike Percy of the University of Alberta business school 
said about three months ago in response to the expansion of the 
oil sands, the tar sands in northern Alberta and the big pulp and 
paper projects that were under way in the forestry industry that 
Alberta would require $20 billion of new investment money over 
the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage investment in the country but we need to 
know the rules and we need to know that Canadian sovereignty is 
not at stake.  If there are areas where we have sensitive 
industries that need protection, let us protect them but let us 
define it as narrowly and clearly as we can so that we do not 
scuttle a deal in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government has not shown leadership.  It must 
take up the challenge and deal with Canadians, go out and tell 
Canadians what this deal is all about and why the government is 
negotiating it on their behalf. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wonder if the 
hon. member would tell me what he calls the 35 meetings with 
provincial and territorial officials since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. friend has forgotten that there are 
consultations on an ongoing basis and have been since that time. 
Could he tell us whether he counts that?  Maybe he does not count 
the ongoing meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had the delegation from British Columbia before the 
committee—I believe my hon. friend was there—the official from 
the department acknowledged that the province had been very well 
informed on an ongoing basis and commended the government for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those comments are very 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the provinces were in town last week. There 
was considerable complaint that they were not part of the 
process.  The government is negotiating on their behalf.  While 
officials from the department may have been meeting on a low 
level basis, essentially they were not part of it at the 
ministerial level until last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making, though, is that the public has not been 
informed.  The minister and the department have not been engaged, 
and I cannot understand why.  Why have they not gone out and 
talked about what the proposed benefits are to Canadians?  What 
are they afraid of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ludicrous.  When I talked with the chief negotiator in 
September and when I questioned the minister in committee in 
October, I believe, I raised these concerns and said there were 
people on the other side. I thought he was causing himself a lot 
of extra work and damage that was not necessary.  A lot of the 
objections were being raised out there that were not accurate but 
somebody had to deal with them.  The chief negotiator at the time 
said the minister's direction was for them to inform the public. 
It simply has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we getting stacks of letters?  Why are we getting all 
these phone calls?  It is because the minister has not gone to 
British Columbia to talk with Canadians about it.  That is where 
the biggest concern is.  That is his job.  Even Brian Mulroney in 
the free trade debate and NAFTA went out and sold what he thought 
were the benefits of that agreement. 
It amazes me why this government would not be doing that.  I 
cannot understand it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder 
if the member from Peace River could clarify something for me. 
There is no such thing as an MAI agreement.  There is no signed 
agreement.  Why is the member from Peace River engaging in the 
same kind of conspiratorial theory that the NDP wants to bring 
out?  How can we have a reasonable discussion on a non-existent 
agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague the parliament secretary said, I have a 
list of consistent meetings with the provinces, the private 
sector, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Information 
Technology Association, the Canadian Federation of Agricultural, 
the dairy farmers, and so on.  There has been a consultative 
process.  The member is falling into the very trap that these 
people want us to believe, that somehow there is a conspiracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member speak to that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will gladly speak to 
that issue.  It makes my case about the arrogance of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government want to do?  Is it going to be another 
Kyoto type deal where it says by the way, we were over and 
negotiated deal, this is what it is and here it is folks? That is 
not good enough.  We had lots of witnesses who said that it is 
not necessary to carry on these discussions in private. If we do 
not have public support what kind of an agreement is the 
government signing on behalf of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do have is a draft.  It was a March draft, then updated 
to May.  We know the objectives that Canada was trying to 
negotiate. What we did not have until November was the list of 
exemptions that the government was intending to table.  It is not 
good enough to come and say we have arrived at an agreement and 
here it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way it is going right now, if the government does sign an 
agreement, unless it makes some changes this could arrive on 
Canadians' desks.  In the Canada-Chile free trade agreement we 
never saw the agreement.  We never had a debate on it in the 
House of Commons.  All we got was a Canada-Chile free trade 
agreement. The government said by the way, as a result of this we 
have to amend some legislation to make it work.  That is the 
arrogant style that Mulroney had and that the Liberal government 
condemned.  I just read the kinds of comments it made in 1992. 
But this government is doing it all over again.  It simply is not 
good enough in these times.  Canadians want to be consulted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
of Peace River is wanting to, if I may use a vacuum cleaner 
analogy, suck and blow at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has said in the minority report that it has no 
trouble whatsoever with the MAI. It simply wants investors 
protected more.  This is a nuisance motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the NDP that has supported concerns about the 
environment, labour, people, the arts in this agreement.  All 
Reform wants to do is get some sort of attention on this issue. 
In fact, it wants to get more MAI, the quicker, the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Reform Party is why does it not be a bit more 
honest with its motion and say let us ram this MAI through faster 
than before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
interesting approach.  As we said during the election campaign in 
June, until we see the actual agreement, how are we going to 
support it.  We support the concept of a multilateral agreement 
on investment that has certain principles.  That is what we said 
in our dissenting opinion.  I just read those out for members to 
remind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did say a lot of Canadians had apprehension and concerns 
about this.  Their concerns need to be addressed.  We also said 
in our dissenting opinion that we wanted to have a public debate 
and a vote in this House of Commons before the agreement is 
ratified by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the people who are lining up against the 
rules based investment agreement are the same groups that opposed 
the free trade agreement in 1988. 
I was not in government but I remember at the time that the sky 
was going to fall.  Everything that could possible go wrong with 
Canada was going to go wrong.  That is what we got from the NDP.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the member for Dartmouth raises the fact 
that the Reform Party is not very consistent.  It seems to me 
that the NDP has had a few supply days that could have been 
dedicated to this since September.  Where was it on this issue? 
There are a lot of mistruths being put out to the public, 
especially in B.C.  I challenge the government to deal with 
those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is very constructive to say, as the NDP 
government of B.C. did when it came to committee, that Canada 
should walk away from this deal and not be involved in the 
negotiations at all.  I do not think that is very constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what has happened to investment in the province of 
British Columbia in the last seven years. It has dropped every 
year to an all time low.  The premier of B.C. is advertising in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and the <I>Financial Post</I> “we 
encourage investment in the province of B.C.”.  It is because 
they are in serious trouble there.  Business is leaving in 
droves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the NDP has had lots of opportunity. It has 
taken its opportunities in town hall meetings to talk about how 
bad this is.  I has talked about getting out of the free trade 
agreement with the United States and Mexico.  I do not think it 
would have very much support for that across Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me today to debate this issue on 
the MAI.  I chaired the subcommittee on international trade and 
trade disputes.  We had the opportunity to study the MAI for 
three months before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the hon. member was a member of that committee.  He 
knows we heard from some 50 witnesses in the month of November 
including the chief negotiator, the Minister for International 
Trade and a number of significantly large Canadian groups which 
represented concerns on this issue.  We brought forward a report 
on the MAI which is available to all Canadians if they order it 
from Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this report is on the Internet.  It is at www.parl.gc.ca. 
Also the Department of Foreign Affairs has a site specific to 
this, www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca.  There is all kinds of information 
on the Internet from all over the world on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the opposition parties to show any government 
involved in these negotiations which has been more open on this 
issue.  We had witnesses before the committee who stated that 
this is one of the most open negotiations in the history of these 
government led trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to talk about the recommendations 
in our report.  I feel they reflect what Canadians were telling 
us across Canada.  I agree with the hon. members who say that 
there is a great deal of misinformation or disagreement as to 
what is in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also question the hon. member especially on what he said in 
terms of negotiation and information being given to the provinces 
and the territories.  There were plenty of meetings throughout 
the history of these negotiations with the provinces to let them 
know.  Representatives of British Columbia appeared before the 
committee. The representative who was not a politician agreed 
that they had been informed by the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary said, there were some 30 meetings 
with the provinces over the years, but there were also meetings 
with private organizations and non-government organizations such 
as the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters Canada, auto parts 
manufacturers, auto industry associations, book and periodical 
councils, the Canadian Auto Workers, Canadian book publishers, 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Canada Council for the 
Arts, the Canadian Environmental Law Association and the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture.  There were numerous meetings with 
representatives of these groups as well as correspondence.  The 
list goes on.  Clearly there has been a lot of effort made by the 
government to inform Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to speak about the recommendations 
of the subcommittee, as they reflect what Canadians from across 
the country who appeared before the subcommittee wanted us to 
tell the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first recommendation called on the government to continue 
participating in the MAI negotiations but only if the final text 
fully protects Canadian culture, the environment, labour 
standards, health, education and social services, both at the 
federal and subnational levels; in other words, federally, 
provincially and municipally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important point.  There is confusion in terms of 
what role each level of government can play in this issue.  The 
federal government has spent a lot of time with the provinces in 
bringing light to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second recommendation was outlined by the previous speaker. 
It recommends that the government continue and increase its 
efforts to inform Canadians.  That was agreed to by all members. 
It was felt that the government should be informing the public. I 
know the government has reacted.  Since the subcommittee reported 
the minister has spoken publicly on the issue.  It is incumbent 
on all members to do that as well.  They have received 
information packages from the government which they should 
include in their householders to let Canadians know what the 
issues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation is to fully involve the provinces.  I 
have already spoken about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the fourth recommendation, it is felt that the 
government should consider undertaking a full impact study to let 
Canadians know the impacts this will have on certain sectors of 
our economy.  It is not practical early on in the negotiations to 
do this because we do not really know what will be in the final 
text.  These issues will be negotiated, but we do not know what 
will be the final conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee indicated that it wanted to look at this issue 
again to ensure that Canadians continue to be informed.  It is 
important that the government let Canadians know and it is in the 
process of doing that with respect to the full impacts the 
agreement will have on certain sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth recommendation was that for future negotiations there 
should be an open and transparent process and public 
consultations and disclosure as much as is practical under the 
circumstances.  I do not think hon. members expect that 
negotiations such as this can take place with a million groups 
looking over the shoulders of the negotiators.  Frankly, that is 
not practical.  However, what is practical is as these 
negotiations continue governments can give updates to certain 
sectors of the economy.  They can have meetings, such as those 
which took place under the WTO when we had farm groups coming in 
to talk about agriculture.  They were actually there in Geneva at 
the time with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments can do these things.  I know that governments have 
asked certain international groups to the OECD, have met with 
them and have brought them up to date on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth recommendation was that the definition of investment 
in the MAI should be clarified and should reflect the approach 
taken in the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh recommendation was, in the interests of certainty, 
that governments and investors under the MAI ensure that it 
reflects which international agreement takes precedence in terms 
of the rules.  As we know, there is the WTO, there is the NAFTA 
and now there is the MAI. 
We wanted to make sure Canadians knew before they invested which 
international agreement took precedence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number eight was that we wanted the government to use this 
agreement to subsequently pursue an investment accord worldwide. 
We feel it is important for Canadian corporations.  I know the 
opposition likes to talk about these as big international 
corporations but over the past number of years the smaller 
corporations have been engaging in the majority of world 
investment.  Canadian small and medium size enterprises are 
presently the major worldwide investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about big monoliths. We are talking about 
small businesses throughout Canada.  They need certainty in some 
of the smaller countries that are not in the OECD to ensure their 
investments are safe.  That investment helps with trade and it 
helps Canadian businesses get in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Why aren't you telling the public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  We are telling the public.  We sent 
something to the member which I hope he will put in his 
householder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all Canadians to get a copy of our report. I feel it 
reflects what Canadians are saying.  The government has indicated 
to all members in the House that it thinks the report is good and 
that it will reflect the final outcome of the negotiations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for his comments. They were well intended and well 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subject has raised a lot of concern back home.  It goes 
back to the general election campaign.  People were asking 
questions about the MAI then and they are still asking the same 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government hold public hearings across Canada so that 
everyday Canadian citizens will have a chance to appear before a 
committee on all aspects of the MAI?  I know the member has 
provided some ideas.  For example people can use the Internet. 
Some of the people I have talked to have said that they have had 
trouble finding this information on the Internet. Will the 
government go across Canada with a full public debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question that comes up quite often is the concern about 
preserving our Canadian culture.  The minister mentioned that he 
is looking for a country specific reservation on culture. However 
there remain issues such as standstill and rollback clauses.  If 
it is just a country specific reservation on culture, is it still 
allowed to be rolled back?  Should we not be looking for a 
general exemption on culture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Madam Speaker, in terms of the first 
question, I had hoped at that time that we would have an 
opportunity to travel across the country.  I have had a number of 
personal invitations to visit places across Canada to talk about 
the issue.  I would encourage all hon. members to get out and 
talk about the issue.  When the minister speaks, he can speak on 
behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the intention of our committee at that time to travel but 
because the negotiations were going on in January we did not have 
that opportunity.  There are many groups that represent the 
different concerns of Canadians on that issue.  We brought them 
here to make sure their points of view were expressed.  I would 
encourage the government to put more effort into getting across 
the country to inform Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the culture issue, I was disappointed in the Reform Party's 
recommendation not to protect the cultural industries which I 
feel have contributed to much job creation.  There is much 
support in Canada on that issue. 
In terms of the protection, as was said earlier and as the 
minister stated, certainly Canada has put that on as one of the 
provisions it feels is a deal breaker.  It feels if we do not get 
the protection that is needed, the Canadian government will not 
sign it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, since 
time is running short I will be very direct in my question to the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of this issue seems to come down to sovereignty, who is 
going to control the affairs of the nation.  Will it be a 
multinational corporation deciding the affairs of the nation from 
abroad or will it be the nation itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a resource rich country.  We need resource management. 
Who is going to manage our resources?  Who is going to be in 
charge of our fisheries?  Who is going to be in charge of our 
mining and our forest resources?  What protection is in the MAI 
now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the information on the MAI on the Internet.  I have 
followed it for over a year.  There is a scarcity of it.  You can 
say there is a lot there, but there is a scarcity of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  I thank the hon. member's party for 
supporting the government on this initiative in terms of our 
commitment to make sure that our governments both federally and 
provincially still have the powers they need to make sure that 
Canadians are protected in all these different areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of who is going to control it, as I said earlier, it is 
not a question of these big monolith companies versus the 
government.  Most of the people that are investing abroad are 
small and medium size enterprises.  They are the ones that need 
the protection certainly from the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to the Reform motion.  It gives me the opportunity 
to make known the Bloc's position on the multilateral agreement on 
investment or MAI.  This agreement is currently being negotiated 
among the member countries of the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the motion by the official 
opposition on the MAI primarily because the government failed to 
hold a proper public debate on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the brief hearings hastily held by the subcommittee 
on international trade, trade disputes and investment in the last 
Parliament, the House and therefore all members elected to 
represent the people were unable to debate it at length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, a number of groups including unions, non 
governmental organizations and consumer groups have unfortunately 
not had the opportunity to express their considerable reservations 
to the government on this agreement.  It is of some concern, 
because people are unaware of the agreement's existence, its scope, 
its advantages, its inconveniences and its costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to explain what is at stake in the 
MAI and yet it must do so, because, when it signs this agreement, 
the government is committing the people of Canada for over 15 
years.  The government has lacked transparency in this matter. 
It is saying, through its Minister for International Trade that, 
for the first time in Canadian history, a commercial agreement was 
considered by a parliamentary committee before it was signed.  Care 
must be taken here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agreement was examined, it was as the result of a leak 
by the NGOs, which managed to get a copy of it and to make it 
available on the Internet.  A number of members already had the 
text of the MAI and were querying the government on it.  These are 
the real reasons the government gave the MAI to a subcommittee for 
examination.  No credit should be given for transparency and good 
intentions when there were none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions from the opposition and public pressure are forcing 
the minister to organize a public information meeting shortly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like to give a brief background of the 
MAI, so as to explain its purpose and the Bloc Quebecois' position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 29 member countries of the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to negotiate a 
multilateral agreement that would liberalize foreign investments 
and clarify the rules governing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed in May 
1997, at the meeting of the OECD Ministerial Council. 
This was put off for a year, member countries being unable to agree 
on final wording because of the complexity of the procedure and, 
more importantly, differences of opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sources even indicate that key paragraphs of the text are 
covered in changes and that over 600 pages of reservations 
submitted by the various countries have yet to be negotiated.  A 
new deadline has been set for April 1998 and will not be met.  And 
we have since learned that the MAI will not be finalized before the 
fall.  The minister is therefore able, if he really wants, to 
submit the text of the agreement for public discussion and to hold 
a real debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two principles underlie the MAI: the first is non-discrimination 
against foreign companies.  This means that countries that sign 
the agreement will have to treat foreign investors and their own 
investors without distinction and without discrimination. 
Eliminating protectionist barriers and opening up our borders to 
international competition will enable our businesses to increase 
their foreign business opportunities, we are told.  The goal of the 
MAI is to create equal conditions for international investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is the legal protection of investors and 
their investments.  The goal here is to ensure that investors have 
safe access to target markets.  It is known that investments are 
not always safe because of a lack of precise rules with respect to 
investments and because of the corruption sometimes found in 
certain countries.  The recent Asian crisis is a very good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI provides for a dispute resolution mechanism that gives 
a foreign investor legal recourse if he feels he has been treated 
unfairly. 
As a result, such an investor could sue a state through a panel of 
referees with binding powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While supporting the general objectives of the MAI, the Bloc 
Quebecois shares some of the concerns expressed by a number of groups 
that testified before the sub-committee. In our view, this agreement 
will promote freer investments and trade in general and we cannot oppose 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, since capital mobility is increasing, we believe there 
should be regulations to ensure non-discrimination and protection for 
investments. This means being able not only to take advantage of 
globalization but also to manage the stress resulting from globalization 
while at the same time extending the investment system world-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a number of conditions must be met before the Bloc 
Quebecois will be able to support the signing of the MAI. 
First of all, it is important that the Canadian government negotiate the 
inclusion of a cultural safeguard clause to protect the cultural 
industry in Quebec and Canada. Under no circumstances will the Bloc 
Quebecois be satisfied with a simple reservation.  In this kind of agreement, 
a proviso does not sufficiently protect this industry as it only applies 
to those countries that requested it, while a general exemption clause 
would apply to all signatory countries. Also, the fewer the countries 
requesting a reservation, the greater the chances of it being removed in 
future negotiations.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also concerned about statements made in this 
House by the Minister for International Trade, who said on February 12 
that the agreement would not be signed if it did not include an 
exemption for culture. The minister added that he would walk away from 
the table if there is not a complete carve out for culture in the MAI. 
However, on February 13, the minister stated just the opposite in a 
speech, when he said he would agree to a reservation if he could not get 
full cultural exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential thing regarding culture and communications is to 
preserve the ability of the federal and provincial governments to set up 
policies that promote the development of that sector. 
Our planet is rich because of its diversity, its cultures, its ways of 
life and its customs. The world would lose if we tried to standardize 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also supports the subcommittee's first 
recommendation that Canada should sign the MAI provided the final text 
protects Canadian culture, the environment, work standards, health and 
education services, and social security, at the federal and provincial 
levels. We should prohibit states from lowering their national standards 
to attract foreign investments. The Bloc Quebecois will never let the 
MAI give precedence to the rights of investors and businesses over those 
of the citizens, the workers and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also believes that consultations must continue 
to take place on a regular basis with the provinces, before the Canadian 
government ratifies the agreement. 
There are currently many preliminary lists of reservations and it would 
appear that coverage of federal states remains a problem. Therefore, 
there is a need for proper and ongoing consultations between the 
provinces and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An editorial writer was right in expressing concern about the MAI's 
scope. He wondered whether we would witness the setting up of a charter 
of rights and freedoms for corporations. Some groups expressed the same 
concerns when they appeared before the committee. The MAI includes a 
number of important and far-reaching rules that will restrict 
governments' ability to regulate foreign investments, because it gives— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member's time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> Madam Speaker, could I have the unanimous consent 
of the House to finish my speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member is 
requesting unanimous consent to finish her speech.  She would need 
no more than a few moments.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> The MAI includes a number of far-reaching 
rules that will restrict governments' ability to regulate foreign 
investments, because we must not forget that it gives businesses 
the new right to challenge government decisions.  “In short, the 
MAI would give government and private enterprise the same status in 
law”, the writer commented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and in the interests of transparency, the Bloc 
Quebecois is asking the Canadian government to refer the text of 
the agreement back to the members of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade before it is signed.  Once 
again, it is absolutely essential that the Minister of 
International Trade meet this requirement for transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to move an amendment to the Reform 
motion. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding the following after the 
final use of the word “Agreement”: “, in particular by 
refusing to make a commitment to submit the text of the MAI to 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, and more specifically to its Sub-Committee on 
International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment, before 
signing the Agreement.”

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to begin my remarks this afternoon by suggesting that this 
is the first time we have had a chance to debate this issue in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After more than a year of negotiations on a deal that will 
profoundly impact on the lives of every Canadian citizen, this is 
the first chance we have had to say anything other than raise the 
issue in question period from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone indicated, the MAI is about who will make decisions 
for the future generations of Canadians.  Will it be duly elected 
governments at the local, regional, provincial and federal 
levels, or will it be large corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Mitsubishi is bigger than the country of 
Indonesia in terms of size.  Philip Morris is bigger than New 
Zealand.  Wal-Mart is bigger than Poland, Israel and Greece.  In 
my judgment and in the judgment of my party, if the MAI is passed 
and accepted by the government, it will mean that we will be 
turning over the sovereignty of our country to the whims of large 
multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the question was put to my friends in the Reform Party 
about whether they thought it was a good idea, the spokesperson 
from Peace River said he thought it was. On behalf of the New 
Democratic Party, we think this is bad.  For that reason it is 
fair to say we are the only political party in the House of 
Commons that is clearly on record as opposing the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party supports it.  It has been the enthusiastic 
cheerleader since day one.  Some people would say that Canada 
actually initiated the original discussions in the OECD to begin 
the MAI process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives have been enthusiastic NAFTA supports and FTA 
supporters.  They support the MAI.  Bloc members support the MAI. 
They are enthusiastic NAFTA supporters.  My friends in the Reform 
Party have indicated that they enthusiastically support the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support it and I will say why.  Fundamentally we do 
not want to throw away our sovereignty, but it has almost become 
a mantra in the country—and we heard it again today—that $1 
billion in foreign direct investment will create 45,000 jobs. All 
cabinet ministers have this text in their hip pockets which they 
pull out and read during every speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may be true, but when they look at what happens to foreign 
investment in Canada a very interesting picture unfolds.  In 1997 
the total of new foreign investment in Canada was $21.2 billion. 
If this is true, at first glance we ought to have no unemployment 
at all.  The reality, however, is quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What percentage of $21.2 billion of foreign investment in Canada 
in 1997 was for new business investment and what percentage was 
for the takeover of existing Canadian companies? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, 97.5% of the $21.2 billion went for acquisitions and a 
meagre 2.5% went to new foreign investment.  For all intents and 
purposes we can say that virtually all foreign investment in 1997 
was not to open up a new mine, a new business, a new mill or a 
new manufacturing plant.  It was to buy up an existing one with 
no net gain in jobs, no net gain in R and D, and no net gain in 
community benefits.  Virtually 100% of the foreign investment 
last year was simply foreign companies coming in and buying 
existing ones.  The notion that foreign investment will create 
jobs is an absolute mythology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past three years, at the urging of its corporate 
backers, the Liberal government has been negotiating a deal to 
secure a brand new charter of rights for investors behind the 
closed doors of the OECD in Paris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until very recently Canadians could not find out what this 
negotiated deal was all about.  They could not find out what our 
negotiators were negotiating.  They could not get a text.  It was 
only when the Council of Canadians leaked a text that it became a 
quasi-public document.  Later the government was embarrassed 
enough to have to generate a copy that it was working on in its 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really believed its rhetoric and that the MAI 
was a good deal for Canada, would it not want to be telling 
Canadians what it was doing?  Would it not want to inform 
Canadians about the deal?  Would it not want to tell Canadians 
the main essence of the negotiated deal in the best interest of 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wanted to do that it could send an abbreviated 
copy or an executive copy of the entire copy to virtually every 
household in Canada.  The government has the ability to do that 
at the snap of a finger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling is that the government does not want Canadians to 
know what it is negotiating.  Let us be reminded that whenever 
Canadians had a chance to vote on NAFTA they voted against NAFTA. 
They voted against free trade with the United States and Mexico. 
The government imposed it anyway, but that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows that if Canadians knew the essence of the 
agreement they would vote against it.  To this day I have not 
heard a single Canadian stand to say they think the MAI is a 
great deal.  I have heard hundreds of people say it is a bad 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the incredible work of my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party over the last few months, criss-crossing the 
country, holding public meetings and speaking wherever they could 
to try to inform people about the MAI because the government 
refused to do so.  Somebody had to tell the country about the MAI 
and we have taken that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that my friends in the Reform Party are even 
mentioning the whole issue today.  Back in April of last year it 
started to be raised in the House of Commons by the New 
Democrats.  I was one of the questioners.  A number of my 
colleagues were asking questions about the MAI.  They asked about 
the implications for Canadian sovereignty, Canadian culture, 
Canadian labour standards, environmental standards and working 
conditions.  We raised these questions day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along comes the election and my leader tried time and time again 
to get it on the political agenda of that campaign.  Many of our 
candidates tried to get it on the political agenda, but the 
Liberals did not even want to talk about it.  The Reform Party 
candidate in Kamloops said that he had never heard of the MAI. He 
thought is was something like missing in action, something to do 
with Vietnam.  The Tories did not dare say anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most critical deal that will influence the lives of 
generations of Canadian was not even mentioned by Liberal 
candidates or the Prime Minister during the election campaign. 
That is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as we got back here, what political party was up in the 
House of Commons asking to hear more about the MAI, asking for 
public hearings and an emergency debate in the House of Commons? 
Every time we were turned down, not only by the government but by 
the other political parties.  The Conservatives, the Bloc and the 
Reform Party did not want a debate on the issue in the House of 
Commons.  They voted it down.  I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the MAI was mentioned on 20 days in the House of 
Commons.  It was raised in question period because the government 
did not permit any debate on it.  There was a debate in the 
British Columbia legislature on the MAI.  I think it was the only 
province to do that. 
As a matter of fact it is clearly on record as opposing the MAI.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP in the Yukon Territory as well passed a resolution in 
the legislature against the MAI.  The NDP representative in 
Prince Edward Island put a motion on the floor of the legislature 
to oppose the MAI at least until public hearings across Canada 
were held, and it passed unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They are Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  And yes they are Tories, but it was the 
NDP member of the legislature who raised the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 it was raised 20 times in this House of Commons, 11 
times by New Democrats.  To be fair, two Liberal backbenchers 
mentioned it and one member of the Bloc.  There were no Tories 
and no Reform members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have much time to get into the details of the MAI. But 
it is fair to say it is now obligatory because of the impact on 
Canadian culture, because of the impact on the ability of elected 
governments to manage the economy in the best interest of the 
citizens they represent, because of the implications of the MAI 
against the Canadian environment and against Canadian labour 
standards, that Canadians be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this deal is signed, I would at least hope that the 
government would seek the input of Canadians as it did on NAFTA. 
We will do whatever we can as New Democrats from coast to coast 
to coast to oppose this deal. We do not think multinationals 
should be making decisions about our children's future.  We do 
not think multinational corporations should be deciding what 
comes first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I will simply say let us be reminded that as we speak 
today, Ethyl Corporation has sued the federal government for 
trying to protect the health of Canadian citizens because it says 
it takes away from its profit to do away with additives to 
gasoline.  That is what we are getting into, a trade deal that 
will impact on the lives of every Canadian. We are locking 
ourselves for 20 years into the future. Even future Parliaments 
will not have a chance to deal with this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the speech by the hon. member. It 
intrigues me that he made the statement that this is the first 
opportunity he has had in the House to talk about the MAI.  Then 
he went on to criticize everyone else for being supportive of the 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question I would like to ask him is why the NDP did not 
bring this issue before the House itself. The NDP has had supply 
days. What did it do?  It used up its supply days on other 
situations that were not nearly as important as this. The first 
thing I would like the hon. member to do is to explain to the 
people of Canada why he did not bring forth this issue right 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I would like him to explain to me is this 20 
year rule he mentioned toward the end of his speech. The 
government has said that it is actually not 20 years, that it is 
five years.  The 20 years only apply to companies that have 
invested during the five year period if a country then opts out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example if McCain Foods were to invest $300 million in a 
canning plant in Malaysia and Malaysia then opted out, McCain 
Foods would be protected for a further 15 years.  That is the 
government's explanation. Does the hon. member have some other 
version of that explanation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad my friend asked 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first day back after the 1997 general election we felt that 
we ought to raise the most important question facing the future 
of Canada, which we did.  We asked for a special debate on the 
MAI. We asked for cross-country hearings on the MAI.  We asked 
the government to inform Canadians about the details of the MAI. 
That was our first item of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We called for cross-country hearings and so on but we did not 
get the support from our friends in the other political parties. 
I do not know whether that was because they did not want to tour 
or they did not know anything about the deal. But we will set 
that aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then along came our first opposition day and we had a choice to 
make.  We acknowledged that there were 1.5 million children 
living in poverty in one of the richest countries in the world. 
We acknowledged that there were 400,000 young Canadians looking 
for work and could not find a job.  We acknowledged that there 
was only one other country that has a worse record when it comes 
to child poverty and that is the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt that it was appropriate to speak out on behalf of those 
young children who cannot pay for a lobbyist. They do not 
participate in election campaigns. 
They do not give contributions to political parties. We felt it 
was appropriate that they have a voice.  Because the children of 
Canada are our future we have put them first in terms of our 
opposition day motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Kamloops' intervention about 
how the MAI was going to completely destroy our country.  The 
reality is that 80% of our trade is with the United States, all 
of which is already encompassed under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say how it is solely the New Democratic Party that 
is concerned about this issue.  I wonder if the member could 
explain this comment in Friday's <I>Globe and Mail</I>: “Many of 
us have been encouraged to think that the fight for the MAI is 
very worthwhile, said the Saskatchewan minister responsible for 
trade, Mr. Wiens”.  It would appear that his own provincial 
government does not back his understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, not that my friend would 
attempt to distort the facts or anything that was said, let me 
first say what Premier Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan had to say 
about the MAI.  He declared that Saskatchewan will never be part 
of any global trade agreement that was essentially a race to the 
bottom in terms of conditions and standards for people.  He said 
that any international trade agreement would have to recognize 
trade union rights, the preservation of the environment and human 
rights before Saskatchewan would even consider signing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all absent from the MAI. My friend said there is no 
such thing as the MAI yet.  We should send him over a copy so he 
can have a look at it.  He would notice that those are all exempt 
from the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to reiterate for the record that whenever there is a 
New Democrat government in this country, be it in Saskatchewan, 
British Columbia, the Yukon or New Democrats in legislatures 
across the country, we are all unanimous in saying the same 
thing.  The MAI ought not to be signed.  The MAI is against 
Canada.  The MAI is really a special constitution of rights and 
freedoms essentially designed for the multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the duly elected representatives of the people 
of Canada and not the multinational corporations ought to make 
decisions about the future of our citizens. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The amendment moved by the 
member for Laval East to the Reform Party's opposition motion is in 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I might be pushing my luck a little bit, but I do have a 
whole lot more to say about the MAI.  I wonder if I could seek 
unanimous consent from my colleagues to allow me to continue for 
a few more minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our party we have fought very hard over the past several 
weeks prior to the compilation of the report on the MAI from the 
subcommittee to ensure that culture is protected.  I want to 
clarify for this House that it was a Progressive Conservative 
intervention which made as part of the recommendations of the 
report that culture would achieve deal breaker status. We 
intervened and fought for and strengthened seven of the 
recommendations of the report and we are very proud of that 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Philosophically our party has been consistent in its support for 
free trade.  Many of the members opposite, including the chairman 
of the subcommittee who was elected in 1988, fought vociferously 
against free trade, that free trade was not a good idea because 
it was brought forward by Brian Mulroney. 
However, now they are big proponents of free trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member from the New Democratic Party said this 
issue was not raised by Conservatives in the House, he was wrong. 
We raised this issue several times in question period in the last 
House. We asked the minister of trade why the Minister of the 
Environment introduced Bill C-29 which led to the litigation from 
Ethyl Corporation against the Canadian government in the amount 
of $350 million, and why should we now trust him as minister of 
international trade to negotiate on behalf of Canada in the MAI 
when his leadership in the ministry of environment led to that 
lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did raise that issue and I would clarify it for the hon. 
member.  I certainly would not want to accuse him of having 
omitted that on purpose or oversimplifying a very complex issue, 
although that may be a reasonable accusation in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of free trade since 1988 is fairly unequivocal. Like 
any other sound economic policy, it takes a long time for the 
impact to be felt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council told me 
recently that any job growth that has occurred in Atlantic Canada 
has occurred as a result of free trade. When I speak with the 
member for Saint John she tells me how Saint John has benefited 
from free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the basic principles of free trade are sound 
and we support free trade. However, we do not support any deal at 
any cost without any consultation with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's inaction and vacuum of information has 
provided an opportunity for people who are opposed to free trade 
philosophically to fill that vacuum with some misinformation. 
Like any issue, there is some information out there from the 
opponents of MAI that is very sound and deserves debate and 
discussion.  This government has not provided Canadians with that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same as the Kyoto agreement and the lack of discussion 
on it.  Effectively the Kyoto position was written on the back of 
an airplane vomit bag on the way to Kyoto.  The Canadian position 
was basically reached without any consultation with ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this government wonders why Canadians reject liberalized 
trade philosophically when they are essentially provided with a 
final deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of foreign affairs for Australia in May 1996 
introduced the Australian model for treaty negotiations.  When 
Alexander Downer was in Ottawa on his last trip, I met with him 
and discussed this.  In fact, the leader of our party met with 
Alexander Downer to discuss this important model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the Australian model provides is that any 
treaty Australia signs will be submitted to and tabled before 
parliament for 15 days of debate prior to ratification. That is 
one of the recommendations we fought for at the committee level 
to try to get in the final report and we were shot down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other components of the Australian model and one we 
were successful in achieving at the committee level, and I am 
very proud of this, is that there will be an impact analysis. The 
government should undertake an impact analysis on current 
federal, provincial and municipal programs in Canada to 
understand fully the impact of MAI on the current programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our subnational governments have not been consulted on MAI. 
Something we have to ensure is that the provinces, municipalities 
and all Canadians have an opportunity to voice their concerns on 
MAI, Kyoto or any other international treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we welcome more debate in this House.  We want to 
fight to ensure that there is a full debate in this House on this 
very important international agreement prior to ratification. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is very rewarding to hear the Conservative Party supporting 
this motion in that we need a fuller debate across the country 
and in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the need for a broad cultural 
exemption and the support the Conservative party would have for 
that.  Consider NAFTA, the free trade trade agreement with the 
United States that his party negotiated. 
We also have an exemption for culture, but the Americans have the 
right to retaliate in kind.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that most of the pressure for culture would probably 
come from the United States, I am wondering how the member would 
see the MAI moving that process forward, considering that we have 
an exemption which essentially has a counter balancing part under 
the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is one of those 
issues which helps our party to define itself as being different 
from the other party to which it seems to be compared 
periodically, that being the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were unequivocal in our support for a cultural exemption and 
we will fight to ensure it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of protecting culture in a national unity context 
boils down to this.  We need to preserve the ability for 
Canadians to speak with each other as Canadians.  We need to 
preserve institutions such as the CRTC and the CBC when we are 
living next to a cultural elephant.  We need to ensure that all 
Canadians can communicate fully.  We need to ensure that there is 
systemic protection for culture within Canadian institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the NAFTA and the free trade agreement Canadians are 
protected against their biggest cultural risk, that being the 
U.S.  There is a bilateral right to retaliation, but that is a 
part of any trade agreement, providing a double edge sword. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing to recognize is that we are expanding 
the chapter 11 provisions to 29 countries.  That is why due 
diligence is ever more important.  There will be an unprecedented 
level of exposure to Canadian culture and we must ensure that our 
cultural interests are protected.  That is why, when the Reform 
Party was equivocal about its support for a cultural exemption, 
the Conservative Party fought hard to ensure that it was there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise to speak to the issue of the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide a little background very quickly.  My 
government colleague said that the MAI is on the Internet and that 
people have only to call to have a copy sent to them, but someone 
who is not familiar with this matter may not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What first has to be done is to express the MAI in simple 
terms so that people will know right off whether it is worth 
further consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Peace River said that it was up to the 
Liberal government to make it better known.  I am sorry.  In this 
corner—since we cannot talk about this side—of the House, we 
think it is the job of the members of Parliament to meet Canadians 
and Quebeckers and explain the MAI.  It is not just the 
responsibility of the Liberal government.  We know this government 
too well.  If we give it too much responsibility, we already know 
what will happen.  The effect may well be negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is up to us as parliamentarians to explain the MAI to 
people.  It is not new.  Essentially after the second world war 
trade began to be carried out on a global scale as the result of 
various agreements and reconstruction agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall plan in Europe and the massive influx of American 
capital in Japan in essence established different sorts of free 
trade systems.  That was the start and it progressed very slowly. 
In the 1960s, things picked up.  Unfortunately, there was a Liberal 
government in power.  When investment began circulating, the Prime 
Minister of the time, Mr. Trudeau, created an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate aim of this agency was to block foreign 
investment, to control it.  Thank God, a Conservative government 
followed and changed this agency into Investment Canada, which 
still exists today and has a much more active role seeking 
investment abroad and directing it to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The party of which I am a member has a history of 
globalization, no matter what, but the same cannot be said for our 
friends across the way, or our friends next to us.  I would be 
curious to know what the position of each of the Reform MPs was in 
1988, when there was an election on the issue of free trade with 
the U.S.  Today, they are all for free trade, but what were their 
individual positions in 1988? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, our friends across the way wanted to tear up the 
free trade agreement.  Had there not be a free trade agreement to 
speed up exports, Canada would have had an economic downturn in the 
past five years.  That is as clear as it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very curious to hear the change in their tune. 
International credibility with respect to globalization belongs to 
this part of the House, and I would like to share the credit with 
our friends who were here from the Bloc Quebecois in 1988 and, let 
us recall, supported free trade along with the majority of 
Quebeckers and were not afraid to face a world reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, yes people must be informed.  True, but the 
information must also be given in layman's terms.  Our actions must 
be explained. Investments have already begun, and there are all 
kinds of agreements.  Agreements with the U.S., agreements with 
Mexico, and one part on investments with Chile.  There are many 
bilateral agreements in place.  There is no end to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why is there an agreement?  So that light may be cast on a 
specific aspect of the bilateral agreements: investment. 
Canada has an important role to play, but it must also protect its 
culture for, contrary to what Reform may think, culture is also 
part of our national identity.  Such things as environmental 
standards must be put in place, as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support the Reform Party's motion, which calls 
for a greater government presence. I will make one very important 
point in closing.  When the free trade agreement was negotiated 
with the U.S., there were no consultations coast to coast, true. 
There was something more—an election.  Would the government be 
prepared to call an election today on the MAI?  This may be the 
challenge we are issuing to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to the member's speech, 
as I have done all morning on this very serious matter, and I am 
left with one overriding question.  How are we in this House and 
how are the Canadian people supposed to tell the difference 
between the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Reformers in this 
House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three, based on the speeches today are clearly, I hate to 
use the word in terms of some sort of collusion, operating from 
the same premise, joining forces in this House to force the 
government to fire up its propaganda machine in order to convince 
Canadians that their concerns about the MAI are unfounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anybody in this House who will join the NDP and 
convince the federal government that the MAI is not a good deal 
for Canadians and that there are serious flaws in the draft 
agreement that will have very significant ramifications for the 
future of important programs like medicare and public education, 
unique cultural programs in this country?  Who is going to stand 
up and join us in this House fighting the MAI? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, the difference between us, the 
Liberal Party and the Reform Party is that we are consistent in terms of 
our international policy. This is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also consistent in saying that Canada is ready to face what 
is going on at the international level, while the NDP does not agree 
because it thinks that only our internal economy can solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today should be supported by the NDP because 
it asks specifically that Canadians be consulted more extensively. The 
New Democrats should support the motion. We are not asking them to 
support the MAI. We are asking them to support the idea that there 
should be more dialogue, and that this dialogue should include more 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party should support the motion. 
It would not mean it supports the MAI. It would simply mean that it is 
in favour of having discussions, because the government did not bother 
to properly inform Canadians, even parliamentarians, on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my hon. friend from 
North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak on the Reform Party opposition day 
supply motion which concerns the famous multilateral agreement on 
investment.  I also refer to it as the MIA, which is what we are 
really talking about, missing in action.  We are talking about 
transparency and I want to bring the debate back to this.  We are 
focusing on transparency, on public disclosure and on making sure 
the government knows what is going on.  I will focus on those 
issues in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has failed to talk to the Canadian people.  Some 
people on the government side have said that they consulted with 
the provinces in 35 meetings over two years.  Is that not 
amazing?  I will read a recommendation from the committee which 
had a very short time to debate this issue:  “The government 
should continue to increase its effort to inform Canadians of the 
merits of the MAI while addressing the concerns brought forward 
to the committee at public hearings”. The next recommendation 
is:  “The government should pursue a process that fully involves 
the provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a recommendation made by the committee and signed off by 
the majority of the committee members, Liberals.  Yet those 
members stand up so proudly saying they have been informing 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this issue is that nobody knows what is going 
on.  Why are those members so secretive about it?  They have been 
negotiating this agreement for over two years.  Yet during the 
election campaign last April nobody had heard of it.  They are 
absolutely silent.  I suggest they are ashamed of it.  Why will 
they not talk about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the red book.  Do we see this in the red book? 
No, by golly there is not even a word about it.  There is not one 
word after negotiating an agreement with 29 countries.  Imagine 
that.  I wonder why. And then there was the throne speech.  Did 
we hear about this wonderful, exciting multilateral agreement on 
investment?  No, not a word, zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant went through the 
committee's recommendations.  I emphasize that these 
recommendations were made by a majority of Liberals and this 
member was the chair of the committee.  These are his words in 
defending the government's position against our motion:  “The 
government should pursue a process that fully involves the 
provinces and that will allow sufficient time for the text time 
available at that time to receive the benefit of further 
parliamentary examination by this committee prior to the 
signature of any negotiated agreement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is their recommendation and the only thing he can say is 
that we have had 35 meetings with the provinces. I point out that 
The provinces are now bailing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His next recommendation is that the government should consider 
undertaking a full impact analysis that will note the reason 
Canada should take part in the MAI.  What the member said about 
this is shocking and unbelievable.  He said it is not practical 
to have a full impact so early on in negotiations.  Imagine 
saying that it is not practical early on.  We have been 
negotiating this for two years.  The government is supposed to 
sign this in April 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind the government that we are now almost in March 
1998.  What is he thinking when he says that we cannot have an 
impact analysis early on?  It is absolutely unimaginable.  What 
are they ashamed of and what are they trying to hide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next recommendation, and this is the chair of the committee 
defending these recommendations, is: “In future negotiations 
regarding matters of as widespread importance”, they acknowledge 
that as the MAI, “the government should undertake an open and 
transparent process so that public disclosure and consultations 
can be carried out in a timely manner”.  Imagine that, public 
disclosure and consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must look at my notes because I cannot believe what he said 
about that.  He said it is not practical.  Can you believe that, 
coming from this government, that it is not practical to consult 
with the public?   “In a timely manner”, that is what we are 
talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of this wonderful agreement.  This is the official 
copy given to me by the government which it is so proud of it. 
What is the very first word on it?  Confidential.  Imagine that. 
The first word on the top left corner of the agreement is 
confidential.  What is it worth?  Why will Liberals not talk to 
the public about it?  They are screaming about this.  What are 
they hiding?  I have concerns about it.  I can say right now I 
will not support the MAI because I do not know what members 
opposite are hiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support free trade agreements.  We need free trade agreements. 
They are good.  We need more investment in Canada.  Our investors 
need to be protected.  What is the government doing?  Why is it 
so secretive? It is an absolute disgrace.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what government members are up to, but there is no 
question they are embarrassed about it and not proud of it.  They 
are so secretive it is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals really care about or really believe in the 
agreement, why are they not talking about it?  They are not proud 
of it.  There is no question they do not believe in it, or they 
would be telling us about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask government members to look at what the motion says.  It is 
asking them to be transparent with the people of Canada, to tell 
them what is in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the minister's idea of transparency?  It is a luncheon 
at the Chateau Laurier about two blocks away, having a group 
meeting at lunch and talking to some investors.  Those are his 
consultations with Canada five minutes from parliament.  That was 
his B.C. meeting.  It is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They accuse me of not speaking.  I have meetings planned in the 
greater Victoria area. I have had three or four of them and I 
have another one next week, a very large one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we see anybody from British Columbia?  Will we see their 
senior member?  Will I see Mr. Anderson there?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We have just come back from the weekend and some members 
may be on a roll, but we still want to maintain the parliamentary 
traditions of not referring to ministers by name and directing 
our comments through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
member of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was on a roll and all 
excited.  I did not mean to use the minister's name.  I 
apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, the committee has been 
given only three weeks.  The Liberals are proud and talk about 
consultation.  All I have heard the minister say in the House is 
that it has been sent off to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the consultation process; it is sent off to committee. 
Even worse, the idea of the parliamentary secretary on how to 
communicate with the people of Canada was “We sent a memo to all 
members of Parliament.  Can't you send out a message in your 
householder?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that how the government will rely on getting a message out, 
by suggesting to members of Parliament that they use their

transparency.  This is not the first time I have prepared speech

We could go back to Bill C-2.  Time and time again it brought in 
closure and shut down debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have to allow for democracy.  I will conclude right 
now by saying that this is about transparency.  It is about 
informing the public and openness.  Right now the public is not 
informed.  The government is hiding behind a missing in action 
agreement we know nothing about.  It is time the government came 
out of the closet and told Canadians what is in the agreement.

Madam Speaker, no one in the House disagrees with the idea of

</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns those of us at this end of the House is the

to be arising out of panic stricken fear that progressive forces 
in the country are winning the debate and its side is not being 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member a specific question around a statement made by 
some friends of the Reform Party. Maybe it is a front for the 
Reform Party.  A representative of the Fraser Institute, Mr. Owen

forced a debate on the impact of MAI on health care. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why don't I believe, then, what the Council of Canadians and Mr. 
Appleton are saying?  Because the government, the Liberal 
government, tells me it ain't so.  They tell me that the

going to take them at their word.

Debate has not been allowed to happen in the country.  Public 
discussion has been stifled by friends of the Reform Party, by 
the collusion between the Liberals and Reformers in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know what the 
member is going on about.  She raised a hidden agenda.   Here is 
the agenda.  It is about open and transparent government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the New Democratic Party had supply days.  If they 
felt this issue was important they could have talked about it. We 
are on the eve of this year's budget.  The Reform Party has 
committed an entire day of debate, a supply day, the day before 
the budget, to talk about the issue.  That will show the 
commitment and the dedication of this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have grave concerns about the government's unwillingness to 
talk about it, why it is hiding it.  It is not in the throne 
speech.   It is not in the Liberal red book.  The Liberals did 
not talk about it in the campaign.  What are the Liberals hiding? 
That is what we are pushing them on.  That is the only way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP claims to be wonderful; it will save everybody in this 
multilateral agreement.  Where are NDPers?  They could have 
talked about it.  The reality is that the Reform Party made it a 
priority and did something. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member from the Reform neck of the woods.  He 
talked about speaking out on the MAI and devoting a whole day to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has gone a lot further than one day of hype.  We have 
been pursuing the issue, the failure of the government to address 
the MAI and bring it to Canadian citizens, since well into the 
election campaign of last year.  As a matter of fact in a public 
debate in Flin Flon during the campaign I was able to take the 
Liberal member to task and he knew nothing about the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not stopped debating the issue.  We have not stopped 
pursing the issue for six to eight months.  Where has Reform 
been?  It has finally been forced to be an opposition party by 
the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, we know that the Council of 
Canadians is a front for the NDP.  We know the NDP's position on 
the agreement.  What we do not know is the government's position. 
That is what we are here for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to save a few comments for the NDP.  We can talk about 
investment.  We have an NDP government in British Columbia.  We 
have no investment.  The NDP premier of British Columbia is 
placing ads in the <I>Financial Post</I> asking for investors to 
invest in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support free trade agreements.   We need to protect investors. 
This debate is about what is in there.   We want to make sure 
that our social programs are not trampled on.  We want to make 
sure health care is protected and that the right exclusion 
clauses are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are asking the government to do.  It has to 
become open, go to the people and talk about it.  Right now there 
is no question the government has not talked about it with 
Canadians.  It has talked about it behind closed doors.  It will 
send it off to committee.  It will have luncheons with some of 
the big players.  However it is not talking with Canadians and 
that is what it needs to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming as I do from a small business background and a small 
business community in North Vancouver, it should not be 
surprising that I am personally supportive of the concept of the 
MAI.  I think it is a good idea.  Frankly the intent of a 
multilateral agreement on investment is shared by the majority of 
my constituents as far as I can determine at this time. 
That does not mean there are not some people opposed, but at the 
moment it appears the majority are in favour.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big problem is that the government has not been speaking 
clearly and forcefully in conveying its position in the Vancouver 
area.  If an MAI can be negotiated, which truly levels the 
playing field for investment between the participating countries, 
thereby making it easier, less expensive and more efficient for 
small businesses to expand and create jobs by servicing those new 
markets, it would be an excellent deal.  The government would be 
well congratulated if it could achieve such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support in principle does not mean that we do not have some 
tough questions for the government on the issue.  The government 
and the minister in particular have put on a disgraceful display 
in connection with the MAI.  People have been begging for 
information for just about the entire time it has been 
negotiated.  There simply has not been enough public presence out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister not been out in public debating the Maude 
Barlows and Paul Hellyers of the land.  If he has such a good 
deal he should be involved in intelligent debate and be able 
prove to Canadians that it is a good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before posing questions of the government provided to me by some 
of my constituents, I would like to put on record my position 
regarding the MAI once it comes before the House if there is 
enabling legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as soon as the MAI is signed in principle by the 
government, I will advertise in my local newspaper for people to 
come forward who are opposed to and in favour of the MAI.  I will 
split them into two groups and with research assistance from my 
office we will create a written position against and a written 
position for the MAI.  Equal space will then be given to each 
side in a householder that will go to every house in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, as the letters and calls come in, the material from the 
opposing side will be used to answer those letters and calls.  In 
that way we will facilitate a widespread exchange of ideas, 
opinions and criticisms.  People will get a chance to see the 
other point of view.  I will also hold public meetings according 
to the demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, before the House comes to a third vote on any enabling 
legislation, I will do a scientific poll in my riding and that is 
the way I will vote in the House.  My constituents have that 
commitment from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That seems to be a good spot to interrupt 
the member.  He still has in excess of seven minutes of his 
allotted time and will have the floor when we return to the 
supply motion debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a growing dismay with the high cost of 
post-secondary education.  Some in this House seem to consider 
post-secondary education to be an entitlement, free and paid for 
completely by the taxpayer.  Access to post-secondary education 
has always been a reward for hard work and achievement at the 
secondary level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for post-secondary education must remain a partnership 
which includes the federal and provincial governments, parents, 
businesses, alumni and students.  Although current tuition may 
seem high, the payoff over a lifetime is more than adequate 
compensation.  The call for full funding is unrealistic.  It 
would place a real burden on existing taxpayers, three-quarters 
of whom have not had the privilege of attending university. Also, 
the success rate for students who contribute to their own 
education is higher than for those who do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all Canadians including students to recognize the 
limitations of our resources.  Federal assistance for students 
under the Canada student loans program has amounted to billions 
over the years.  We have also pledged to further enhance our 
funding for university and college students across Canada, but 
within reasonable parameters, leaving students some 
responsibility for the process.

borrowed money from the Canada pension plan.  This is not a very 
good bargain for Canadians.

government claims it is very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the shameful fact that Canadians pay $6,000 a year in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the federal government is the primary supplier of 
blood products, whereas the provinces already pay the costs of 
health care for victims of Hepatitis C; and in light of the huge 
cuts by the federal government to provincial health transfer 
payments, is the federal government prepared, in negotiating the 
damages to be paid to victims of Hepatitis C, to take into account 
the large amounts the provinces are already contributing to health 
care for victims of Hepatitis C?

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the best I can do is 
reiterate what the Minister of Health said on the issue last week 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that no one would be happier than he with a compensation 
package for hepatitis C victims.  He said that victims were best 
served with a package of compensation that involved both levels 
of government, and he said that he was prepared to wait a little 
longer to see if we could get that agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
President of the Treasury Board has acknowledged the findings of 
the advisory committee on senior level retention and compensation 
in the Public Service of Canada.  He says that the government 
values top quality executives in the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the government will accept the findings of the 
advisory committee but refuses to accept the ruling of the human 
rights commission on pay equity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it because the government does not value the work of female 
employees, or does it just not care about low and middle income 
workers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the simple truth is that the commission has not made a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important now is that we have made an offer of $1.3 
billion for pay equity.  The union has refused to put it to a 
vote by its members.  For the common good, I once again ask the 
member to put pressure on the syndicates and the unions so they 
will put this offer to their members.

is obvious to everyone in the House that the mysterious 
millennium fund is nothing more than an ego fund for the Prime 
Minister.  It should be more properly called the “me lend my 
name” fund.  Students want an education fund that addresses the 
issues of all students today, not the ego of their Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  While students of 
the next millennium might benefit, what do students of this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

that student debt is a major problem.  We have been working hard 
at it.  Tomorrow our budget might be interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the millennium fund absolutely extraordinary.  I was in 
London last weekend at the G-7 meeting.  I listened to the debate 
on how to celebrate the millennium.  They are building a very 
expensive dome that will cost millions of pounds while this Prime 
Minister is choosing to invest in the great brains of our young. 
That is what he is doing and that is a good thing.

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a little disconcerting when speeches are interrupted in 
the middle but I will continue on from this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had just finished explaining to members how I would be finding 
out the political will of the constituents in my riding so that I 
could vote that way when or if the MAI comes before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would challenge other members particularly those of the NDP 
who assume that their constituents are against this thing to 
really get out there and start sharing information from both 
sides. Do exactly what I do and find out how the majority feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to a few of the questions that have been 
sent to me in a stack of letters from constituents.  I will not 
be able to go through all the questions but I will give a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that foreign corporations would be able to ignore 
our environmental and labour laws, leaving us to be ruled by 
large corporations?  The government's response to that has been 
that it is not true.  It says that all corporations will have to 
abide by the same environmental and labour laws in Canada as 
domestic corporations.  They ask why we should have two sets of 
laws anyway as it does not do anyone a favour to have domestic 
companies working to a lower environmental or labour law than we 
would have for a foreign company.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept that explanation as reasonable.  But my question is, 
why are the Liberals not out there telling the public? Why are 
they not out making this information available?  That is what 
today's debate is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question asked, and it was mentioned earlier here 
today, why is there a 20 year opting out period? If the deal 
turns out to be bad for Canada, why should we be stuck in it for 
20 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response is that it is not true. We are only 
tied in for five years. The 20 years refers to any companies, 
perhaps like McCains, that have made a large investment in one of 
the participating countries only to find that country then opts 
out again. McCains or any other company for that matter would be 
protected for the following 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side are nodding their heads so I have 
got their explanation right. But why are they not out there 
telling the public? Why do we in Reform have to stand here to 
facilitate this when it is the government's job to be selling the 
program, to be answering questions from the Maude Barlows and the 
Paul Hellyers? Why is the minister not out there debating those 
people? Instead of that he sits in his chair doing nothing, 
waiting for this thing to explode around him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are adequate statistics available from NAFTA from the last 
10 years to show that these types of investment programs really 
work. I have in front of me the figures for NAFTA for more than 
10 years actually, the figures from 1984 to 1997. In that time 
the volumes of exports to the U.S.A. almost doubled from $85 
billion to $157 billion a year, thanks to NAFTA. Meanwhile our 
exports to other countries, almost all the other countries of the 
world, have actually gone down. In Europe they have gone up, but 
to a lot of other countries they have actually gone down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can get a good MAI which facilitates trade in the same way 
that NAFTA has in North America, we have a really good chance of 
building our exports and therefore our job creation in Canada. 
That would not just help McCains and Northern Telecom, it would 
work for the small companies in my riding that are very busy 
exporting in small quantities to those other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI or at least the principle behind the MAI, the concept of 
an MAI promises similar benefits.  If it is properly and fairly 
negotiated it should ensure that any person or company investing 
in one of the signatory countries will find identical investment 
rules in place in each country. That is good. Negotiating such an 
arrangement makes good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It even makes sense if it forces our cultural and health 
industries in Canada to compete in a real world marketplace and 
to become excellent instead of mediocre, to strive for excellence 
in the climate of competition. I think that may be good. I have 
two pages of letters to the editor of the <I>North Shore News</I> 
in the last week complaining about the health care system being 
in disarray. If there was a little bit of competition introduced 
to the marketplace we might find it would go a long way to 
solving some of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always possible of course that even under the best 
possible negotiated MAI some inefficient and subsidized 
industries are going to go out of business and jobs will be lost. 
Under NAFTA, jobs disappeared from the costly and inefficient 
shipbuilding industry in my riding but they were replaced by high 
tech, cleaner, new industry jobs, many, many more of them. 
Frankly the unions in the shipbuilding industry let down their 
members badly by not helping them to retrain and adjust to the 
new marketplace reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me once again to criticize this Liberal government 
which is not adjusting to the reality of the information age we 
live in. People want to know what is going on. They want to know 
what the government is negotiating on the MAI.  The Liberals have 
failed to acknowledge that they need to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has blown it completely. As I mentioned, he should 
have been out there debating Maude Barlow. He should have been 
debating Paul Hellyer. He should have been debating the 
professors, the academics from the socialist universities who are 
complaining about this MAI. The Speaker laughs but, Mr. Speaker, 
the universities are loaded with socialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the question of sovereignty disappearing, I would like to 
see the minister debating Maude Barlow about the loss of 
sovereignty. Frankly I do not believe there would be a loss of 
sovereignty because the Liberal government is so dictatorial, I 
cannot see the Prime Minister giving up even one iota of his 
power to anybody else. To suggest that we are going to lose our 
sovereignty is totally ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rapidly running out of time and I have only asked a 
fraction of the questions that are in the big pile of letters 
from my constituents. I have passed on copies of some of those 
letters to the parliamentary secretary to be answered.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he will do that for me.  However, I will finish with a 
quote from a fax from Dr. Koscielniak who sent it to me.  He says 
in one of his questions:  “Why the secrecy?  Could it be that 
the Liberals are ashamed of this treaty?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe Dr. Koscielniak has hit the nail on the head.  This 
minister and his entire government are actually ashamed of the 
treaty because they are ashamed to admit that world trade is a 
reality.  It needs to be properly negotiated and fairly 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members made the promise to get rid of NAFTA and found out 
that it works.  Now they have the responsibility of the MAI and 
they are so ashamed at having to back peddle that they do not 
want to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like the minister to get out there and actually 
start doing something. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wonder 
whether my hon. friend is aware of this document called “Revised 
Draft Reservations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised draft reservations are the actual guts of what is 
being negotiated at the present time.  There is common agreement 
on a lot of the broad draft, but there are 52 pages of revised 
draft reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before these reservations are properly negotiated and so on, how 
is the minister expected to go out and deliver these reservations 
which are not yet negotiated or agreed on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has made a very public statement about the 
concerns.  He has abbreviated the concerns I think very 
succinctly.  A week ago last Friday he made a speech to the 
Centre for Trade Policy and Law in which he laid down some of the 
key salient points for all Canadians to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement is on the Internet.  It is available to every 
citizen of this country.  He talks about the interpretation of 
expropriation where it should be narrow, the Canadian definition. 
He gives the ironclad reservations for health care, social 
programs, education, culture, programs for aboriginal people and 
minority groups, and finally no standstill or rollback 
requirements in any of these areas of reservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to culture, he supports excluding culture from the 
MAI altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister not communicating with Canadians by making 
statements such as this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the big 52 page 
draft of reservations that he is talking about, but it is the 
government's responsibility to make sure it is widely circulated. 
It has not done it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister cannot talk in absolute specifics, he 
should be debating Maude Barlow on national television in general 
terms.  Frankly, I cannot think of anything that would be more 
entertaining than this.  It would probably get the largest TV 
audience of the entire year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about the amount of information available, if the 
government is not doing its best to get it out there, people do 
not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet address was given earlier.  It is www.parl.gc.ca. 
That is the general Internet site.  It is not the specific site. 
Let us get the specific site so that people can actually find the 
stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just an example again of how poorly they communicate 
with the constituency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the more we hear from members of the Reform Party in 
this debate, the clearer their agenda becomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tried to leave the impression this morning that they are 
concerned about culture and health care and social services and 
that they will only support the MAI if reservations that work are 
entrenched in the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now just heard from the member for Medicine Hat a very 
clear statement that I think is probably a little more revealing 
of the truth and a little more in line with the motives of Reform 
behind this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat just said that we need more 
competition in health care.  This is after all of his colleagues 
have stood up in the House and claimed to be concerned about 
wanting a reservation in the MAI to protect health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This all begins to fit.  We know that the MAI opens the door to 
foreign investments and will begin to dismantle medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the Reform Party stand?  Is it going to stand up 
against the MAI and protect medicare or is it going to join with 
the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc in this House, open 
the doors and kill medicare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, health care is reserved under 
NAFTA.  The government has indicated that it would also reserve 
it under the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately enough in January when I was in Florida I got 
kidney stones— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order, this is very serious.  The member should be aware that 
this issue went before the health committee.  A motion was put— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is engaging in 
debate. The hon. member for North Vancouver has the floor.  He 
should be allowed to complete his remarks.  He will do so briefly 
I know because the time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was saying I was 
unfortunate while I was in Florida over Christmas to get kidney 
stones.  I had to go into a hospital in Florida.  The service 
levels were spectacular.  It really put to shame what happens in 
my riding in North Vancouver with socialist medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any harm in having some competition. 
Even though it is reserved out of the MAI by the Liberals, I know 
it is widely supported in my riding that there should be some 
competition to get some efficiency into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member from the NDP referred to the member for 
Medicine Hat.  The speech was so good I would not want anybody to 
mistake the member, not that the member for Medicine Hat would 
not have also made a great speech.  The member is from North 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I did refer to the hon. member as the 
member for North Vancouver.  I did not know whether the hon. 
member was referring to some remarks made during question period 
when she made her comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I stated in this Chamber on February 12 
that I would be glad to debate the government's approach to 
negotiations toward an MAI agreement with members of the 
opposition anytime, anywhere.  I am pleased that the hon. members 
opposite have taken up my invitation so quickly.  What better 
venue could there be for this discussion than right here in 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also say that it is a great time to be talking about 
matters of international trade which are obviously tied to 
international investment.  Canada has never done better than it 
is doing now under this Liberal administration.  Figures released 
last week by Statics Canada show that Canadian exports last year 
grew to their highest level ever, $301 billion.  They are 
continuing to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is jobs and economic opportunities for 
Canadians.  This also reflects the high level of confidence and 
dynamism in the Canadian economy, now that we have managed to 
bring the deficit under control and set the stage for strong 
future economic growth, as the Minister of Finance will discuss 
tomorrow afternoon in his budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly glad to have this opportunity to report to 
Parliament on the steps I have taken to familiarize Canadians with 
the issues involved in the MAI negotiations, and will continue to 
promote a national debate on this subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first years of the MAI process in 1995 there was not a 
lot to talk about because the preliminary phases of all such 
negotiations are quite abstract.  There was not very much on the 
table in the way of substance.  However, the talks entered a more 
important period around the time that I became trade minister 
last June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon assuming the MAI file, together with the ministers of 
finance and industry, I approached this MAI process in two 
phases.  The first was the priority of getting more information 
out to the Canadian public.  That is exactly what we have done. 
Government officials and I have made ourselves available to 
numerous media interviews.  We have provided the media community 
across the country with background information.  We have provided 
ongoing information packages to all members of Parliament.  We 
have consulted widely with Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in regular consultations with 
provincial governments, through meetings, conference calls and 
correspondence.  We have spoken with some 40 private sector 
organizations ranging from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce to the 
Canadian Council for the Arts, the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Sierra Club, and 
health groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there was a request made for the House of Commons 
subcommittee on international trade to hold public hearings on 
the MAI last year so as to give a broad range of Canadians an 
opportunity to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at those views we will find that Elizabeth Smythe, a 
professor from Concordia University, said:  “I want to close by 
noting that the hearings of this committee itself indicate a 
shift in the willingness of the Canadian government to seek input 
from Canadians on this agreement.  I also want to note that I 
think the Canadian negotiators themselves have been very 
effective and extremely co-operative and forthright, as my own 
experience attests”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>University of Toronto Professor Robert Howse said:  “Finally I 
would like to note the value of this kind of hearing and the 
hopefully enlightened focus it can put on the specifics of an 
issue like the MAI and grassroots attitudes toward it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee reported Canadians noted that the 
Conservative Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party all 
agreed with the government that Canada should participate in 
these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase, which began this year because negotiations 
were scheduled to intensify, was the right time to further engage 
Canadians on the remaining outstanding issues, whether through 
speeches or round tables, through members of Parliament holding 
their own meetings in their neighbourhoods and communities, or 
through the provincial governments in mandating their committees 
to review various aspects of the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the official opposition accuse the government in 
the motion today of having failed to encourage public discussion 
on the MAI or to explain the issues involved, they simply do not 
know what they are talking about.  That is precisely what we have 
been doing all of these past few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I will be pleased at the end of my comments to table in 
the House today a 20 page document which summarizes the many 
different extensive consultations which the government has 
conducted with diverse groups right across our nation.  Any 
objective person looking at the list will have to come to the 
conclusion that there has been wide and serious engagement as 
well as outreach.  When taken together these groups represent 
thousands of Canadian companies and millions of individual 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to this, Canadians may be right to ask what about 
the Reform Party, the official opposition in the House, looking 
at itself in the mirror. In other words, what have Reformers been 
doing to increase the understanding of Canadians on the MAI? 
What contributions have they actually made?   Where are the 
community town hall forums that the official opposition has 
organized? Where are the lists of the meetings of their NGO 
communities? Have they outreached with the stakeholders across 
this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done the responsible thing, but it seems that 
somehow the official opposition can be irresponsible and not do 
one single thing.  Its members sit back and say that it is 
supposed to be passed on. There was not even a single letter from 
the official spokesperson on trade for the Reform Party making 
one positive, constructive suggestion on the MAI. 
There is further evidence of where Reform Party members are 
coming from when they reject in the committee report a broad 
exemption for Canadian culture.  In that same report why do they 
reject the inclusion of labour guidelines for multinationals in 
the MAI?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  My apologies to the hon. minister for 
interrupting him, but I would like to make a point that he might 
share with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleagues in the Reform Party are so concerned about 
the MAI on their supply day, do you not think they would have 
enough energy to have a quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the hon. member calling for a 
quorum?  I do not see a quorum.  We had better ring the bells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I now see a quorum.  The hon. 
Minister for International Trade has 11 minutes remaining in his 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was about to say, 
in both process and substance the Reform Party is suspect.  Yes, 
there is a lot of hot air.  Yes, there is a lot of huffing and 
puffing.  When we notice what Reformers stand for, we cannot 
understand their eagerness to abandon basic Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reformers complain in their motion that they do not 
understand why Canada is participating in these negotiations. 
While many concepts are difficult, the answer is quite clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment flows are particularly important for Canada.  We 
are host to $180 billion of foreign investment.  And we must not 
forget that every billion dollars of foreign investment generates 
over 40,000 jobs over five years.  Furthermore, Canadians have 
invested $170 billion abroad. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that trade and investment are inextricably 
linked there is no multilateral framework of rules for investment 
as there is for trade.  In many countries, in particular in 
developing countries beyond the OECD, the treatment of foreign 
investment remains unpredictable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is essentially about developing a code of conduct for 
countries that host and invite direct foreign investment and not 
as some would suggest a charter for multinational enterprises. 
The fact is that we already have transparent and fair rules for 
foreign investment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right kind of MAI would ensure the same kind of treatment 
for Canadians abroad without requiring us to substantially change 
what we are already doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said on many occasions that we want to eventually take 
the MAI to the WTO whose membership is in the area of 130 
countries and develop north and south.  In that forum we could 
negotiate a truly multilateral agreement on investment that would 
complement the rules on trade via the same body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad the official opposition says in its motion today that 
it does not understand any of this, particularly since its 
position in the committee report was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports Canada's participation in the OECD 
effort to construct an MAI that will encourage foreign investment 
in Canada and give protection to Canadian investment abroad. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reformers do not understand our explanation for 
participating in the negotiations, why are they supporting that 
participation?  They are either confused or playing at political 
gamesmanship or, as we correctly suspect, both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me stress a crucially important point.  Participating in 
these MAI negotiations does not mean we are hell bent on signing 
any resulting agreement come what may. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT55"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT55"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite the contrary.  We will only accept an MAI that meets 
the following key Canadian requirements.  The first requirement 
is a narrow interpretation of expropriation which makes it 
entirely clear that legislative or regulatory action by 
government in the public interest is not expropriation requiring 
compensation, even if it has adverse profitability consequences 
for both companies and investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is ironclad reservations at both national and 
provincial levels that completely preserve our freedom of action 
in key areas including health care, social programs, education, 
culture and programs for aboriginal peoples and minority groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there would be no standstill or rollback requirements 
in any of the areas of reservation or exception I have just 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to culture we support excluding culture from the MAI 
altogether for all countries.  If some nations insist on 
addressing this sector we will register, as is our legitimate 
right, a country's specific reservation in this area.  At the end 
of the day for Canadian culture there would be no difference 
between the two options.  Canadian culture is simply not 
negotiable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also not accept an agreement that adversely affects 
Canada's supply management regime.  We will take the necessary 
reservations to preserve investment measures specific to our 
agricultural interests and responsibilities.  The same will apply 
to the management of our natural resources. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there are important questions on how the MAI should 
approach labour and environmental standards and whether we should 
call for binding or non-binding language.  Even experts in the 
NGO community agree that this is a complex issue where it is very 
important to avoid unintended consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a very positive discussion on this and other issues with 
provincial trade ministers at last week's federal-provincial 
meeting.  The NDP minister from Saskatchewan said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is taking a very strong position at the table that health, 
social services and education will be an unbound reservation and 
that those matters will not be touched or Canada will not sign 
the agreement.  That is the position that they have taken very 
strongly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to add: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us have been encouraged to think the fight for the MAI is 
very worth while. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was from the NDP Government of Saskatchewan.  Al Palladini, 
the minister from Ontario, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I want to congratulate the minister for initiating 
this meeting.  I thought the meeting was a very successful one 
and certainly the assurance that all the ministers from each 
province received today on the MAI is that the federal government 
is certainly going to be the driving force behind this thing, but 
at the same time with positive input allowed or giving 
opportunity to the provinces, especially in environment and in 
labour.  So I am really confident that these things are going to 
materialize in getting us an agreement that is good for both 
Canada and the global community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the provinces advocated that Canada walk away from the 
MAI table.  In fact they were quite reassured by the direction 
that the Government of Canada was taking, and we agreed to work 
on areas that needed further work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that labour is largely a provincial jurisdiction and that 
we share responsibility in the environment, I have asked for 
their views and I await their responses particularly in these two 
areas because the large majority of both provinces and 
territories have not given us their final position on these two 
important matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also continuing to push hard for clear provisions in the 
MAI against the extraterritorial application of laws on 
investment such as the U.S. Helms-Burton act on Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to take the time necessary—and we now have 
it—for full consultation with all parties.  For some critics, 
including the NDP, our insistence on meeting key Canadians 
requirements is not good enough. 
They say we should not be at the table at all, that we should be 
watching from the sidelines.  They said that again today, 
particularly the MP from Kamloops, at a time when the NDP premier 
is reaching out in a rather desperate way to both the business 
and investment communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not imagine a more self-defeating course for Canada than 
the one they are advocating.  All we would accomplish by running 
away would be to forgo any chance of shaping an agreement that 
works to our advantage or that satisfies Canada's particular 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the leader of the federal New Democratic Party 
publicly recognized that globalization brings opportunities.  I 
congratulate her on catching up, however belatedly, to the latter 
part of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada believes that Canadians do not want to 
hide from globalization.  Instead, they want to work with 
governments to try to shape it to our advantage, which is exactly 
what our participation at the MAI table is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will not run away and we will not hide.  Above 
all, we will not capitulate either.  We are quite prepared to 
take the time to get it done right.  If our requirements are not 
met, we will not sign.  We will still continue to attract 
investment to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want, as I said, the right deal at the right time and not any 
deal at any cost or at any time.  For the government, Canada's 
interests and values must always be and always will be paramount 
whether or not the Reform Party likes it.  We will never settle 
for anything less. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is 
it not interesting?  We finally flushed out the Minister for 
International Trade.  He had 20 minutes here today and he dealt 
with some of the concerns people are raising.  I think that is 
great.  It is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of using his time to bash the opposition parties, he 
should have used his time to explain this deal to the fullest 
possible detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost annoying that the minister would suggest the Reform 
motion—I guess he did not read it—says that we do not 
understand this.  The motion says that we are condemning the 
government for failing to explain why it is negotiating the MAI, 
why it is failing to explain the benefits and costs to the 
Canadian people, and why it is failing to take part in public 
discussion on the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the parliamentary secretary will know that the 
amount of mail on this is increasing dramatically.  All members 
are getting a lot of mail on it.  It is because the minister and 
his department have failed to go out and sell the deal across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says in his response that they took it to committee and asked 
the committee to study it.  Absolutely.  It was three weeks in 
committee.  We were told that we needed a report by December 13 
when the House rose.  I guess we did because the thing was moving 
along.  There was a deadline where we were going to have an April 
30 signing if everything went ahead.  We understand this may be 
delayed, but that is the timeframe we were working toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When was the minister to involve the public?  It is the end of 
February.  The deal is supposed to be signed on April 30.  Things 
move along pretty slowly in this process.  The minister said we 
had a lot of people make representations, a lot of organizations, 
40 some, including chambers of commerce.  In spite of that the 
committee said the government should continue and increase its 
efforts to inform Canadians of the merits of negotiating the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the committee say that?  A lot of people came to 
committee and said that, first, the committee should have 
travelled across the country and addressed the concerns where 
people live and that, second, a lot of people did not even know 
what MAI meant.  What does it mean?  There has to be an education 
process.  We have a minister and a department that are not taking 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee made 20 some recommendations in the middle of 
December.  We still have not had a response to the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the minister.  When will they 
respond to the committee's report?  Will they wait until the day 
the MAI is signed?  Will the minister bring the deal back to the 
House of Commons for debate so that we have a chance to consult 
with our constituents once they arrive at an agreement, a chance 
to debate it in the House of Commons and a chance for a vote by 
all members?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am trying to move the debate along. 
Since there are so many members who wish to ask questions I will 
try to maximize the number of questions within the time 
constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to table, 
in both officials languages, a 20 page document which outlines 
the degree of consultations which has taken place with the 
Government of Canada across the country.  I table this 
enlightening document for the benefit of my friends who seem to 
be resigned to having a pathetic debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member was complaining about having kidney stones.  Another 
member said “why are you bashing the Reform Party?”  It was not 
a question of bashing the Reform Party.  That comes very easily. 
Its members do that job best themselves.  What I was trying to 
say was here is what the Government of Canada has done.  Here is 
who we have consulted.  These are the bottom lines of the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade critic for the Reform Party has not given me one word 
on the MAI.  His party has had no meetings to speak of.  They 
have not travelled across the country to discuss this matter with 
the stakeholders but they say they are the responsible leaders of 
Her Majesty's official opposition.  It is as if they are saying 
they do not have anything to say or to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course they cry when we ask them why they are open to 
foreign culture entering our country.  What is wrong with them 
when the entire Parliament of Canada is prepared to defend our 
identity?  What is wrong with them when they do not want to 
support labour rights being defined, both the rights and 
obligations of the multinational companies as well as the 
workers?  Why does the member want to sell our health care 
system?  He pathetically stood in his place to tell us that he 
got better treatment in the United States of America than he 
could have in Canada.  In the United States there are 50 million 
people who do not have any insurance to speak of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he asked about social services.  He said there was not 
enough competition in social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wonders why he is getting bashed, it is 
because he deserves it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask at the end of my question, or perhaps after I hear 
the response from the minister, that you seek unanimous consent 
to extend this question and comment period.  I liked his last 
response a great deal and this is one of the few chances we are 
going to get to question him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a serious point of order, I would ask for the consent of the 
House to extend the question and comment period for 10 or 15 
minutes to allow other members to ask the minister a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a short question. 
The minister repeated the mantra we have heard so often from him 
and his colleagues that $1 billion of direct foreign investment 
results in 45,000 jobs.  However, the point is that 97% of 
foreign investment in 1997 came into Canada not to create new 
jobs but to buy existing Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister simply confirm that 97% of all foreign 
investment that came into Canada in 1997, $21-plus billion, was 
to purchase existing Canadian companies and not to create new 
jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the figures do not come 
from my department or from the Liberal Party of Canada.  The 
figures come from Statistics Canada, which happens to be one of 
the best statistics gathering organizations recognized the world 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada has two sets of numbers.  For every $1 billion 
in traded merchandise we sustain or create some 11,000 jobs in 
Canada.  For every $1 billion of investment in Canada we create 
or sustain 45,000 jobs over the course of a five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That investment may take different forms.  For instance, in the 
province of British Columbia 30% of its GDP is made up of trade 
with the Asian market.  Trade and investment represent an 
important lifeblood for our national community.  They are the 
flip side of the same coin.  One creates the other. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we also have to recognize that we are not just talking 
about incoming investment in the order of $180 billion to Canada 
and that when that comes in, not only does it create job 
opportunities, it also imports important R and D development in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also talking about Canadians aggressively investing 
abroad, $170 billion.  Not only does that create more competitive 
companies for our firms internationally, it also creates spin-off 
jobs at home as well as research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we went to Latin America and made investment, it also 
created jobs for firms of architects in B.C., firms of lawyers, 
firms of engineers.   The investment is the complement to trade. 
The two go hand in hand and Canada, without trade and investment, 
will not be able to create the economic wealth that both he and I 
want for today's generation, particularly for young Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  There was a suggestion from the NDP 
that we seek unanimous consent to see whether we could extend 
this 10 minutes.  We would be in favour of that if the Chair 
would be interested in seeking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the period of questions and comments for the minister by 10 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
I want to commend the minister on his evolution from a vociferous 
opponent of free trade to now an ardent supporter of the 
principles that my party has supported since before 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the minister is relative to the Australian model 
for treaty negotiation which was introduced by Alexander Downer, 
foreign minister, in May 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could apply to Canada's participation in MAI, it could 
apply to our participation in Kyoto or virtually any 
international agreement that we are pursuing. The treaty as 
legislated will be tabled in Parliament at least 15 days before 
the government takes binding action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the treaty will be tabled after the treaty has been 
signed for Australia but before action is taken that would bind 
Australia under international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit to having the treaty that is signed 
tabled in the House for 15 days for legitimate, meaningful debate 
similar to what Australia has now?  That was the same position we 
took as part of the foreign affairs and international trade 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not achieve agreement at the committee but I would like 
to ask the minister, who I really hope believes in this type of 
meaningful dialogue, whether he will commit to 15 days of debate 
and discussion with the final agreement tabled in the House prior 
to ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as far as the first 
point goes, I think if the history of political parties in the 
country is looked at, it will be found very objectively that the 
Liberal Party of Canada has always been the party to try to tear 
down these protectionist walls and be very multilateral, very 
much a freer trade orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's party certainly has a history of suggesting that 
those old Chinese walls need to be built bigger, better and 
higher. If he is a student of history he should hit those history 
books.  I think he will be pleasantly surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the whole question of parliamentary 
engagement.  I appreciate the hon. member's suggestion of the 
model used by the Australians.  I think he mentioned that to me 
in a very constructive way last year when he was still the trade 
critic.  I appreciated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly will give a commitment to study one of the 
recommendations tabled in the report of some kind of 
parliamentary engagement at the end of the process.  Should the 
committee come back to the House in terms of a debate?  Should 
there be some parliamentary motions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also early days.  I am being very up front with 
him.  We do not know whether there will be an MAI agreement, what 
shape it will be, will it change any laws of the Parliament of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are prepared to look at the question.  We have mentioned that 
we are going to report earlier than we are allowed, so that we 
can provide those kinds of answers for Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the last little debate between the Conservatives and 
the Liberals was quite enlightening.  The minister asked us to 
look at our history books.  I remember very well this minister 
arguing against free trade in this House. I am amazed and happy 
that he got into cabinet.  It does sometimes change the way we 
think or the way we have to think.  I am happy he is now a free 
trader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear him knock the Reform Party.  This party has always been 
in favour of free trade.  We have not changed our position. Do 
not give me the eyes, we have been.  The minister is the one who 
has changed his mind many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party is the one that brought this matter to the House of 
Commons.  That is why it is being debated today.  The NDP could 
have brought it on one of its supply days.  The Liberals could 
have done on it their supply day.  We brought it here.  We are 
debating the issue but we are not getting one answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every party has asked the same question. A very good question 
came from my colleague in the Conservative Party. The weakness in 
this whole debate has been that the minister has not been out 
selling it.  There is a lot of false information coming from our 
socialist friends at the other end to the Canadian people.  Will 
the minister guarantee the Canadian public that before Canada 
ratifies the agreement the House of Commons will have the chance 
to debate and vote on the issue?  It is very simple. That is all 
we are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason I was raising 
my eyes is that he somehow gave the impression to the House that 
the Reform Party had a history rich enough to talk about the free 
trade agreement and NAFTA. Not only does it not have a history, 
it does not have a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of parliamentary engagement, he may not like the answer 
but I gave it to him.  He can get up and ask another question. 
What I was trying to say is that we are not afraid of an 
engagement of Parliament.  It was not his party or his critic or 
anybody else who pressured the government into putting this issue 
before the parliamentary committee.  It was an initiative 
voluntarily taken by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we wanted a report by the end of December 1997 was 
that if there was to be a signature by the end of April we wanted 
the parliamentary committee to be able to offer its advise to the 
government in January so that when crunch time came on the 
negotiations we would have the advice of the Parliament of 
Canada.  The hon. critic for the Reform Party knows this. I told 
him so and he agreed with it at the time.  We did it at the front 
end and we are certainly going to consider what role, if any, 
Parliament can play at the back end of the process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister told me in the House that culture would be carved out 
for the MAI.  Then he said if we do not get a full exemption we 
will settle for country specific reservation, like we did in 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that NAFTA does not protect us since it allows 
retaliatory measures by the U.S.  The former trade minister said 
on January 30, 1997:  “We do not have any cultural protections 
under NAFTA.  That is a myth, we never did”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government insists on continuing with this negotiation 
will the government commit to protecting culture with a full 
exception to the text like that enjoyed by financial services 
such as banks and national securities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I tried in my address 
today and a few days ago to answer the hon. member's question. I 
know she is serious about the cultural industry.  I know that she 
took on the Reform Party some hours ago on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said two things.  First, Canada takes the position that the 
culture issue should not be on the MAI table.  But because it 
operates by consensus, if one country insists on having it on the 
table we have said, which is our right, that we will take a 
country specific exemption.  For the purposes of Canadian culture 
either of the two options is the same.  The bottom line for us is 
that cultural is not negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, where culture does have an exemption is in the 
investment chapter under NAFTA.  It will do so at bare minimum 
under the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can be up front with the hon. member, I do not think for 
culture the concern is either NAFTA or the MAI. The concern I 
have for culture and trade is at the WTO. 
When the application came against our Canadian magazine industry 
and the movie industry, it came through the WTO.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have advocated publicly that we need to square the circle at 
the WTO. If we can do labour and trade, if we can do trade and 
the environment, if we can have the very sensitive and emotional 
debate on agriculture in the next round, surely we can also 
despite the difficulty try to square the circle with trade and 
culture.  Culture at the end of the day comes down to self pride 
and identify.  Every country, big or small, rich or poor, has 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly with technology where you can download culture, 
countries which think that a different language or a different 
history can protect them in terms of culture identity are wrong. 
We are finding that more allies, more countries are seeing it the 
way Canada does.  I would like to mobilize some kind of 
international opinion that at some point, maybe in the next 
round, we can have rules on trade and culture that protect and 
distinguish between illegitimate and legitimate practices. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to ask a question that is from a constituent so I hope this 
will be one question the minister actually answers. It is a 
specific question. Could jobs in our resource extraction sectors 
go to foreign workers?  For example could Americans come in to 
buy up Canadian fishing licences and could Fletcher Challenge 
bring in New Zealanders to work for lower wages in the woods? 
Could the minister please answer those questions for a 
constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member had 
listened to the speech I gave when we talked about natural 
resources, the answer would be very self-evident. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister stated just a few moments ago that he was seeking 
the advice of the committee as he wants its input and involvement 
in the parliamentary process. The committee made specific 
recommendations to the minister, number four, a full impact 
analysis and number five, that this has to be public disclosure, 
a transparent process with consultation with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These recommendations came from the committee.  They were 
endorsed and supported by a majority of Liberals.  His own 
chairman has responded in the House today by saying that it is 
not practical to do a full impact study so early on. It is not 
practical, and those were his own words, for an open consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell this House that he is willing to go to 
Canadians, to go out to British Columbia and talk about this 
multilateral agreement on investment so that they know what the 
heck is going on?  That is what this debate is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member was 
listening to the debate and I agreed with unanimous consent to 
afford extra time, we have been doing that. It is not only 
myself, but also our backbenchers and our government officials. I 
would also like to see him and some of the other huffy puffy 
Reform Party members take their responsibilities seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We initiated the parliamentary dialogue. We are certainly 
grateful for the advice the parliamentary committee has given the 
government. As the member knows, being a student of parliamentary 
procedure, the government is given 150 days to report back to the 
committee. The hon. critic for the Reform Party knows that I have 
also made a commitment to do it before the allotted time because 
I can appreciate the sensitivity of some of those 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are grateful and we are obviously studying those 
recommendations and will be reporting back to that committee very 
soon. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for 
Vancouver East, poverty; the hon. member for

will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an interesting discussion that we are having. 
I was appalled at the comments of the minister when he indicated 
that Reform had no history in this debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I inform the minister that I was involved in a debate during the 
1988 election campaign when the Conservatives were talking about 
free trade and the Liberals were against free trade.  The 
Liberals and the NDP argued against the free trade agreement 
between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also involved in the debate on NAFTA during the 1993 
election campaign.  I remember the Liberals and the NDP arguing 
against NAFTA.  It is interesting how things change when one gets 
into the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is about the Reform motion which I will read 
again for the understanding of viewers who are just joining this 
debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for:  (1) failing to 
explain why it is negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment (the MAI); (2) failing to explain what benefits and 
costs it foresees for the Canadian people; and (3) failing to 
take part in public discussion on the Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion must sound familiar to some Liberals because it is 
similar to a motion they made against the Tory government in 
March 1992 while the Tories were negotiating the free trade 
agreement. The Liberal motion on NAFTA which was presented on 
March 24, 1992 was put forward as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for its failure to be 
completely open with Canadians about its principal goals and 
objectives in the current North American free trade negotiations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals are saying that our motion is bad although they 
put a similar motion before the House in 1992.  Come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's comments are even more interesting.  The hon. 
member who just gave us a 40 minute dialogue on his position said 
in 1992  “We had to rely this morning on the Toronto <I>Star</I>, 
as have Canadians, to try to learn what the Government of Canada 
has been dealing with in terms of the other two countries.  It is 
a shame that we have to rely on one of our newspapers to begin to 
enlighten not only Canadians but elected Canadians who are 
supposed to deal with issues on behalf of 26 million shareholders 
of this company called Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking grassroots here now “Back home on an issue that 
is fundamental to the livelihoods of all Canadians there is 
silence and ignorance. When there is silence and ignorance, 
whether it is true or not, there is certain to be fear of the 
unknown at the very least”.  This is from the hon. minister who 
just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP and its allies are out in strong force, in particular in 
my province of British Columbia.  Whether it is the Council of 
Canadians or whether it is the environmental groups, they are 
telling Canadians one side of the issue.  And where is our 
government in this?  Nowhere.  Nowhere has the other side of this 
issue been debated either publicly or individually with 
Canadians. This is the same group of people, with the exception 
of the Liberals who were against the free trade agreement and 
NAFTA.  We see them once again out there campaigning very 
strongly against this government proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments from the NDP are that Canada will lose its 
sovereignty, that we will have to give up our health care and 
that we will lose our Canadian culture.  Those of us who do not 
see the boundaries and the borders can understand why somebody is 
not debating the other side of the issue, why somebody is not 
challenging those kinds of comments which are being put before 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians want to hear both sides.  I am convinced 
that Canadians want to know not only what the benefits are but 
what the drawbacks are.  I believe Canadians are sophisticated 
enough to know that in any international treaty Canada enters 
into and which Canada signs there will be some winners and some 
losers. Canadians want an honest evaluation of what is likely to 
happen. They are not getting it with a government that sits in 
silence and does not want to participate in this debate. That is 
where this government has failed. 
This is why Canadians across the country are very concerned.

is true or not, there is certain to be fear of the unknown at the 
very best”.  That is so true. It is the silence and the 
government's reluctance or the refusal to even talk to people in 
Canada about what the MAI is, what does this multilateral 
agreement for investment mean.  Who are going to be the winners, 
who are going to be the losers?  When we talk about losing our 
sovereignty to the large corporations of the world, is it true, 
is it not true?  What exactly does this multilateral agreement on 
investment mean to Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I believe I have a commitment to my constituents I had a 
full page in my householder on this particular issue trying to 
bring it to their attention so that we could start this kind of 
debate.  I must say that most of the comments I received from my 
constituents were negative.  They felt that there was a problem 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the question so that the House understands what 
they were asked. The question was:  Do you support the basic 
principle of the MAI which states that foreign companies shall be 
subject to the same regulation as domestic companies? There were 
almost 2,000 responses to that survey question. Of those almost 
2,000 responses 1,507 or 77% of the people said yes that they 
supported that principle.  Only 317 or 16% said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, despite that support for the principles of the 
multilateral agreement on investment the people who chose to 
comment, who actually wrote to me, had negative things to say.  I 
want to share with the House one of the comments that I received. 
I quote “The citizens of Canada require an across Canada forum 
to be held on the MAI now. This has been negotiated in secrecy 
until it was leaked to the press last spring. This government was 
elected on promises to renegotiate NAFTA, so where is their 
mandate to progress with the MAI?  The repercussions for 
Canadians and Canada could be so grievous that open and free 
debate across this country is needed. This government does not 
represent Canadians. This has become very clear in this country 
since 1993”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a comment from a constituent of mine.  There were many 
others who made comments which support that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is a draft agreement, as I understand it, that is being 
negotiated by this government.  It is a draft agreement that 
applies to 28 other countries around the world, but most 
Canadians do not know that.  Most Canadians do not know what 
other countries we are talking about entering into this 
negotiation.  That kind of debate and that kind of information 
should be widely known so that people can understand who it is we 
are talking about entering agreements with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole list of exemptions that Canada has already 
placed through the NAFTA and NAFTA is the basis on which the MAI 
agreement is being negotiated.  Canadians need to know that. They 
need to know what exemptions already in place in NAFTA are going 
to be carried over to the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to be brought into this discussion. I and my 
colleagues believe that Canadians deserve to be included in the 
governance of their country and that Canadians deserve to have 
the right to have this kind of debate before that agreement is 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the minister and from his department, 
are they going to provide this debate before the people of Canada 
and before this House of Commons before the agreement is signed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker I would 
like the Reform Party member to answer a question I have on the 
Reform Party's minority report on the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I can determine from the minority report, Reform says 
“The protection for culture, if it must exist, should be drawn 
as clearly and as narrowly as possible”. 
This seems to aid the United States position on that which is 
that they would oppose very broad cultural exemptions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the Reform Party if they would justify 
promoting the interests of huge entertainment giants like Sony, 
Walt Disney and Blockbuster at the expense of the rights of 
Canadians to their own cultural expression? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Reformers are not afraid 
to say that Canadians can compete at any level, whether it is on 
a cultural basis, business basis, industry basis or anything 
else.  Canadians have the potential and it has been proven. 
Whether it is Céline Dion or Bryan Adams in Vancouver, Canadians 
have proven that they can compete on an international scale. They 
do not need protection.  They need promotion and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we would like to see is a tighter concentrated framework 
for culture because things like the Internet and the new 
technologies can be easily drawn under that cultural 
characteristic.  We feel that would be detrimental to 
development, investment and jobs in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder 
if the member could comment on the fact that the evolution of the 
MAI, as I understand it, is basically to address those areas 
which are not already mandated by multilateral agreements. 
Eighty per cent of our trade is with the United States, therefore 
80% of our investment agreements are already documented in the 
NAFTA. The rest of that, almost 20% or at least 15%, is now 
mandated in bilateral agreements.  In other words, 95% of our 
trade and investment policy is already undertaken in these 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is talking about and what her party is so 
concerned about is an agreement that cannot at maximum affect any 
more than 5% of foreign direct investment now occurring in 
Canada.  Could she relate to me how important she thinks that is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that 
65% of our investment is with the United States, not 95%.  This 
is why we need to have this kind of debate.  It is so those kinds 
of figures get put on the table and everybody knows what they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is, yes, Canada already through NAFTA has this 
investment agreement with the United States and Mexico.  However, 
what is happening here is we want to use that same framework and 
expand it to 28 countries, some of which we already have an 
investment agreement with.  It is not under NAFTA but in 
bilateral agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is 28 countries agreeing to consider this option. I 
understand there are more undeveloped countries that are waiting 
for this to happen so they can come on board as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of the motion before the House. 
The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for:  (1) failing to 
explain why it is negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investments (the MAI), (2) failing to explain what benefits and 
costs it foresees for the Canadian people, and (3) failing to 
take part in public discussion on the Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to say that it is really quite 
remarkable to hear the hon. Minister of International Trade speak 
on this motion.  We have presented this motion in part to give 
this minister a platform to explain to this House and, through 
it, to Canadians why there is a need for the national treatment 
of investment as is proposed under the MAI.  Why would Canada 
benefit from the further liberalization of trade laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking the opportunity and seizing the moment, he 
used most of his time for partisan politics, for taking cheap 
shots as opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a principle at the heart of parliamentary democracy 
which this government sometimes seems to lose sight, the 
principle of ministerial responsibility.  We on this side of the 
House are merely legislators.  The minister is a legislator as a 
member of Parliament and is a minister of the crown, a member of 
the executive branch of government responsible for negotiating 
and implementing foreign treaties. It is his responsibility, not 
that of opposition legislators, to explain and articulate the 
need or lack thereof for Canada to enter into certain foreign 
agreements, the MAI in this case.  The government has yet once 
more failed in that respect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not surprising coming from this minister and this 
government given that this is a minister and this is a party 
which in 1988 launched a vicious attack on the free trade 
agreement with the United States, which committed that it would 
tear up the free trade agreement, that it would retroactively 
veto the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members sitting on the opposite side of this House who 
argued in 1988 that free trade would lead to the end of Canadian 
sovereignty.  I remember a Liberal commercial on television with 
a map of North America where somehow magically the border of the 
49th parallel was erased on the television screen.  They said 
that Canada was going to become the fifty-first state, that this 
would lead to untold economic misery, that our universal publicly 
administered health care program would be doomed.  That is what 
they said, people sitting over there right now, including the 
Minister of International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 they said they were going to renegotiate the NAFTA.  The 
last  time I checked, they did not change the North American Free 
Trade Agreement one iota.  The reason why this minister has a 
huge credibility deficit addressing the MAI, the reason why so 
many Canadians are so cynical and suspicious about the real 
motives and outcome here is precisely because they have never 
admitted the kind of radical change of philosophy that they have 
undergone in government with respect to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the minister do just that, that he and his 
colleagues do some stock-taking and apologize for how they tried 
to engage in precisely the same kind of fearmongering and 
misrepresentation that our friends in the New Democratic Party 
and the party to our left are wont to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has always supported the principle of free 
trade.  We support the principle of national treatment of 
investment.  We support it not because we want to give more than 
we get, but because we realize that Canada as an enormous 
exporter, as a country whose economic engine is export industries 
and services, would benefit enormously from allowing our 
companies, our investors, greater freedom of trade in foreign 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late last year I was invited by the hon. Minister of Finance to 
take part in a Canadian delegation at the American Hemispheric 
Free Trade Discussions in Santiago, Chile, with all of the 
governments of North, South and Central America.  I had an 
opportunity at that conference to speak with Canadian companies 
with major investments in South America.  Let me give one example 
in Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian mining company based in British Columbia has invested 
hundreds of millions of dollars in capital and training in mining 
operations in Chile that have generated handsome profits for this 
Canadian company, for its Canadian shareholders, for its Canadian 
employees.  It has brought new wealth to this country like so 
many other Canadian export oriented companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very same company was considering whether it would be able 
to continue its operations in Chile or would have to suspend its 
operations at some point because there is a dual tax scheme in 
Chile, a tax regime which imposes a much higher tax on the 
corporate profits of companies that are foreign owned.  By 
allowing certain countries to discriminate against foreign-held 
companies, that company and its Canadian employees are not only 
penalized but are at risk of losing the hundreds of millions of 
Canadian dollars that they have invested there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dozens and dozens of similar instances not only in 
this hemisphere but throughout the world where Canadian 
investments are put at peril by these kinds of discriminatory 
protectionist policy regimes which make everybody poor and nobody 
richer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want with this motion to focus on this government's inability 
or unwillingness to lodge a major national debate.  The minister 
says that we had committee hearings on it.  That is wonderful. 
Three weeks.  I do not know how many business days the committee 
actually met in Ottawa, 10 or 11 business days.  It stayed here 
in Ottawa and the only people they heard from were the usual 
talking heads from interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever that committee did, whatever its report said, I can 
assure members that it did not get out to the constituents of 
every member of this place, some of whom are being mislead by the 
propaganda of radical left wing conspiracy theorists to believe 
that the MAI will lead to another end of Canadian sovereignty, 
another end to our health care programs and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this government do?  Absolutely nothing.  In the red 
book, the MAI was not even mentioned as an election issue.  We 
are talking about a significant international investment 
agreement that was not even raised as an election issue by this 
government.  It has been under negotiation for two years.  They 
had done virtually nothing in those two years to present it to 
this House or to Canadians.  Then they blame the opposition for 
not articulating the government's policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not understand.  As one of my colleagues says, it 
really is audacious.  We have asked one simple question of the 
minister who spoke not long ago, whether or not he would commit 
to having this House debate and perhaps ratify—imagine that—any 
agreement that is signed by the Canadian negotiators in Paris at 
the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could not give us a straight answer on that very simple 
question.  As somebody who is about as free trade as someone can 
get, even I start to wonder what is going on here, what is being 
hidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the minister not just give a simple straightforward 
commitment that the democratically elected representatives of the 
people of Canada will have an opportunity to get to the bottom of 
the agreement, to look at the details, to see how broad or how 
narrow the exemptions are, to see whether or not Canada will 
benefit, to see what the economic costs and benefits are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can he not make that commitment in this place today?  It is 
not a big deal.  It does not cost the government anything 
politically or financially to allow members and Canadians to 
debate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, I really strongly believe that this minister 
needs to make a fundamental reassessment about how he has managed 
this file.  There is a great deal of hysteria building up out 
there and he has done virtually nothing to tell Canadians the 
truth about this agreement and its implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this motion tonight will be the beginning of just such a 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest and astonishment to the 
comments of the Reform Party member for Calgary Southeast.  Of 
course, it is interesting to see the born again Reform Party 
suddenly expressing concern about the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southeast quite rightly points out that 
the Liberal Party during the last federal election campaign was 
silent on the MAI. That silence was just as deafening from the 
Reform Party.  I recall on many instances the leader of my party, 
the member for Halifax, colleagues from Winnipeg and elsewhere, 
alerting Canadians to the profound dangers of the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the only party that even touched this issue in the last 
federal election campaign.  In fact as recently as a couple of 
weeks ago, Reform Party members of Parliament were vigorously 
defending the MAI.  My colleague from Vancouver East debated the 
member for North Vancouver and the member for North Vancouver was 
extolling the virtues of the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members of Parliament signed on to the agreement of 
the foreign affairs committee on the MAI.  New Democrats of 
course have from the outset strongly opposed this agreement, this 
20-year lock-in that would constitute a massive assault on 
Canadian social programs, environmental programs and culture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Calgary Southeast is a very 
straightforward one.  Could the member explain why the leader of 
the Reform Party was totally silent, not one word, not a peep, 
not a whisper, about the MAI during the last federal election 
campaign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the hypocrisy today?  They realize that Canadians are deeply 
concerned about the MAI.  They suddenly woke up and said “my 
God, maybe we better do something about this”.  They were silent 
and had supported the MAI from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me correct the record 
in two important respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we were not silent during the election campaign on this 
issue.  We spoke about it in public forums.  We had a clear 
position.  We supported the negotiations, not the agreement, 
because there is no agreement.  We do not support an agreement 
that does not yet exist.  That is why we want to be able to 
debate it in this place.  We do support negotiating instead of 
pulling out of the negotiations unilaterally and hiding our heads 
in the sand, as our friends from the New Democratic Party would 
want us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will go through the negotiations.  We support the 
government's presence at such negotiations.  Canadians will be 
able to debate the agreement that is finalized there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been very willing to discuss the issue all along and 
during the election campaign.  When I debated the New Democratic 
candidate in my constituency he never raised the matter, but I 
did talk about our support in principle for free trade.  I do not 
know what the hon. member is talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot believe it.  My colleague in the socialist movement is 
absolutely right.  One thing about the NDP is that it was 
consistent in its opposition to anything having to do with a free 
market economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hypocrisy of the party over there standing up today and 
suddenly pretending that it is the defender of those opposed to 
the multilateral agreement on investment is an ultimate insult to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have no knowledge of what is going on around the 
table.  They pick up their information in bits and pieces from 
what they receive in the mail or what they read in this paper or 
that paper.  They never took the time to look into the agreement 
to see what it really meant for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by saying that the agreement takes nothing away 
from Canada.  There is everything to gain for us and nothing to 
lose.  They should get their heads out of the sand and stand in 
support of what the government is doing rather than acting like a 
jacuzzi socialist without knowing the least bit about socialism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to not 
knowing much about socialism, I plead guilty.  I have never been 
in a jacuzzi but my limousine Liberal friend across the way will 
know that we have not engaged in the sky is falling chicken 
littleism of the loony left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  Obviously the member came in after I was done 
my remarks because he did not hear what I said.  The Reform Party 
does support and always has supported the principle of free 
trade.  I talked about why it is necessary for our investors to 
get national treatment overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the hon. member coming from?  Is he in favour?  Was he 
in favour of the FTA in 1988? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  He was in favour of it.  I guess he did 
not tell Mr. Turner that.  Was he in favour of NAFTA in 1993?  We 
do not know where the Liberals are coming from.  At least Reform 
has been consistent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
least I know what a socialist is, unlike the previous member.  I 
am sharing my time with the member for Parkdale—High Park.  I 
would appreciate a signal as I get to the end of my allotted 
time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to engage in the debate today.  I must confess that 
I was a little surprised by the issue right from its inception. I 
am particularly surprised by the attitude taken by my friends in 
the New Democratic Party.  The member from Burnaby stated a few 
minutes ago that New Democrats have been unalterably opposed to 
the deal from the beginning.  While that is not inconsistent, it 
strikes me as being a little unintelligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Canada, as well as the rest of the world, is 
moving into a different kind of economic structure, one which 
gives a trading country like Canada enormous opportunities around 
the world.  Our businesses are engaged in every corner of the 
globe and they are asking for some measure of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been quite active with groups in Winnipeg that are 
looking at emerging markets in the Far East in particular.  There 
are companies in Winnipeg that have managed to secure very 
substantial agreements with China.  These companies are not large 
multinationals.  They are companies that are currently doing 
business in Winnipeg.  In fact right now there is a big 
delegation of people in the hog business who are looking at 
selling pork products abroad and making substantial investments 
in China, Korea and Taiwan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The MAI has nothing to do with those 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  The problem is that the New Democrats are 
unwilling even to hear the other side of the debate.  All they 
want to do is say “It is wrong.  The sky is falling”.  Let us 
at least get some of the comments from the other side on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a significant number of ordinary Canadians are 
trying to do business around the world.  It is in their interest 
to have a legal framework which protects their interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that any time we get into an agreement which is 
contractual in nature we also agree to certain things.  If we are 
asking other people for exemptions or to change their body of law 
or to limit their freedom to act, we will do the same thing in a 
contractual manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also reasonable, when we start to negotiate any kind of 
agreement, that the various parties put on the table their 
preferred deal, their perfect world.  They may differ 
significantly from our view of a perfect world.  That is why 
there are negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discussions which go on for some period of time and we 
reach common positions.  It is not rocket science; it is the 
business of negotiating an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised at the shallowness of the Reform Party's 
motion, particularly the second and third parts of it.  It states 
that the government has failed to explain what the benefits and 
costs will be and that the government has failed to take part in 
public discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a document, to which the minister referred, that goes 
back to May 24, 1995.  If members check their calendars they will 
determine that was before the last election.  On that date there 
was a public announcement of the launch of the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not, unless called upon, take up the time of the House to 
go through this, but since then there have been hundreds and 
hundreds of meetings, discussions, phone calls and documents 
exchanged with everybody from business to labour.  They go right 
across the spectrum.  The people who have wanted to be involved 
in the process and wanted to get information have been provided 
with it quite extensively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not certain what the Reform Party is attempting to achieve 
with the debate when its members stand in the House and profess 
they cannot get things that it seems the rest of Canada has been 
able to obtain quite easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very legitimate concerns.  My friends in the New 
Democratic Party, when they step down from their rhetoric and 
start to look at the issues, actually make some valid points.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Dartmouth made a cogent and coherent 
argument about some legitimate concerns relative to culture. A 
number of concerns have to be looked at in light of what we are 
prepared to accept in terms of limitations on our own freedom of 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say on the one hand that we are giving up our sovereignty 
and will no longer be able to act on behalf of the people of 
Canada.  On the other hand we can say we are entering into an 
agreement where we agree to do something and the other side 
agrees to do something.  We weigh what we are giving up against 
what we feel we are achieving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, contrary to the opinion expressed by the Reform 
Party, was not the least bit shy about being in the House and 
debating this point, as he has not been the least bit shy about 
being anywhere in Canada and discussing it.  In the discussions I 
have had in my riding I have had the same kind of reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Articles have been printed in the paper.  One article was 
something like “if we pass this agreement life in Canada will 
end”.  That kind of rhetoric has done two things.  It has 
devalued the debate and made it more difficult for the New 
Democrats to put on the table legitimate concerns about this very 
complex set of negotiations.  It has also raised concerns on the 
part of people who may not be aware, may not have the time or may 
not have a sense of what is happening internationally around 
them, particularly older people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set up a committee in my riding to work on this issue. 
People, at first blush, after reading the rhetoric were quite 
fearful about what may or may not be happening.  However, when we 
sat down and looked at the questions, got the information from 
the minister and came back and had a discussion, it seemed that 
step by step people were satisfied that their concerns were being 
addressed and their fears were being taken into consideration in 
the negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to make three key points.  The first is that 
there is nothing mysterious or secretive about involvement in the 
MAI negotiations.  This is not something that will all of a 
sudden be sprung on people.  Goodness knows an enormous amount of 
information has been shared already.  It is a process that began 
publicly over two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the minister and the government want to let 
Canadians know what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if it can be achieved, a good and fair set of rules for 
international investment would in principle be good for Canada. I 
do not think I need make that point in the House.  If we could 
get a set of principles or rules in place that further 
international co-operation, trade and investment in a way that is 
of net benefit to the people of Canada and the people in the rest 
of the world, it would be a good thing.  It is a good thing when 
nations come together to negotiate and build a framework of 
agreements rather than to fight.  It is a good thing if we 
negotiate a solution in Iraq rather than fight to reach a 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to underline the third one.  At the end of the 
negotiation the government will not sign on Canada's behalf an 
MAI that does not fully support key Canadian values and safeguard 
vital Canadian interest.  I believe that is an important point to 
end on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day people are negotiating and looking for ways to improve 
things in the country.  Having reached an end to those 
negotiations, we in the Chamber and in the country will be called 
on to evaluate it.  If it does not meet that test we will not 
sign it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberals have been negotiating this agreement for at least 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the election we saw red book II, in which we did not see 
any mention of MAI.  We heard no mention about MAI in the throne 
speech and I was surprised when I saw this report on multilateral 
agreement on investment marked confidential. This report would 
not be in my hands if it was not leaked to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this government negotiating in confidence without 
letting Canadians know what the benefits or costs to Canadians 
are?  Why was this government afraid to have a public discussion 
on this issue?  Why was this government afraid of calling a 
public debate on this issue?  Why was the government afraid of 
having an informed discussion on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking a simple thing.  We want public discussion on this 
issue.  We want debate in the House.  Can this member inform us 
why he is afraid of having a discussion in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not only am I not afraid of 
having public discussion, I am standing and participating in the 
discussion taking place in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks why there was no mention.  This was publicly 
announced on May 24, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Exactly.  There is no surprise here. 
This process has been going on for a very long time.  There have 
been mailings, packages, information sent to members of 
Parliament on July 25, September 15, October 17, November 4, 
February 16, February 9— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the member will 
forgive me, we will go on to the next question so that we can get 
a couple of questions in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the member for Winnipeg South is smarting a 
bit from the fact that New Democrat MPs in Winnipeg held a public 
meeting on the MAI just last week and at the drop of a hat over 
350 people attended, a sold-out crowd of people deeply concerned 
about the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not want rhetoric.  He wants a calm debate on 
this issue.  We have been trying to have such a debate.  I would 
like to ask the member for Winnipeg South a question regarding a 
matter relating to the health committee where we actually tried 
to have such a debate on guaranteeing that health care, medicare, 
would be protected from the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we got from their side were voices from the BCNI and the 
Fraser Institute saying trust the Liberal government.  There were 
no arguments, no accountability, no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this member and this government are so committed to 
maintaining medicare and believe it is not a threat in the MAI, 
why will they not agree to a complete exemption for health care 
in the MAI as opposed to the NAFTA reservations which evoke all 
kinds of concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must confess I was not 
aware that such a meeting was held in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the simplest way to answer that question, although it 
evokes a number of responses, is just to reiterate the point that 
was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In negotiations, many things are broadly talked about but the 
commitment that has been made is at the end of negotiations this 
government will not sign on Canada's behalf an MAI that does not 
fully support key Canadian values and safeguard vital Canadian 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is definitely one of those key Canadian values that 
every member on this side of the House will support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like say how pleased I am to join in this 
debate today on the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do so in a number of capacities, as a member of the 
subcommittee on international trade disputes and investment and 
as a member of the standing committee on heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I rise today as a member of a riding that is home to many 
artists and individuals who are involved in the arts and cultural 
industry in Canada, a sector I am absolutely passionate about and 
care for very deeply.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start the debate by reiterating the key messages 
that the minister has been saying about the MAI.   First, 
there is nothing mysterious or secretive about our involvement in 
the MAI negotiations.  I believe that Canada has a duty to be 
there to protect that which is important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if it can be achieved, a good and fair set of rules for 
international investment would in principle be a good thing for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, at the end of the negotiations, the minister will not 
sign on Canada's behalf an MAI that does not fully support key 
Canadian values and safeguard vital Canadian interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about one very important vital Canadian 
interest and Canadian value.   That is the arts and cultural 
industry in Canada and what we as a government have been doing in 
consultation with the cultural sector and the individual actors, 
creators, writers, technicians, publishers who live in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been consulting with the minister.  We have been going 
to the minister, having the minister's ear and the minister has 
been listening.  Let me put that in the context of what I would 
ask all members to read, a report that was tabled at the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts by Garry Neil which sets out the problems 
with the original draft text that came out in May 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report, Mr. Neil makes absolutely clear that according to 
that draft which was released, the cultural sector would be 
covered fully by the MAI as drafted in January 1997. 
Unfortunately I have to disagree with hon. members of the Reform 
Party that Canada can compete anywhere and in any sector, 
including the cultural sector.  With all respect, they can only 
do so because of this government's cultural policy which 
advocates the creator and Canadian content and the infrastructure 
to take that Canadian content through the creator to our 
audiences in Canada.  That has been our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Neil goes on by saying that potentially with the January 
1997 text as drafted, the MAI would affect in some way virtually 
every cultural policy.  We may be able to compete today in 
children's programming for one reason alone, because we have a 
cultural policy that promoted children's programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are world leaders in television programming for 
children.  <I>The Comfy Couch</I>, <I>Dudley the Dragon</I>, things 
that our children and our grandchildren know about, have come 
about through one of those policies which has been the Canada 
cable and television production fund which is only given to 
Canadian companies.  Those things would not have been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see the impact the MAI in its 1997 form would have had on 
culture.  Let us talk about what, if we had accepted that draft 
as written, it could potentially have done for culture. 
Particularly to Reformers who feel that culture should not be on 
the table, that it should just be part of this agreement, let me 
tell them what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada prohibits, limits or restricts foreign ownership in most 
of our cultural industries currently.  For example, no foreign 
company can own more than one-third of a Canadian broadcaster or 
distribution undertaking, cable, satellite or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy in the book trade generally prohibits a Canadian 
company from being sold to non-Canadian interests.  The policy in 
film distribution prohibits a foreign company from establishing a 
new business in Canada, except to distribute its own productions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased foreign ownership in the sound recording business is 
reviewed by investment Canada under the net benefits test. 
Ontario's periodical and publication distribution act and several 
Quebec statutes require Canadian ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing our government's policy does for culture is that 
funding programs are limited to Canadian individuals and firms. 
Access to most funding programs is denied to non-Canadian 
companies and individuals, for example funding support for film 
and television production activities through Telefilm, the 
provincial agency.  The Canada Council is limited to Canadian 
firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If taxation is carved into the MAI, the support through the 
refundable investment tax credit and the companion provincial 
schemes are also at risk.  The CRTC has been mandated by this 
government for the creation of private sector production and 
talent support programs in both the television and sound 
recording industries by directing licences to provide certain 
percentages of revenues for these purposes. 
These programs are generally not available to foreign firms.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the book publishing industry development program, 
the block grant program of the Canada Council and the publication 
assistance program.  They are limited to Canadian book and 
magazine publishers.  Access is also limited to many funds that 
support new media productions, again limited to Canadian firms. 
The cultural industries development fund, administered by the 
former federal business development bank, provides assistance 
only to Canadian firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the definition of investor in the MAI includes 
organizations and associations operated on a not for profit 
basis, direct and indirect funding of these activities may be 
subject to challenge if access is denied to a foreign association 
or organization having a Canadian presence or asset. Let us look 
at the Canadian content requirements.  For a television program 
to qualify under Canadian content, the producers of that material 
must be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are examples of this government's cultural policy not just 
to protect Canadian culture but to promote it, to ensure that we 
have a viable industry that, as Reform says, can compete anywhere 
in the world.  That is because of this government's policy.  If 
we look at that, we must also look to see what has to be done for 
our cultural sector.  The subcommittee on the MAI and the 
Canadian heritage committee have been listening to what has to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Neil has said in his report that first and foremost Canada 
must take a lead role and try to support the principle of the 
French government which is asking for a full exception. 
Currently the only exception in the MAI text as drafted in 
January 1997 is an exception for national security.  The French 
addendum puts in a principle of cultural exception.   Let us use 
that word clearly, exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also listened to representatives from SOCAN, the society of 
Canadian composers, who came up with a review of different ways 
we could exempt culture.  They came up with a broad definition of 
culture, one that differs from the NAFTA definition.  When we 
consider where we were with culture years ago when NAFTA was 
drafted, we did not have the technology and the art we now have. 
They added words to it. Television and broadcasting are now part 
of it.  The committee looked at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same day we heard from SOCAN, the standing committee on 
heritage also heard from representatives from the Ministry of 
Industry who spoke about the multimedia industry.  They told us 
how our cultural industries account for 25% of the multimedia 
industry.  But that is not a definition in NAFTA.  So the 
committee is listening.  Perhaps the SOCAN exception is not 
sufficient.  We have to continue to consult with heritage, with 
industry as to what the appropriate exceptions should be. Again, 
we are now talking about exceptions but that is not all we have 
to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot get all the other countries to buy into the idea of 
an exception for culture as we have done for national security, 
then there is one other recommendation made by Mr. Neil in his 
report.  If the broad exception is not agreed on, the country 
specific reservations must be unbound and new measures must be 
permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to report that is exactly what the Minister for 
International Trade has stated.  If we are not able to obtain a 
full out exception along the principles of the French exception, 
then Canada will accept nothing less than an unbound country 
specific reservation, the recommendation made by Mr. Neil at the 
Canadian Conference of the Arts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is listening and the committee is recommending the 
principles of SOCAN.  Mr. Keith Kelly, the executive director of 
the Canadian Conference of the Arts, told us to make it 
self-judging and important, protect what is important to 
Canadians.  That is what this government is going to do.  If we 
do sign we will do so only when we have fully protected the 
cultural industries.  We will not sign until we have a definition 
that covers not only the arts and cultural industries of today 
but the arts and cultural industries of tomorrow. 
Only in that way, by continuing with our present cultural policy 
of ensuring Canadian content and creation and the infrastructure 
to support it, only then will we be able to compete abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am rather curious with this very broad exemption the member is 
asking for if it would include such things as telecommunications, 
computer software, television signals, Internet service.  These 
are all things that could be argued as relating to Canadian 
culture.  If that is the case and considering the whole area that 
I have just mentioned is the greatest expansion of investment in 
the world today with satellites and all of the very high level, 
high priced technology, is she not really saying that with that 
broad exception no investment in Canada for anything to do with 
new telecommunications, Internet, satellite or anything else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
very important and relevant question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things with respect to the broadening of the 
definition is if we look at the SOCAN exception it has added 
communications by telecommunication in its definition of cultural 
industries.  I think this is something we are going to have to 
debate as to what are cultural industries.  We cannot predict in 
the future what our new cultural industries will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the NAFTA definition is simply enough. But 
I also take the recommendation made by the Canadian Conference of 
the Arts that one way we can ensure we can protect and promote 
our cultural industries abroad and have them compete in this 
competitive world is by making culture self-judging. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for Parkdale—High Park for 
actually reading into the record some very important facts that 
have been put forward by Garry Neil and also by Keith Kelly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand a great deal about the issues the hon. member is 
talking about and I appreciate her concern about culture in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still very nervous though about wording.  I would like to 
know whether the hon. member thinks it would be a good idea to 
have people like Garry Neil and Keith Kelly, spokespeople for the 
arts, available to actually make a final judgment on whether or 
not we have at the end of the day a cultural carve out which is 
acceptable to them.  How does the hon. member think that could 
happen so that we will not at the end of the day find ourselves 
with something which is absolutely useless for culture in this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think consultation is 
important, absolutely.  One of the recommendations the 
subcommittee made was to support the approach to seek general 
exception, make it self-judging and aggressively pursue an 
alliance with respect to exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I think it is important that we continue to have 
discussions with members of the arts and cultural communities 
which we are doing right now in the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage. This is not something we have put aside to 
just let the subcommittee work with.  The more consultations we 
have the better.  We need to continue this and get into 
partnerships which this government is willing to do with the arts 
and cultural industries in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was on the subcommittee on trade disputes which considered this 
issue with the hon. member.  I know of her concern for the 
cultural and arts sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me a little bit is it seems to me we are talking 
about a big agreement here that has the potential for benefiting 
a lot of sectors. Culture is one of them, but there are a lot of 
sectors that could enjoy more investment.  There are a lot of 
Canadian businesses that are investing outside our country and 
which need the protection this kind of agreement would provide, 
protection for non-discrimination, protection for expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has suggested we should walk away from this unless we 
get this broad self-judging exemption for our cultural industry— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Parkdale—High Park has about 45 seconds to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the minister 
has made it absolutely clear and I support the minister.  If we 
cannot get an acceptable cultural country specific reservation, 
we will walk away from this agreement.

have a protectionist policy. We do not stop those people from 
coming into Canada and investing under our rules and under the 
transparency rules. I invite companies to come and to be part of 
our cultural industries, but not to take them over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Resuming debate. 
Before we do, hon. members, if during the questions and comments 
there seems to be a good interest and a lot of members wanting to 
ask questions, if you would indicate that to me then I will know 
the number of people who want to ask questions. Then we can keep 
the questions and comments quite short so we can get in as many 
people as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for your information I will be sharing my time with my colleague 
from Vancouver Island North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is very proud to have brought this to the floor 
of the House of Commons in the absence of information being 
provided by the Liberals over this very, very important issue. 
The questions of the people of Canada have fundamentally been met 
by silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Winnipeg speaking about the fact that 
members of Parliament had been briefed. Is that not wonderful. 
There are 300 of us. There are 30 million Canadians who would 
like the information, not just 300 members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1997 election the question came up, what is the MAI? 
What is it all about? There was a lot of concerned chagrin on the 
part of many Canadians, myself included, because I did not know 
what the MAI was. All I found out was that it had been under a 
process of negotiation not just for weeks, not just for months, 
but for well over a year and the people of Canada had been 
basically kept in the dark. This has led to a deep concern on the 
part of Canadians as to what this government, indeed what these 
multinational companies are up to.  What is going on behind 
closed doors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Into that vacuum of information we have had the foes of the MAI 
jump. They have jumped in with books. They have jumped in with 
public appearances on radio and television. They have been in 
front of every microphone, and where has the minister been? I do 
not know.  Certainly not in front of a microphone, certainly not 
explaining this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question, what is in it for the foes, what is their 
agenda? I suppose to a certain extent a person could say it makes 
an awful lot of money for public interest groups. They take a 
contrary position to the government and they build it up in some 
kind of a ghost and goblin way, such as the Council of Canadians 
has done.  It makes a lot of money for their cause and keeps 
their people employed. Their attack on this is sometimes blunt 
and forceful and sometimes subtle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in hand a book entitled <I>MAI:  The Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment and the Threat to Canadian 
Sovereignty</I>.  If that is not ghosts and goblins, I do not know 
what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show the subtleness I am referring to, I quote from page 67: 
“While it is doubtful whether foreign based corporations would 
try and use the MAI rules to strike down provincial labour codes 
directly, the new investment treaty would most certainly create a 
more competitive climate, which would put additional pressure on 
governments to weaken parts of the labour codes”. Then they give 
some examples, and they conclude by saying: “These examples show 
that this kind of economic type legislation is increasingly the 
target of attack by big business in this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on here is the foes to the MAI are basically 
having a field day while fundamentally we have silence from the 
government on the other side. It is into this breach that the 
Reform Party jumps, and we jump with information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multilateral agreement on investment is going to be a 
creation of negotiation. It is not a stationary object we can throw 
stones at. It is presently under negotiation. I suggest, as a 
matter of fact I state, that a multilateral agreement on 
investment would be of great benefit to Canada as a trading 
nation and to all the people of Canada who work for the companies 
that are involved in producing the goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the MAI?  Quite simply it is nothing more and nothing 
less than a common set of rules that defines the rights and 
obligations of investors from 29 countries when they invest in 
any of the other 28 countries that are currently negotiating the 
agreement. That is it.  That is what the MAI is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI fundamentally sets out a level playing field.  It 
replaces a mixture, a pot-pourri of overlapping and sometimes 
conflicting investment agreements between all of those countries 
and other countries in the world.  It brings some order to the 
chaos that presently exists between countries in terms of rules 
which subject companies to the rules of governments when they 
make investment in foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that we now have the free trade agreement, 
NAFTA and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is now 
conducted under the World Trade Organization.  All of those 
agreements have sections relating to investment.  We have chaos 
at this particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if we did not sign?  In committee just the 
other day, Mr. Jack Stoddart, the chairman and publisher of 
General Publishing Company, said “It is important because we can 
live within the OECD”—the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development—“without the MAI and that is important because 
many people feel that it is either all or nothing.  You have to 
be in or we will be sort of out in left field.  We have so many 
trade deals, so many trade treaties already with countries we are 
talking about in the 29 countries but, as Mike Harris the skip of 
the Canadian men's curling team said `Well, tomorrow the sun will 
rise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Stoddart then says “Well, if we don't sign this deal the 
sun will rise.  I would suggest however that it is going to be a 
difficult day for the cultural industry if the deal goes through 
the wrong way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we saying here?  There are very large Canadian 
multinational corporations that have investments worldwide.  Just 
to name a few:  Cominco, Noranda, Inco, General Motors.  They all 
have investments worldwide.  If those investments are put into 
jeopardy by a foreign country determining that they are going to 
be treating the Canadian investment in their country in a 
different way to the way in which they are treating their other 
national companies, that effectively means the jobs of tens, 
if not hundreds, of thousands of Canadians presently working in 
Canada have the potential of being in jeopardy because of the 
actions of a foreign nation against a Canadian multinational 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just heard a Liberal across the floor say we will not sign a 
deal unless we get a broad cultural exemption.  Was she saying 
that the jobs and investments in the cultural industry in Canada 
are more important than the jobs and the investment in the large 
companies in Canada that have investments outside of our country? 
Is she pitting one group of workers or one group of investors 
against another saying that if the mythical cultural group is not 
protected, then we are not going to protect anyone?  That is a 
rather shameful way to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the globalization of culture whether we want it or not. 
I heard in committee people from Quebec and people interested in 
the French language in Canada saying that there is an 
encroachment on the Internet and the worldwide web of English 
and English terms are getting in the way of French and thereby 
undermining the French culture in Canada. This is not unique to 
Quebec.  It is not unique to French speaking Canadians anywhere 
in Canada.  This is exactly the complaint that is addressed in 
Russia.  Russia is using an English word for floppy disk.  There 
is nothing like that in its lexicon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that if we go to a broad exception such as has 
been proposed by the Liberals, the U.S. will not sign it. 
Therefore the MAI will not come into effect.  If we go to a broad 
exception, we have not really achieved anything in any event 
because we have not been able to define what is culture and what 
is not culture.  Consequently, we will end up with the same chaos 
we presently have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI will not make or break Canadian culture.  The MAI is a 
part of our arrangement relative to Canadian culture. 
The position of the Reform Party is that it would support 
exceptions as narrow as required and only when necessary for 
specific protection.  This idea of a broad exception, an all 
encompassing exception, is not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that culture should be negotiated at the World Trade 
Organization as a package of culture.  We must negotiate in 
concert with Germany, France, the U.K. and Australia against the 
United States to form an alliance against the United States 
because of its attitude toward the export of its culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI, properly negotiated, will be a powerful tool in the 
hands of Canadian companies and Canadian workers will move ahead 
as a result of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding that all opposition parties would like to have a 
full impact analysis of the MAI.  We also suggest that the MAI be 
subject to a final text which fully protects Canadian culture, 
but not only Canadian culture.  I have heard much about that 
today, but I have not heard about the environment, labour 
standards, health, education and social services at the federal 
and sub-national levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member of the Reform Party feels about issues 
other than culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the impact analysis is 
something which has been recommended, as I understand it, by the 
subcommittee.  The Reform Party is in support of that section of 
its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other areas which the hon. member is asking about are 
presently covered under the NAFTA and we would expect the same 
kind of treatment in those areas.  Otherwise we would end up with 
conflict between the NAFTA and the MAI.  The agreements must be 
negotiated in parallel.  We cannot have two separate agreements 
which relate to the same thing saying different things. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make it unequivocally clear that the multilateral agreement 
among all of the OECD members is not an end in itself.  It is a 
beginning.  The next step would be to go to the World Trade 
Organization and, hopefully, every member of the World Trade 
Organization will abide by the same rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to tell my colleague that our negotiators are not 
going to a round table with other OECD members to discuss our 
cultural industry as an open field.  There are already 
protections under the FTA and the NAFTA for our cultural 
industry.  We want to ensure, as a minimum, that what we have in 
terms of exemptions now under the NAFTA and the free trade 
agreement will continue when we sign the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, what the government is doing, basically, is the 
absolute minimum in a fair game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take my colleague's comments today as an endorsement 
of what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the cultural exemption to 
which the member speaks which exists under the NAFTA is indeed a 
very weak exemption.  It can be countervailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use <I>Sports Illustrated</I> as an example.  I 
realize that <I>Sports Illustrated</I> comes under the WTO, but I 
am using it as an example.  If we are not prepared to comply with 
the findings of a tribunal, the United States could countervail 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> with wood.  The United States could 
countervail movie production with wine making.  The U.S. has a 
whole host of remedies which would go against us on our 
exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It borders on being a myth that we have a cultural exemption 
under the NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the hon. member's comments.  What he said was, if 
you have this unconditional or broad mandated carve-out for 
culture, the Americans will not sign.  Therefore we cannot go 
ahead with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the Reform Party's position is that we will go out with 
some other multilateral partners and make them give us some 
special conditions on culture.  Is the Reform Party's position 
not that if we cannot get our way with this agreement then we 
will cave in to the Americans? Is that not what he said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting to 
hear one's words repeated by somebody who has a different 
interpretation of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted from a newspaper article which I take as being 
authoritative.  U.S. negotiators say that they believe their 
cultural related companies, such as telecommunications and 
computer software firms, would not have as much access to the 
global market if countries were allowed to protect those kinds of 
industries.  With a broad cultural exemption, it is my position 
that this government, particularly under the idea that was 
postulated by the Liberal speaker before me, is that this would 
be self-policing.  We will decide what is going to be included 
and what is not.  Quite frankly, the Yankee trader would be crazy 
to sign such an agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to discuss the multilateral agreement on 
investment today.  This is an official opposition Reform motion 
which is being debated.  I will read it. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for: (1) failing to 
explain why it is negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment (the MAI), (2) failing to explain what benefits and 
costs it foresees for the Canadian people, and (3) failing to 
take part in public discussion on the Agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a significant amount of correspondence on this 
issue.  The main theme in the letters deals with concerns about 
the MAI as posing a threat to our economy, our environment, our 
resources and our social and cultural programs, that it is a 
threat to Canadian sovereignty, and that it would provide new 
avenues for corporations to challenge national, provincial and 
municipal laws.  There were major concerns about what we termed 
roll-back and stand-still provisions of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme seems to be the loss of our Canadian way of life and a 
concern that any exemptions Canada may negotiate may be difficult 
to define and difficult to enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What information do we have regarding the MAI?  We have the 
website which has a draft of the text agreement.  We have the 
exemptions proposed by Canada in November 1997.  We have the 
statements of the minister and we have some parliamentary 
committee proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this information tell us?  The first thing we know is 
that the committee never left Ottawa.  Any concerned Canadians 
from other parts of Canada who appeared before the committee had 
to travel to do so.  Very simply, it is not good enough to only 
consult in Ottawa on an issue of this magnitude.  My position is 
that it is not for the official opposition to do this homework, 
it is for the government.  In the words of one of my constituents 
“if it is so good for the Canadian people and the economy, why 
is it not being debated publicly?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things I looked for in the 52 pages of the 
reservations tabled by the minister in November which are of 
major interest to my constituents in Vancouver Island North.  For 
example, the fisheries exemption.  We have one for fishing, 
harvesting and processing and one for fishing related services 
which deals with port privileges and foreign fishing within our 
200 mile zone.  Critics have stated that if the MAI is signed the 
way it is currently worded, the exemptions do nothing to prevent 
Canadian fishing licenses from being owned by non-Canadians.  If 
this is the case, it is a major change and one that I believe 
Canadians would not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the fisheries exemptions carefully.  They do nothing 
to alleviate my concern that Canadian fishing licenses should be 
reserved for Canadians only.  The standing committee on fisheries 
has invited the Canadian negotiator to attend our committee to 
respond to this and other concerns.  This has not yet occurred. 
There are many things that have not yet occurred on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a standing committee environment meeting two weeks 
ago because the Canadian negotiator was represented at the 
meeting.  He stated that the minister was considering signing a 
letter of intent regarding the MAI at the end of April because 
there would be no final text available at that time.  This is 
highly inappropriate as it takes us further down the road without 
knowing where we are going. 
It is also a dismal negotiating position for a government already 
known as a patsy in international circles.  The minister should 
not sign anything at the end of April.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some concerns about provincial jurisdiction in 
particular from British Columbia and Prince Edward Island.  For 
example, in B.C. the crown owns 95% of the forest land and uses 
the forest as a strong instrument of government policy making. 
Many people involved in the industry as well as government do not 
want this agreement to tie their hands in terms of promoting 
value added British Columbia manufacturing and other initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. has the added complexity of the recent supreme court 
decision on aboriginal land title, the Delgamuuk decision.  The 
current aboriginal affairs exemption is totally inadequate and 
does not cover the eventuality of investor compensation by 
government for ongoing aboriginal land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an obvious shortcoming given that government may 
unavoidably be compelled to transfer assets or deny investment. 
This is a tremendously complex area that can no longer be glossed 
over. Provincial interests have been seriously neglected by the 
federal government on the major issue of aboriginal affairs for a 
long time. The time for Liberal government fudging is over, not 
to be continued with the MAI on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is readily apparent that a major set of consultations with 
stakeholders is required across the country and it has not 
happened.  Canada has further reserved the right to adopt or 
maintain any measures with respect to public law enforcement, 
correctional services, income security, social security, social 
welfare, public education, training, health and child care.  On 
the surface this sounds reasonably sensible.  In addition, there 
are several exemptions for oil and gas, banking and financial 
services and land ownership. The list does not look as 
comprehensive as I would have anticipated given public concerns 
about the environment, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do I have to stack up against these criticisms?  The 
minister is now saying that there is virtually no chance of an 
agreement by April and lots of chance for consultation.  He made 
a speech.  What did he say in his speech?  He said: “Canada will 
not accept any general commitment to freeze the so-called 
standstill or phase out restrictions on foreign investment. 
Canada will retain the flexibility to carry out public policy in 
core areas of national interest.  The MAI would also not force 
Canada to lower its labour or environmental standards.  In fact, 
it is intended to keep other countries from lowering theirs to 
attract investment away from Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said:  “I can tell you what the MAI is not.  It is not 
a charter of rights for multinational companies, nor does it 
spell the end of Canada's sovereignty.  We will retain the right 
to enact laws in all areas, social policy, health care, corporate 
rules, labour and the environment.  We will still be able to 
impose restrictions on foreign investment in sectors like 
culture, health care and education”.  That is what the minister 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did he make this speech?  To the Standing Committee on 
Industry in Ottawa.  It is no wonder Canadians are wondering 
where the minister is who is responsible for the MAI.  The 
question is who is right, the critics or the minister.  Who are 
we to believe and where is the missing dialogue?  Why is the 
government failing to explain to the public why it is negotiating 
the MAI and what the costs and benefits are for the Canadian 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant initiative which is certainly 
deserving of a much greater profile and public consultation than 
the government has given it. I would like to be able to analyse 
the information and come up with a reasoned response as I think 
many Canadians would like to do.  Given what has transpired to 
date, this is impossible and I blame the government.  I am in full 
concurrence with the official opposition motion to condemn the 
government for its lack of proactivity on this issue.  It has had 
the time, the opportunity and the resources, but it simply has 
not had the political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minister's own words:  “My department is consulting 
closely with the provinces, the private sector and 
non-governmental organizations”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will start by commenting on some of the points that were raised 
earlier with respect to this, which will lead up to my question 
for the hon. member for Vancouver Island North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the member for Kootenay—Columbia indicated that the 
government, if I understood him correctly, was pitting one 
industry against another industry.  If I understood him properly 
we should not be protecting broad based Canadian heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very clear message has been sent out today.  If I understood 
the member properly it is that Canadian heritage is on the 
trading block as far as the Reform is concerned.  Absolutely not, 
as far as the government has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member for Vancouver Island North. 
Does he believe we should protect Canadian heritage at all cost, 
even if it were to mean not signing the MAI?  Remember, sir, that 
you are dealing with the very make-up of our country when you are 
questioning this and people are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind all members 
to address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many issues in 
the MAI of which heritage is one.  To wrap oneself in the 
heritage flag and suggest that the Liberal answer is the only 
answer, which is actually a totally unworkable answer, I am not 
going to respond directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will say is in any set of negotiations there are some 
basic issues.  If we do not get what we want we should not sign 
it.  I agree with that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
hearing a few of the speeches by Reform Party members I concluded 
that we are in agreement about the need for an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is one exception.  My colleagues in the Reform 
Party want the government to abandon its fight on behalf of 
cultural industries. I want to say for the record that we will 
not abandon that fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is trying to allude to the fact that certain 
Canadian laws will be affected if we were to sign the 
multilateral agreement.  I want to correct the record.  No 
Canadian laws will be affected as a result of that.  Every 
Canadian law, whether provincial or federal, will continue to be 
in full force after the signing of the multilateral agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to have straight that signing the agreement will not 
cripple the hands of the Canadian government from enacting 
special laws in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member stand and say that he commends what our 
Canadian negotiators are doing at the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that 
government members want to somehow portray themselves as the only 
defenders of Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to take that position he should 
narrowly define what he says and say exactly what he wants.  What 
he has said so far does not cut it.  A broad exemption really 
does not cut it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised some legitimate concerns from a British Columbia 
perspective, from a provincial perspective.  I do not hear anyone 
asking me about those legitimate concerns.  Members will not find 
out about any of them if they sit in Ottawa and only accept input 
in Ottawa. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the member for Vancouver Island North is 
a very straightforward one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the MAI is so important to the Reform Party, why was it that 
the leader of the Reform Party during the last federal election 
did not say one word about the MAI? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we needed to see the 
details when the election campaign was going on.  It is 
interesting that this question should come from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, when I was asked about the MAI, I 
had an opinion.  When the NDP candidate was asked about the MAI, 
he did not know anything about it.  Twenty-four hours later, he 
was totally opposed.  What kind of homework is that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the secretary of state for regional 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat disappointed in the motion as it fails to move the 
debate off this eternal merry-go-round.  It is in distinct 
contrast with the participation of the Reform Party in committee 
and its helpful contributions to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to refer to the committee's minority 
report as it was written in the larger report.  I take the Reform 
Party at its word when it says that it is a free trade party and 
supports Canada's participation in the construction of a 
multilateral agreement on investment.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is a free trade party that supports liberalized 
trade and investment.  We thus support the MAI initiative at the 
OECD subject to the concerns we have outlined on labour and 
multinational standards and culture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having stated its position as supportive of the government's 
initiative, I propose to turn to two of its criticisms in the 
time allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I highlight these in contrast to the motion which seems to be 
highly critical of the government.  I characterize its critique 
as one of nuance rather than adamant opposition, as one with 
which reasonable people might disagree but one which is 
characterized by a broader sense of agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party states in its minority report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We endorse most of the recommendations contained in the 
subcommittee's study of the multilateral agreement on investment 
with the exception of the one on labour and multinational 
standards and the one that has a broad exemption for culture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to those two exemptions and ask whether Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition is giving the government good advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from a great variety of sources with respect to 
cultural exemption.  It has a variety of names, a cultural 
carve-out, cultural exemption, sectoral exemption, et cetera. The 
argument is that the agreement will severely limit Canada's 
ability to foster indigenous culture and Canada's voice.  Some of 
the rhetoric borders on paranoia and uses silly language like 
NAFTA on steroids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, to its credit, is a bit more nuanced in its 
critique.  For those of us who sat in on some of the testimony it 
became quite clear very quickly that not all cultural industries 
are created equal.  Writers and artists dependent upon grants 
from government and other sources appeal to a limited audience or 
are just starting to feel the need for some protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural industries that are capital intensive and have a degree 
of mass cultural appeal need access to large, international 
markets and international capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's film and television production industry increasingly 
depends on foreign markets.  Peter Lyman of the Nordicity group 
pointed out the importance of foreign trade and investment from a 
Canadian perspective.  Foreign financing and foreign revenues 
contribute about $600 million to Canadian film and television 
production. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of CanWest Global was given as a Canadian firm that 
gets tens of millions of dollars in revenues from its foreign 
investments in Australia and New Zealand, which strengthens its 
ability to finance traders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To state that all cultural industries are created equal is not 
consistent with the testimony of the witnesses.  Clearly quite a 
number feel the need for protection, but there is also a number 
who feel that the protection of an MAI carve-out may be a serious 
detriment to their eventual success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's position is that if the protection of culture 
must exist it should be drawn as clearly and narrowly as 
possible. 
In fact it would prefer a cultural policy which does not put 
stressful artists and companies at risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the view that when the minister negotiates the final 
working agreement he should be very specific as to what culture, 
for the purpose of the agreement, means.  This is not an 
abandonment of culture.  I believe that this is the direction the 
government is going.  It is one which is desirable and has broad 
support within the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area of dissent is on labour and multinational 
standards.  The Reform Party's position in the minority report 
is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Reform Party fully supports the labour standards at 
issue—the right to organize democratically, bargain collectively 
and strike peacefully in the absence of discrimination—we cannot 
support thrusting these standards on to other countries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Reform Party is wrong for two reasons.  It is 
missing an opportunity to develop a practice of raising 
international standards.  Many of the countries with which Canada 
is negotiating have labour standards and practices which are 
appallingly low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of countries that are party to these negotiations 
routinely exploit their labour force.  In some respects it is an 
ideal time to try to raise labour standards rather than let them 
slip off the table as the Reform Party advocates.  The argument 
which has the direct or indirect effect of raising standards 
needs to be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason I think the clause needs to be included is to 
level the playing field.  I would much prefer that other 
countries bring their treatment of workers up to our standards, 
rather than the reverse.  If we miss the opportunity to raise the 
standards for other countries, our own competitiveness will be 
eroded and therefore defeat what we hope to obtain from the 
agreement, namely the ability to sell into other countries 
without exploiting our labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is an opportunity to enhance the lot of workers 
around the world and to provide a measure of dignity to all.  No 
country including our own should be put in the position of having 
to exploit its own labour force to obtain a measure of 
prosperity.  At its root, raising worldwide labour standards is 
enlightened self-interest and one which the minister should 
pursue with vigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Reform Party has a useful contribution to 
debate.  It is my view that it is a more nuanced approach to the 
cultural exemption and one which needs to be examined.  However, 
on the issue of labour and multinational standards, Reform is 
clearly wrong and cannot be supported.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is interesting to hear so much talk about the Reform Party's 
dissenting opinion.  I guess it must have struck a nerve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, though, that there was some talk about 
international markets in terms of culture.  We know there are 
about $700 million of investment in our Canadian cultural 
industries from countries such as Australia.  If we decide to go 
the protectionist route, two can play that game.  Other countries 
can play that game as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put broad cultural exemptions on instead of defining 
narrowly exactly what we need, how will that serve our interests 
with countries such as Australia which are investing in Canada? 
Would that not cut off some of the investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the so-called threat to Canadian culture seems to be 
coming from the United States.  We already have the NAFTA with a 
so-called cultural exemption which says that we can have 
retaliation and equivalent effect.  It would be pretty tough to 
get a weaker exemption than that.  That will remain in place 
whether or not we sign the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member see the MAI destroying the cultural 
exemption which is already in place under the NAFTA?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is that I 
do not.  The issue is the form of cultural industry which appears 
to be in need of protection.  I believe the minister is in the 
process of negotiating that form of cultural protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue really is to equally access and have a level playing 
field with respect to those industries which have either mass 
appeal or that need large capitalization.  In this way we can 
have our cake and eat it too.  Those industries which do not 
require that protection will not have it in the agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it unfortunate that some Liberals choose to say that the 
Reform Party is not out to protect Canadian culture.  It is quite 
the contrary.  The Reform Party recognizes that Canadian culture 
is a very valuable commodity to this country but cannot be 
protected with a broad instrument such as they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A quote in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on February 17 from Paris 
reads “Scores of French writers, film-makers and composers 
joined forces yesterday in Paris to defend their government 
cultural subsidies against the threat posed by a new global 
investment pact.  They fear it will undermine its cultural 
identity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection goes both ways.  French-speaking people who want to 
export Canadian culture will be stopped at the border of France 
if the MAI is under a broad cultural exemption.  If that is what 
we want and what France has asked for, we will have a wonderful 
little fortress with our Canadian culture with a great big wall 
around it because we cannot get it out in spite of the fact that 
Canadians and Canadian artists are world class people.  We want 
to give them the opportunity to be able to export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat disappointed 
in the member opposite in that it appears he has missed my major 
point.  I will repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major point is that the industries which feel they are in 
need of protection will obtain protection from this agreement. 
However, those cultural industries which are not in need of 
protection, such as the CanWest and Nordicitys in this world, 
will not necessarily obtain it in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simple:  We will have our cake and eat it too.  That 
is the essence of good negotiations and good agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a very simple question.  What the hon. member 
is saying is very good but he has heard some good comments from 
this side.  The hon. member is a fair member and has been around 
for a while.  Does he agree that this debate should come back to 
this House for a full debate by all members of Parliament and 
voted on so that all Canadians understand fully what the 
agreement is going to be about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister has already 
said that and answered that question fully.  It is an agreement 
of this country and goes through the normal parliamentary 
process.  I do not know why the member needs to be concerned 
about that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development—Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
rise today on behalf of the government to speak to such a delicate 
and important matter as the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, the MAI is a fundamental agreement with regard to 
what we are as a society, not only in social terms but also in 
terms of economic development.  On the subject of economic 
development, I would point out that Canada is a leader around the 
world.  It is also a leader in the establishment and advancement of 
multilateral processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vitality of our economic component speaks eloquently of 
our international interventions.  Canada, whose foreign trade 
represents over 40% of GDP, is one of the biggest trading nations 
in the world in terms of the figures involved.  This figure is the 
highest of that of any of the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, Canada's favourable trade balance increased from $7 
billion in 1991 to $41 billion in 1996.  So this agreement on 
investment is very important for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said we were and still are leaders in this area.  In this 
regard, we could perhaps look back and consider the first free 
trade agreements.  We could even consider the notion of free trade. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be recalled that the first discussions on free trade, 
on liberalization, date back to the turn of the century, with the 
first Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, 
Wilfred Laurier.  Then, in the aftermath of the second world war, 
there was as we know a surge in globalization. Certain structures 
were put into place, leading to the creation of the World Trade 
Organization or WTO, which started out as GATT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the purpose of the WTO is to regulate 
international trade, to make sure that the rules of the game, so to 
speak, are respected. 
It is increasingly evident now as we speak that economies are no 
longer strictly national, that they are subject to international 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phenomenon of globalization is gaining strength. 
Obviously, even if the WTO is doing a good job with trade 
regulation and liberalization, through its own framework and 
through the various bilateral and multilateral trade agreements 
that may been signed, in this era of globalization there are other 
elements that must be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
represents another important element. 
It is one we must have at any price, if Canadian companies are to 
enjoy more freedom on the international scene, to be able to invest 
more readily and more confidently, and consequently to ensure that 
the Canadian economy prospers and that we are able to continue to 
hold our own and to create quality jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are against this agreement decry the fact that the 
negotiations took place behind closed doors.  I think that those 
who say that are trying to mislead people.  As a government, we 
announced the start of negotiations with the other countries 
involved in the discussions on May 24, 1995, three years ago. 
Since then our government and all the other governments involved 
have indicated their intention to reach an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague responsible for International Trade has also 
been working extremely hard with parliamentarians in order to 
develop a position that is strictly Canadian and will open up 
markets, while respecting our strictly Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I must refer to the three guiding 
principles underlying these discussions.  The first element is that 
this is a totally open process, not a secret one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the goal is to provide a framework for what, in this 
era of globalization, is termed international investment, to 
provide rules, standards, that will offer some security to 
businesses with an eye to development on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we as a government will be signing an agreement that 
will respect the principles of Canadian society, that will respect 
our society's interests, and that will have job creation as its 
ultimate goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a closer scrutiny of the MAI shows that this is, 
essentially, an agreement which will provide businesses with a 
framework and, in some cases, will create regulations such as those 
already in place within the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI will consist of a number of elements, three of which 
we would classify as fundamental.  First, there is the question of 
the rule of expropriation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1755

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is self-evident that this is a fundamental rule, and must 
not be interpreted in such a way as to end up as a kind of hobble, 
if I may use that word, to our role as a government to regulate and 
legislate in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague responsible for international trade is perfectly 
aware of the importance of defining the terms “expropriation”, 
“legislation” and “national regulation”.  He is aware too, because 
it works both ways, of the importance of those definitions for our 
companies when they wish to establish an international presence and 
when they invest in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second important element is the protection of our freedom 
of action in areas that may be found at the very heart of Canadian 
society.  We obviously are referring to health care, social 
programs, education, culture and programs for native peoples and 
minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element is the status quo.  In other words, it means 
that we will not accept any restriction in the areas indicated of 
the freedom of action we currently enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are told by our negotiators in Paris— 
since everything is happening in Paris under the aegis of the OECD 
—that negotiations are going well and we may reasonably expect to 
reach an agreement that honours the points I have just mentioned 
and the nature of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if we leave things in the hands of time and 
the fine team of negotiators we have and with my colleague, the 
Minister for International Trade, we will reach an agreement that 
can only benefit Canadian society and all Canadian industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before any multilateral agreement is agreed upon by the Canadian 
government, would this member favour this issue coming back to 
the House of Commons for debate?  Would he favour allowing time 
for us to consult with our constituents, having a full debate in 
the House of Commons and voting upon it here in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my 
speech, the negotiations with regard to this agreement were 
announced three years ago.  It is a custom with international 
agreements that negotiations are carried out on a sort of 
confidential basis.  The member states involved in the 
negotiation of the agreement are discussing the issues among 
themselves.  At the end of the process, they will reveal to their 
populations the contents of the agreement.  The negotiations are 
underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this government is concerned and as far as my 
colleague, the Minister for International Trade has been 
involved, we have been very open minded.  We want to be sure of 
the principles in this agreement.  At the end of the day if we 
decide to sign this agreement it will be because we have found 
some Canadian principles enshrined in the agreement.  We will 
make sure those Canadian principles are good for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  We need some relevance here.  I asked 
the question of whether the government would bring this issue 
back to the House for a vote in the House of Commons.  I want an 
answer to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In the opinion of 
the Chair, the hon. parliamentary secretary was on topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a

way with the other countries are very important for our country's 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not hold public hearings and allow a parliamentary 
committee to travel across the country?  This matter is so 
important for Canadians as a whole.  It is democratic to hold 
public hearings, to discover the opinions of Canadians across the 
country.  Why not do that?  It is a democratic thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second question.  There is a provision in the 
agreement that concerns me a great deal; it says that, should 
Canada sign the agreement, there would be no review for 20 years. 
Does the parliamentary secretary agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the subject of 
consultation, I think my colleague for international trade was 
quite eloquent in his remarks on the government's consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out, the agreement is essentially still under 
negotiation among the parties to the round table, and, as I 
mentioned earlier, under the aegis of the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second question, since the agreement is still being 
negotiated and has not yet been ratified, the question is a 
hypothetical one I cannot answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when this negotiation is complete and the Government 
of Canada has made up its mind to sign on, will it bring it back 
to the House of Commons for a full debate of this House of 
Commons and a vote by all members of this House of Commons, yes 
or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, how many seconds do I 
have?  A minute. It is pretty amazing to see that the hon. member 
comes back with what I would call with all due respect a 
hypothetical question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the negotiations are still under way. All the member 
states are still involved in the negotiation process.  I would 
like to remind my colleague from the Reform Party that Canadians 
supported this government in the last election. They trust this 
government.  The people of Canada know that my colleague 
responsible for this department is taking care of our Canadian 
principles. Let us give the negotiation process a chance and we 
will see afterward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have seen in this last speaker and this last exchange between the 
opposition parties and the government exactly why this motion is 
before the House today. It was brought forward by the Reform 
Party not because we are not in favour of multilateral 
agreements, not because we are afraid of free trade, not because 
we do not think Canadians can compete, but because when this deal 
is done, it should be debated and discussed and voted on by the 
people Canada through their representatives here in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is not done, is it any wonder that Canadians spend 
their time now in town hall meetings looking at one another 
wistfully saying “Has anybody heard anything about the MAI? Has 
anybody got a clue on the government side what this is all 
about?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious.  Three times now, many times during the day but 
certainly in this last go around here, there has been a point 
blank question, when this deal is completed, will the government 
bring it back to the House for debate and a vote. Then the hon. 
member from the Liberal side stands up and asks how long he has 
to answer that question. Is it yes or no? It reminds me of the 
famous quote by Winston Churchill that it is the people who 
control the government.  Not the government, the people. That is 
what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on that side of the House seem to think it is a good 
idea for the government to control the people. Is it any wonder 
that in the upcoming byelection in Port Moody—Coquitlam, Lou 
Sekora, now the new found Liberal messiah, will come into the Port 
Moody—Coquitlam riding and says “This is an excellent 
opportunity for me to represent you in Ottawa”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is he actually up against?  Maybe he does not know. I do 
not know Lou Sekora, maybe he just does not know. Maybe he thinks 
he is going to run it like his mayor's chair. But he is up 
against the backroom boys. He is up against the smoky backrooms, 
the cooked up deal presented to the Canadian people as a fait 
accompli.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all told to accept it like good little boys and girls. 
When the Liberals are finished concocting this thing in whatever 
format it might have, we are told to just accept it.  Although 
for some reason we are not at the level to understand the deal, 
we have to accept it because the father Liberals will tell us it 
is okay. It is the ultimate in Ottawa sending a message to Port 
Moody—Coquitlam, British Columbia saying “We know what is best 
for you. Do not ask any questions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lou Sekora is going to find out in spades that is what he is up 
against within the Liberal caucus. Do not ask a question. Do not 
ruffle any feathers.  Do not rock the boat.  Just accept and then 
sell the completed deal back in our ridings. Do not for heaven's 
sake debate it here in the House of Commons.  That is what he is 
up against. That is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad because this debate should be about the MAI.  Even 
given the Liberals' reluctance to discuss this, we have learned 
more from the government side today about the MAI, the process 
and what they are up to than we have learned in the last two and 
a half years. It is too bad the minister got so partisan.  If he 
had just answered the questions we would have learned quite a bit 
more about this deal than we have learned so far through the 
newspapers, through the rumour mill, through the wild imaginings 
of Maude Barlow and her crowd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad because this debate really is about a very 
important subject for all Canadians. Free trade is important for 
Canadians if it is done right.  Multilateral agreements on 
investment could be a good thing for Canada if they are done 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem, and the reason this motion is before the House 
today, is that the government has not done it right.  The process 
has been wrong. The process is flawed.  The government has been 
very secretive.  This secret in the government reminds me of an 
abscessed tooth.  It just sits there and bothers you, it grates 
at you, antagonizes you and sticks the needle into you. It is a 
secret.  A constituent, a voter wants to know what it is about 
and somebody says “No, no.  It is a secret.  You can't know”. 
His jaw starts to ache. “What is it about those guys that is 
causing this bunion on my gums? What is it that is forcing me to 
feel so aggravated?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the secrecy.  They say, “You guys cannot know because you 
are only the voters, you are only the business people and you are 
only the constituents who have to live with the deal.  Why should 
you have to know about it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am kind of partial to knowing what is going on in the country, 
and not just because I am a member of Parliament.  I have to live 
here too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder constituents are looking for answers.  They are not 
getting them. That is secret, it is abscessing, it is getting 
worse and it is causing this government a lot of damage on the 
MAI because it has not been forthcoming with what should be going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we said in the Reform Party?  Our trade critic has 
amply and adequately described it throughout the day during his 
questions and answers.  Let me run through the principles that 
should be guiding this.  What should be guiding it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Openness in all multilateral agreements.  Let us be open about 
it and allow debate.  Let us allow votes.  Let us allow 
discussion in a public forum, and this certainly is the most 
public of forums. Lots of information explaining the costs and 
the benefits of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said before that an MAI could be a good thing for Canada.  I 
think it should be a good thing for Canada. We need foreign 
investment.  In turn we need to invest in other countries and so 
on.  That could be and should be a good deal for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is public consultation.  The minister's idea of public 
consultation with British Columbia at least is to hold a meeting 
at the Chateau Laurier in the British Columbia room.  He thinks 
that you just throw the doors open in the Chateau Laurier, where 
of course all the British Columbians are known to wait in the 
morning to talk to the minister, you crawl down to the British 
Columbia room, you throw the buffet open and say “They have been 
consulted.  The B.C. room was wide open.  All of the British 
Columbians that could pour into that room on short notice were 
welcome to attend”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not consultation.  That is more of that niggling little 
pointy part the dentist uses to get right into the filling.  That 
is the part that just says “Gee, you guys in B.C., why not take 
that.  How do you like that?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who could not come to the British Columbia room at 
the Chateau Laurier are back in my province of British Columbia 
saying “I don't know what they are doing down there. 
They will not tell me what they are doing.  They will not discuss 
it.  They will not debate it.  They will not vote on it when it 
comes to conclusion.  They will not have a discussion in the 
House of Commons by the representatives we sent there”. Instead, 
the six Liberal yes men and women they have in British Columbia 
come here and say “Well, let me just get that needle again and 
see if I can get it under the tooth and see if I can make you 
more comfortable”.  I think not. It is too bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Lou Sekora has trouble counting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with a couple of comments that came from the minister 
of trade when he was in opposition.  This is what he said about 
NAFTA.  NAFTA is a very similar type of agreement as the MAI, we 
think, although we cannot know because they will not tell us. 
This is what he said about NAFTA: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without any information and with the results clear as day on the 
free trade agreement, Canadians can only respond with a certain 
amount of genuine fear for themselves and their nation. 
</UL>
<That is what he said in 1992 about the NAFTA agreement.  He went 
on to say in <I>Hansard</I> on March  24, 1992, in opposition that 
Canadians must be part of the equation. I guess that means at the 
British Columbia room at the Chateau Laurier: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must be part of the equation.  They cannot be told at 
the end this is good for them.  Canadians must decide for 
themselves, in conjunction with the Parliament, what is good for 
themselves, their children and the future of the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this motion of ours is about today.  Sure we 
condemn the government.  Sure we say that it has mishandled this 
file. The reason is obvious.  Canadians have said this secrecy, 
this way of giving us the fait accompli at the end of the process 
is not the way to negotiate international agreements and expect 
the Canadian people to buy into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem.  The toothache, the secrecy, goes on too 
often, too long and the debates here are simply a rubber stamp 
instead of a meaningful debate and a meaningful vote. That should 
change.  This motion is to address that issue and try to get the 
debate on the MAI at least started because the government has 
failed at every step of the way in having meaningful debate on 
the MAI, one of the most important agreements ever to face this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a very serious question for the member opposite.  I too believe 
it is important to have discussions in ridings across this 
country.  I am having a town hall meeting on the multilateral 
agreement on investment, an open forum, publicized in newspapers, 
as are many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for this member who speaks so sanctimoniously about 
how terrible it is to invite people to Ottawa is why has he as 
the whip of his party not spoken to Grant Hill?  The health 
committee of this House of Commons wants to travel on the issue 
of natural products and substances.  We had a proposal that was 
approved by the Board of Internal Economy and only because your 
member refused we were able to travel the country to 
listen to the views and concerns of people in Vancouver, 
Winnipeg, Halifax and other parts of this country where the 
committee wanted to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, who is the whip of his party, why has he not 
spoken to Grant Hill and given— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members, a 
couple of things.  Before we give the member for Fraser Valley an 
opportunity to respond, we do not refer to other members by name 
in the House.  Also, the Chair cannot recognize members unless 
they are in their place.  A 50 second response, the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what to say 
to the hon. member.  I do not know why she is trying to divert 
this debate on to natural products.  It was her health minister 
who started the whole fracas on the natural food products.  It 
was her minister who tried to stymie people who wanted to get 
access to natural products.  It was her minister that put the 
health police against the health inspector. But I do not want to 
get excited about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, I just want to say again that the opportunity to debate 
in public forums has to be done across the country on all kinds 
of issues.  If the member wants to talk about natural products, 
we can get off on that tangent but I am unwilling to at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI should be discussed in public forums.  When it is 
finally discussed and negotiated, then the final debate, the 
final public consultation happens here in the House of Commons 
and a vote to ratify it takes place in this House.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the minister in December drew attention to the fact 
that yet another report graphically portrayed the tragedy of a 
million and a half Canadian children living in poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been too many reports from the Canadian Association 
of Food Banks, the Canadian Council on Social Development, 
Campaign 2000 and others.  All of these reports point to the same 
thing, that the Liberal government has failed to address poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the situation is much worse than when this House passed 
a resolution unanimously in 1989 to eliminate child poverty by 
the year 2000. The only thing that the Liberal government has 
offered and has announced about four times is the national child 
tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even the child tax benefit is woefully inadequate.  The $850 
million promised for the child tax benefit will not in any way 
compensate for the regressive policies of the Liberal government, 
nor the cutbacks in funding for social assistance of 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the benefit has been proposed, people on welfare will receive 
no additional funds.  While the funds will initially be 
distributed to every child below a specified income level, 
provincial governments will deduct that amount from current 
welfare payments. This means that welfare poor children and their 
families will gain absolutely nothing from the government plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite government assurances that no child will be worse off 
under the plan, anti-poverty activists have real concerns 
regarding the implications and the messages that this segregation 
of working poor from welfare poor entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a commitment to a comprehensive anti-poverty agenda, the 
national child benefit is a band-aid solution that actually acts 
to depress wages and further marginalize poor people. Children 
are poor because their parents are poor.  Eliminating child and 
family poverty will require a comprehensive strategy that must 
include other essentials such as job creation, housing, child 
care, training and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of affordable child care is a particular concern 
because the benefit is structured to push low income mothers into 
the workforce without providing funding for quality child care 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has consistently put child care on the 
back burner despite promises to the contrary.  There is no 
discussion and no plans that we have seen about strengthening 
child care as a complement to the child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on the government to review its child tax benefit and to 
acknowledge and recognize that this benefit is woefully 
inadequate and will not in any way compensate or substitute for 
the cutbacks that we have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is committed to eliminating poverty in this 
country and helping poor children and their families, then we 
must at the very least ensure that this child tax benefit has 
adequate funds, is fully indexed and also applies to families on 
welfare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not 
the first time but the second time in the last week that I have 
been asked to speak on behalf of the government as it relates to 
child poverty based on a question that the member from Vancouver 
East has asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite frankly appalled that the member continues to suggest 
that this government and in fact all governments in Canada do not 
think that child poverty is a priority.  Two years ago this June 
governments of all persuasions, not only Liberal, Conservative 
but in fact NDP governments, came together at a premiers' 
conference, with the Prime Minister chairing that particular 
conference, and made it very clear that the number one priority 
of Canadians was child poverty and that we would put in place in 
a partnership kind of scenario, certain programs that would help 
children and, of course, help their families at the same time.

that this generation has ever seen.  I cannot for the life of me 
understand why this member continues to suggest that not just 
this government but all governments are not committed to this 
very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize that this particular question is one which we 
have taken very seriously.  The Campaign 2000 organization, which 
we all know, of course, is not a Conservative think tank, has 
said this is the first time that both levels of government have 
acknowledged the need for a plan to jointly address child 
poverty.  I again emphasize a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, of course there are problems.  We are working toward it. We 
are going to put programs in place and we will see them roll out 
as that plan starts to unfold in the weeks and months and years 
to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on this 
motion to adjourn, when we know that tomorrow is an important day, 
budget day.  On the eve of the budget, I think it is appropriate 
for two opposition MPs to raise the issue of the battle against 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what this government may say, the present situation in 
Canada is far from rosy in this connection. 
Poverty is increasing, and as I asked on November 25, 1997, of all 
those billions that are surplus in the employment insurance fund, 
is there not some way the government could make a special effort to 
get some of it back into the pockets of the unemployed during the 
time they are without work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us never lose sight of the fact that, when there is talk 
of child poverty, it is very rare for poor children not to have 
poor parents, and the most important issue is to ensure that 
parents have enough money to live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the employment insurance program can be self-financing 
and make an acceptable surplus with premiums of $2 per $100 of insurable 
earnings, as compared to the current rate of $2.70 per $100. Could the 
government not provide in tomorrow's budget for a reasonable premium 
reduction and use part of the 70 cents difference to improve the quality 
of life of those who find themselves without work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that not be a good way for the government to really fight 
poverty with the main tool at its disposal, namely the EI fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I wanted to make about the November 25, 1997 question 
is this. The minister's response at the time was “We are following this 
reform very closely”. 
He was referring to the tabling, early in 1998, of a report evaluating 
the reform for 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was tabled last week or the week before, and it does not 
contain any recommendation. On the one hand, the minister claims to be 
following the reform closely and promises that, if changes are needed, 
they will put everything on the table, but on the other hand, he tables 
a report for the entire year 1997, which does not include a single 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister decide to leave evaluation of the reform up 
to people who are capable of making concrete, short-term 
recommendations to him, because those now covered by the Employment 
Insurance Act, who are watching their benefits shrink and the 
number of weeks dwindle, or who are not eligible for benefits at 
all, cannot wait for the 1999 report, which will tell us that in 
1998 they have still not managed to find the figures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of all the parties on the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities 
would certainly be able to come up with all kinds of examples and 
amendments to the act in order to make it more humane as quickly as 
possible, and ensure an acceptable minimum income for all 
unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government take the opportunity offered by tomorrow's 
budget to put solutions on the table and finally ensure that its 
reform is fair?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must admit 
that I find it very humorous.  Those of us who were in this House 
in the last Parliament debated the EI changes in a very 
significant way. 
The committee—and my colleague from Malpeque was there—spent a 
lot of time talking about what the changes would mean.  Of course 
when we implement changes of this magnitude, the largest changes 
in the last 25 years, there is going to be a period of 
adjustment.  There will be a time when there are some unknowns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation we committed ourselves to five separate 
reports, to monitor the system as it unfolds before Canadians to 
see if it has the right kind of effect on workers, if it has the 
right kind of effect on training and if it has the right 
component of insurance.  There are both passive and active 
measures.  This legislation is different from what we saw in the 
previous unemployment insurance legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first monitoring report which was tabled in Parliament last 
month obviously suggested very strongly that it was a preliminary 
report.  Most of the information which the hon. member talked 
about cannot be forthcoming from the new legislation because it 
has just been implemented.  We cannot get the data because people 
have not been under the new system long enough for us to make a 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that member and other members opposite are doing is 
basically playing with rhetoric, with words, because until we see 
the second, third, fourth and fifth monitoring reports and get 
the real data we will not be able to make a factual analysis of 
whether in fact the new EI changes are working or not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make this very clear.  The commitment of the 
government is very clear on this issue.  If there is a need for 
changes, if the monitoring shows that there are certain areas 
which are not working properly and require modification, this 
government is prepared to make those changes.  That is the 
obligation and the commitment of this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question originally had to do with the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and the military in Haiti.  I would like to tell 
the House right off the bat that this question has absolutely 
nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the safety 
of the RCMP members stationed there on the peacekeeping mission. 
Actually, I believe that it is now a training mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the two areas we were dealing with after the 
military left had to do with the physical safety of members of 
the RCMP as they carried out their training duties and their work 
with the local police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Haiti is a relatively unstable country.  It is still working out 
its democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of recent events come to mind.  For example, a police 
chief was reportedly killed in the area with a machete. 
Apparently he was beheaded.  That indicates that the level of 
violence to which I am referring is present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of my question and at the time of committee meetings 
on the RCMP superannuation act, one of the assistant 
commissioners stated that the RCMP did have some concerns and 
that they were sending a medical officer to Haiti to look into 
the situation and ensure that members of the force were being 
properly taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member of the RCMP is injured we want to ensure that they 
have the care required, similar to what they would receive in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the parliamentary secretary is twofold.  Are the 
members of the RCMP in Haiti sufficiently safe in their duties, 
having due regard to the local situation?  This also includes 
other countries which might have military support in Haiti. 
Second, if a member of the RCMP is injured, either slightly or 
seriously, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that there 
will be adequate care given to that member?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very proud of the quality of the people who were sent to 
Haiti by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and with the way they 
co-operate and work as part of the full team with Canadian armed 
forces personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had a large number of people serve in Haiti and the

tour because of their excellent instruction and the models they 
have presented to the Haitian police.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the numbers of people who were there, we had 650 
Canadian forces personnel and more than 50 members of the 
Canadian civilian police, mainly the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police.  When we left we did leave some protection.  We left the 
Bisons, the armoured personnel carriers, so that when they 
paroled they would not be fully exposed.  They would give them 
protection while patrolling from one town to another or within 
the cities of Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main accomplishment of the military components was to 
establish some form of stability.  It was not perfect when we 
left but it will take a long time before we ever get the Haitians 
to conform to the kinds of patterns that we would like to see. 
The modelling was never there.  The kinds of rules and respect 
for the rule of law were not instilled in the civilian 
population.  As a consequence, our police and our soldiers going 
in as peacekeepers had to play a lot of it as they saw it and use 
common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They performed indispensable functions in monitoring and 
training national police forces.  They played a major role 
through the assistance of local police forces in restoring civil 
order and contributing to the building of confidence and security 
between the parties and the local populations.  That was what the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the 46 members of the police force there we have not had a 
major incident.  They have looked after themselves well and have

<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to focus my attention this evening on the 
government's failed strategy of quiet diplomacy to resolve the 
Pacific salmon treaty dispute and the recent resignation of 
Canada's tough talking and well respected chief negotiator, Yves 
Fortier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the dispute, Mr. Fortier has forcefully and 
eloquently articulated the concerns of Canadian fishermen.  He 
has asserted three points over and over again which the Prime 
Minister and the minister of fisheries have failed to listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier's three points were that the Americans were 
overfishing Canadian salmon stocks which violates the equity 
principle of the treaty, that the Canada-U.S. stakeholder process 
is doomed to fail because U.S. states and Indian or aboriginal 
tribes have no interest in agreeing in a reduction of a catch of 
Canadian bound salmon, and that the U.S. and Canadian governments 
must resolve the dispute at the senior political level, a 
tete-a-tete between the Prime Minister and president.  It is time 
to call in the so-called <I>A</I> team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of special envoys Ruckelshaus and Strangway backs Mr. 
Fortier on these three points.  Why did Mr. Fortier resign if the 
Ruckelshaus-Strangway report vindicated everything that he had 
been saying for the past four years as Canada's chief negotiator? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter of resignation, Mr. Fortier outlined two paths the 
Canadian government could take to resolve the dispute.  Ottawa 
could demand international arbitration and lobby Washington 
vigorously to impose a compromise on U.S. stakeholders, or Ottawa 
could weaken its demands and essentially sell out the fishermen 
to calm the waters between Ottawa and Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true that Mr. Fortier resigned because Ottawa decided on 
the second path, to sacrifice Canadian fishermen for the sake of 
warmer relations with Washington? Rumours are circulating on the 
west coast that the U.S. state department refused to continue 
negotiations if Mr. Fortier remained as Canada's chief 
negotiator.  Could the minister confirm that the state department 
did ask for Mr. Fortier's resignation and, if it did, why did the 
Canadian government capitulate to American demands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian government calms the waters between Ottawa and 
Washington through quiet diplomacy, a storm is brewing off the 
B.C. coast.  This summer the estimated average catch will only be 
50 to 100 sockeye per boat on the north coast.  There is also a 
major crisis with Skeena River coho, stocks that the Alaskans 
have been overfishing for years.  There is a desperate situation 
developing in the B.C. coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister demand that President Clinton sit 
down to resolve the dispute?  When will the government assert 
itself to protect the interests of Canadian fishermen and demand 
that the Americans put conservation first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer the minister of fisheries talked of quiet diplomacy, 
that he could do nothing to stop American fishing except talk 
nice.  As a result Canadian fishermen became desperate, backed 
into a corner by Alaskan overfishing and disastrous federal 
fishing policies that have left many almost bankrupt. 
These fishermen then engaged in some gumboot diplomacy of their 
own, blockading the U.S. ferry <I>Malaspina</I> to stop the 
overfishing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government learn that selling out Canadian 
fishermen to placate Washington will only cause more conflict and 
more pain for B.C. coastal communities and salmon fishermen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister find the backbone to stand up to 
President Clinton and demand his country live up to its 
obligations under the international treaty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised 
by some of the comments of the member opposite.  He should know 
full well that the government is standing behind B.C. fishermen 
in their quest for a settlement.  However I am little surprised 
by the slant he is taking in terms of being very selective in the 
points he picked out of Mr. Fortier's letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Read in its entirety, however, the letter is a clear description 
of the history of the Pacific salmon dispute and what needs to be 
done in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the letter Mr. Fortier's sense of dedication and 
commitment shine through.  After five years as chief negotiator 
on this difficult issue, it is not surprising that he expresses 
frustration with past experiences.  Unfortunately those 
statements have been taken out of context.  It is important to 
quote some of the other statements made in Mr. Fortier's letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He describes Canada's position in past negotiations as “clear 
and forceful yet flexible and fair” and Canadian demands as 
“valid, justified, reasonable and practicable”.  He describes 
how Canada only agreed to a stakeholder process after negotiating 
a formal framework which required a commitment by the United 
States to resolve through government to government negotiations 
all issues left unresolved by stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier refers to this as “another significant victory for 
Canada, one that afforded us certain opportunities”.  It is 
those opportunities that the Government of Canada now hopes to 
capitalize on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier describes the Ruckelshaus-Strangway report as “the 
most recent positive development for Canada”.  He states that we 
have made progress and the government has been provided the tools 
with which to achieve the benefits that are its due under the 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally it should be pointed out that the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are now leading 
consultations aimed at developing an effective negotiating 
process.  The Government of Canada intends to stand behind B.C. 
fisherman and ensure that there is a negotiated settlement to 
this process.
