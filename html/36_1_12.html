to repeal the Firearms Act and to require that persons convicted 
of using a firearm to commit a crime must serve five years in 
prison; and that the sentence is increased to ten years if the 
firearm is actually fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is important because the Canadian people want a 
serious crackdown on the unlawful use of firearms rather than 
legislation which aims primarily at law-abiding gun owners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.)</B>  moved for

from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I wish to table my private member's bill 
entitled the negotiation of terms of separation act.  This 
legislation provides the principles to determine whether a 
provincial vote to separate is valid and would require partition 
of any provincial electoral areas not voting to leave Canada.  It 
would require a clear statement on a separation ballot of what a 
yes vote truly means.  If Parliament agreed that such a vote was 
valid, then the Government of Canada would be required to hold a 
binding national referendum to authorize it to negotiate terms of 
separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce this bill. 
It is quite lengthy and sets out requirements for the Minister of 
Finance to state his intentions over the next few years to 
forecast the finances of the country and to give reasons on a 
yearly basis as to why he is not meeting his targets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill would put an end to a process 
that has been taking place over the years.  There has always been 
a debt reduction and servicing account where people could make 
gifts to the crown, supposedly to reduce the debt. 
But the government has always had access to that account and 
could play this sort of shell game where it pays off a bit of the 
debt and then borrows the money back again.

of landing fee). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce my private 
member's bill in the House today. This bill amends the 
Immigration Act to prevent the assessment of the right of landing 
fee on immigrants in addition to the application fee. This will 
prevent economic discrimination against immigrants from low 
income countries which may be caused by such fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a land of immigrants and the current right of landing 
fee placed on people coming to Canada in addition to their 
application fee is discriminatory and regressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practice goes against our history and against our vision of 
our country.  Almost everyone can trace their roots back to 
immigrants and even today immigrants continue to play an 
important role in Canada's development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a step in returning Canada back to its vision 
regarding immigrants. This bill was introduced in the second 
session of the 35th Parliament and I hope that members of the 
House will seriously consider the bill's intent and purpose.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4.  On the order:  Government Orders 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>September 25, 1997—The Minister responsible for the Canadian 
Wheat Board—Second reading and reference to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food of Bill C-4, an act to 
amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</UL>
<A NAME="LINK34">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.)</B> 
moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and 
to make consequential amendments to other acts, be referred 
forthwith to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to open the debate on the 
proposed new law to change the Canadian Wheat Board, and to bring 
about the biggest changes in western grain marketing in more than 
half a century.  At the outset I want to thank the government 
House leader for ensuring that this new legislation, Bill C-4, is 
before the House of Commons at a very early stage in this new 
Parliament.  It is getting prompt, priority attention which is 
important to prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed one urban news reporter complaining the other day that 
Bill C-4 had “suddenly” been introduced in the House.  It may 
have escaped that reporter's attention that amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act have been under consideration for more 
than two years.  The consultations and analyses have been both 
exhaustive and exhausting, probably the most comprehensive in 
history.  The whole process has been thoroughly public and 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised to move quickly in this new Parliament to make the 
Canadian Wheat Board more democratic, more accountable and more 
flexible and to place more decision-making authority in the hands 
of grain producers than ever before in history. Bill C-4 fulfils 
that undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is a $6 billion enterprise doing 
business in 70 countries worldwide.  It ranks among the top 10 
Canadian exporters.  It is the country's biggest single earner of 
foreign exchange.  Once Bill C-4 is enacted, farmers will be in 
the driver's seat like never before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout its history the Canadian Wheat Board has been 
governed by a small group of up to five commissioners, all 
appointed by the Government of Canada without any requirement 
that anybody be consulted and legally responsible only to the 
Government of Canada.  But in today's dynamic and changing 
marketplace, producers have made it clear that they want the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be more accountable to them.  They want 
more control, and that is what Bill C-4 will provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new law for the first time in history, the CWB will be 
run by a duly constituted board of directors.  There will be 15 
directors in total and two-thirds of them, 10 directors, will be 
elected directly by prairie farmers.  That is a solid controlling 
majority.  If Parliament is able to deal with this bill promptly, 
the elections to select these new directors can be held before 
another crop is planted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law will provide that all of the powers of the Canadian 
Wheat Board are vested in the hands of its directors.  Because 
two-thirds of them will be elected, they will be directly 
accountable through the democratic process for how they manage 
the CWB's multibillion dollar business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to their general power to run all the affairs of the 
CWB and in response to specific recommendations from farmers, the 
directors will have the explicit authority to choose their own 
chairperson, to set the salaries of the directors, the 
chairperson and the president, to conduct regular performance 
appraisals on the president and to recommend his or her dismissal 
if thought necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to erroneous assertions of some of the wheat board's 
more strident critics, like that gaggle of political drifters who 
make up the so-called Saskatchewan Party in my home province, 
neither the CWB nor the government will retain any power to fire 
any elected director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that farmers are well served, the directors will be 
entitled to full disclosure of all facts and figures about CWB 
operations, including but not limited to audited financial 
statements.  They will be able to examine the prices at which 
grain is sold, the price premiums achieved, all operating costs 
and whether the CWB is truly efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its elected directors the CWB will gain the benefit of 
the practical expertise of real producers.  If they are not 
satisfied with how the CWB deals with farmers or its sales 
strategy or the way it does business, they will have the 
authority to change things as they see fit democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group that has been particularly outrageous in its attacks 
on the Canadian Wheat Board is the National Citizens' Coalition, 
a funny bunch that would not know a bushel of barley from a 
handful of rice. 
It alleges, wrongly, that this new legislation would give the 
directors and the officers of the CWB free rein to ignore and 
break the law.  That is patently false.  If you have any doubt, 
just read the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The directors and officers of the CWB will be under an explicit 
obligation to act honestly and in good faith, exercising all 
reasonable care, diligence and skill.  If they fail in that duty 
they will expose themselves to legal liability.  They will carry 
a very heavy fiduciary responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions in Bill C-4 on this point are virtually identical 
to provisions that appear in the Canada Business Corporations Act 
which applies to all federally incorporated private sector 
companies in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the structural changes in governance and accountability, 
the Government of Canada will continue to provide the Canadian 
Wheat Board with very substantial financial guarantees, covering 
not only the initial payment set at the beginning of each pooling 
period and the CWB's credit sales program, but also all of its 
general business borrowings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the CWB is a multibillion dollar enterprise, the amounts 
outstanding under these guarantees are often very large. 
Historically, because of the wheat board's strong performance, 
the federal guarantees have been called on in only rare and 
isolated circumstances, but the Government of Canada is on the 
hook if something suddenly goes wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason the government will continue to have a window on 
Canadian Wheat Board affairs, in addition to that line of 
accountability directly to western farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a window is also necessary because any Canadian exporter of 
wheat or barley, whether on the prairies or elsewhere, requires a 
Canadian Wheat Board export permit.  Consequently, the government 
will select a minority of the CWB's directors, five in total, 
including the president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please note that under the new law the choice of president 
requires consultation in advance with the other directors.  The 
directors as a whole will have the right to set the president's 
salary, to appraise the president's performance and to recommend 
dismissal if necessary. Farmers will always hold a two to one 
majority among the directors over all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enhance the Canadian Wheat Board's flexibility, to give 
farmers more choice in how they are paid for their grain and to 
speed up cash flows to producers, Bill C-4 will enable the 
Canadian Wheat Board to make cash purchases of wheat and/or 
barley, increase initial payments quickly whenever market 
conditions warrant, close and pay out pool accounts at any time, 
provide an early pool cash-out option, fully use modern risk 
management tools, issue negotiable producer certificates, offset 
storage costs, facilitate deliveries to condo storage systems and 
receive grain through on-farm mobile elevators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new law will also empower producers to determine 
democratically what is and what is not under the Canadian Wheat 
Board's marketing jurisdiction.  If farmers want to exclude some 
type of grain, in whole or in part, from the Canadian Wheat 
Board's current single desk system, that can be done, subject to 
three clear conditions. First, the CWB's directors must recommend 
it.  Second, the Canadian Grain Commission must approve an 
identity preservation system to protect quality standards. Third, 
if the proposed exclusion is significant there must be a vote 
among producers to approve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, if farmers want to include rye or flax or canola 
within the Canadian Wheat Board's mandate, that too can be done, 
again subject to three very clear conditions.  First, the farm 
organization which represents the producers of that commodity 
must make a formal written request for the inclusion.  Second, 
the CWB's directors must recommend it.  Third, there must be a 
vote among farmers to approve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions are balanced and fair both ways, for either 
exclusions or inclusions, and in either case the authority is 
vested where it belongs, not in politicians but in the hands of 
farmers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every marketing innovation which farmers have debated 
over the past several years will be possible under this new law. 
In a nutshell, that is what Bill C-4 is all about, empowering 
producers, enshrining democratic authority which has never 
existed before, providing new accountability, new flexibility and 
responsiveness, and positioning farmers to shape the kind of 
wheat board they want for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-4, 
an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and other acts.  In 
doing so I have two purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to draw the attention of hon. members, in 
particular members from urban ridings, to the importance of 
agricultural reform.  Second, to express my disappointment that 
the bill before us is such a pale and timid imitation of what is 
required to prepare the Canadian Wheat Board and to equip 
Canadian grain growers to succeed in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when a majority of the members of the House had 
rural and agricultural backgrounds.  That is now not the case. 
There was a time when at least two or three of the leaders in the 
House would have come from farm backgrounds.  That is now not the 
case.  In fact, of the five party leaders in the House, I am the 
only one that actually grew up on a farm.  I trust hon. members 
will forgive me if I engage for a moment in a little nostalgia 
before turning to the subject matter of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfather on my father's side homesteaded in Saskatchewan 
at the turn of the century.  He broke prairie sod with oxen south 
of Rosetown, Saskatchewan.  With his three sons he went through 
the technological transformation of the agricultural industry, 
from ploughing with oxen, to ploughing with horses, to the old 
days of steam machines, to the days of gasoline and diesel 
tractors.  He also went through the economic and political 
transformation of the agricultural economy, from the homesteading 
days of unregulated markets through the period of exploitation by 
the railways and the grain companies, to the agricultural reform 
period of the twenties and the thirties.  That established the 
pools, ultimately resulting in the creation of the Canadian Wheat 
Board and the foundations of the current grain handling, 
production and marketing systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father entered politics in Alberta during the depression. 
Throughout the years that he was a cabinet minister and the 
premier of Alberta we operated a dairy farm east of the city of 
Edmonton. We operated a farm that milked about 70 cows.  We went 
through the evolution of supply management and the transformation 
from hand milking to mechanical milking, from stanchion barns to 
loafing barns with milking parlours, all the time subject to the 
cost-price squeeze that has become characteristic of trying to 
operate a family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recount this to say that almost all of us, no matter what we 
now do, if we go back far enough, will find family roots in the 
agriculture industry.  I am also reminded that no matter how far 
away we may now be from the farm, if we are still in the habit of 
eating three times a day, we have a vested interest in the state 
of agriculture and in agricultural reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I hope that when bills like this are brought before 
us and when agriculture questions are asked in the House, members 
from urban ridings, like me, will not simply turn glassy eyed and 
ignore what is being proposed or what is said.  I trust that we 
will continue to give agriculture and members from predominantly 
rural communities the attention that their traditions, industries 
and concerns deserve in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to the subject of the reform of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  No federal political party holds more 
grassroots, public political meetings in the west than Reform, 
meetings at which this subject has been discussed at length for 
years.  If I can briefly survey what we have found over the last 
number of years it can be summed up in three positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there are those who would abolish the wheat board.  There 
are those who favour doing away completely with the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  They point out that the whole world is moving 
toward a more market driven free trade in the agricultural and 
food product sector.  They maintain that the trend cannot be 
arrested nor should it be arrested and that in that environment 
the Canadian Wheat Board is a monopolistic anachronism.  This is 
not the position of the Reform Party but we are aware that that 
position exists among some producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are those who want to keep the Canadian Wheat 
Board essentially as it is or as it was.  Many of these are older 
producers who remember the exploitation of farmers by the grain 
companies and the railways in the early days of the west.  Many 
of these are producers who are uncomfortable in having to deal 
with the complex and ever-changing market forces of the 
international grain trade. 
They believe the future prosperity of the grain farmer lies in 
the direction of following marketing principles that have served 
well in the past.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the position of the official opposition that the 
Canadian Wheat Board should remain as it is or as it was.  We are 
convinced that many of the old marketing principles, however 
valid they might have been in the past, are no longer a reliable 
guide to capturing the markets of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third option and this is the option favoured by the 
official opposition and by an increasing number of producers. 
That option is to fundamentally reform the Canadian Wheat Board 
to make it more market sensitive and more accountable:  more 
sensitive to a freer, more diverse, more competitive market and 
trading environment, and more accountable not to the government 
and the minister but to the consumers and producers it is 
intended to serve.  This is the position of the Reform Party and 
the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the bill we see a feeble attempt to appear to be 
reforming the Canadian Wheat Board without any real or 
substantive changes required to make real reform a reality.  Only 
a government and a minister hopelessly committed to the status 
quo would regard the tinkering in the bill as substantive change, 
to use the words of the minister.  The minister tries to make a 
silk purse out of a sow's ear, a feat beyond the competence of 
this minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Prince George—Peace River, and 
other Reform members, will discuss the defects of the bill in 
detail and will present some real reform alternatives.  The 
bottom line of our analysis is that Bill C-4 fails to improve the 
market sensitivity of the Canadian Wheat Board and fails to 
substantially improve the marketing options open to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of our analysis is that it fails to 
significantly improve the accountability of Canadian Wheat Board 
producers in the manner that is being demanded by producers and 
required for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the importance of grain marketing to Canada, 
especially in the west, I urge all members to give the bill the 
attention it deserves and to take counsel from the members among 
us speaking particularly from rural and agricultural ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the foregoing reasons which will be expanded by my 
colleagues, I urge members to defeat the bill, to send it back to 
the minister and the department, and to demand a real Canadian 
Wheat Board reform act suitable for preparing the board and the 
producers it serves to cope with the demands of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak this morning on Bill C-4, formerly C-72. 
Thanks to the lack of foresight by the government during the 35th 
Parliament, we have to partially repeat the work the hon. members 
had done in this House on Bill C-72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it must be made perfectly clear that the 
Canadian Wheat Board we are today trying to modernize, to update 
for the year 2000 and beyond, affects the grain producers of Quebec 
only very slightly.  In reality, the Canadian Wheat Board is 
important in four provinces: Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
part of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in 
favour of Bill C-4, because we find it a reasonable attempt to 
modernize the Canadian Wheat Board, its board of directors in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the contributions by the Bloc Quebecois members 
sitting on the Agriculture and Agri-Food Committee, we have managed 
to get the number of directors elected by the grain producers 
themselves raised to 10.  Before that, the good old federal 
government, with all of its great foresight, and particularly with 
its great generosity, was the one making the appointments. 
Obviously, we always tried to select the best, but the best is 
usually an acquaintance or a friend, someone who has done us a 
favour in the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the government has just appointed Mr. Justice 
Michel Bastarache, a colleague of the Prime Minister, the former 
chairman of the yes committee in the 1992 referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord and a great friend of this country's 
federalists.  Our fine Prime Minister, the member for 
Saint-Maurice, propelled this judge into a seat on the supreme 
court and it will be this judge who decides on Quebec's right to 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding next to mine, the very beautiful riding of 
Beauce, the member, Gilles Bernier, was an independent.  In order 
to free this riding for a Liberal member, Mr. Bernier was also 
given an appointment.  Although he had no previous experience, the 
government appointed him ambassador to Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was relatively young, the Trudeau government appointed 
the Créditiste member for the riding of Richmond—Arthabaska, my 
friend Lionel beaudoin, to the Canadian Wheat Board.  A byelection 
was then called, and Alain Tardif was elected, and sat in the House 
until 1984, when the Conservative Party arrived in force. Funnily 
enough, he too was appointed a judge, but with the tax court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see how it works.  Where is the usual process for 
appointing people to the important jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, only five members of the board of directors of 
the Canadian Wheat Board will be appointed by the Governor General 
in Council, the ten others will be elected democratically by the 
grain growers as a whole.  The majority of the board of directors 
will be elected—a significant change—and under the control of 
the producers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four appointments will be made by the Governor General in 
Council, that is friends once more.  They will not be members of 
the Reform Party, but certainly friends of the Liberal régime will 
be sitting on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Fundraisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Fundraisers perhaps, as we saw in Quebec in 
March and in previous months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major difference—and I want to say a word about it—concerns 
the appointment of the president. The governor in council will have to 
consult the 14 other directors already sitting on the board in order to 
appoint number 15, who will become the president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the agriculture committee managed, thanks—and I say it in 
all humility—to my intervention and also to the support of my friend 
and colleague, the hon. member for Malpeque, to include in the bill a 
provision whereby the remuneration is fixed by resolution of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if a nitwit is appointed, board directors will have the power 
to decide that this person's salary will be one dollar per year. 
This way, the nitwit will not hang around for too long and will quickly 
give up his position. The board of directors will also have the power to 
include or exclude certain grain categories.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the case of canola, for example. Canola is currently 
not covered by the Canadian Wheat Board. Of course, should canola 
producers wish to join the Canadian Wheat Board, three very specific 
rules will apply. However, the most important decision, the biggest 
hurdle, will be to obtain a mandate from registered canola producers. A 
vote will be held, but it will not be by show of hands, since some 
people can then move quickly and vote two or three times. There will 
only be one vote per producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a majority vote yes and the other two conditions, which I will 
deal with later, are met, then all canola growers will have to join the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what some members of the official opposition were 
hoping for, which is for producers to join the Canadian Wheat Board one 
year because it suits them, and leave the next year, because they were 
able to sell their grain on their own. In other words, producers will 
not be allowed to join the commission when prices are down and then to 
opt out when prices go up. Either you're in or you're out. Either all 
producers join the Canadian Wheat Board or they're out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like, of course, to congratulate the new 
Minister of Agriculture on his appointment. For once, the Prime Minister 
brought in someone who knows agriculture well. 
I find it unfortunate however that the responsibility for the Canadian 
Wheat Board was given to another minister, who no longer heads the 
Department of Agriculture. Like all members of this House, I think this 
is most unfortunate. Even among government members there is discontent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the rationale? When the current minister was agriculture 
minister, he was naturally put in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Like the Canadian Dairy Commission, the wheat board falls under 
Agriculture Canada, not under External Affairs or Justice. This decision 
is fraught with consequences the Prime Minister will have to live with 
for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, members of the Bloc Quebecois will support this 
government initiative, which they believe is a step forward. It may be 
a small step, but a step in the right direction nonetheless in 
modernizing the Canadian Wheat Board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to be able to speak to Bill C-4, the amendments to 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to serve the area of Palliser.  It is an area of 
Saskatchewan that includes all of Moose Jaw, a portion of Regina 
and a good swath of farming country that surrounds those two fine 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency of Palliser is named in honour of a former 
British army captain, Captain John Palliser, who was sent out 140 
years ago in 1857 on an expedition to southern Saskatchewan to 
see whether the climate was hospitable for agriculture.  Captain 
Palliser became famous, or perhaps infamous, for saying that the 
region was “unfit for human abode”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Captain Palliser was wrong.  There have been developments in 
agricultural technology that he could not possibly have foreseen. 
The Regina plains he found so inhospitable that many years ago 
have now become one of the best grain growing regions in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The climate can be as harsh as he described it, but people in 
Palliser and throughout the prairies have used the tools of 
community and co-operation to overcome the obstacles of climate 
and distance. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is one of those tools of co-operation. 
It has served western farmers well since 1935 and they made it 
clear in the barley plebiscite last February that they want to 
keep the Canadian Wheat Board as a single desk seller for their 
grain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in charge of the wheat board introduced amendments 
to the act in December of last year. Those amendments were sent 
quickly to the agriculture committee.  In fact our caucus at that 
time in the 35th Parliament believed that the reference to 
committee was too hasty.  We did not understand the minister's 
great hurry and we thought there should have been more 
opportunity for debate in the House prior to the referral. Len 
Taylor, our former agriculture critic from The 
Battlefords—Meadow Lake, made known his and our party's 
unhappiness with the government's procedure at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that in Bill C-4 the minister is once again making the 
same speedy reference to committee and again we are concerned 
about that. We feel that members of the House would have valuable 
contributions to make in the debate prior to the legislation 
being referred to committee. We do not understand the minister's 
undue haste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, today the wheat board legislation is back before 
the House as Bill C-4.  Our caucus has looked carefully at the 
bill and we are pleased to see that it makes some important 
concessions based on amendments proposed by the agriculture 
committee that I referred to earlier. I want to review the most 
important of those changes and to indicate where our caucus can 
support them and where we feel further amendments are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, Bill C-4 contains an inclusion clause. That 
means that grains can now be added or included as opposed to what 
was in Bill C-72 when they could only be deleted or excluded. 
This is a major change and a concession on the minister's behalf. 
It was the wise course to take and the right thing to have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do however have some concerns about how the process to 
achieve the inclusion of a new grain would be triggered.  It is 
not clear to us which farm organizations would have the right to 
ask for such an inclusion.  I flag this for the minister to 
suggest that we do have questions and that we may have 
suggestions to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second there are also some welcomed changes in governance. Bill 
C-4 stipulates as the minister said that 10 of the 15 members of 
the board of directors are to be elected by farmers with the 
minister naming the remaining five.  The directors will now 
choose their own chair rather than leave that power with the 
minister. These are improvements over Bill C-72 but we do not 
believe that they go far enough yet. We have no problem with the 
government naming some members to the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue after all to guarantee the wheat 
board's initial price on grain purchased from farmers.  Our 
caucus insisted that the government continue these financial 
guarantees and we are pleased that they have been maintained.  If 
the government is going to have considerable financial exposure, 
then it is only reasonable that it have some window into the 
board's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However under Bill C-4 the minister maintains the authority to 
choose the president of the board of directors, a person who will 
double as the wheat board's chief executive officer.  Our caucus 
opposes this. We believe this gives the government too much 
control over a board of directors that should really be 
accountable ultimately to the farmers and it gives the government 
too much control over the day to day operations of the wheat 
board itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the proposal, we believe that the board of 
directors should have the authority to choose the president and 
chief executive officer and we urge the minister to make this 
amendment.  We believe that the federal government will have 
enough influence by its appointment of one-third of the 15 
members of the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who insist that the government should have no 
participation on the board of directors. Too often these are the 
same people who would like to sever all connections before the 
government and the board.  This is a cynical exercise using the 
rhetoric of democracy as a tool to do away with the wheat board 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the minister has addressed an important issue on 
the inclusion of grains and has made some improvements on the 
issue of governance.  However there is a third area of concern to 
us in which the minister has made no concession and that is in 
the area of cash purchases of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades the Canadian Wheat Board has earned the confidence 
of farmers because they knew that they would all be treated 
equitably in the purchase of their grain. The board bought grain 
from farmers at similar prices and under similar conditions. This 
practice known as price pooling has been the bedrock on which the 
Canadian Wheat Board was built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Bill C-72 and now Bill C-4 the son of C-72, would give the 
board the ability to buy grains from anyone, anywhere at any 
time. This in effect undermines the principle of price pooling. 
We believe that it would also undermine the farmers' confidence 
in the board and thereby diminish the board's credibility and 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister argues that these arrangements would allow the 
board to adapt more quickly to market developments especially 
when the board needs a certain grain quickly and supplies are not 
immediately forthcoming.  While there is logic in this reasoning, 
we fear that the board could in the search for short term 
flexibility undermine its longer term credibility with farmers. 
At the very least we would want the legislation to be quite 
specific as to when the board could resort to cash buying.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus believe that it is time to end the uncertainty 
which has surrounded the Canadian Wheat Board.  This uncertainty 
has been foisted onto the board and onto western farmers by the 
actions of some of our trading competitors, but what is even more 
damaging are the activities of that vocal minority of farmers who 
would do away with the board altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Leader of the Opposition did not refer to what his 
party is going to propose, undoubtedly it will be a form of dual 
marketing.  We suggest that dual marketing is no more a solution 
in the agricultural area than two tier health care is in the 
medicare field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our lingering concerns about this government's longer 
term trade agenda, we believe it is best to get on with Bill C-4. 
This bill makes some important concessions and improvements from 
its previous incarnation based on amendments proposed by the 
agriculture committee in the last Parliament.  Our caucus 
supports Bill C-4 in principle but we reserve the option of 
making further amendments to this legislation in committee.

represented my riding over 40 years ago.  He was the Hon. Walter 
Dinsdale.  His words on the subject matter outlined in Bill C-4 
are very relevant for someone who spoke on the issue 40 years 
ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wheat is still the economic lodestar of the prairies—. Wheat 
made possible the building of Canada's first transcontinental 
railway, and I sometimes think the construction of the CPR was 
the last major effort on the part of this dominion government 
relative to the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also the rapid development of our wheat economy that made 
possible the great waves of immigration in the early years of 
this century and opened up that part of Canada to popular 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important as the wheat trade undoubtedly is, it nevertheless 
leaves our prairie economy in a particularly vulnerable position 
because it means that we are tied to a one-product economy.  When 
disturbances inevitably occur in world economy and are reflected 
in our internal economy, it is the agricultural industry that is 
the first to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I would like to add, Mr. Speaker, that the wheat 
board has been particularly effective in smoothing out extreme 
swings in the economic cycle.  The only difficulty with the wheat 
board is that it has tended to become used as an instrument of 
political manipulation, and wheat policies have been adapted to 
the welfare of the party in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add, though, that marketing boards do not necessarily 
increase the price to the producer.  They merely iron out some of 
the wilder fluctuations.  In the final analysis it is demand that 
determines price. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic reciting these words on an issue which was brought 
to the attention of the then Liberal government over 40 years ago 
by a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament.  Is it not 
funny that 40 years later the current Liberal government 
continues to put a deaf ear to the concerns of western members of 
Parliament.  It is sad how little things have changed around 
here.  It is really sad for the producers who have to deal with a 
federal government which is so adamant on preventing change when 
it concerns the interests of farmers across western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that the government in power has a very 
difficult issue facing it today.  I have spoken to many 
stakeholders across the country and I can say that they have very 
divergent needs.  Some say to get rid of the board entirely and 
we recognize who those people are.  There is also the range on 
the other side which says to leave it exactly the way it is, the 
status quo with no changes whatsoever. We recognize where that 
comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in the middle however a number of stakeholders, a 
number of producers, who would like to see change, some of them 
within the Canadian Wheat Board system and some of them on a 
voluntary basis, so they would have the right to choose in which 
fashion they would market their grains.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government today had an opportunity to embrace change going 
into the 21st century.  It had an opportunity to show leadership 
with respect to marketing western Canadian grains. In fact with 
Bill C-4 before us right now, it has failed to show that 
leadership.  The government has tinkered with the existing 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not naive enough politically to believe that we on this 
side of the House are going to change the direction of 
government. In saying that, when I came to this House I said to 
my constituents that I wanted to bring positive criticism, 
constructive criticism to the government.  I would like to in the 
next little while show some of that positive criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue I would like to deal with in Bill C-4 before us 
today is that of the inclusion clause.  I had the opportunity to 
actually speak to the commissioners of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
When I asked the question why must there be an inclusion clause 
to include canola, flax, rye and oats, the answer I received was 
if there is going to be an exclusion clause, then we should have 
an inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never did they speak to the ability to market better.  Never did 
they speak that it would be better for the producers.  Never did 
they speak to the fact that it was the best way to market in the 
world today. They simply said because there is exclusion, there 
should be inclusion.  This is not good enough.  The majority of 
shareholders and stakeholders in agriculture do not want 
inclusion of those crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the board of directors, it is a very good move considering 
the legislation that is before us.  There should well be an 
elected board of directors.  I agree with that.  Of the 15 board 
of directors who have been identified, all 15 should be elected 
by the producers, not appointed by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are going to say “but the government has an involvement in 
this financially”.  In the Ontario Wheat Board right now, the 
government has involvement financially.  All 10 board of 
directors are elected by producers and not appointed by 
government. There should be an elected board of directors, not 
one that is appointed by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that as well, the CEO form of governance is great.  I 
do not believe nor have I ever believed in management by 
committee or by commissions. I believe the CEO form of governance 
is a good direction this government has taken.  In saying that, I 
also believe that the CEO should be appointed by the board of 
directors, not by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CEO is given the proper opportunity and the proper vision 
to plan for where we are going in the 21st century, I believe it 
is a step in the right direction.  Give the chief executive 
officer the opportunity to put his or her positions forward on 
the basis of the board, not on the basis of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I would like to speak to right now is that of 
accountability.  The Canadian Wheat Board in the opinion of the 
stakeholders has not been accountable to the producers.  It is a 
closed shop.  They do not have the opportunity of getting the 
information that we would like to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board along with CSIS are the two 
organizations that are not affected by the access to information 
legislation. That is not right.  There has to be transparency. 
There has to be openness and there has to be accountability by 
the Canadian Wheat Board to the people that they serve, the 
producers of western Canada.  That accountability can come with a 
chief executive officer who is appointed by an elected board, and 
with the elected board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, there are improvements within the existing Bill C-4 
over previous legislation on the Canadian Wheat Board.  What I 
would like to see are those changes I talked about previously as 
well as the possibility and the opportunity of perhaps some 
voluntary co-operation of producers with the Canadian Wheat 
Board, an opt in and an opt out opportunity for producers. This 
has not been talked about.  It has not been discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trust me, when it gets to committee I am sure there will be 
plenty of time to debate these very, very positive and 
constructive criticisms of this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House 
today and make some comments on Bill C-4. 
I am pleased to speak in support of the motion to refer Bill C-4 
to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources 
and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, for the 
work he has done in the process of developing the bill over the 
last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 62 years the Canadian Wheat Board has been one of the 
cornerstones of our nation's success in agriculture and 
agri-food.  Changes in Bill C-4 build on that success by 
providing for a more modern Canadian Wheat Board, one that is 
more accountable to farmers, more flexible and more responsive. 
Farmers will have a direct role in shaping the operations and 
directions of the corporation.  They will have more power to take 
on the very real challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the preparation and debate on the legislation we have 
done everything possible to ensure that everybody with an 
interest in this complex issue has a had a full and fair 
opportunity to voice an opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1995 my predecessor as Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-food established the western grain marketing panel to 
conduct a comprehensive examination of western grain marketing 
issues.  One year later after extensive consultations, including 
15 town hall meetings and 12 days of public hearings across the 
prairies, the panel completed its report and submitted it to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister distributed a summary of the report's 
recommendations to all farmers in western Canada and invited 
their feedback.  In one way or another more than 12,000 
individuals and organizations responded to the panel's 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1996 Bill C-72 was tabled in the House of Commons. 
In February 1997 the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-food, which I chaired at that time, held a series of 
meetings across western Canada.  We visited Winnipeg, Regina, 
Saskatoon, Calgary and Grande Prairie.  We heard from more than 
40 groups and a similar number of individual farmers during those 
committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of those hearings we made more than 20 amendments to 
the bill before we reported it back to the House in April 1997. I 
am pleased to note that the amendments were retained in the new 
bill.  The system does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the past summer the minister responsible for 
the wheat board continued to conduct informal consultations with 
the grains industry officials to hear views on the legislation. 
In early September he requested views from farm organizations on 
the appropriate principles to govern the election of the 
directors.  It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the 
future of the Canadian Wheat Board has been exhaustively 
discussed and debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the amendments is to respond to some of the major 
concerns raised during the debate and to ensure that the CWB is 
well positioned to continue as a reliable, responsive single desk 
seller of Canadian wheat and barley in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective is to build on the proven strengths of our 
existing marketing system while enhancing its accountability, 
improving its responsiveness to changing producer needs and 
opportunities, providing more flexibility and faster cashflows, 
and minimizing future complications in international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking action on all of the points raised by the panel 
with regard to the accountability of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
As the minister responsible for the wheat board has explained, 
under the legislation the current commissioner structure of 
management would be replaced by a part-time 15 member board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be comprised of ten producer elected representatives 
and five government appointees including a full-time president. 
Both the chief executive officer and the full-time president 
would be responsible for the day to day operations of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CWB status as an agent of the crown and crown corporation 
would end when the new board of directors assumes office.  The 
Canadian Wheat Board Advisory Committee would be terminated when 
deemed appropriate by the minister responsible for the wheat 
board but not before the end of its current mandate at the end of 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in the bill would also allow the Canadian Wheat 
Board to offer farmers more options in terms of pricing and 
timing of payment for their grain and provide it with greater 
flexibility in the way it acquires grain.  At the same time the 
amendments leave intact the basic principles of single desk 
selling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also includes provisions for adding additional 
grains to the marketing mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board.  I 
want opposition members to listen to the process that has to take 
place.  In such a case the request would first have to come from 
a recognized commodity group and the board of directors would 
have to recommend the inclusion.  Then a vote on the inclusion by 
the producers of that grain would also have to be held.  There 
are a number of steps.  After that the changes to the marketing 
mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board could then be made through an 
order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in the bill would also give the board of 
directors the power to exclude specific types, classes or 
varieties of wheat or barley from exclusive Canadian Wheat Board 
jurisdiction in the domestic or export market.  This authority 
would be exercised only upon the recommendation of the board of 
directors.  There would have to be assurances from the Canadian 
Grain Commission that the necessary quality control measures were 
in place to avoid co-mingling of grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the board of directors considers the exclusion to be a 
significant change, a vote of the producers would also have to be 
held.  Again a number of steps would have to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian Wheat Board governed by a board of directors 
comprised of a majority of producer elected members would improve 
accountability to and communications with producers.  It would 
also result in an increased sense of producer ownership of their 
marketing organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the self-sufficiency of the Canadian Wheat Board would 
increase, the government would still have an important role to 
play in supporting it.  For example, the government would 
continue to provide financial backing for initial payments, 
borrowing, and for such programs as the credit grain sales 
program.  The changes would provide the board with more 
flexibility in the acquisition and the pricing of wheat and 
barley enabling it to operate more efficiently, increase returns 
to farmers and reduce the risk to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have discussed the bill responds to views expressed by 
numerous stakeholders.  It is important to note, however, that 
the amendments do not constitute the full response of the 
Government of Canada to the concerns of the Canadian grain 
producers and the recommendations of the western grain panel.  We 
are also pursuing many other avenues to address other issues that 
they brought forward related to grain marketing and 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last November our government introduced legislation 
to modernize the Canada Labour Code.  Among other things those 
amendments stipulate that while grain handlers and their 
employees will retain the right to strike and lockout, in the 
event of a work stoppage involving other parties in port related 
activities, services affecting grain shipments must be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another important issue, specifically the efficiency of our 
transportation system, the Minister of Transport, the minister 
responsible for the wheat board and I met this summer on July 25 
with key members of the grain industry in Winnipeg.  As as result 
of that meeting the grain transportation industry has developed 
and put in place a monitoring program and a contingency plan to 
ensure efficiency in the movement of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-4 and other actions the Government of Canada is 
demonstrating it is listening to the concerns of Canadian grain 
producers.  It is taking action to address those concerns.  It is 
laying the foundation for continuing growth and prosperity in the 
grain sector and Canada's rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all the members of the House to lend their support 
to the amendments contained in the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish I could say at the outset that it is a pleasure 
to rise today to address Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act, but the simple truth of the matter is that it is 
not.  A vast majority of western Canadian grain farmers whom the 
bill will affect and I hoped the minister and his government 
would have listened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to digress for a moment, I noted during the brief remarks 
of the hon. minister of agriculture a moment ago he referred to 
some 20 amendments the agriculture committee had made that were 
ultimately incorporated into the bill before the House today, 
Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people watching the debate today to realize 
that those amendments are very superficial.  With the possible 
exception of the so-called inclusion clause, there is not a lot 
of substance to those amendments. 
They do not go nearly far enough to address the real concerns 
being echoed across the prairies by Canada's western grain 
farmers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the bill's predecessor, Bill C-72, the minister has 
accomplished the near impossible by alienating everyone.  Where 
is the support for what he is about to do?  If this is the way to 
proceed and the majority of grain producers support his latest 
retread legislation, why are they not applauding him?  One has to 
speculate the point of consultations, submissions and hearings 
undertaken by the minister and his government over the the past 
year if in the final analysis they do not intend to listen to and 
incorporate those ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the western grain marketing panel and all the debate that 
took place, as the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food just 
mentioned, on Bill C-72 both in Ottawa and during the travelling 
show across the prairies.  Where are the substantive arguments 
put forward by the farm groups and farmers that appeared before 
that panel?  We do not see them in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple truth is that farmers will not substantially benefit 
from the legislation, and the Liberals know it.  The government 
is intent on forging ahead despite the cries of the vast majority 
of producers that it simply does not address their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the government's strategy is to bring forward the bill 
for 180 minutes of debate with 10 minute speeches and no 
questions and comments.  We in the opposition ranks cannot do an 
adequate job of discussing such a comprehensive piece of 
legislation in a 10 minute speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few moments I have left I will touch briefly on a number 
of points.  I certainly applaud the intervention of the 
Progressive Conservative member.  It is interesting to note that 
he and his party have picked up on the lead that Reform took on 
Bill C-72 in the last parliament.  They are now basically in line 
with some of the main points we are raising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not include anything that would take the Canadian 
Wheat Board toward being a voluntary organization.  We see a real 
demand by producers for freedom to choose.  We do not see any 
real options in the bill.  That has to be one of its most 
fundamental flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may bring about the total demise of the Canadian 
Wheat Board with the legislation.  With its all or nothing 
inclusion and exclusion clauses, a future board of directors 
could gradually exclude grades and types of grain until 
eventually the wheat board would be just a shell that does not 
market anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers may divide on their support for the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Other speakers have referred to the two extremes.  The 
bulk of farmers are in the middle.  Between 75% and 80% of 
farmers want to see some change which ranges from minor change to 
very substantive change.  I have found the majority of farmers 
are opposed to the contingency fund.  They view it as simply 
another tax being imposed upon them by the government.  In a 
situation where it is mandatory to belong to the Canadian Wheat 
Board this contingency fund is another tax at a time when farmers 
cannot afford any more input costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another perplexing part of the legislation is the question of 
how elected directors will ultimately be held accountable, as my 
hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like CSIS this organization is highly secretive, ultra secret. 
It does not have to adhere to access to information and it cannot 
be audited by the auditor general of the country.  We think those 
are major flaws. Again this was an opportunity for the government 
to address very real concerns, to open up the board and make it 
more accountable. 
I would ask all hon. members and people viewing this debate to 
answer this question.  Can they imagine any other corporation, 
club, or charity to which they belong answering questions 
concerning decisions made at an annual general meeting by saying 
“I can't answer that” or “If I told you that I would have to 
kill you”.  It is absolutely ridiculous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to open up the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers are 
demanding it.  For the minister responsible for the Canadian 
Wheat Board to suggest that this bill is going to make it more 
accountable is actually ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, yet another anomaly contained in this legislation is the 
issue of the legal liability for directors, officers and 
employees of the Canadian Wheat Board. If directors act honestly 
and in good faith, as it states they must in this legislation, 
then why do they require protection from criminal activities?  If 
they have shown that they have complied with clause 3.12, then 
could they not simply prove that in a court of law as other 
Canadians are required to do without having this other clause 
3.13 which basically exempts them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that one of probably twenty changes that the 
minister was bragging about a while ago is the deletion of the 
term “employees”.  Yet we find that other persons are also 
covered under that clause.  In view of that the clause stating 
“person or persons acting at the request of the corporation” 
would certainly include the employees, at least I think it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are a lot of concerns across western Canada about 
the timely and efficient movement of grain to market.  This was 
an opportunity for the government to include in the bill or some 
other bill the removal of the Canadian Wheat Board from the 
present position it has across the country with transportation. 
I support that we should be looking at ways in which we can 
decrease the bureaucracy inherent in the grain transportation 
sector.  One of those ways would be to have the board take an at 
port position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one underlying question.  Is this the best the Liberals 
could come up with?  Earlier the minister took great pains to 
justify his rush to get this recycled bill back through the 
House.  He said that extensive consultations had already taken 
place regarding the legislation.  He is correct on that point, 
but obviously, as I said earlier in my presentation, the simple 
fact is that he is not listening.  He is not responding to the 
very real needs of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those producers are crying out for fundamental change and some 
freedom to choose.  In a free and democratic country like Canada 
it is absolutely ridiculous that we still have this mandatory 
monopoly left over from the second world war. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in this debate on the motion to refer Bill C-4 
to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the Canadian Wheat Board that are proposed in 
Bill C-4 have been designed to respond to the wishes of western 
Canadian grain farmers. Some western grain producers and producer 
groups have been asking for more flexibility in the marketing of 
wheat and barley.  The question arises, would Bill C-4 allow 
aspects of a dual market or voluntary marketing through the 
Canadian Wheat Board?  The short answer is yes, subject to the 
democratic will of the farmers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tool, Bill C-4, would enable the Canadian Wheat Board to 
provide additional marketing options to farmers while maintaining 
the integrity of pooling and single desk selling. 
However, the board of directors, two-thirds of whom will be 
elected by farmers, would also be empowered to recommend changes 
that would result in a marketing system with some of the features 
of a dual market, if that is what producers want.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part IV of the current Canadian Wheat Board Act provides the 
Canadian Wheat Board with single desk control over the export of 
wheat and barley, while part III deals with the acquisition of 
grain from producers, pooling and initial payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part IV also provides for monopoly control over interprovincial 
trade of wheat and barley which has, of course, long since been 
removed for domestic feed grain.  As members can see, producers 
currently have three options for selling their feed wheat and 
feed barley. They can sell it to the Canadian Wheat Board.  They 
can sell it to the private trade.  Or they can sell it directly 
to a domestic customer.  None of this will change if Bill C-4 is 
passed.  In fact, it has been made more explicit to remove all 
doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the option of selling to the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
private trade or directly to the final customer exists, but only 
for domestic feed grain.  However, under the exclusion clause in 
the new legislation it will be possible for this option to be 
extended to “any kind, type, class or grade of wheat and 
barley.” This clause provides for the exclusion by regulation of 
any kind, type, class or grade of wheat or barley from the 
provisions of part IV of the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  But it 
would still allow the Canadian Wheat Board to continue its 
activities under part III. This would mean that the Canadian 
Wheat Board would still be able to purchase the grain from 
producers and at the same time operate a pool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For such an exclusion to occur three conditions have to be met. 
First, a new farmer controlled board of directors would have to 
recommend it.  Second, the Canadian Grain Commission would have 
to approve an identity preservation system to safeguard quality. 
Third, a producer vote would have to be held if the board of 
directors decided the exclusion is indeed significant. If all 
three conditions were met, the minister would recommend the 
exclusion and the governor in council would pass the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing the exclusion clause is an inclusion clause.  This 
clause allows for the extensions of part III or part IV or both 
to grains not currently covered by the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
I should point out that this inclusion clause is confined to 
crops that fall within the definition of grain now in the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, that is oats, flax, rye and canola. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is subject to the commodity organization which best 
represents the producers of that grain asking for it.  And of 
course, the Canadian Wheat Board directors, as I said, those who 
were duly elected, would have to agree and farmers would have to 
approve it by a democratic vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose that all these three conditions were fulfilled and 
suppose that the Canadian Wheat Board Act were thus extended so 
that part III applied to rye, but not part IV. Remember, part III 
refers to pooling while part IV refers to single desk selling. 
Extending part III but not part IV would create a situation as I 
have described under the exclusion clause, that is, farmers would 
be able to sell rye not only to the Canadian Wheat Board but to 
others. If the decision is to extend both parts III and IV, this 
would result in both pooling and single desk selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision of Bill C-4 would allow for cash purchasing. 
The Canadian Wheat Board would have the flexibility to purchase 
grain at a price other than the initial payment.  If this were 
used extensively for a particular grain such as feed barley, the 
result could be that prices for feed barley in Canada would 
differ from prices in the United States only by actual transfer 
costs.  In such circumstances, licences to export feed barley to 
the U.S. would likely be granted with no charge for buy back, 
although there might well be conditions imposed to ensure that 
such feed barley exports would not adversely affect the Canadian 
Wheat Board malt barley exports to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation would be somewhat comparable to a dual market or 
voluntary marketing through the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, part VI of the Canadian Wheat Board Act allows 
marketing plans for voluntary pools to be established for grains, 
varieties, grades or classes that are not required to be marketed 
through the Canadian Wheat Board.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a marketing plan can only be set up after an association of 
producers or an association or firm engaged in the processing and 
marketing of grain submits a proposal for the establishment of a 
marketing plan to the minister and is approved by the governor in 
council.  Such a marketing plan would include guaranteed initial 
payments, however, the guarantee would only cover a maximum of 
90% of any losses incurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision for marketing plans is in the current act but it 
has never been used.  If it were it would result in a voluntary 
pool for grain covered by the marketing plan.  Under this 
provision the administrator of the plan must be designated.  It 
is conceivable that after it becomes a mixed enterprise the 
Canadian Wheat Board might qualify to be an administrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are several ways that a dual market or 
voluntary marketing through the Canadian Wheat Board, or similar 
results, could be achieved under Bill C-4.  All of them would 
require as a minimum that the producer controlled board of 
directors take a conscious decision to do so.  In most cases 
farmers would carry the ultimate authority through a democratic 
producer vote.  It comes down to producers deciding what 
producers want. They will elect the majority of the board of 
directors and they will vote on inclusion or significant 
exclusions of crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other aspects of the legislation these tools are 
enabling.  They put power in the hands of producers, allowing 
them to shape the Canadian Wheat Board to the needs of Canadian 
farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as a member of 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, I am very honoured 
to take part in the House of Commons debate on Bill C-4 to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by saying that, strictly from the standpoint 
of principle, the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-4, with a few 
reservations that I will mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it is good to see the decision making power of the 
Canadian Wheat Board put in the hands of farmers, who represent ten of 
the 15 members on the board of directors. 
In addition to making them accountable, their presence means the 
Canadian Wheat Board is more plugged in to what they actually 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of trust and agreement between people in the same 
profession is very high.  Quebec farmers are no exception to the rule 
and want to see their colleagues in the west benefit from this new 
arrangement of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that elected producers form the majority on the CWB will 
leave the Board less vulnerable to challenges regarding international 
trade rules from our trade partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, which prides itself on promoting orderly and harmonious 
marketing of agricultural products, can only be glad that the Canadian 
Wheat Board has greater flexibility in marketing its products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, major advantages to streamlining the Canadian 
Wheat Board's operating method and making it more functional.  However, 
with billion dollar transactions involved, what mechanisms will be 
introduced to ensure good risk management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Quebec taxpayers are not ready to see their tax 
dollars go toward making up the Canadian Wheat Board's deficits. It will 
be recalled that these deficits were in the several hundreds of millions 
of dollars in 1991.  Business is business.  This is a marketing agency 
that must be able to assume its deficits in the long term if there are 
annual losses. 
Let us hope that the reserve fund does enough to allay that 
concern.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth pointing out that Quebec wheat purchasers, that is 
the mills and the bakeries, have appreciated the consistent quality 
of the products delivered under the auspices of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, and they hope those same quality standards will be 
maintained in future under Bill C-4.  There are provisions for 
implementation of quality control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of the bill raises some questions.  This is a bill 
for western Canada, since 95% of the volume administered by the CWB 
comes from the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and 
parts of Ontario and British Columbia, that is the region 
designated in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois must, however, look after the agricultural 
interests of Quebec, both its present and its future interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of clauses 24 through 26, which indicate that the 
CWB may, under certain conditions, recommend that certain types of 
grains be excluded from or added to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, leaves one confused.  The bill states 
that the minister may not make the recommendation for exclusion 
unless the board of directors so recommends and the Canadian Grain 
Commission has approved a procedure for identifying the grain in 
question, so as to preserve its identity. 
If the board is of the opinion that the exemption is significant, 
the producers will also have to vote on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, who are these producers?  How will they vote? 
And most of all, can they be from outside the designated region? 
In this connection, Quebec is justified in asking questions, since 
it has to go through the Canadian Wheat Board if it wants to 
export.  What if Quebec were to become an exporter of any of these 
products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government retains considerable control over the 
board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Let us hope that 
opening it up to the producers is something real, and not just 
caving in to community pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 contains a good 60 references to the minister.  The 
federal government is, therefore, maintaining considerable control 
over the Canadian Wheat Board.  For example, the federal government 
is the one to decide how farmers will be elected to the board of 
directors. 
The president of the board of directors is appointed by the 
governor in council on the recommendation of the minister.  Why can 
the elected directors elect the president of the board but not the 
president of the commission? The president holds office for the 
period of time set by the federal government.  The government is 
also requiring the Canadian Wheat Board to prepare a corporate plan 
annually, under clause 19.  Obviously, the Minister of Finance must 
approve the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this right of review, the Minister of Finance retains 
control.  How much autonomy will the Canadian Wheat Board have?  On 
the one hand, the government allows farmers to speak when it can no 
longer stand the pressure from the farming community.  On the 
other, the government is keeping the decisions affecting them 
centralized.  You wonder who really has their hand on the tiller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois will be on the watch.

Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence this bill is a further refinement of the previous 
Bill C-72 of the last Parliament on which the agriculture 
committee held extensive hearings across the Canadian Wheat Board 
area.  This new bill encompasses much of what we heard from the 
farm community during those hearings and tries to establish a 
balance between the various views within the farm community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hold strong views on the Canadian Wheat Board and personally 
maintain that commissioners appointed for their expertise and 
marketing still makes a lot of sense but I am, based on views put 
forward by the farm community during those hearings, willing to 
accept the approach of the board of directors and the kind of 
flexibility that Bill C-4 encompasses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would express to those strong Canadian Wheat Board supporters 
that they will have to be extremely vigilant in the election 
process because big money from the merchants of grain with allies 
like we have just heard from the Reform Party is really out to 
destroy the Canadian Wheat Board over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that those strong supporters of the wheat board be 
very vigilant in terms of seeing that people are elected to that 
board who are pro-wheat board supporters, as we have shown can 
happen through the Canadian Wheat Board advisory process through 
which the majority of pro-board supporters were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board has shown itself to be a model, an 
institution second to none in marketing intelligence and ability 
through its operating structure to maximize returns back to 
primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three pillars of single desk selling, pooling of returns and 
government guarantees are essential for the Canadian Wheat Board 
to maximize those returns back to primary producers. Those 
pillars remain under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Canadian Wheat Board is to sell western Canadian 
wheat and barley in the international marketplace at the very 
best possible price.  All proceeds from sales less the marketing 
costs are then passed back to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With annual revenues of more than $5.8 billion, the Canadian 
Wheat Board is one of the country's largest exporters and one of 
the world's largest grain trading organizations.  That is very 
different from the private grain companies that often work on 
exploitation of primary producers, the kind of system that Reform 
members opposite seem to support.  The wheat board works on 
farmers' behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its founding in 1935, the Canadian Wheat Board has been 
able to return premiums to farmers through pooling and single 
desk selling.  Its status as a single desk seller of western 
Canadian wheat and barley exports has given strength and market 
power to prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today instead of competing against one another, Canada's 110,000 
wheat and barley farmers sell as one and can therefore command a 
higher price for their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single desk selling also enables the Canadian Wheat Board to 
take a unique approach to market development.  It is both product 
and consumer oriented in nature, resulting in long term 
relationships and a better consumer understanding of Canadian 
grain.  Longer term marketing relationships are to the benefit of 
farmers and all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Canadian Wheat Board all sales are deposited in one 
of four pool accounts, wheat, durum wheat, feed barley or 
designated barley.  This ensures that all farmers benefit equally 
regardless of when their grain is sold during the crop year.  The 
system of initial in term adjustments and final payment has 
worked well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even that will be improved in this legislation and the 
government will continue to guarantee the initial price.  As 
well, the government continues to guarantee the Canadian Wheat 
Board's borrowings.  This allows the CWB to finance its 
operations at lower rates of interest, again to the benefit of 
farmers and the country as a whole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board, without a doubt, has provided 
exceptional service to western Canadian farmers for more than 
half a century.  The 1995-96 annual report tabled in this House 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A performance evaluation conducted during the 1995-96 crop year 
showed Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as 
quality of product, customer service, technical support and 
dependability of supply. Another study conducted by three 
economists showed that the CWB's single desk system generates an 
additional $265 million per year in wheat revenue for farmers, 
thereby enhancing Canada's competitiveness.  It also showed the 
CWB provides a low cost marketing service to farmers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I should mention is what our competitors are 
saying.  To those who want to undermine the ability of the wheat 
board, let me quote what our competitors are saying in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Carlson of the National Farmer's Union said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a competing farmer's perspective, we in the U.S. do not 
have a vehicle like the CWB to create producer marketing power in 
the international grain trade.  We basically sell for the best 
price among our local elevator companies and lose our interest in 
our grain after that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our export trade is dominated by a few large corporations who 
are interested in buying low and selling high to enhance the 
earnings of their owners, who are not generally the same 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we destroy the various institutions that farmers in many 
countries have built to help themselves survive economically, we 
will have nothing left but producers standing bare among the 
ruins of structures that once empowered and protected them in a 
marketplace dominated by giants. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective through this legislation, Bill C-4, is to continue 
to empower our farmers and make the Canadian Wheat Board an even 
better marketing institution.  I would show these Reformers 
opposite the annual report of the Canadian Wheat Board, 
“Marketing for the Future”, and that is what this legislation 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this legislation, our government is responding to 
recommendations made by farmers with concrete action.  Under Bill 
C-4, 10 out 15 Canadian Wheat Board directors will be elected by 
prairie farmers before the end of 1998.  That establishes the 
two-thirds majority farmers called for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be changes to the Canadian Wheat Board's 
marketing mandate and greater empowerment for farmers.  There 
will be changes to allow more flexibility in wheat board 
operations and improvements in cash flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under Bill C-4 the Canadian Wheat Board will be 
able to adjust management adjustment payments during any crop 
year much more quickly by removing the need to first obtain 
cabinet approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also provides for a contingency fund to manage 
risk consolidated with cash trading.  As the minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board has said, the operations of the CWB 
will also be improved by the access it will have to modern risk 
management tools that would allow a forward contracting system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these changes, along with many other important 
adjustments proposed in Bill C-4, will effectively build on the 
principle of more direct producer input into the priorities and 
operations of the Canadian Wheat Board while also enabling the 
Canadian Wheat Board to become an even more flexible and 
effective marketing agent for western Canadian grain farmers in 
the century ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it says on the cover of the wheat board annual report, 
“Marketing for the Future”, this government is willing to 
empower the Canadian Wheat Board while those opposite are wanting 
to undermine it.  We will succeed in the empowerment of the wheat 
board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate on Bill 
C-4.  As a matter of fact I am so enthused I was able to persuade 
my colleague the member for Qu'Appelle to share his 10 minutes. 
So we will be taking five minutes each on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying that those who forget the lessons of 
history are doomed to repeat them.  We have seen the Reform Party 
members stand in this House and try to give a little history 
lesson as it has been rewritten by the Reform Party, not quite 
going back to the dirty thirties where there were no marketing 
boards working co-operatively to market farmers' grains in this 
country.  They fail to remember that part of history where 
farmers were having a very difficult struggle in this country to 
make ends meet but we will see what happens down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament the NDP caucus opposed Bill C-72 which is 
now Bill C-4 which is before the House.  We opposed it as it was 
originally introduced in December 1996 for a number of reasons 
and I want to summarize some of those reasons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was cash buying. The board's great strength and its success 
are based on its practice of buying grain from farmers at an 
initial price, marketing it as a single desk seller and 
distributing any surplus earnings equitably as final payments. We 
were concerned about provisions in Bill C-72 for the board to buy 
grain for cash from anyone, anywhere at any time.  We felt cash 
buying had the potential to undermine the board and as a result 
farmers' confidence in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were concerned about governance.  Given the language of 
former Bill C-72 we feared that the government and not farmers 
would control the board's destiny. For example it was not clear 
then how many directors there would be.  Nor was it clear how 
many of the directors would be appointed by the minister and how 
many would be elected by the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the member for Palliser has outlined what changes 
have been made as a result of our interventions in the previous 
Parliament.  Of course two-thirds of the board are now going to 
be elected in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also retained the power to appoint the chair of the 
board of directors as well as the president of the board. This 
has not been changed in Bill C-4.  We still support this 
component of the remake of the CWB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerned us most was that Bill C-72 allowed for the 
exclusion of grains from the wheat board's jurisdiction but made 
no parallel provisions for grains to be added to that 
jurisdiction.  We felt that this was clearly hostile to the board 
and we could not understand why this provision was in the 
legislation. For the information of the House it is now in Bill 
C-4 and we are very pleased that grains are being included as 
opposed to being excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-72 was introduced in December 1996 but the legislation 
was soon overtaken by events.  The minister decided that farmers 
should vote on whether they wished to continue to market export 
barley through the wheat board.  In a certain sense he was 
experimenting with the exclusion clause of Bill C-72 even before 
it became law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The barley vote occurred amid great controversy.  A few farmers 
who were stubbornly opposed to the board had earlier chosen to 
break the law.  Rather than sell to the board, they ran to the 
border with truckloads of grain. Some of these farmers and their 
soulmates in the Reform Party and the National Citizens' 
Coalition as well continued to use every available opportunity to 
attack the wheat board as we have heard today in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta government even mounted a constitutional challenge 
to the board's right to buy and sell grain on behalf of farmers. 
The courts have now spoken, ruling in the board's favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But all of that is history.  As we know the barley vote was held 
last February and the great majority of farmers left no doubt as 
to where they stand.  Fully two-thirds of barley growers voted to 
continue to have the wheat board act as the single desk seller 
for their grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party always boasts about how democratic it is, about 
how it believes in referenda and plebiscites as a means of making 
political decisions.  Here is a perfect opportunity for Reform 
Party members. Two out of three farmers voted in favour of wheat 
board marketing.  We might expect that Reform would now honour 
its commitment to democracy and accept the wishes of the 
majority. But as I said earlier, those who forget the lessons of 
history are doomed to repeat them and that is Reform's tombstone 
in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party rhetoric is one thing and principled action is 
completely something else as far as Reformers are concerned. 
Based on what I have seen and heard from Reformers, they will 
continue to attack the wheat board.  They have no intention of 
respecting the wishes of the majority of farmers when it comes to 
the wheat board.  I think that speaks volumes about the integrity 
of that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to congratulate former New Democratic Party 
members Vic Althouse and Len Taylor who worked very hard in the 
committee prior to the election being called to establish some of 
these major changes on behalf of the wheat board, on behalf of 
farmers throughout Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to say a few words today in support of Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the CCF and the NDP over the last 50 or 60 years 
has been one of supporting the Canadian Wheat Board and fighting 
very hard for orderly marketing in other marketing boards in this 
country.  I am very proud to say that in the last Parliament our 
small caucus was able to persuade the government to come forth 
with a stronger bill which is why we can support this bill in 
principle today.  At the committee stage of course we will be 
moving amendments to improve the bill further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the record that we strongly support single desk 
marketing in this country.  It is a principle which is supported 
by the vast majority of farmers right across this country.  We 
saw that recently in February 1997 when two-thirds of the barley 
producers voted in favour of marketing their barley through the 
Canadian Wheat Board, through single desk marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is hypocritical.  I do not even know if it 
should be called Reform.  Sometimes it is the deform party.  It 
opposes the Canadian Wheat Board and has called for dual 
marketing. Meanwhile it says that it wants referenda for 
everything.  It says that it is a grassroots party. Remember the 
rhetoric of its leader saying that it is a grassroots party and 
that it will listen to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two-thirds of the people have spoken, the barley producers. And 
where are the Reform Party members?  Are they in the House saying 
that barley should be marketed through the Canadian Wheat Board? 
No they are not.  They are silent.  On the one hand they say 
there should be referenda.  There was a referendum.  The farmers 
said very clearly that they wanted their barley to be marketed 
through the Canadian Wheat Board and that is the way it is going 
to be.  Yet the Reform Party members are silent on the issue. 
They do not believe their own rhetoric.  They do not fulfil their 
campaign promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers have spoken, the grassroots have spoken, the people 
have spoken.  Where is the Reform Party?  Reformers are not 
listening to the people.  They have broken their word.  They have 
broken their promises. It is about time Reformers were called to 
task for their hypocrisy, called to task for breaking promises, 
called to task for misleading the farmers of this country.  This 
is only one example of where they have broken their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have another promise.  Recall.  Where are those prairie MPs 
who said they would listen to the farmers? They should be 
recalled.  There should be petitions recalling those prairie MPs. 
They have said one thing and done the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition said “I would never move into

bingo hall”.  Where is the Leader of the Opposition resting his 
head at night?  Where is he dreaming at night?  In Stornoway. 
What hypocrisy we are seeing from the Reform Party.

hanging their heads in shame.  The right wing Neanderthals of the

time they were exposed to the farmers of this country.  It is 
time they were exposed to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, first I 
would like to offer my apologies for a raspy, scratchy voice.  I 
beg the indulgence of members of the House to hear me out this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate you on your appointment to 
the Chair.  I am sure you will do a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being my first opportunity to give a speech in the House 
during this Parliament, I want to take the opportunity to say 
thanks to my constituents for returning me to the House of 
Commons for a third term.  I thank them for placing their 
confidence in me once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I am happy to speak on Bill C-4 is because 
the Canadian Wheat Board's home is in my city, the city of 
Winnipeg.  In fact many employees of the Canadian Wheat Board are 
constituents of mine who live in the riding of 
Charleswood—Assiniboine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline some of the changes which distinguish 
the new bill from its previous incarnation in the last 
Parliament, that is Bill C-72.  I would also like to detail the 
proposed amendments that are aimed at both rejuvenating and 
modernizing the Canadian Wheat Board and putting control over its 
activities squarely in the hands of producers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout its 62-year history the board has been an agent of 
the crown answerable solely to the Government of Canada and 
governed by a small group of up to five commissioners.  Bill C-4 
provides for a big and immediate change in the way the board is 
governed.  Under this proposed legislation a board of 15 
directors of whom 10 would be directly elected by producers would 
govern the operation of the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore under the new bill the Canadian Wheat Board would 
become a mixed enterprise, and for the first time in its lengthy 
history it would become accountable in a very direct way to the 
producers it serves.  This means that producers will have a 
larger and more direct voice in the way in which their marketing 
system operates.  These changes are consistent with the majority 
recommendations put forth by the Western Grain Marketing Panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of the members of the House may recall, in 1995 an 
extensive consultative process was undertaken that involved 
literally tens of thousands of producers across western Canada. 
The goal of that process was to determine how best to revitalize 
and modernize the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It 
culminated in a set of recommendations made by the Western Grain 
Marketing Panel in July 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the debate among western farmers with respect to grain 
marketing is a sharply polarized one, it makes it all but 
impossible to arrive at one all-encompassing solution.  The 
minister responsible for the wheat board has listened to the 
concerns of western farmers and has answered their calls for a 
more responsive, accountable and accessible wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is before the House today in the form of Bill C-4, 
an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts.  This legislation 
proposes major changes to the Canadian Wheat Board that will 
empower farmers as never before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed from Bill C-72?  Although Bill C-4 resembles 
very closely Bill C-72, there are a few changes that 
differentiate it from its predecessor.  Foremost among these is 
the elimination of the interim appointed board of directors 
provided for in Bill C-72.  This was to be a transitional 
measure, however the government has responded to farmers who saw 
no need for this step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-4 the Canadian Wheat Board would be governed by a 
board of directors with a majority of its members elected by 
farmers and accountable to them.  I repeat elected to farmers and 
accountable to farmers.  This board of directors should be in 
place by December 1998 at the very latest.  Ideally it would be 
in place as soon as next spring.  The draft bill no longer 
provides for an interim bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major change in Bill C-4 is the provision that allows 
for the inclusion or exclusion of grains under the Canadian Wheat 
Board's mandate.  Similar to an amendment tabled by my colleague 
the hon. member for Malpeque during the last Parliament, this 
provides that such a change in the Canadian Wheat Board's mandate 
can only be triggered if certain conditions are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If producers wish to remove a type of grain from the mandate of 
the board, they will be able to do so subject to three 
conditions.  First there must be a recommendation to do so from 
the board of directors.  Second the Canadian Grain Commission 
must approve an identity preservation system to ensure quality 
standards remain intact.  Remember Canada has a great reputation 
when it comes to our wheat and we want to maintain that.  Third 
if the exclusion is viewed as significant by the board of 
directors, a vote among producers must be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly if producers wish to add additional grains to the 
wheat board's mandate, this too could be possible subject to 
three specific conditions.  First the farm organization 
representing the producers of that commodity must make a written 
request for the inclusion.  Second the inclusion would have to be 
recommended by the wheat board's board of directors.  Third 
producers themselves must vote in favour of the addition. That is 
pretty democratic in my estimation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new provisions are balanced and fair both ways for either 
exclusions or inclusions.  In either case the decision making 
authority lies where it should be, directly with producers 
themselves. The clear goal is to put farmers in the driver's seat 
when it comes to any future changes in what grains the wheat 
board markets.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that when Bill C-72 was originally 
drafted, both the Financial Administration Act and the Canada 
Business Corporations Act were used as models for various 
provisions. Subsequently it was decided that it would be more 
appropriate if provisions in the CWB act relating to the duties 
of directors and officers were the same as those in the Canada 
Business Corporations Act which applies to private sector 
corporations. Accordingly, a few revisions have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite might wish to note that references to 
employees in provisions relating to the duty of care, duty to 
comply, limit of liability and indemnification have been deleted. 
These changes will result in employees of the Canadian wheat 
board being placed in the same position as employees of any 
corporation. To me that makes a lot of sense.  If they are 
acting in good faith and within the scope of their employment, 
then they would have the same protection under common law as 
would employees of private corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the directors and officers of the Canadian wheat board 
they will naturally be required to abide by the law. They will 
also have the duty to act honestly and in good faith, exercising 
all reasonable care, diligence and skill.  If they fail in that 
duty they will expose themselves to legal liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the changes that I have mentioned, all of the 
amendments made to Bill C-72 in the last Parliament have been 
retained in Bill C-4.  It reflects the essence of the 
Western Canadian Marketing Panel's recommendations on Canadian 
wheat board governance and operational flexibility and also 
establishes the criteria and general process for making changes 
to the wheat board's marketing mandate. These changes usher in a 
new era of accountability and flexibility within the Canadian 
Wheat Board, ensuring that it is well positioned to compete with 
in the global marketplace as the dawn of a new millennium 
approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has roughly a 20% share of the world market in grain. 
This is in no small way as a direct result of our having a single 
desk seller of wheat and barely that combines size, global reach 
and marketing clout to bring about the best possible returns from 
its world markets.  Because of the not for profit nature of the 
Canadian Wheat Board the cost to farmers for the premiums 
commanded by the board amount to mere pennies per bushel.  This 
is well worth reiterating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, on a point of order.  I 
understand that the member is at least three minutes over his 
time. Every member has been tightly constricted in the debate, 
including the Leader of the Opposition.  I would ask that the 
Chair enforce the time limits on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  As far as I know, 
there is no problem on the time.  Everything has been according 
to the chronometer.  The member has 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand that I have 
only a few seconds left. After all, I was given 10 minutes as 
everyone else was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to this bill's moving on to committee and I am 
sure that it will be vetted and examined there very closely and 
we will have a vigorous debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate you on your elevation to 
your new position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my constituents that this is the first time I have had 
a chance to speak at any great length in the House and I really 
appreciate being returned to the House after a short vacation of 
three and a half years.  I am certainly pleased to be back and I 
will do my best to represent their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4, the Canadian Wheat Board bill, is a difficult issue. 
It is very complicated and there are a lot of stakeholders and 
many positions, as my colleague from Brandon—Souris reported a 
while ago.  The government had to take a position on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four options available. It could get rid of the 
Canadian Wheat Board altogether which 37% of farmers recently 
voted in favour of, quite an astounding vote to toss the wheat 
board out completely.  This certainly expresses a great deal of 
frustration and anger for 37% of the people to say throw it away 
and we will go our own way.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second choice would be to leave the status quo, and I do not 
thank anyone agrees that is a realistic possibility.  The third 
option would be change the board and have influence from the 
primary producers, and this is what Bill C-4 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have preferred some voluntary participation so that 
farmers would have a choice.  How would the fast food industry 
react if a small group or majority group of fast food operators 
said that all fast food operators would operate a certain way 
without choices?  This would not be acceptable.  It would be the 
same with the steel industry and with the fishermen in my part of 
the country.  If a majority of fishermen said they were going to 
sell their fish and produce to a certain group of people and that 
the rest of the fishermen would have to comply, it would not be 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers should have an option.  It should be voluntary 
participation in the Canadian Wheat Board like every other 
industry.  This goes well with the general direction of global 
economy and privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are willing to support certain aspects of this bill but we 
will require amendments.  We will be making positive amendments, 
not nuisance amendments.  One area we are concerned about is the 
inclusion clause.  We do not understand it nor do we understand 
the purpose of it. There is no support from the farmers we have 
talked to.  It seems to be a backward step in the age of global 
economy and privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exclusion clause is positive and it does acknowledge the 
needs and the desires of some people to have voluntary inclusion 
in the program.  But it is very complex and vary cumbersome to 
implement the exclusion clause.  We would like it made a little 
more flexible and available to more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten out of fifteen people on the board of directors are from the 
industry.  Four of the fifteen members and the CEO will be 
appointed.  The previous speaker said he wanted to put farmers in 
the driver's seat.  If we are going to put them in the driver's 
seat why do we not let them drive and have all of the board 
members from the industry rather than just ten? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario the industry drives the system.  In the Ontario Wheat 
Board all members are elected.  We do not see why the members of 
the Canadian Wheat Board are not also elected.  The CEO should 
definitely be elected from the board, by the board of directors, 
as in any other format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indemnification clause bothers us.  The board members are 
allowed to set their own pay, benefits and make all the 
decisions. It says, however, that they will not be responsible 
for any errors or omissions.  This is unacceptable.  They must be 
responsible if they are responsible for their own pay, benefits 
and working conditions.  In any case this is still a monopoly the 
way it is set up.  There must be accountability.  The way Bill 
C-4 sets it up there is indemnification and there is no 
responsibility on behalf of the board members.  With a monopoly 
there must be openness.  There must be access to information, 
freedom of information and there must be accountability.  We will 
probably put forward an amendment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area which was brought to our attention by industry 
people is the contingency fund.  If farmers are to take the 
responsibility for the contingency fund and not the federal 
government, why are there still five federal appointees on the 
board?  Farmers see no place for the federal government's board 
members if they are to be responsible for the fund.  They think 
all members should be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big hole in Bill C-4 the way I see it as the 
transportation critic.  Transportation is not mentioned in the 
bill at all and there are no issues with respect to 
transportation.  The second biggest issue in grain handling in 
this country is transportation.  It involves every aspect of the 
business, rail operators, elevator operators, port operators, 
pilotage organizations, pool operators and the primary producers, 
the farmers.  Most people we have talked to have indicated that 
the issue of transportation is equal to all others. It must be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect that is extremely cumbersome is that the Canadian 
Wheat Board has total control over the allocation of wheat cars. 
This makes it almost impossible for the farmers to have access to 
the cars.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that empty ships are waiting in Vancouver harbour and 
full train cars are sitting in the port of Vancouver but with the 
wrong product.  The wheat board has determined that the wrong 
product should be shipped to port.  It is a mistake.  We think 
this should be completely reviewed and the primary producers 
should be involved in what grain goes in what train cars and is 
delivered to what port and when.  They must play a role in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is pilotage charges.  It has been brought our 
attention that pilotage charges are expensive.  With new 
technology there is no need for these pilotage charges, 
especially on the west coast.  In the end the grain industry pays 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pushing for a review of the Canadian Wheat Board issues 
and on wheat transportation issues in general.  We believe the 
system cannot respond quickly anymore to changing market demands. 
There is no accountability in the transportation system in the 
wheat transportation business.  There is no penalty for 
non-performance.  Many market opportunities are missed because of 
full train cars sitting on the wharf, empty ships in the harbour 
and the wrong grain in the train cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system is designed to fail in the global economy.  It 
clings to the assumptions of a bygone age and it means the system 
cannot work.  We think the system must change and we have a plan. 
We would like to see the new system have accountability. Farmers 
are accountable for delivering the right grain in a timely 
manner.  Railways are accountable for moving grain according to 
agreed on terms.  Shippers are accountable for loading the grain 
at the right time in the right place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think market forces should be responsible.  We think market 
forces should determine what grain goes where and when.  We think 
those people who buy grain should determine when it moves, not 
the people producing it and not the people in the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  The demand should determine what grain goes where.  We 
think there should be just in time delivery so farmers do not 
have grain sitting in elevators for months at a time or sitting 
in train cars at the port of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things.  We want choice for the grain companies. 
We want them to have choices for transportation as much as 
possible.  We want transparencies so the rules are clear to all 
participants in the system.  We want a reasonable transportation 
cost.  As much as the Canadian Wheat Board is a monopoly, so is 
the rail system a monopoly.  With deregulation and changes in 
rail costs coming down, the transportation costs for wheat should 
be coming down.  They are not.  We would like to see some control 
over costs that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot to say on this bill.  We want it to proceed but we 
want it to proceed with the amendments the industry is demanding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as a 
quick comment on the final remarks of the previous speaker, I 
suggest this is the Wheat Board Act.  There has been a great deal 
of work done in the transportation department and the 
transportation committee on the issue of grain transportation and 
some of the problems in developing a truly competitive rail 
system.  I do not think that is something contained in this 
legislation and we should not detract from the importance of this 
legislation in trying to solve a separate problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister responsible for the wheat board for 
what has been a truly Herculean task.  The minister has worked 
for more than two years consulting with producers throughout 
Canada.  This is a service to more than 110,000 Canadian farm 
families.  It directly affects their livelihood and you do not 
undertake changes to such a program without careful consideration 
and consultation within that community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has done a superb job and is to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the city of Winnipeg.  I do not farm.  I live in an 
urban centre.  Urban centres right across the prairies are 
enormously impacted by the health of the agricultural community. 
The large grain companies and the wheat board itself are located 
in Winnipeg along with the commodities exchange and a host of 
suppliers that make their living on the effectiveness of the work 
done in the farming communities around the urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus in my remarks today on the whole issue of 
accountability and democratization.  The minister has made a very 
prudent step in his move to open up the operations of the wheat 
board to control five producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised by the reaction of the Reform Party. 
Like the member for Qu'Appelle pointed out, members of the Reform 
Party came into the House in the last session, in the last 
campaign and now in this session talking about the importance of 
taking direction from their voters, the importance of listening 
to their constituents and acting in their best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of another circumstance when it has been clearer 
what producers want.  A small number of producers would like to 
see the board abandoned completely now, but a substantial 
majority of producers, and not 50 plus 1, want exactly the kind 
of changes the minister is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand what part of democracy the Reform Party does 
not like.  A majority of members of the new wheat board will be 
elected directly by producers.  It is unclear what members 
opposite are objecting to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will be more flexible.  It will be more accountable. 
Producers will have the opportunity to make major management 
decisions such as excluding certain types of grain from the 
control of the board.  I was interested in the remarks of the 
Conservative member who referred to including certain types of 
grain.  That member supported the exclusion but had grave 
concerns about the inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what democracy is all about?  If we tell farmers 
they are empowered to make decisions following a process that 
consults with the producers, and as in the act a vote must be 
taken, what does the member of the Reform Party fear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a significant majority of producers vote in favour of 
including something in the wheat board, are they not the ones to 
make that decision?  Similarly if they vote to exclude something, 
are they not the ones to make that decision?  Is that not what we 
have heard across the floor in the last four years from the 
Reform Party, that we should trust people to make the decisions 
in their own best interests?  That is what the minister has tried 
very hard to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a balanced approach.  It is a big step.  It does not go 
all the way to full democratization, but it certainly takes us 
down that road and puts control directly in the hands of 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about five basic principles.  It is about empowering 
producers.  It is about putting authority where producers have 
always wanted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my friend in the Reform Party to consider all producers. 
Let us not just be concerned about a few large producers along 
the American border.  Let us consider what the wheat board has 
always been charged to do along with the rights and needs of all 
producers.  Let us trust in producers as a group to make 
decisions which should properly be made by them because it has a 
direct impact on their livelihood.  The bill enshrines that 
authority.  It enshrines the democratic process that outlines the 
authority those duly elected members will have in the management 
of the new wheat board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised to hear the opposition of the member 
for Portage—Lisgar to the new accountability provisions.  I 
heard him speak about the need for the wheat board to be more 
accountability, yet when we take that action in the bill he wants 
to toss it out.  I am a little puzzled by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will have access to audited financial statements.  It 
will have access to all the operational information it needs to 
make decisions about the proper functioning of the wheat board. 
The board will have control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has enhanced powers in its overall flexibility.  The board 
can make the decision to include or exclude types of grain.  It 
can make the decision about how it will market.  I fail to 
understand the concern of the member for Portage—Lisgar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does something the government has tried to do in a 
great many areas, that is open up the processes of governance and 
hand over to people directly affected in a community the right 
and responsibility for the management of that entity.  We have 
seen it with the moves in the transportation industry.  We have 
seen it with the moves in the establishment of independent, arm's 
length agencies, in research infrastructure and now in 
scholarships.  We are saying that governments can step back and 
can trust the community to make those decisions.

constantly preaches this process refuses to support it.

is always a pleasure to sit in the House, listen and learn, and 
then give the opposition some good advice and perhaps explain a 
term or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg South asked me why we could not 
support democracy.  In the last election were there only 
Conservatives and Liberals on the ballot?  Were there not Reform 
and NDP candidates?  When we vote on the Canadian Wheat Board, 
why do we not have on the ballot single desk selling, open market 
or voluntary wheat board?  Why do we not have four options?  To 
me democracy is a clear vote with no argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we elected our chairman.  I wanted to ask the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to the minister for the wheat board how 
he explains democracy and I was ruled out of order.  To me 
democracy is a vote by a secret ballot, not one with a policeman 
standing at the door and counting fingers.  That is not 
democracy.  I have seen that type of democracy in the Soviet 
Union and in Eastern Bloc countries but not in democracies like 
Canada, the United States and Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all for democracy.  I am for a free vote on the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  Everybody has hammered me because I do not 
represent farmers.  Let us ask members across the way how many 
rural Liberal or NDP members there are from Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and Alberta?  Not very many.  They cannot hold one to a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  None, none, at all.  Is it democracy to 
have somebody in Ottawa dictating to farmers in western Canada 
what they have to do, no matter what the price? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not listen to the latest ruling by Judge Huband in 
Manitoba on the wheat board court case.  He said the wheat board 
had no accountability to farmers.  It does not have to maximize 
prices.  All it is obliged to do under the wheat board act is to 
move grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that representing farmers?  For goodness' sake, to me that is 
distortion.  Perhaps I am getting a little strong with my words. 
Maybe I had better tone down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The farmers spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  The hon. member from the NDP talked 
about accountability and equality.  I wish he would explain it to 
me.  When his MP pension plan is about $2 million and my farmers 
are starving, where is the accountability?  How did the NDP vote 
on the MP pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  How come he did not run in Yorkton this 
time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  I wonder why he did not run in 
Yorkton.  I do not think there were many farmers there.  He 
needed the farmers.  He wanted them to vote for him, did he not, 
or why did he move? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting House in which to sit and listen to these 
people talking about democracy, accountability and equality.  As 
long as somebody in Ottawa can tell us what to do in western 
Canada it is accountability and it is democracy.  When we in 
western Canada send 60 Reform MPs representing all the rural 
areas we say what farmers need.  They want a voluntary wheat 
board, a wheat board that can market all grain and get the best 
price for them.  But that is not equality, that is no good, 
according to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  They voted on the wheat board advisory. 
They were 100% in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  They voted on the advisory board. I 
thank the hon. member for bringing that out.  I do not have Mr. 
Harder, the advisory board chairman, in my riding but I was 
interested in what kind of accountability and prestige he had in 
his riding.  I went to the returning officer and checked the 
figures on the votes the Liberals and the NDP got in the two 
polls where Mr. Harder, the big defender of the wheat board, was 
working against Reform tooth and nail.  The results were 25 for 
the Liberals, 78 for Reform, 18 for the Liberals and 72 for 
Reform.  That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a flood in Manitoba.  It was very interesting when 
they were campaigning.  All of a sudden I saw Liberals waving 
$5,000 cheques and saying “Vote for the Liberals and you will 
get compensation.  Just vote for us”.  There were 12 Liberal 
candidates in Manitoba and 6 of them floated down the Red River 
with their $5,000 cheques.  They are gone, gone for good.  That 
is what I call democracy.  That is accountability.  If we do not 
deliver what we say then down the river and out into the lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in western Canada want equality.  They want 
accountability.  They want democracy.  They want the option of a 
voluntary wheat board, a single desk or open market.  That is all 
they ask.  When we look at the CTV-<I>Maclean's</I> poll, farmers 
are in the most honourable profession in Canada.  Let us look 
where politicians are:  right on the bottom just above lawyers. 
It is accountability when they are placed according to order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a real nice experience to listen to the debate 
today.  I hope they will ask me for the judgment of Judge Huband 
to read how accountable the wheat board is.  When the wheat board 
mandate is only to get rid of grain no matter what the price that 
is not accountability.  Accountability is to get a fair market 
price distributed to each farmer.  If the wheat board is not 
prepared to do that it should get out of the business.  Everybody 
else will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the canola industry, the flax industry and the 
rye industry.  Farmers are moving them.  They are getting decent 
prices.  They are progressing.  Look at the wheat board grains. 
They are going down, down, down. Very soon we will not have any 
wheat with which to make our bread. That is what is happening to 
wheat board grains.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently had a provincial byelection in Portage.  It is 
Portage—Lisgar for the information of the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South. Reform got over 15% of the votes without a party 
to back it up, just behind the Liberals.  Not only did we do 
well, we got rid of another two Liberal MLAs in the legislature. 
They resigned because they were so disillusioned with the lousy 
political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am very new to the House, but it was my understanding 
that we were debating Bill C-4 today and not the recent 
byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In the opinion of 
the Chair the hon. member was relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to look 
at the last clause of the bill.  If a wheat board manager or a 
wheat board employee is found to be in civil disobedience or is 
caught in a criminal act what happens to them?  The liability 
comes back to the farmer who has entrusted that employee with the 
grain. That is responsibility.  I have to pay the liability for 
the guy skimming my grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I hire a man and he steals my pick-up truck and I call the 
police and they arrest him and put him in jail, will I have to 
pay the fine?  Will I have to pay him for the time he spends in 
prison? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how ridiculous this bill is.  It takes the liability 
away from the government, which is forcing this bill on farmers 
and placing the liability on producers.  I have never heard of 
something like that happening in a democracy.  It really bothers 
me that that type of thing can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Huband said that Parliament should look into these 
irregularities and do what has to be done.  What did Parliament 
do when asked to act on these irregularities?  The solicitor 
general lost the documentation between here and Winnipeg D 
division.  It was gone.  I got kicked out of the House because I 
could not believe that was possible.  How can government, from 
the solicitor general to D division in Winnipeg, lose the 
documentation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill is about— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair rose 
because on that occasion, in the opinion of the Chair, the hon. 
member for Portage—Lisgar was straying from relevance to the 
bill on debate.  The member has about 30 seconds to wrap up his 
speech.  I would ask that he do so by speaking on the bill which 
we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very 
much.  I know that I will get the chance in the House one of 
these days to get an explanation of democracy from that side of 
the House because I still have not found that it gibes with what 
the dictionary says.  I would like to know who is right.  Is the 
Webster dictionary right about democracy or is the Liberal 
government right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill deals with.  Where is the accountability? 
Where is the equality?  Where is the democracy in this bill?  I 
do not see it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has been an 
interesting morning and afternoon discussing Bill C-4, an act 
regarding the Canadian Wheat Board.  It is something which the 
hon. member opposite from western Canada claims he knows a fair 
bit about.  What astounds me is that he talked about democracy. I 
know a little about democracy and I know that this bill speaks 
directly to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made a very firm pledge to listen to the 
producers.  It listens to the people who are affected by 
legislation.  That is exactly what Bill C-4 does.  It speaks 
exactly to the needs of producers and to consumers who enjoy the 
agricultural industry.  It is a Canadian industry.  It is not 
just a western Canadian industry.  That is why we are debating it 
here on the floor of the House of Commons. It is very important 
for us to discuss it.  I honour and respect the opinions of our 
colleagues from western Canada, our colleagues from Reform. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We too represent western Canada.  We are prepared to listen to 
their arguments, to their discussions and to their points.  That 
is exactly what we are doing here today.  We are referring this 
bill to committee prior to second reading.  That is what the 
debate today is about.  We are referring this bill to committee 
prior to second reading.  That is the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referral to committee prior to second reading allows members 
opposite and government members to provide greater input into the 
substance and structure of a bill.  It is an innovation that was 
created by the Liberal government in the last Parliament to allow 
opposition members and government members to provide greater 
substance to bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the democratic point of view that is a very important 
point, something we are not afraid of.  We are not afraid to 
listen to people who have opinions and want to have their 
opinions registered for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have come to a point where we are arguing—actually 
my colleagues opposite are arguing—whether or not this bill 
embraces democracy.  Clearly two-thirds of the board of directors 
of the Canadian Wheat Board will be representatives of the 
producers who are most directly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand a little something about democracy and I would 
suggest to the hon. speaker that clearly those who have a vested 
interest should be represented on the board.  That is clearly 
what Bill C-4 does. For the first time in the history of the 
wheat board we will actually have representative democracy. Those 
producers who are most directly affected by the actions and 
outcomes of the Canadian Wheat Board will have a direct say in 
its management and its structures.  That is representative 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar had to ask the 
question, what is democracy.  I can certainly understand why he 
would have to ask that.  He has intimated that he does not 
understand where democracy fits into this bill.  The farmers 
themselves are sitting on the board of directors of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  They are the ones who represent the associations, 
they are the ones who represent the farmers and they do the best 
job.  Two-thirds of the board of directors will be farmers and 
that is exactly what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Portage—Lisgar mentioned that his farmers 
are starving.  For 62 years the Canadian Wheat Board has been 
representing farmers and it has been doing a very good job. 
Stability in the wheat board process is very important and it is 
something that creates stability within the agricultural 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are prepared to create innovation because innovation is 
important.  We are creating innovation within this act to respond 
to the needs of the day.  Two-thirds of the directors of this 
organization will be from the producers themselves, and I find 
absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It is quite a good bill. It 
is a bill that meets the needs of the wheat industry.  The 
Canadian Wheat Board will now be more representative of those 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wheat exports have been increasing recently in part because of 
the efforts of the Canadian government and in large part because 
of the efforts of the Canadian Wheat Board.  We have actually 
seen increases in our export capability in this field.  We have 
seen increases in revenue, in the amount of value that is created 
from our agricultural community.  That is a very important point 
to add when we talk about the supposed inefficiencies of the 
wheat board.  Where do we get increases when there are supposed 
inefficiencies from this structure?  It is a good structure 
because it represents the needs of the people who are most 
interested in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me to address this in the House because the House 
deserves better decorum.  However, there has been a suggestion 
that the farmers who will sit as members of the board of 
directors for the Canadian Wheat Board will for some reason be 
corrupt and that this wheat board legislation will protect 
corrupt farmers.  That was the suggestion from the Reform Party. 
As they go around their constituencies making representations 
about the Canadian Wheat Board, they will suggest that the 
legislation allows inappropriate activity to go unharnessed and 
unabated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out the wording in the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act what we proposed directly follows the Canadian Business 
Incorporations Act and nothing more.  It follows exactly what 
every private sector firm incorporated under the rules of the 
Government of Canada follow today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they go about their riding consultation process are they 
going to point out that day after day as long as Reformers sit in 
the House, that they have indemnity from any sort of prosecution? 
That is a procedure they enjoy every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform members make inappropriate statements and members 
from the opposition benches make what some would consider 
inappropriate statements, it is the House of Commons and the 
people of Canada who will pay for their legal bills. That is 
amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members are discussing the fact that they feel this is 
completely inappropriate that farmers, those who sit on the board 
of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board should be completely 
open and susceptible to any charge or allegation, even if it 
comes from the benches of hon. members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a valid reason why we should have the same rules that 
govern every private sector forum in the country incorporated 
under the Canada business act that same respect should be given 
to the farmers who take the courage, time and energy to sit on 
the board of directors of this corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like hon. members opposite to point out when they go 
about their constituency consultations that they do not want 
farmers who sit on this board of directors to have any 
protections whatsoever, to have any sort of umbrella within the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  They should be able to do their business 
and not do things which are contrary to the laws of Canada as has 
been suggested, not to do things which are contrary to the best 
interests of farmers.  They should be allowed to just go about 
their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While members opposite enjoy parliamentary privilege day after 
day in the House of Commons, they would have farmers be 
susceptible to prosecution regardless of how frivolous the 
charge.  That is exactly what hon. members will not talk about as 
they go about their riding consultations, that they enjoy 
parliamentary privileges and that they will have their legal 
bills paid for by the House of Commons, yet they will not even 
extend part of that same privilege to anybody else. That is 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I come to my conclusion.  Soon we will refer this to 
committee before second reading.  It will be a great opportunity 
to work with my colleagues, to respect the wishes of farmers and 
to strengthen, not tear down, the Canadian Wheat Board.  Quite 
frankly, I believe hon. members opposite want to weaken it 
because they know it is a darned good Liberal innovation and it 
will strengthen our resolve in western Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to take a few minutes to send greetings to 
the people in my riding.  This is not the first time I have risen 
in this new Parliament, but this is my first speech.  I would 
therefore like to take a few minutes to acknowledge the people in 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know this is my second mandate.  I obtained 64% of the 
vote thanks to a fine team that stuck with me throughout the 
campaign, which led to a great victory on June 2.  The people 
placed their confidence in me.  That moves me deeply.  And I thank 
them very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all good faith, I would like to salute my opponents in the last 
election campaign, especially Clément Lajoie, the mayor of St. Bruno, a 
village in my riding, and Sabin Simard, the Conservative candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all candidates ran a respectful campaign. I say 
“candidates” because at the party level, it was another story. 
When you are facing in your riding a party like the Liberal Party 
of Canada, I can tell you that respect sometimes goes out the 
window. Let me tell you I did not appreciate the Liberal Party's 
little destabilization tactics in the middle of the campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was rumoured that we had not risen often enough in the House, 
while over not quite eight months I think I had risen more than 
70 times, which is quite a bit more than many members across the 
way. The word was going around that I attended only 80% of 
votes, when it is well known that one day a week, that is one day 
out of five or 20% of the time, I could not be here. They 
were trying to destabilize us in the middle of the campaign using 
this kind of lines. They played with public opinion by 
capitalizing on the fact that people are not necessarily familiar 
with how politics works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, what I find most disturbing is how much money these political 
parties have available. You probably know that, as a party, the Bloc 
Quebecois believe it is important not to have financial ties with 
business or corporate interests. That is why there are no corporate 
donations allowed in Quebec, only public funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in the middle of an election campaign, you find yourself 
pitted against political parties that take donations from large 
corporations, I find it extremely painful to have a policy to that 
effect, especially considering how they get their financing. 
This was made obvious recently during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, Mr. Speaker, as I can see you watching the clock, while 
I will not rend my clothes over this issue, I certainly would have a lot 
to say on the matter, but there is nothing to worry about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be upset with how things were done in the past, as I said, 
but fear not, I am looking to the future. In fact, I am absolutely 
thrilled about the future. Because the future means 44 Bloc members. It 
means the year 2000 and a new country. This will require a third 
referendum, and this time the yes side will win. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask please, 
that we stay somewhere close to the bill that we are debating 
which is of course the wheat board bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B>  Certainly, Mr. Speaker.  I am getting 
there. But the folks in our ridings deserve a nod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of my riding— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised to hear you call a member to order by censoring 
his arguments.  On every occasion that we have risen in this House, we 
have made the connection between the bill now before us and certain 
objectives that our party has.  I am very surprised to hear the young 
member interrupted and told that he must say this or that, when the 
other parties are not treated this way. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, hon. 
member, the Chair does not consider that to be a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that it is sort of 
a tradition for one's maiden speech to concentrate a bit more on 
local affairs.  That was the reason I thought it important to 
mention a few facts.  But, as you wish, I will move right along. 
I had some nice things to say, but out of respect for the Chair, 
and for this democratic institution, the Parliament of Canada, I 
will move on to my comments on Bill C-4.  I do so with respect, 
because I hold this institution in respect.  In Quebec, we have 
respect for democracy.  I did want to mention the third 
referendum, which is not far off.  I hope that this institution 
will respect Quebeckers' upcoming decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in connection with Bill C-4, I wanted to mention an 
agricultural initiative in my riding, the Coopérative Grains D'OR.  The 
co-operative's 225 shareholders have set up a grain centre, which means 
they can process and package their own crops.  I am telling you this 
because it brings me to today's debate on the bill to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as I said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to the 
bill. It is a worthwhile piece of legislation which will ensure 
greater representation for western producers, and we are pleased 
to see a measure which will benefit other Canadian provinces. We 
are not here to undermine what is being done elsewhere, quite the 
contrary, but we are aware that, while the bill affects Quebec to 
some extent, it does so in an indirect way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure is a carbon copy of Bill C-72, which was introduced 
during the last session of the 35th Parliament. Fear not: it is 
not out of generosity that the Liberal government came up with 
this legislation but, rather, because of pressure exerted by 
western producers, who have been demanding that changes be made 
to the methods used by the Canadian Wheat Board. In recent years, 
many transborder farmers from western Canada have illegally 
exported wheat to the United States.  This undoubtedly explains, 
to some extent, the government's initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to be made to the Canadian Wheat Board through this 
bill take into account, among other things, the restructuring of 
this body, thanks, in part, to the partial replacement of Liberal 
patronage, as outlined in clause 3.  I say “partial replacement 
of Liberal patronage” because this government will still appoint 
five directors out of the 15 mentioned in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the reason we are supporting this bill is that a majority 
of directors, 10 of them, will be elected by the farmers who use the 
CWB's services. This is a positive change, in light of the current 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the Bloc Quebecois played a major role in 
the makeup of the board. Indeed, without the efforts made and the 
pressure exerted by the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic, the 
Liberals would surely have reduced the number of producers' 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the activities involved, Bill C-4 provides greater 
flexibility in purchasing grain and paying farmers, the whole 
process being covered in part by a reserve fund set up by the 
CWB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our agriculture and agri-food critic said earlier, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports this government measure.  Unlike those who 
accuse us of navel gazing and despite the fact that this subject 
might appear to be of no interest to us because of the difference 
in our farming sectors, we are interested in the measures 
proposed in the bill, which is if considerable significance for 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and various parts of British 
Columbia. Western grain farmers are entitled to have their say, 
and we will try to add our support in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still on the subject of the social restructuring in this bill, 
I would point out certain facts that will shed a little light on 
what appears to be a government sacrifice, but which in fact a 
sham. 
I say sham because the government will retain fairly significant 
control over the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, for these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will support 
the bill's being sent to committee, and we do not intend to make 
things difficult for the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to clarify a couple of points that have been made on 
Bill C-4.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear about the undemocratic process that has been 
suggested with regard to the wheat board, there is no question 
that we need to have a balance between those who are responsible 
for the expertise in that legislation and those who really 
represent the sale by the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does put forward a very good balance.  We do have 
people who were appointed as the CEO of that corporation.  We are 
looking at an extremely large corporation.  People looking after 
that corporation certainly have a responsibility to have the 
expertise to be brought forward to make certain that those issues 
are understood and understood well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly need a larger portion of elected people who are 
going to represent those they are selling the grain for.  Quite 
clearly there is not a scenario where one can be done without the 
other.  The expertise of both is required:  those who know the 
value of the grain, sell the value of the grain, work with people 
abroad, work with all the intricacies of transportation and 
everything the board is responsible for; and those who represent 
the primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill we have set forward a balance yet we have put the 
primary producer first without question having 10 people elected 
from areas across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one talks about the responsibility of that board, the 
Ontario Wheat Board which is a very heavy producer of wheat as 
well is under the Canadian Wheat Board.  Ontario certainly has a 
very strong vested interest in how the Canadian Wheat Board 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one Reform member who represents Ontario nor do 
they understand.  I spent a long time in the last Parliament 
trying to explain to several Reform members what that condition 
was with the Ontario Wheat Board and our sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly they have to understand that my riding is a major 
producer of wheat, there is no question about that.  We produce 
it in Ontario yet we need to have permission from the Canadian 
Wheat Board to sell our grain abroad.  We need to have permission 
from the Canadian Wheat Board to transport it from province to 
province.  Therefore there are many implications of that wheat 
board that have a great effect on other regions of Canada.  It is 
not just a western grain issue, ladies and gentlemen.  That is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that when we look at this bill we have done 
extreme consultation across the west.  There is no question that 
this has been a process where hearings were held by a committee 
that went across the west.  It looked at the results of those 
hearings and certainly moved that issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister at the time and the minister who remains 
today tried to take into account every aspect of the operation of 
that board before he made any recommendations.  He very 
cautiously went about the recommendations and changes that were 
brought about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no question that the department has spent years looking 
at the issues and bringing forth a compromised position that 
actually is fair for everyone. What we are hearing here is a very 
one sided viewpoint, a one sided presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague before me pointed out, it is very clear when 
they talk about not having protection for the farmers who are 
sitting on the board from legal suits that may come about. What 
an unfair position it is to ask people who are elected and sit on 
a major board that deals with all Canadian wheat in areas of 
other countries, with all the questions and problems that come 
about and they are saying, “Look, sit there.  We will pay you a 
small amount but if you are sued for millions of dollars, do not 
expect any support”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a shame that is because every other corporation in this 
country provides those protections for people sitting on their 
boards. All members in this House when they stand and speak are 
afforded that protection in this House.  The House of Commons 
covers their costs if they have legal problems with regard to 
whatever happens in the House.  They cannot be sued for 
statements they make in the House.  However at the same time, 
they are saying that the board of directors for the Canadian 
Wheat Board cannot be provided that kind of protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there are many arguments being put forth here which 
are very one sided.  That is very unfortunate from my viewpoint 
because I believe those ladies and gentlemen who dedicate 
themselves to work on the wheat board, those ladies and gentlemen 
who shall run for the new wheat board, will do a great service 
for the farmers in western Canada and for all the farmers in 
Canada.  There is no question that we should give them all of the 
afforded protection we can give them so that they will provide 
that service well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise for the first time in this House.  I want to say that no 
bill will ever come before the House this session which is closer 
to my constituents than this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the Souris—Moose Mountain constituency where the 
farmers in 1960 wanted options.  They were not satisfied with the 
marketing of grain.  Although they were subjected to all kinds of 
opposition, phoney road bans, phoney literature being spread 
about it, the farmers said they want an option.  They dug down 
deep into their pockets and built the Weyburn inland terminal. 
Today the city of Weyburn has the largest grain handling facility 
of any inland place in Canada because the farmers exercise an 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite do not seem to realize that is what Reform is 
talking about.  We are talking about an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the wheat board does not look clearly into what our young 
farmers are saying, and I know this is true in Souris—Moose 
Mountain, if they are not given an option, then the wheat board, 
in its original purpose, the reason for which it was designed, 
will self-destruct.  That self-destruction will not take too many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing of which members opposite ought to be 
cognizant.  They brag about the 37% vote they got.  The only 
difference between a third and a half is a sixth.  That fraction 
is growing smaller and smaller all the time because of the bills 
they are putting before the House such as the bill which revises 
the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about democracy, with 10 of its members being voted 
in and 5 being elected.  They say it is a Canadian bill. Is the 
creation of the Ontario Wheat Board not a Canadian bill?  All of 
its members are elected.  What is wrong with electing all of the 
members to this board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as there is not accountability and open books, as long 
as there is not accountability in the way their statements are 
audited and produced, then that area of suspicion grows with 
every crop that comes off every farm.  It is growing and 
government members had better understand why it is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded to the farmers in my constituency who have and will 
continue to put their money into their own grain handling 
facilities.  If those farmers are given the option tomorrow, we 
will find out which option they will take.  They will take the 
same option which they did in building their facilities.  They 
will take that option.  There is no doubt about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about getting permission from the Ontario 
Wheat Board to deliver grain across the border.  Why is it that 
the people in the west cannot get permission to deliver their 
grain to the area of their choice?  It is allowed in Ontario, but 
it cannot happen in western Canada.  Government members will have 
to answer those questions.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The electorate of western Canada did answer. The greatest wheat 
growing province in Canada said “no way, we are going to elect 
eight Reformers all from the rural area”.  There is the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members say this is an Ottawa made bill for the 
bureaucracy that basically is in Ottawa, and therefore the bill 
is going to stay here.  They know very well with the government 
members, five of them being appointed, all they have to do is 
take three members away from the 10 and they have the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy goes right out the window.  All of those three members 
elected have to do is side with the government and the five who 
are appointed and the wishes of the farmers are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that and that is exactly why they did not have a 
totally elected board.  That is exactly the reason.  They are not 
fooling the farmers of western Canada.  They are not being fooled 
one little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the farmers right now who are in dire straits, and there are 
a lot of them with the price of wheat, are given the opportunity, 
if they are listened to, they would say “Please, in our 
democratic society of Canada give us the choice.  Don't legislate 
to us. We grow it, we store it but we don't own it.  We don't 
sell it.  We can't understand the operation because our selling 
agency is not even responsible to us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in my constituency, more and more agents every year 
are going out of wheat.  Do members know why they are going out 
of wheat and barley production and the acreage is going down? 
Because they do not have a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they can get mustard, canola and soya, all of these 
commodities, that is where they are going.  They contract it in 
the spring.  They know what they are going to get and they got a 
choice.  They have a choice with whom they even contract it to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all we are asking, but those members want to keep this 
thing a dictatorial body governed not at arms' length from the 
government.  The government is right in there and that is where 
the mistrust comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I can go to the people of my constituency, even those who 
support the wheat board, even those who openly say they want more 
control.  They have said no, they are not going to get it with 
this mix-match. “We will give them 10 elected boys but we'll 
control them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They still see the board controlled by the government.  That is 
exactly what the farmers do not want and that is not what the 
farmers on their survey of western Canada said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this bill gets a good airing in this House.  I hope 
committee goes through it in detail because the major producers 
of western Canada deserve more of an option than what they have 
been given under this bill, for this is a billion dollar 
industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know if two or three years from now whether 
anyone will remember this speech, but I will give it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is destroying the wheat board.  I want to make that 
clear at the beginning.  I am going to be asking a series of 
questions to point out how it is doing that.  I have heard the 
Liberals across the way talking about the fact that we do not 
have any representatives in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the relevance of that point to what we are 
discussing today.  The Canadian Wheat Board affects primarily the 
people in the prairie provinces.  If the hon. minister in charge 
of the wheat board had to face farmers in an election today, he 
would not get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got elected because he is in primarily an urban constituency. 
There are very few farmers who support him on this issue.  I 
think that is something that should be clear to the members 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to those people watching and listening to this debate 
today, I appeal to our city cousins, to listen to the dilemma 
farmers are in because they have no control over the minister of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is talking about democracy.  Every farmer knows 
that the question which was asked on the plebiscite on barley 
marketing was not the key question. It was an all or nothing 
question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided that there was either a monopoly or there 
was no wheat board. That is not what the farmers in my area are 
telling me.  If members want to talk about democracy, they should 
come to my riding and design the questions.  I have already done 
that and over 80% of the farmers want changes to the wheat board, 
which the minister is not making. That is democracy and it is not 
happening in the House today.  Over 50% of the farmers want some 
choice. They were not given that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in an area that is very strongly supportive of the wheat 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I will not have time to get through the nine very 
important questions that I think need to be addressed.  I will 
have to somehow communicate that to the members opposite in 
another way because those are key questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had very little light shed on this debate today. There 
has been a lot of heat and it has generated a lot of friction 
between farmers in Saskatchewan.  Unless these questions are 
addressed and light is shed on this, we are spinning our wheels 
and not doing what is in the best interests of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I surveyed the farmers in my area, I had no vested interest 
in one side of the question or the other.  I wanted to know what 
farmers really thought.  I think that is what the government 
should be doing.  It should be going to farmers and asking what 
they really want. The government put in place a marketing panel 
and when it brought in its report, the government cherry picked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to somebody this morning reporting about the 
transportation issue and how all of the key stakeholders in it 
got together and reached an agreement and the government simply 
cherry picked on the results of that.  That is what it has done 
with the western marketing panel.  We have this problem over and 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another time I will go through my nine questions because I feel 
they are essential in shedding light on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings at this time and put forthwith the 
question on the motion now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>   Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
If I were to get the unanimous consent of the House I could go 
through these nine points because they are essential.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK58">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-2, an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old 
Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and of 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last night, as you are well aware, I had started into the debate 
on the CPP legislation, Bill C-2. I wish to give a quick review 
of the points I made last night before I continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP legislation was designed some 30 years ago.  There is no 
question that in that design of CPP legislation there needed to 
be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me, hon. 
members, if we could keep it down in the House while other 
members are speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was very kind of 
you.  The folks across the way could listen and learn a bit about 
the CPP legislation.  Then they would understand. There is a very 
good colleague across the way who happens to be a parliamentary 
secretary who is helping them understand some of the finer 
details and we very much appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the review of what I talked about yesterday it is critical to 
understand that the legislation which started 30 years ago needed 
some upgrading to be brought into the reality of today's society. 
Certainly when the chief actuary reported that there was a 
tremendous imbalance in the relationship between the 
contributions on the one hand and the payouts on the other hand 
and that it would not be a long sustainable plan, the finance 
minister took it upon himself to make certain corrections were 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, the minister did not move along in this in 
some way in that he did not hide the fact that this plan needed 
revision. He went about it in a very open clear obvious way.  He 
did consultations with all provincial and territorial governments 
in trying to examine the direction we should go.  He talked to 
professional actuaries across the country, insurance experts.  He 
talked to social planners, seniors, youth and the disabled to 
make certain that all the elements of society that are affected 
by the Canada pension plan were taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations took a very long period of time. The answer 
that came back from Canadians was to keep the CPP and to make 
changes if necessary.  The message was that the CPP is a very 
vital part of Canadian society, a very foundation under which we 
operate and one that needs to be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also pointed out that there were some distortions when talking 
about the CPP.  Many colleagues across the way have suggested 
that it is a tax grab.  Quite the contrary.  This is a savings 
plan, an investment fund that will be managed by an independent 
body.  Any profits that come to the management of that 
independent body will go back into the fund.  No dollars will go 
into general revenue.  It is an independent fund that will be 
managed separately.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP contributions are tax deductible and therefore a tax 
deductible process that is put in place for the future of 
Canadians, for seniors of today.  When we look at it, there is no 
question that it is a very vital program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who says it is a tax grab is saying “Don't put any more 
money into it”.  If that is the case, the reality is that if no 
more money goes in, payments do not go out. In reality what they 
are saying is no CPP for low income seniors in the future.  That 
is a shame because that is removing the vital foundation under 
which this country operates which is to look after the seniors of 
this land.  To say “Don't put money into the CPP” is to say 
“Low income seniors, we don't care about you”.  I have a 
tremendous concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic features remain the same today as they were before. 
What we were told as well through these consultation processes 
that I pointed out yesterday was to go very easy.  We were told 
not to go at this process very rapidly to alienate, hurt or upset 
any group in society.  The plan was put in place so that changes 
would occur over a seven year period.  Those adjustments would 
not be put in immediately.  They would be spread over a seven 
year period and therefore it would not be a catastrophe or a blow 
to any group in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus I have arrived at the point where I finished last night and 
I am continuing today.  The impact of the changes will be shared 
among retirees, future survivors of retirees and recipients of 
disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted earlier, one currently in receipt of a retirement 
pension under the CPP will not see that pension change.  Let me 
state that again because that is something everyone in this House 
and everyone in society should be aware of.  If you are in 
receipt of a CPP pension today, that will not change.  All of 
those people who have pensions now can look forward to that same 
pension over the years without change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However retirement pensions for future beneficiaries would 
change since the calculation would be based on five year maximum 
earnings instead of the current three.  As an example of that 
impact of the proposed change, the maximum monthly pension based 
on the year's figures would drop from $736 to $724.  That 
proposed change means a $12 a month change in benefits.  That is 
a minimal change.  It has been designed to be minimal, not to 
upset or destroy the balance but to make it affordable and make 
those changes minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also changes proposed in the disability benefits of 
the CPP.  As of now, to qualify for a disability pension an 
applicant must have contributed to the CPP in two of the last three 
years, or five of the last ten years.  The bill proposes to 
change that requirement so that to be eligible for the benefit 
you must contribute in four of the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes are also proposed to the formula which will be used to 
calculate the disability levels.  Under these proposals, 
pensionable earnings would be based on the applicant's maximum 
pensionable earnings at the time of disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I have a short time left to finish and there are a couple 
of points I would like to underline.  We found ourselves in a 
position from the actuarial studies that stated that changes had 
to occur in the plan.  We have tried to make those changes as 
easy and spread over a longer period of time as possible.  We 
believe it is very vital that all seniors have pensionable 
earnings.  We believe that seniors must be protected with the 
Canada pension plan and it has to be put in place to be 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who says you cannot increase the rates is saying you 
cannot pay benefits to seniors in the future.  That is the 
reality.  It is either pay into the plan and pay the benefits, or 
do not pay into the plan and cut the whole CPP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am hearing from the right wing side of the House, from 
the Reform Party, from the Conservative Party, is they do not

the reality if they are saying not to renew it or not to do what 
needs to be done to improve the plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was particularly impressed with the comments from the MP for 
Kent—Essex saying that the pension plan is not a tax grab by the 
government, that the funds that would be put into the pension 
fund would not be used for purposes other than pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the MP for Kent—Essex that the government increased 
UI premiums and instead of using this money to help the 
unemployed, it used it to reduce the deficit.  This was a misuse 
of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the GST, the famous tax that was supposed to be 
abolished by the government?  The GST was never abolished as far 
as I know.  I ask the MP from Kent—Essex if the government can 
be trusted not to use funds in the pension fund for purposes 
other than the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from my colleague.  I am surprised because he was sitting in the 
House when the Liberal government was elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the unemployment fund.  The first measure 
that the government undertook in 1993 was to stop an increase 
scheduled by the Tory government before we were elected.  Then 
under three subsequent budgets we reduced the EI contributions, 
once, twice, three times.  We reduced them in every succeeding 
budget. For the member to suggest that we increased them, I 
wonder where he has been for the last three and a half years. 
Certainly he has not been studying the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue on that point which he opened the door 
for and reiterate very firmly so all Canadians understand, that 
we will have a fund.  It will be a tax deductible contribution by 
Canadians.  It will pay for the CPP benefit.  It will be 
administered by a separate body.  Not one penny of contributions 
will go to the general revenue fund.  They will go to the CPP 
fund and will be used to pay for benefits down the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Canadians to understand that there were 
changes made in the 1989 legislation that allowed more people to 
qualify for CPP and increased the flat rate.  We actually 
increased the rates that people could receive under the CPP and 
we set up the plan for more people to qualify.  As a result it 
affected the bottom line of the fund historically. That is one of 
the reasons that it is not able to pay for the costs in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find this very interesting.  I rise to make a comment on the hon. 
member's speech.  He called a 74% increase in payroll taxes a 
minor adjustment.  If that is a minor adjustment, I would like to 
hear the hon. member's definition of a substantial increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on his remark that the Reform wants to get rid 
of pensions for seniors.  A plan comes in.  Everyone is told a 
pension will be there for them and that there will be no 
increases.  Now we are facing a Liberal solution: throw money at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have promised in writing that seniors in our plan will be 
guaranteed the pension they are already receiving.  They will get 
everything they have a right to expect from the plan.  We will 
offer it to people earlier and get it out of the hands of a 
government that has totally lost control of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about some adjustments in 1989 that have 
jeopardized the cashflow of the plan.  We are talking about a 
plan that is almost $600 billion underfunded.  That did not start 
in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member wish to clarify his comment that this is a 
minor adjustment?  Does he wish to reconsider his position?  He 
ought to know it is incorrect to say the Reform is out to take 
away anyone's pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the obvious reality is 
that people are paying into the plan.  We have separate 
management of the plan by financial experts.  They are experts in 
insurance policies.  They are experts in social planning.  They 
are experts in disability payments.  They are experts in all 
areas CPP covers.  They tell us the contributions—and we see it 
in the actuarial numbers—have not and will not pay for the 
retirements of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not take this role on to stand back and not deal with it 
until we are at a critical stage.  Paul Martin had the foresight 
to take the issue on immediately— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is almost 
certain the hon. member was referring to the Minister of Finance. 
Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  The hon. Minister 
of Finance had the foresight to move the issue forward and 
resolve the problem 20 years in advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the Tories avoided solutions.  They did not 
tackle the issue.  We must make sure contributions match the 
payouts over any period of time.  It is a closed fund.  The only 
way it becomes sustainable is to make certain that contributions 
and payouts balance.  If we cannot increase the contributions we 
cannot make the payouts.  That is obvious.  As soon as we cut the 
contributions we cut the payouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed in the RRSP scenario is that those who 
have a lot of money to pay into RRSPs will be the benefactors of 
a pension in the future.  Those who do not have the funds, those 
poor Canadians, are the ones who will end up without pensions. 
The rich get more and the poor get poorer.  That is story being 
put forward by colleagues across from me today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to debate Bill C-2, an act to amend the 
Canada pension plan.  Some members of my generation think it 
should be renamed the Canada Ponzi plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension plan was devised over 30 years ago by a Liberal 
government with a noble objective, one which all members then and 
now can agree on.  The objective was to provide retirement 
security to all Canadians and to reduce poverty among seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a certain extent Canada's retirement income system for 
seniors has been successful in alleviating poverty among seniors 
and generally improving the living standards of Canadians.  As a 
young Canadian I would like to be on record as supporting a 
strong, fully funded retirement income system which ensures that 
no Canadians fall between the cracks in their older years when 
they are without earned income and sometimes without support from 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one thing we can all agree on.  It is unfortunate the 
hon. member who spoke before me found it necessary to engage in 
overblown, overheated partisan demagogic rhetoric.  He suggested 
that my Reform colleagues and I supported a diminishment of 
benefits for seniors simply because at the same time we support 
generational equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important first principle that all parties debating the 
bill support income security for seniors and for all Canadians as 
a primary objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic framework of the bill and the plan which it amends is 
as fundamentally flawed as it was 30 years ago when it was first 
introduced in this place at a time when the most wildly 
optimistic demographic projections still foresaw that a pay as 
you go scheme was unsustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experts knew it then.  They have known it every since.  Call 
after call for responsibility to ensure that we did not rack up a 
massive unfunded liability, a massive taxpayer IOU, was not 
heeded by successive Liberal and Tory governments.  They put 
short term political considerations ahead of long term human 
considerations.  They should be eternally shameful for failing to 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have created a scenario where the pension fund now has a 
$580 billion unfunded liability, an amount that almost exceeds 
the federal debt.  This brings the total indebtedness and 
liability of younger Canadians to well over $1 trillion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add to that the debts and unfunded liabilities of 
provincial governments, local governments and other pension plans 
for public servants, we find my generation will be inheriting 
over $2 trillion in public indebtedness and liabilities.  This is 
a result of successive decisions made by this parliament and 
provincial parliaments.  That is something for which those who 
sit on the front bench of government, none of whom represent 
people of my generation, should apologize to my generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People of my age will forever have to work harder and longer to 
get less, keep less and earn less.  They will be paying higher 
taxes, higher income taxes, higher payroll taxes and higher sales 
taxes, to fund the debts and liabilities incurred by the 
government and by the Progressive Conservative Party when it was 
in power.  The bill speaks to that and the member for Saint John 
denies it.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, whether or not they like it, the Tories made the 
decision to do nothing.  They made the decision not to act.  They 
made the decision to let the unfunded liability rack up to the 
point where it is now at $580 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government comes to us and presents itself as the 
saviour of the Canada pension plan.  Finally it says it is time 
for somebody to take up the clarion call and reform the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is 30 years too late and $580 billion short.  It 
should have structured the plan the right way 30 years ago when 
it was known that the demographic pyramid would change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the plan was designed it was assumed there would be six 
taxpaying workers to every dependent retiree.  We now know that 
within 20 years the ratio will be two taxpaying workers to every 
dependent retiree, a ratio which is not sustainable for a defined 
benefit pension scheme like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need a Ph.D. in mathematics.  We need to look at the 
actuarial report of the Canada pension plan which year after year 
reports a tragic record of red ink into which the government has 
decided to steep my generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it particularly galling that the government spends so 
much time congratulating itself on its moral courage in deciding 
to raise payroll taxes by 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will kill tens of thousands of jobs and reduce hope, growth 
and opportunity for younger Canadians and future generations. The 
government is busy congratulating itself.  At the same time it is 
busy stealing from the taxpayers of the country to fund its MP 
pension plan.  It is prepared to impose a 10% payroll tax on all 
Canadians so they can get a whopping pension of $8,800— 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When an hon. member accuses us of stealing I would ask you to 
consider it.  It is not right.  It is not fair.  It does not 
create an atmosphere which is conducive to the good governance of 
the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair heard 
the member for Calgary Southeast refer to stealing in an abstract 
manner.  It was not directed at an individual.  The Chair also 
recognizes the sensitivity and would ask the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast to ensure that when that kind of word is used 
it is very clearly put in the context of the abstract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not mean to impugn 
the integrity of any member of the House.  I meant to impugn the 
decisions made by successive governments and parliaments that 
decided to use the coercive power of the state to take money from 
people, without giving them a choice, to fund their retirement 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I cannot use that word in the House, but I know the words 
people on Main Street use to describe the MP pension plan.  They 
are a lot worse than the word I just used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and its friends in all the other parties want to 
raise the CPP payroll tax to 10% to give Canadians an enormously 
generous pension of $8,800 a year.  Is that not something?  They 
are prepared to pay a lesser premium to the MP pension fund to 
get millions of dollars in unfunded, lifetime pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This double standard is a scandal which every Canadian knows 
about.  Members can heckle me from the other side of the House as 
much as they like, but they know their constituents are fed up 
with that double standard, and I will take a stand against it 
every chance I get in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government proposes to do, among other things, is to 
raise the CPP premium, as it is called, from the current rate of 
5.6%.  It started at 3.5%.  I understand that when the father of 
the Minister of Finance first introduced this concept, it was 
suggested that the premium rate would stay at 3.5% in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They guaranteed Canadians that at the time.  Of course they were 
wrong.  I will not say they lied.  I will assume the best 
intentions.  Since then, the rates have creeped up to 5.6% and 
now in Bill C-2, they propose to move those rates to 9.9% by the 
year 2003 so that individual premiums will increase from $945 a 
year to $1,645 a year, a 73% increase. That means payments of 
over $3,200 a year for a self-employed person, the kind of person 
who is trying to run a small business, to create jobs, the kind 
of jobs the government does not know how to create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that going to do, that $10 billion tax grab, the largest 
single tax increase in Canadian history?  Is it going to create 
any jobs?  That is a question I ask members opposite.  I believe 
they ran, quite honestly and sincerely, in the last two federal 
elections on a commitment to increase employment, particularly 
for younger Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Prime Minister speak quite movingly in his remarks 
on the Speech from the Throne on the importance of increasing 
economic hope and opportunity and jobs for young Canadians. I was 
very impressed by the sincerity and emotion expressed in his 
speech but actions are the true measurement of sincerity, not 
just words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proposes in Bill C-2 to take away jobs from 
younger Canadians, take away opportunities from small businessmen 
who are struggling to create real employment and growth in our 
economy.  They propose to do that through the single largest 
payroll tax grab in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the question of generational equity?  What do they 
say about that?  What we know is that the first retirees, the 
first beneficiaries of the Canada pension plan, will have 
received $11 in benefits for every dollar in premiums that they 
paid into the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can argue with that?  It is nice that we were able to 
manufacture money to increase the living standard of retired 
Canadians. The problem is that somebody has to pay the bill, and 
that falls on us here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger Canadians, those of the generation after me, will 
receive some 57¢ in benefits for every dollar they pay into the 
plan that the government is proposing. Is that equity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada always prides itself on being the 
party of equity.  It claims to be the party of fairness.  Where 
is the fairness in taking from one generation without its consent 
to subsidize benefits for another generation?  Where is the 
fairness in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about supporting young Canadians.  This is a 
government that does not have a single member under the age of 30 
but has the temerity to stand up and say that.  I appeared before 
two of the panels that the federal government held on reform of 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were very few representatives of the younger generation of 
Canadians welcomed at those panels.  Why?  They were too busy 
working.  They did not have time, like the tax-funded special 
interest group friends of the government to come before those 
hearings and to ask for more money from their grandchildren and 
great grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say shame for not giving younger Canadians a voice on this. 
We do have younger Canadians.  They are looking at one of them 
right here who is going to have to pay part of these bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other things the Liberals propose in these amendments 
is to create a publicly managed investment fund of over $200 
billion.  Just imagine that, a bunch of politicians and 
government appointed patronage hacks controlling the largest 
investment fund in Canadian history. As far as the eye can see is 
pork when they talk about that kind of investment board.  Where 
are the controls?  A board entirely appointed through cabinet 
appointments, just like those very noteworthy appointments to the 
appeals board, to the parole board, to the immigration refugee 
board— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>—like to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Thank you very much.  That is just what we 
need, a bunch of senators managing $200 billion public dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has produced several studies and 
reports.  The Bank of Canada, the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund, and virtually every credible economic think tank 
in Canada will confirm that payroll taxes kill jobs.  The biggest 
killer of jobs in terms of taxation are higher payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in the 78th straight month of unemployment at over 
9%, with 17% youth unemployment that reaches 25% in some regions 
of the country.  Families have been undergoing diminished 
disposable income for the past 15 years.  Even though they are 
working harder, they are coming home with less.  What does the 
government want to do?  It wants to raise those taxes even higher 
and go against all of the conventional economic wisdom which says 
that will reduce job growth and mean fewer opportunities for 
Canadians to get a leg up in the tough new 21st century economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an option. Yes, we do have an unfunded liability and 
the country has to make some difficult decisions on how to deal 
with that unfunded liability. There are no easy choices.  As I 
said at the outset, this party and I think all reasonable 
Canadians are committed to fully respecting and honouring the 
commitments that have been made to Canadians concerning their 
pension benefits.  We are committed to that, but it will cost 
money to honour those obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a way to fully fund those benefits while at 
the same time giving younger Canadians better pensions and better 
retirement security. That is to look at some of the reforms that 
have been proposed by very respectable mainstream organizations. 
The C.D Howe Institute has produced several papers proposing the 
conversion of the defined benefit Canada pension plan Ponzi 
scheme into a mandatory private retirement savings vehicle, a 
proposal which has been seconded by the World Bank, an 
organization which is in part funded and supported by the 
government, as well as many other think tanks around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments around the world are coming to grips with the same 
problem that Canada is now encountering.  Last summer I attended 
a conference in Budapest attended by economists from welfare 
state countries around the world.  They talked about how to 
convert these defined benefit pension plans into pensions that 
are fully funded, mandatory private retirement savings vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has offered such an alternative and I wish members opposite 
would take this idea seriously.  If young Canadians were 
allowed to make a payroll contribution to a private investment 
vehicle and got a modest rate of return of 6% a year, they would 
end up with an annuity of over $250,000, producing an annual 
retirement income of nearly $24,000 a year, a far sight better than 
the measly $8,800 offered by the government.  Better pensions at 
lower cost seem to make too much sense for the Liberals opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close my remarks by saying that the House has a 
unique opportunity to really grasp the future.  Members should 
think about the impact that this will have on their grandchildren 
and the taxes they will be forced to pay. Members should forget 
about their own interests for a moment if it is possible. Maybe 
they would give up their MP pension plan if they really started 
doing that. Members should forget about their own benefits for a 
moment and think about their grandchildren.  If they do that, I 
have enough faith in the sincerity and good sense of members 
opposite that they will embrace a real alternative for Canada and 
for its future by embracing a private mandatory retirement 
savings plan, as we have proposed.

never, ever change himself. He has changed his hair, he has 
changed his teeth and he has changed his voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech my hon. colleague said “we have to believe, we

to change the pension plan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know if that was a question or a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was not a question, it 
was not a comment, it was an irrational rant by a member who is 
embarrassed by the moral leadership of the hon. leader of the 
opposition who took the challenge and gave up his pension last 
year.  Why does that member not meet the same challenge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can do is quote one of my constituents.  I have received 
more mail on this than on any other issue so far in this 
Parliament.  People have been saying that there is a need for 
real reform of this pension plan.  For instance, Mrs. Brad Skeet 
from my riding writes “I am a hardworking, tax-paying citizen in 
your constituency.  I heard that the federal government is going 
to raise the pension contributions again.  I must strongly 
protest this action—the CPP is something that my husband and I 
do not even count on for supporting us in our retirement.  We

families who have a full time parent at home are at a 
disadvantage compared to homes where both parents work”.

society.  We need policies that support parents as they raise 
their children not which put them at a disadvantage.  Canadian

Canadians of all ages have benefited from improved quality of

commitment to providing the best services available to Canadians 
in need of oral health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our part the federal government continues to co-operate with 
the provinces and territories, as well as non-government 
organizations, to ensure that the health care needs of Canadians, 
including oral health care needs, are addressed in a cost

sterile city warehouse while his business suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also familiar with a small, family owned restaurant whose

years ago the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was concluded. The 
passage of time has taught us a few things.  First, hundreds of 
thousands of jobs did disappear and many such jobs disappeared 
from the ranks of the large corporations that said in 1987 that 
free trade meant more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is no question that the FTA and subsequently NAFTA 
and the WTO have all contributed to downward pressure on wages 
and the standard of living of ordinary Canadians, not just in 
terms of wages but also in terms of deteriorating social programs 
and social harmony.  Although I am sure there are Canadian 
exporters who have done very well, it is also true that we do not 
know to what extent the low value of the Canadian dollar is 
really the key determinant in much of this success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore we continue not to have free trade with the U.S. On 
softwood lumber, on durum wheat, on sugar, and in a variety of 
other ways the U.S. appears to have it both ways.

has taken, since his minister took action. Did he, personally or through 
his chief of staff, on the eve of a general election in Canada, remind 
his ministers of the directives on influence peddling issued within his 
government? Is that what he did or did he tour Quebec with individuals 
who were involved in influence peddling instead? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Prime Minister to tell us why his ministers comply

Canadians who are unemployed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I said last week and I will repeat that when we took 
over as the government the premiums paid by Canadians were $3.30. 
This has been reduced to $2.90 and is going down every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took over the unemployment insurance fund it was many 
billions of dollars in the red.  We put it in the black. Good

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
surely the prime minister knows that he is alone in this

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the question to the Minister of Finance. Since the

night we learned that there is a special government list of 
companies seeking government funds and that this information gets 
sent out to the government's regional ministers and the local MPs 
whose ridings are affected.  That means the prime minister must 
have known about the $600,000 grant proposal by Videon. Then of 
course Videon made this $5,000 donation to the Liberal Party when 
it never had done so before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the prime minister this.  When he went to cash that 
$5,000 cheque, did he not smell a conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there should be a little respect for the truth.  The $600,000 
program is going toward the creation of jobs and will be paid 
when the jobs have been created. Also, the company that is 
building the hotel is not Videon.  A person by the name of 
Thibault who lives in the riding told the press that he never 
heard about a company called Videon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister talks about a little respect for the truth. We 
have to watch him from this side every single day, so we 
certainly understand what he talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Videon is a parent company of Auberge des Gouverneurs which is 
building the hotel.  We know that.  The transitional jobs fund 
lets people in the riding know what is happening.  This means 
that the prime minister would have been informed. This means that 
the prime minister as the local MP for that area would be allowed 
to lobby the minister for that $600,000 grant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is well aware that the contribution level is set

<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the auditor general states specifically that there is no 
procedure and that the minister is flying by the seat of his 
pants, for example by excluding, since January, half the people 
who would have been entitled to employment insurance and no 
longer are, thanks to him.  That is the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to ask this question of the Minister of Finance.  Does 
the minister realize that his haphazard approach greatly penalizes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
the auditor general devoted three chapters of his report to the

response to the Atlantic fisheries crisis.  Even the auditor 
general said that the government was at best naive about the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

this into context for two seconds.  TAGS can also be put into the 
same position as the two major problems we had with the two 
floods, the one in the Saguenay and the one in the Winnipeg area. 
When we think of what happened in Manitoba and in the Saguenay 
and that they were crises, the crisis in the fish community was 
the same thing.  We met that crisis with a program that was put 
in place to help 40,000 people who had no income.  I think that 
is what a government should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, floods 
are something that are natural disasters that one cannot predict. 
In 1994 there were too many fishers and there were too few fish 
and the Liberal government promised a program to end all 
programs. Today in 1997 there are too many fishers and too few 
fish and a Liberal government with egg on its face and an 
Atlantic wipe-out to prove it.

<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday in 
question period the minister of Indian affairs bragged about the 
level of accountability to aboriginal people. Today the auditor 
general gave us the straight goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over $1 billion is spent on aboriginal health care each year, 
yet the auditor general states that the government has 
insufficient information on how two-thirds of its programs are 
working.  Given that the auditor general refers to the status of 
aboriginal health as a tragedy and a crisis, what concrete steps 
is this government going to take to ensure proper accountability 
for the $1 billion that is spent every year on aboriginal health 
care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
whenever responsibility for an aboriginal community is turned 
over to a First Nation, it is done on the basis that that 
community will not only have responsibility for administering the 
program, but for accounting for it as well. The agreements that 
are entered into with First Nations ensure a level of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt we have things to learn from the auditor 
general's report.  We will be looking at it very carefully.  I 
assure the hon. member that chief among our priorities will be 
the accountability of First Nations for the money that is spent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the auditor 
general's report shows clearly that there is no accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another subject.  As if there is not enough heartbreak 
stemming from serious social problems on reserves already, we 
learned today that the department of Indian affairs is complicit 
in facilitating prescription drug abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general states that in one three-month period, 
15,000 people went to three or more pharmacies, 1,600 obtained 
more than 15 drugs and over 700 people had 50 prescriptions in 
one three-month period. Since the government has known this 
problem has existed for 10 years, why has it done absolutely 
nothing about it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is simply not so.  Over the last 10 years we have worked 
assiduously to put systems in place to deal with the kind of 
problem the member has referred to. I will give two examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it was the system of gathering information put together 
by Health Canada that allowed the auditor general to come up with 
the analysis in his report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, by the end of the current calendar year, after years of 
work, we are going to have a point of sale system in place that 
will let pharmacists know that there is a problem with the 
prescription.  That is going to help with this problem.

question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the government would 
ensure that no one would use a Canadian passport for unacceptable 
purposes, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs responded in a 
similar vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand from the Prime Minister's response that 
Mossad is authorized by the Canadian government to use Canadian 
passports for purposes other than terrorism? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

answer is no.

my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister confirm that there are guidelines restricting 
the hours of operation at Lester B. Pearson International Airport 
and can the minister assure the citizens of Mississauga that the 
government will not allow the Greater Toronto Airport Authority

other people in the west end of Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right on both counts.  There is a restriction 
in effect at Pearson airport that cannot be changed without the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada says he is going to continue to 
raise interest rates, but now the CIBC says that he is choking 
off the potential for job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since high interest rates shut off job creation, the minister 
must now finally explore the only other avenue that will create 
jobs: lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of increasing spending all the time when is the minister 
going to start lowering taxes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member was a member of the House during the course of 
the last mandate.  He knows full well that in the last budget 
taxes were reduced by over $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that reducing taxes for students so 
that they can pay for their schooling, that reducing taxes for 
the physically disabled so that they are given a level playing 
field, that helping poor families with children is not the kind 
of thing the government should do?  We feel that it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, by 
the government's own measure taxes have gone up $8 billion a year 
since the government came to power.  The finance minister says to 
Canadians he wants to consult, when in fact he has already 
committed in the throne speech to higher spending.  What gives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is lower taxes, not higher spending, is the way to job 
creation.  With interest rates increasing, when is the minister 
going to recognize that the only way to create jobs is to start 
cutting taxes?  When is he going to get it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat, if the hon. member looks at what happened last week with 
the reduction in long term interest rates, mortgage rates have 
been at an all time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer him back to his own province and the consultation 
that took place.  Citizens from all over the province came 
together and effectively came to much the same conclusion as the 
government: it is worthwhile investing in Canadians.  That is 
what we are going to do.

question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general raises a serious issue when the report 
states about Health Canada that the department is not fulfilling 
its responsibilities to manage in a way which helps First Nations 
establish programs and services likely to improve their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What action will the minister take to ensure that rather than 
the dump and run style of program transfer often currently 
employed, the department will work in partnership with aboriginal 
communities to ensure that programs transferred are actually 
going to improve the health of aboriginal people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is certainly our objective.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier to the House in response to another 
question, with each agreement we negotiate the transfer for the 
purpose of self-government, a program for health of aboriginal 
communities.  We try to ensure a level of accountability that 
will make sure that money is properly spent and spent for 
community purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also say that we have achieved some real progress in areas 
like life expectancy and infant mortality over the last 15 or 20 
years, and we intend to keep investing in that kind of effort. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general's report raises the horror of death and illness 
of aboriginal people due to over prescription of drugs through 
the non-insured health benefits program.  The auditor general 
also states that the department has known about this problem 
for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister now move, in consultation with aboriginal 
peoples, to transfer this program to the First Nations people as 
a way to ensure that the issue of over prescription is actually 
dealt with instead of the department's poor response to the 
report when it says it will deal with the problem simply by 
giving aboriginal people more to read about the dangers of 
prescription— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for 10 years Health Canada has been working to address this 
problem.  There are two things in particular that have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have kept good statistical analysis of how the drugs 
are being used so that we can track abuse.  Second, over the last 
number of years, we put in place a system that will be fully 
operational by the end of December 1997 which will allow 
pharmacists at the point of sale to determine whether the person 
presenting the prescription is doing it fraudulently or 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will make an enormous difference in resolving this problem.

I have a question for the Prime Minister.  The auditor general 
today stated in his report that he could find no clearly stated 
national policy for sustainable fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the very serious problems being experienced on the 
west coast and the east coast of the country with fisheries and 
after being in office now for four years, when can we expect a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilbert Normand:</B> The new fisheries act will be tabled in

hope the Prime Minister attaches a little more importance to 
this, which I am sure he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, in his report today, the auditor general stated the 
obvious.  Ground stocks in Atlantic Canada are not regenerating. 
There are very few job opportunities in those rural communities 
in Atlantic Canada and the Atlantic groundfish strategy expires a 
year early in May 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with regret that I learned today that Premier 
Frank McKenna of New Brunswick has decided to quite politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been a very good public servant for a long time. He has 
done a fantastic job in his province.  He was elected for three 
terms.  He changed the province by bringing responsibility to 
public administration and at the same time kept a social 
conscience, a balance that we all try to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has gained the respect of the people of New Brunswick and all 
of Canada.  In Calgary last summer he played an extremely 
important role in using his experience as the dean of the first 
ministers to develop a consensus that was very important for the 
future of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a premier, he was always interested in the status of 
minorities. I had the pleasure of meeting him myself, because he 
vacationed at Cap-Pelé, in the riding I represented for a number 
of years.  He has, for many years, spent his holidays with 
francophones.  He always took a keen interest in the status of 
the French minority in New Brunswick and throughout the country, 
and of the English minority in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he served his province and his country very well and we 
wish him all the best in his future endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to his wife and family for the 
wonderful support they gave him during his many years in public life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the official opposition I would like to pay tribute to 
Frank McKenna.  The fact that he was premier of New Brunswick for 
10 years certainly withstands the test of time for any leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McKenna was one of the first premiers who acknowledged the 
need to balance the books in his province.  This is being 
celebrated right across the country now and we certainly 
appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served his province and his region, especially as an advocate 
of free trade and private enterprise.  This also has spread right 
across the country and we celebrate that because that is the only 
way we will be able to work our way out of the terrible debt 
situations we have all found ourselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also was a signatory and an important player just last month 
in the Calgary declaration.  He endorsed the national unity 
process, the process the premiers were talking about in Calgary. 
He found it important to note that consultation is important, but 
also to recognize the equality of all provinces.  We appreciate 
the fact that he thinks this is important and we want to move 
ahead in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to wish him well.  Again I wish to say on behalf of the

occasion of Premier Frank McKenna's resignation I rise today on 
behalf of my colleagues to wish him well.  There are few Canadian 
politicians, in fact not one that I could name, that have to 
their credit having won 58 out of 58 seats in a provincial 
election or any election.  This certainly has been an indication 
of the level of support the premier has had throughout his 10 
years of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note it is rumoured that Premier McKenna is thinking of 
leaving politics and perhaps going to work in Africa.  The 
current prime minister should beware.  When I stepped down as 
provincial leader in Nova Scotia it was my intention to go to 
Africa, not to go after the top job in the federal NDP.  So one 
never knows where Frank McKenna may land when it comes to his 
future decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During 10 of the 12 years that Frank McKenna was in the New 
Brunswick legislature, I had the opportunity to serve in the 
adjacent legislature in Nova Scotia.  During that time we had 
differences of opinion as you might expect.  There were a couple 
of particularly strong ones over his commitment to workfare, 
which I think has been proven to be something of a failure, and 
also over his commitment to court corporations into the province 
to create low wage jobs as long as they were subsidized by the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite my differences with Frank McKenna from time to time, I 
have never questioned his sincere commitment to serve the people 
of his province as he saw fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this occasion I would like to wish him and his family well. 
Whatever he decides to pursue in the future I am sure he will 
undertake with the same kind of zeal and passion with which he 
has approached his job as premier of the province of New 
Brunswick. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as has 
been mentioned in the House by the prime minister and the leader 
of the official opposition party, Premier Frank McKenna will be 
stepping down effective October 13, which is the 10th anniversary 
of his leadership of the Liberal Party of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank is very personable and he has tremendous family values. He 
is a man whose family comes first.  His wife Julie and his 
children have given a great deal to Canada and to New Brunswick 
over the last 15 years.  Frank was there as an MLA before he 
became leader of the party.  He said when he was elected as the 
leader of the Liberal Party that he was going to be there for 10 
years and that was it.  He kept his word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people are critical of politicians, particularly 
politicians who do not keep their word and Frank did.  He worked 
very diligently for the people in New Brunswick.  There are a lot 
of us here who live in that province.  I served as mayor of Saint 
John for 11 years, so perhaps I worked with Frank more closely 
than anyone else in the House.  Sometimes we agreed and sometimes 
we did not agree, but we always had great respect for one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will miss Frank.  I am hoping that he does not go to Africa. 
I am hoping that he finds something in Canada, preferably in New 
Brunswick so he can continue to work and promote our province. He 
is known probably better than any other premier we have had 
across Canada for his stance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To Frank, to Julie and the children, we wish him good health and 
the best of luck.  I am sure we will see him again.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE

<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege.  It came to my attention 
yesterday afternoon that the office and position of legislative 
counsel has in a de facto manner ceased to exist.  I would 
suggest that this in and of itself is a prima facie case of 
breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind members of the House that a breach of 
privilege occurs according to all the precedents when there is 
some improper obstruction to the member in performing his 
parliamentary work.  The facts are that in 1993 there were seven 
legislative counsel and today there are approximately two point 
something legislative counsel. This is the improper obstruction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three questions to ask.  How can a member of any of the 
18 standing committees be reasonably expected to have access to 
independent legal advice concerning the probable effect of 
specific sections of bills before a committee when no legal 
counsel is available?  How can a member draft amendments to 
legislation when there is a six month wait for the same two point 
something people to draft private members' bills?  How can a 
member who is sent here as a legislator fulfil that role without 
reasonable access and availability of legal counsel? In brief, to 
do the job, each member requires the tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privy Council in the case of Kielley v. Carson in 1842 when 
ruling on a question of privilege noted that members of the 
legislative body enjoy these privileges because the legislature 
cannot act or perform without the unimpeded use of the services 
of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet members are in fact being impeded in performing their 
parliamentary work. Indeed I as a member have no reasonable 
access to the services of the legislative counsel's office.  As a 
member of this House I have been disempowered in carrying out my 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the guardian of the rights and privileges of this place, I 
implore you to give me along with others in this place the right 
to do our work.  I am suggesting to you that this is not a matter 
for the Board of Internal Economy. That body functions in a realm 
that is defined by statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking of you is to uphold my rights as a member of 
this House and not my interests as a member of a particular 
political party which we know is reflected in the composition of 
the Board of Internal Economy. When the Board of Internal Economy 
meets, its members present the positions of their parties and 
members but do not speak or represent each and every member of 
the House.  Only you, Mr. Speaker, as guardian of privileges can 
act in such a manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not asking for another business process review of the House 
staff and functions, nor do I believe that I should be forced to 
resort to individuals who have been subjected to four hours of 
training and are now called legislative clerks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I am aware suggestions abound that the British 
Parliament uses legislative clerks to fulfil the function of 
legislative counsel and by extension the same could apply here. I 
would suggest that this kind of logic ignores 130 years of the 
evolution of this House to the point that we are unique and not a 
twin or clone of Westminster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that a prima facie case of 
privilege exists and with your permission I would like to move 
the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the lack of legislative counsel to assist members in 
fulfilling their duties is a prima facie case of privilege and 
this matter shall be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will wait for more discussions on this 
particular point of privilege but at least at this point, I will 
not accept the motion until I find if indeed there is a prima 
facie case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I believe that, with all due respect for your 
decision, if you were to agree to consider the motion, you would 
find there was agreement.  That is because each hon. member who has 
used the services of the legislative counsels in the past to draft 
bills knows just how time consuming that is, without the proper 
resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you have been extremely attuned in the past to our task 
as legislators, but how can anyone seriously claim in this House 
that our privileges are not being violated when the situation is 
such that gaining access to legislative counsel has become 
extremely complicated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that a committee addressed this matter only four 
months ago, with the suggestion that more legislative counsels be 
added, contrary to what has been done recently.  It is a 
fundamental privilege for each member to be able to act as the 
spokesperson for his community and to be able to introduce private 
members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is well aware that the complexity of the matters 
dealt with, the complexity of the subjects the hon. members must 
debate in order to properly speak for their communities, require us 
to have access to a level of expertise such as the legislative 
counsels possess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly believe that there is unanimity in this House.  Let us 
recall the time, not so long ago in parliamentary history, when 
private members' business was allotted far more time.  If the work 
of the legislator is to have any meaning, it is important that we 
be equipped to be able to introduce private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our colleague deserves our gratitude today for 
bringing to your attention the fact that our privilege is being 
infringed upon by the lack of resources. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to second what the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton and the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a couple of private member's bills in the system long 
before the House sat, and since then a couple of more, but they 
were not ready when the draw was taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many other members in the House have had the same 
situation where bills they were hoping to be drafted and ready 
for the draw were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our privileges are affected, especially when we made commitments 
in the last election to constituents that we would do things when 
we got here and present legislation as private members.  However, 
because they were not done, our privilege of having our name in 
the draw was not there.  That is key to this whole argument. That 
is why most private members in the House are upset with this 
whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you take that as the major 
consideration.  If we cannot have a bill in the draw or it is in 
there but it has not been drafted because there is not enough 
bodies to draft it, there is a problem with the system.  It is a 
good issue to be referred to a committee so we can solve the 
problem of private members and ensure that all private members' 
bills and amendments are drafted as quickly as possible so they 
can do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the government with all its machinery can get bills 
drafted in a day if it wants to present them in the House. Yet a 
private member comes nowhere near that ability.  It is taking 
months, at least three and a half months in my case for one bill 
which is still not finished.  I think we should have better 
service than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping, in your considerations, Mr. Speaker, that you will 
see fit to allow it to go to a committee so we can solve this 
serious problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would just like to respond to the last remark of my colleague 
opposite.  He indicated that there may possibly be some 
preferential treatment to members on the government side.  I do 
not believe— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  I am sorry, I apologize to the House.  If 
in fact it is a reference to the government in terms of drafting 
bills, yes, it has certain resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this question of privilege was raised already by a 
government member who had experienced some frustration and was 
possibly looking for a different or a better means of being able 
to serve his constituent through private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wait for the decision of the Speaker on whether this is a 
prima facie case.  As one member of the board, it is certainly a 
matter the Board of Internal Economy has already been apprised of 
and sensitized to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a matter of hours, possibly, as we get together for our first 
meeting the issue will be high on the agenda.  We will be looking 
to address it in the best interest of private members. It is not 
a government-opposition issue but is a member issue that should 
be addressed by the board.  I will certainly abide by the ruling 
of the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on the government side for 
bringing the issue to the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many colleagues on the opposition side as well as on the 
government side have experienced this situation.  I lend the 
voice of our party in support of the motion that has been brought 
forward.  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you will address this 
proposition and take it under advisement.  We want to support it.

would like to bring to the argument, as opposed to support one 
way or the other, I will take it under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if there are new facts members would like to bring 
forth, I will listen to some brief comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief.  I do not know if it is a new fact, but I want 
people to know that it is a fact the NDP shares the concern 
raised by the hon. member and others who have brought it to the 
attention of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be doing what we can, either through the Board of 
Internal Economy or in some other way, to make sure the matter is 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If I am to hear more facts about support 
that is one thing, but if we have new facts to bring forth that 
would be another. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
addition to the problems we have as private members, during the 
clause by clause amendment of Bill C-68, a large controversial 
bill, we were unable to get the services we required to draft 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had over 200 amendments and we were not able to obtain the 
services from legislative counsel because of the overload they 
were experiencing.  We had to not bring in our amendments at 
clause by clause stage.  We had to bring some of the amendments 
in at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add that to the volume of information that has been placed 
before you for your consideration, Mr. Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the new facts you have 
at your disposal to enlighten your decision, I would like to point 
out that there used to be a law clerk here, who reported directly 
to the Speaker of the House.  Over the years, the idea got lost, 
and little by little we slipped into a funnel with fewer and fewer 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact I would like to add is that having only two permanent 
law clerks for 301 members is the result of a number of years of 
systematic erosion of the resources available to us to perform our 
duties as members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We both know that time is very important in politics.  We had 
an example here today in which the auditor general commented on 
employment insurance.  Had we asked for a bill to be drafted for a 
month or two, or some such, and we could not take political action 
before next January or February, then I would consider my 
parliamentary privileges were being breached. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have had quite a bit of information 
on this matter.  I remind all hon. members, with respect, that 
last week a question of privilege was brought up to which I will 
address myself in the next short while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the interveners seem to be of one opinion.  The hon. 
government whip has stated that the matter would possibly be 
brought up in the Board of Internal Economy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take some time.  Perhaps some information will 
be forthcoming to me in the next 24 hours or so.  I will review 
everything that has been said today as I have been reviewing with 
regard to the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River.  If it 
is necessary for me to get back to the House I will do so after a 
brief delay.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK211">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to 
amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have six minutes remaining for questions 
and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very 
much enjoyed the debate that was going on in the last couple of 
hours.  It really demonstrates the difference between a group of 
people who have not really thought about what they are proposing 
and some people who have given a considerable amount of thought 
to what is actually happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave a statement in the House the other day in which I pointed 
out that young people today, like the member who was speaking, 
pay $3,400 a year for 35 years to pick up a pension of about 
$8,800 a year, when that same money invested in a very modest 
RRSP style plan for the same number of years would end up with an 
annuity of something like $92,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on that side who still think an $8,800 a year pension is 
good news should give their heads a shake because it is totally 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a secondary effect of these CPP taxes, what does the hon. 
member feel the impact will be on small business?  At the moment, 
having come from small business myself, I know that every month 
they have to pay CPP taxes, UI taxes, corporate income taxes, 
income taxes for employees, business licences, Workers' 
Compensation Board taxes and capital taxes in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member give us an idea of the impact on small business 
of this drastic increase in CPP? 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on small business of the proposed payroll tax 
increases in Bill C-2 will be considerable.  Self-employed small 
business people will face an increased payroll tax burden of some 
$3,600 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some hon. friends opposite who are expecting to cash out on 
the great Las Vegas MP pension scam, $3,600 is not a lot of 
money.  For a lot of people in my constituency it is the 
difference between being able to take a holiday in a year, being 
able to take their kids for a trip in the summer, and perhaps 
being able to hire an extra employee to help them so they can 
actually go home a few nights a week and spend some extra time 
with their families.  For the people that I know $3,600 a year is 
an integral part of their quality of life, which will be further 
eroded by the payroll tax increases in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated during my speech a direct link between higher 
payroll taxes and fewer jobs has been demonstrated again and 
again and again.  That is one of the reasons we still have over 
9% unemployment, 1.4 million unemployed Canadians, and 17% youth 
unemployment.  If that is not evidence enough that high taxes 
kill jobs, I do not know what is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I listened to the member for Calgary Southeast.  The debate has 
two levels.  Clearly our parties disagree on the function of the 
retirement system.  I think we would all agree on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also marvel at the member's skills in terms of making 
speeches.  He has a lot to bring to the debate, but to simply 
harp on about the form of the system when what he is really 
talking about is the function does not do any good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that disturbed me was when the member spoke of his 
youth.  Clearly I do not know exactly what role that plays in the 
debate, but he opened the door and I will try to get my rickety 
old body through it.  Just because the member speaks of his youth 
does not mean he speaks for the youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched that party across the way during the election.  Its 
advertising strategy seems to be let Canada separate from Quebec. 
We recently went through a colleague of his going through let 
B.C. separate from Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When he talks about the younger generation not being willing to 
pay for some of the deficits that are owed in terms of the plan 
to the old, I would caution him that generations should not be 
autonomous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a generation of Canadians that went to war to pay the 
price for his freedom.  He simply stood up and said “my 
generation now, at our age, doesn't think this is a good deal for 
us, so forget the older generation Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a clear answer from the member.  Is he laying the 
groundwork for the third pillar of the Reform Party, which is 
youth separation?  Am I going to have to stand up here and fight 
against that?  Is that something that the hon. member does not 
stand for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. 
member that I am a strong federalist as are my colleagues in this 
party.  I do think I speak for a large number of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that there are nine members of Parliament on 
this side of the House under the age of 30 and none on that side 
of the House.  I think that says something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said during my speech at the very beginning that I would like 
to be on record as a young Canadian supporting a strong, fully 
funded retirement income system which ensures that no Canadians 
fall between the cracks in their older years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore yes, I do recognize those obligations and do want to 
fully fund those obligations.  I did say it would not be easy to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of funding the obligations to older Canadians, we 
can also give more retirement security to younger Canadians at 
lower cost than what the government is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I encourage hon. members to vote against Bill C-2 
and to support a private mandatory retirement savings vehicle, a 
defined contribution plan which would give more retirement 
security at lower cost to my generation as well as to all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is one time I really regret not having an opportunity to ask 
a question of the previous speaker, the member for Calgary 
Southeast, rather than having a 10-minute speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would have asked him pertains to his continued 
attacks on the MP pension plan.  One does not like to hear old 
time rhetoric from supposedly new style politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happens, when he attacks the MP pension plan, he alludes 
to the fact that in the last Parliament the majority of Reform 
MPs, all but one, opted out of the pension plan.  That was by 
statute. We had to make a legislative change because the pension 
plan for parliamentarians is mandatory.  What has been the case 
of the MPs of the Reform Party of the class of '97 recently 
elected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A change of statute, a vote in this Parliament, is required for 
the MPs of the class of '97 to have the option of opting out of 
the MP pension plan.  Instead of moving legislation or proposing 
a private member's bill, what the Reform Party has done is that 
each one of the class of '97 has written to Treasury Board saying 
they want to opt out of the MP pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that is, as they should know, Treasury Board 
does not have the power to act.  It can only be done by statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like to have put to the member for Calgary 
Southeast, and I am sorry he does not have an opportunity to 
reply, is whether he is prepared right now to move a private 
member's bill, which he can write himself, giving MPs the option 
of opting out of the pension plan.  If the Reform Party were 
really sincere in all it says, it should have done this long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of my speech has to do with the accountability, a term 
MPs opposite seem to like to throw around, of what has been said 
in debate by the opposition parties, chiefly the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great care to the speech of the member for 
Calgary Southwest because I am a great believer that, in this 
Parliament, when the opposition speaks it must speak 
constructively.  It has an important role in making legislation 
better.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not find the kind of constructive criticism that I would 
like to have found from the Leader of the Opposition.  Instead I 
found, for example, the Leader of the Opposition criticizing Bill 
C-2 because it does not have a preamble.  He says the reason it 
should have a preamble is so the courts will know how to 
interpret the legislation.  He actually says there is a legal 
reason and that every time Parliament passes a statute it has to 
make its intent crystal clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Calgary Southwest had consulted with a 
competent lawyer he would have been told that a preamble has no 
legal force in the courts.  When a judge approaches legislation 
for interpretation he is not required in any way to follow the 
preamble. The legal profession disparagingly refers to preambles 
in legislation as the pious hope clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a preamble in legislation it is usually a 
political smoke screen which comes out of the department that 
writes the legislation, usually the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House a perfect example of a misleading 
preamble.  It is the preamble to Bill C-46, which the party 
opposite fully supported at third reading.  That bill had to do 
with restricting the rights of the accused in obtaining records 
from therapists in sexual assault trials.  Remember that the 
opposition party completely supported that bill.  It had a 
wonderful preamble which outlined how it would protect the rights 
of victims, how it would do this, that and the other thing.  It 
outlined how the legislation would obey the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within months of getting through Parliament it is being 
challenged in Alberta because it defies natural justice.  It 
destroys the right of the accused to defend themselves.  It has 
also been challenged in and overturned by the courts of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the case of a preamble which was put into legislation 
that was fundamentally bad.  Learned parliamentarians on all 
sides of the House supported a law which should not have been 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, instead of 
proposing that bills have preambles, should be condemning 
preambles.  Legislation speaks for itself clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Southwest talked forever about 
payroll taxes.  The point he was trying to make was that 
increases to CPP premiums are a tax.  He cited all kinds of 
academics to prove the point that the increases to CPP premiums 
are a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that no one likes to talk about a new tax, 
be it in Parliament or anywhere in the country. Certainly the 
government would prefer not to talk about it as a tax.  The 
reasoning is that because the government does not directly 
collect the tax one should not think of it as being a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument was not fully developed by the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest.  The argument is if it is mandatory, if it is 
taken off a worker's payroll, then it is a tax.  It is a tax 
because it is mandatory.  The hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
said the government is not being genuine because it is really a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we find later in his speech?  He talks about super RRSPs 
which are mandatory.  In other words, the other party, while 
condemning the government for proposing a pension tax, is 
proposing a tax itself.  It is a matter of semantics.  Perhaps it 
is a misunderstanding of the language. The reality is that a 
mandatory super RRSP is a tax as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I come to the issue of accountability.  The Leader of 
the Opposition condemned Bill C-2 because he felt it merely 
required annual reports and proper reporting by the investment 
board which will be responsible for the funds under its charge, 
which is a huge innovation in the bill to turn the management of 
the pension funds over to an investment panel which will invest 
them in the open market and do so wisely. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the member for Calgary Southwest missed the point.  Instead 
of condemning the fact that Bill C-2 wanted reporting he really 
should have gone after the bill and said that this is the kind of 
reporting we want.  I do not blush as a government member to warn 
my government that I am dissatisfied with this aspect of the 
bill.  What is missing from the bill is an itemized account of 
what we expect from this investment board when it presents its 
annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know the remuneration of the executives.  We want to 
know the cost of administration and management.  We want to know 
the investment plan.  We want to know investment performance. 
Rather than condemning the government, and Bill C-2 because it 
wants annual reports, the Leader of the Opposition missed an 
opportunity for valid criticism and he has left it again to the 
government backbenchers to warn the government that it has not 
fully examined the bill. I hope the committee will look very 
carefully at this whole matter of what kind of accountability 
there should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened very carefully to the remarks of the member for 
Sherbrooke.  He is the leader of the fifth party, I believe.  We 
find Sesame Street economics.  This member condemned the bill 
because it took $11 billion out of the economy over six years. 
Somehow he does not seem to understand that this investment board 
is going to reinvest it in the economy, in the open market.  It 
will reinvest the money in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later the member for Sherbrooke complained that he wanted RRSPs 
to be permitted to invest 50% in foreign investment instead of 
20%.  He is proposing that Canadian pension funds be invested 
outside Canada.  He is not interested in investing in Canada, and 
no wonder. That party did not succeed very well in the election 
of 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to this bill 
that will finally bring the CPP up to date.  It must be admitted that 
the existing plan has a few shortcomings and is in need of improvement. 
There is certainly no need to replace it with the sort of formula the 
Reform Party is proposing, but adjustments are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also important for those Quebeckers listening to know 
that very few Quebeckers are affected by the CPP, because a similar 
plan, the Quebec pension plan, was set up at the same time as the CPP. 
This evokes memories of a time when some form of co-operation with the 
federal government was possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall the Pearson era, when Quebeckers were allowed 
to create the Quebec pension lan, and even to make original 
contributions, such as the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, an 
idea which the government has picked up on in the new bill before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only Quebeckers affected by the CPP are those who have paid CPP 
premiums, whether they live in Quebec or decide to move there, as well 
as members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP.  Approximately 
12,000 Quebeckers are affected by the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most Canadians, however, these are significant changes. The 
increase in premiums will reach 9.9% in 2003. 
We understand that this increase is due to adjustments required to 
ensure that the plan can meet the objectives for which it was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it important to point out that there have been many 
shortcomings in how the plan's money has been built up in the 20 years 
it has been around and that we thought the present bill needed to be 
improved in this regard.  In this sense, the Canada pension plan 
investment board seems like an interesting idea.  It is not too direct 
a market competitor for the Caisse de dépôt et placement because it does 
not actually have an economic mandate. 
Its only mandate is to ensure that the funds are managed as well 
as possible. As a matter of fact, there were major deficiencies in this 
respect. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that I am somewhat surprised by the Reform 
amendment where it says that the system will be even more unfair to 
young people when in fact the proposed premium increase will come mainly 
from the pockets of the baby boomers, that is to say those who are 
presently aged between 40 and 55, and I am one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is normal to some extent that we pay more. 
Indeed, had corrections not been done, we would have ended up receiving 
benefits for which we would not really have paid premiums and nothing 
would have been done to ensure that younger people do not have to pay 
disproportionate amounts for what we, the so-called baby boomers, will 
be entitled to in terms of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the position of the Reform Party and their 
amendment are untenable. The purpose of this bill is not to reform the 
plan at the expense of the younger generations, but rather to reduce 
intergenerational inequity by ensuring that everyone pays his or her 
fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing in this bill and is of great interest to me is 
mention of what will become of the seniors benefit, commonly called old 
age pension. Under the current pension plan, the various sources of 
income available to those eligible for benefits because of their age 
include private retirement plans such as RRSPs and supplementary pension 
plans. 
There are also the public plans, namely the Quebec pension plan and the 
Canada pension plan. Then there is old age security, the guaranteed 
income supplement and the spouse's allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this bill on the CPP is passed, it will be very important to 
hold a true consultation across the country regarding the seniors 
benefit. What little information we have received so far on the 
government's proposal involves very fundamental issues for the future of 
pension plans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, among other things, the universality of benefits. Many 
people who had planned their retirement based on an existing plan will 
face a situation different than the one they expected, simply because 
the government has decided, with this bill, to protect those aged 59 and 
over. 
The government should ensure that much younger people have the option to 
choose between the existing plan and the one that will be implemented in 
the months to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan protects those who are already in the current system. 
These people will not be affected. This is a good thing, but we have to 
make sure that those who will have to live with the new plan can do so 
under acceptable conditions. This is why I call upon the solidarity of 
older people, of those already covered by the existing plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial reaction of a person aged 65 or 70 could be: “I am 
protected under my plan. 
I don't necessarily need to be worried about the coming reform”. 
However, those who can give the most intelligent opinion, the one 
most closely reflecting day to day reality, are the people who are 
65 or 70 years old today and are living with the current program, 
those who receive the guaranteed income supplement, who can tell us 
how it would be if they had to live from day to day on an income 
that came solely from the new form of allowance the Government of 
Canada is proposing, and can tell us there would be major problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consultation would, therefore, have to be transparent, 
and carried out in such a way that everyone may grasp the issues 
and that all strata of society may have a chance to be heard. 
The new pension plan is going to be very important to the baby 
boomers, but it is also going to be important for those who are 20, 
25 or 30 years old today, because this will be their opportunity to 
define the framework under which they will have to live in the 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at the Canada pension plan in the 
perspective of this reform of the seniors benefit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government to be more attentive in the next 
consultations than it was in previous ones, such as the 
consultations on the employment insurance reform.  If the past were 
any indication of the future, it would be a cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities toured Canada and visited all 
the provinces to hear what people thought of the proposed 
employment insurance plan.  The consultations did not lead to the 
results expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today, we see basic common sense in the auditor 
general's report, but considered, calculated, assessed and 
providing the same result as the committee's consultations.  In 
other words, the employment insurance plan must be managed by its 
contributors—employers and employees—and government must 
provide an accounting of the way it determines contribution amounts 
and ensure that the surplus is properly directed to ensure that job 
creation objectives are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of consultation done for employment insurance should 
be done for seniors pensions, but with greater guarantees that the 
government will listen to those consulted, who will tell us what 
they want in a benefits plan for seniors, so that after the Canada 
pension plan is reformed with the change to seniors benefits, we 
are sure that our seniors have an adequate pension plan.  Perhaps 
the most respectful way a society can acknowledge the contributions 
of its citizens is in the treatment it accords its seniors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-2.  I also congratulate on you your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 amends the Canada pension plan and secures the future 
for all Canadians.  No government has ever consulted more widely 
across the country than the Liberal government.  We consulted all 
Canadians from sea to sea on the future of the CPP and on 
Canadians' vision for the future of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Bill C-2 allows the CPP to be an investment for Canadians, 
by Canadians and in Canada.  This will be a win-win situation and 
we will not burden future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague who spoke before me talked about our extensive 
consultations with the HRD committee, on which he was a very hard 
working member.  The social security review was good and much 
will come from it.  We have set the direction for social security 
into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we heard the Reform party attack everything we are doing. 
I commended the hon. member from Quebec on his good attendance 
and good work in committee.  The HRD committee set an all time 
record for the amount of hours spent here in Ottawa and on the 
road.  I have to disclose that Reform members were not there to 
listen to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful that they took this opportunity to cross the 
country and hold their own town hall meetings and then bring the 
reports back.  Reformers are only wanting to represent the views 
of their own members and not of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We could not get a hearing before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  The hon. member opposite says he 
could not get a hearing before that committee.  When we were in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February a federal-provincial agreement was reached on 
changes to ensure that the Canada pension plan would be 
sustainable in the future and would make it more fair and more 
affordable for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes are the result of the latest statutory review of the 
CPP that the federal and provincial governments, as joint 
stewards of the plan, began in 1995.  They reflect what was said 
during extensive public consultations that were held across 
Canada in 1996.  The key recurring theme was that Canadians 
believe in the CPP and they want it preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most participants believe this can be accomplished by 
strengthening the plan's financing, improving its investment 
practices and moderating the growth in costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement answers the concerns of the residents of my 
riding and of most Canadians. This is a very balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and provincial ministers agreed on a three part approach 
to restore the financial sustainability of the CPP and make it 
fairer and affordable for future generations by moving to fuller 
funding; by accelerating contribution rate increases now so that 
it will not have to exceed the 10% for future generations; 
improving the rate of return on the CPP fund by investing it 
prudently in a diversified portfolio of securities at arm's 
length from the government; slowing the growth by tightening the 
administration of benefits and by changing the way that some are 
calculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following important features of the Canada pension plan 
remain unchanged.  Anyone currently receiving CPP retirement 
pensions, disability benefits, survivor benefits or combined 
benefits will not see these benefits affected.  Persons over the 
age of 65 as of December 31, 1997 who elect to start CPP 
retirement pensions after that date will also not see these 
pensions affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All benefits under the CPP except the one time death benefit 
will remain fully indexed to inflation. The age of retirement, 
early, normal or late, will remain unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building up a larger fund, fuller funding and earning a higher 
rate of return through investment in the market will help pay for 
the rapidly growing cost that will occur once baby boomers begin 
to retire.  This is what Canadians have asked the government for, 
to ensure that their Canada pension plan will be there in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Canada pension plan will move from pay as you 
go financing to fuller funding to build a substantially larger 
reserve fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contribution rates will rise over the next six years from the 
current rate of 5.85% to 9.9% and then remain steady instead of 
rising to 14.2% in the year 2030 as predicted by the chief 
actuary. In dollar terms an employee earning $35,800 a year now 
pays about $945 in contributions. In the year 2003 that employee 
will contribute about $1,635.  Yes, that is $450 more than what 
is currently legislated for that year.  However, by the year 2030 
employees will be paying $565 less a year than if we had not 
acted now. Increasing rates more rapidly now will cover the cost 
of each contributor's own benefits plus a uniform share of the 
unfunded burden that has built up.  These costs will not be 
passed on to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be positive changes to the benefits and to the 
administration of the CPP.  Changes proposed are how benefits 
will be administered and calculated in order to moderate the 
growth of costs.  By the year 2030 costs will be reduced by just 
over 9% compared to what they otherwise would be by then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stewardship and accountability are the most important facets of 
the CPP. To improve stewardship of the CPP and provide for more 
accountability so that the sustainability of CPP is not again put 
at risk, federal-provincial reviews will be required every three 
years rather than every five.  Any future benefits will be fully 
funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any future statutory review of the plan, new default 
provisions will identify the steps necessary if the chief actuary 
calculates the CPP to be no longer sustainable at the steady 
state rate and ministers cannot reach a consensus on actions to 
sustain the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will now receive regular statements about their 
pensions with the intent to provide annual statements to all 
contributors as soon as possible.  The CPP investment board will 
provide quarterly financial statements and will report to 
Canadians on the performance of the fund.  It will hold public 
meetings at least every two years so Canadians can know what is 
going on in every province. CPP annual reports will provide more 
complete information and will explain how administrative problems 
are being addressed. Other issues are up for review.  These 
changes will restore the CPP sustainability and make it more fair 
and affordable for all future generations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partial pensions.  Many Canadians want to make a gradual 
transition to retirement.  This opens up the possibility of more 
jobs for younger Canadians.  This will be made possible by 
providing partial pensions during the transition while Canadians 
can continue to work and earn further pension credits. We are 
going to examine this and I hope we can make great progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Survivor benefits. Compared with today when 68% of working age 
women are in the workforce, in the past, when the CPP survivor 
benefits were designed, most women did not work outside the home. 
Ways to update survivor benefits to reflect changing realities 
and the needs of today's families will be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to misinformation that is being supplied across 
Canada by the official opposition I want to repeat that there is 
no change in the age of retirement.  There is no change in the 
contribution rates past the 9.9% that is being set now.  It will 
be held steady.  We will know what the rate will be in the 
future.  The year's basic exemption, which is now $3,500, will be 
frozen at $3,500.  There is no change to the maximum pensionable 
earnings.  All benefits except the death benefit will be fully 
indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to say that good government makes a difference. 
This government has certainly listened to Canadians.  We have 
held hearings in every riding that we represent and we are happy 
to talk to Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to tell you a story about some mad scientists.  Many people 
know them as social engineers.  They have this theory, this idea 
that the more centralized a project is, the better it is.  They 
also believe the more people that are involved, the better it is. 
But these scientists have a problem.  There are so many 
observations that refute this theory. These fallacies of theirs 
are obstacles that prevent this scientific theory from becoming a 
scientific law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These social engineers have staked their reputations, even their 
views of the world, on this framework of centralizing more jobs, 
but the anomalies are overwhelming.  Hence we have a real crisis. 
They created this crisis called the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about a number of these anomalies, these 
complications they had.  First, other government run disasters do 
not work.  Government members point to their own example when 
they talk about how it is a half trillion dollars underfunded. 
There is also the Quebec pension plan.  Although it is better 
than the CPP it has repeatedly earned a rate of return 
substantially below the market average for investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to my own province with the Alberta Heritage Fund which 
squandered hundreds of millions of dollars on Gainers meat 
packing and Novatel. Those are two examples but there are more. 
Even Singapore's Central Providence Fund will not be able to meet 
even the modest levels of retirement benefits estimated by the 
Central Providence Fund itself. We have examples within Canada 
and without that point to government run disasters on investment 
funds like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these Liberal social engineers set up the CPP in 1966 they 
made some promises.  Paul Martin Senior and his Liberal cronies 
said that it would “never cost more than a few hundred 
dollars”.  Those were their own words.  Yet today Liberals are 
talking about something in the thousands of dollars which is 10 
times what their initial promises were.  But oh no, we should 
trust them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals also promised the CPP would never climb above 5% 
contributions, but lo and behold they are talking about 9.9% as 
though it was nothing.  They say that's it.  Can we trust them 
now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a con job all along.  We know that now.  And it is still 
a con job.  Some people are convinced that they are entitled to 
this tax.  I say that if it comes out of your pocket, if it is 
taken out of your wallet, it is called extortion; if it goes back 
into your pocket once the government has taken it, then it is 
blood money.  It is paying you off.  It is trying to buy back 
your support with the fruits of your own labour.  The GST rebate 
worked the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said that Canadians asked for these changes.  I do 
not remember being asked if I wanted the CPP tax doubled.  I have 
friends on this side of the House who wanted to make application 
before the travelling board and they did not get an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if were dense, I surely would have remembered the 
government selling this high priority Canada pension plan tax 
hike during the election campaign.  It is a high priority bill 
that is being introduced right after the election.  Surely the 
Liberals would have mentioned it there and I would not have 
missed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the tax increase mentioned in the Liberal red book?  I 
did not see it.  I am not blind and I do not think I am all that 
deaf, but nonetheless these things were not talked about during 
the campaign.  I am reminded of when the Liberals broke their 
promises on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt whether doubling the CPP would have passed a referendum 
vote.  They say it is something that is grassroots and 
democratic.  If they put a vote to the citizens of this country 
in terms of whether or not they want to see a doubling of their 
CPP, they know that would fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have more tricks in their bag.  They bent the ears 
of the provincial governments.  How did they do that?  The 
Liberals bought off the provinces with promises of cheap loans 
that would be available due to the federal government's extra CPP 
tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has a funny way of repeating itself.  The last time the 
government raised the CPP tax it squandered pension funds in 
provincial bonds at below market rates.  We could well see that 
type of thing again.  Canadians would once again be in the debt 
hole and the Liberals would once again come back to them and say 
“Trust us.  This time it is only going to be 15% or 20%.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This job killing tax hike is going to bring in nearly $11 
billion over and above what it does now.  That is $700 extra per 
year for every working Canadian.  According to a Department of 
Finance study acquired through an access to information request, 
the increase in compulsory contributions from 3.6% to 5% that 
happened between 1986 and 1993 reduced employment by nearly 
26,000 jobs.  These are the same people who are saying this tax 
hike will not cost jobs. This Department of Finance study 
indicates that the Liberal tax hike this time could kill up to 
75,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the finance minister.  In 1994 in his 
blueprint for the economy entitled A New Framework for Economic 
Policy, he said “Higher payroll taxes increase the cost of 
labour and reduce the incentive to create new jobs.”  It is 
75,000 fewer jobs.  That is what the finance minister is talking 
about.  The Liberals do not like to call it a tax hike or a 
payroll tax, but that is what it is.  It reminds me that the 
Liberals are short-sighted. They only see as far ahead as the 
next election because the finance minister can say one thing in 
1994 and another thing in 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, members opposite said during the beginning of this 
debate that they only realized there was a problem three years 
ago in 1994.  They did not sense this baby boom population 
bubble.  They did not feel it.  They were oblivious to it. 
Marketers, demographic trend setters, everybody was talking about 
it but the government did not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal plan was created in 1966.  Surely these people 
could not turn a blind eye to this.  They were not daft, or were 
they? They should have known and anticipated this bubble in the 
demographic trends.  For them to notice the plan even on their 
own admission only three years ago, it has taken them this long 
to finally catch wind that it has to be changed, that it has to 
be reformed.  It sounds very fishy indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a government that wants to bring in a tax hike 
right after an election.  What they are hoping is that people are 
going to forget it, but I do not think that is going to be the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim that the screw-up they created could have 
been worse.  If they had stuck their head in the sand a little 
bit longer, then the hike would actually have been 14%. This is 
so typical of Liberal promises.  They promise to spend taxpayers' 
money and then when they do not spend it they say “We are 
heroes.  We've saved you money because we didn't spend your 14%. 
We are only doubling it to 10%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to make a prediction, and this will be very short. 
The Liberals are bringing in this tax hike early in their term 
and they are hoping the people are going to forget about it by 
the time of the next election.  This increase only gets worse 
over time, and its coat tails will be long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they cut taxes, they might not slit their own throats but if 
foreign pressure on interest rates causes them to rise, 
especially with a separatist vote in Quebec, then they will dig 
their own debt grave.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to be able to participate in the debate today on such an 
important issue for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, as hon. members may know, a number of social, 
economic and demographic trends have developed, such as declining 
birth rates, increased life expectancy and lower than anticipated 
growth in productivity and wages, which, if unaddressed, could 
challenge the sustainability of Canada's public pension system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we committed ourselves to strengthening Canada's 
public pension system.  The legislation that we are debating, 
Bill C-2, will enact the joint federal-provincial agreement 
reached last February to change the Canada pension plan, or CPP 
as it is known.  It is legislation that will place the Canada 
pension plan on a solid financial footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point that I would like to make is that whatever the 
circumstances, CPP will be there for Canadians when they need it. 
In fact the very reason we are making changes now is to ensure 
that it is there in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his February 1995 report, the chief actuary clearly showed 
that without modification to the Canada pension plan, the CPP 
fund would be exhausted by the year 2015 and that contribution 
rates would have had to soar to over 14% to cover the rapid 
growth in cost.  That would be a 240% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through responsible action now that we can avoid 
bankruptcy and truly intolerable CPP rates later, an increase now 
with a number of generations sharing the burden or an increase 
later for our children's generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before moving to make changes to CPP, we held extensive 
consultations with Canadians.  During 33 sessions held in 18 
cities throughout Canada, more than 270 formal presentations were 
made to allow the government to find out what Canadians thought 
should happen to their plan. Canadians had no reservations in 
their expectations.  They wanted the plan preserved, its 
financing strengthened and its investment practices improved.  We 
have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to tell my constituents what 
remains the same under CPP legislation and how the plan is being 
preserved. Anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan 
benefits, be it retirement pensions, disability benefits or 
survivor benefits, can rest assured that they will not see these 
benefits affected in any way.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan benefits will not 
see these benefits affected in any way.  All benefits now and in 
the future will remain fully indexed to inflation.  The ages of 
early retirement, normal retirement or late retirement all remain 
unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed?  Let me try to describe the changes today. 
Effective January 1, 1998 retirement pensions will be based on 
the average of the year's maximum pensionable earnings in the 
last five years prior to starting the pension.  In the past they 
were based on a three year average.  The amount of the pension 
will continue to be dependent on how much and for how long a 
person contributes to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of disability benefits will be further 
improved.  The appeal process will be streamlined and the 
legislation will be applied more consistently.  To be eligible 
for disability benefits workers must have made Canada pension 
plan contributions in four of the last six years prior to 
becoming disabled.  Presently a person needs to make Canada 
pension contributions in two of the three years previous or five 
of the last ten years in order to be eligible to apply and 
qualify for disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for combining the survivor and disability benefits and 
the survivor and retirement benefits will be largely the same as 
those in existence before 1987.  However, changes will limit the 
extent to which these benefits can be added together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death benefit will continue to be equal to six months of 
retirement benefits but up to a maximum of $2,500 rather than the 
current $3,580.  The option to eliminate the death benefit was 
rejected by the federal and provincial governments together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through enacting the legislation after careful consideration 
with Canadians the government will ensure that the Canada pension 
plan is there for future generations, that it is there at an 
affordable premium and that the benefits are guaranteed for those 
future generations.  Due to our plan some 75% of the reduction 
has been made on the financing side and only 25% on the benefit 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP will continue to be affordable.  Canada pension plan 
contribution rates will increase in steps to 9.9% by 2003 or 
4.95% for each employer and employee and then remain unchanged 
instead of reaching the 14.2% projected by the chief actuary for 
the year 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan will move from pay as you go financing 
to fuller funding to build a much larger reserve fund.  It will 
grow in value from two years of benefits currently to about four 
or five years of benefits.  It should be noted that the yearly 
basic exemption, the first $3,500 of earnings on which no 
contributions are paid, will be maintained and frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without these changes future generations would have to pay 14.2% 
for the same benefits we are currently paying only 5.85% for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now CPP contributions not needed to pay for benefits have 
been lent mainly to the provinces at the federal government's 
interest rate on long term bonds.  Under this new legislation 
Canada pension plan funds will now be invested in a diversified 
portfolio of securities prudently and at arm's length from 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that Canada pension plan funds will be invested in 
stocks, bonds including provincial bonds, and mortgages. Instead 
of being lent in their entirety to the provinces we are now in 
the position with the passing of the legislation to make the 
investment philosophy of the Canada pension plan more market 
oriented.  This is consistent with investment policies in most 
public and private pension plans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on prudent assumptions the Canada pension plan can secure 
an average long run return of almost 4% a year above the rate of 
inflation.  That compares with only 2.5% assumed under the 
current policy of the chief actuary.  As well, from now on 
whenever provincial governments borrow from the Canada pension 
plan they will pay the same rate of interest that they pay on 
their market borrowings.  That is making smart use of public 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During cross-Canada consultations Canadians told us they wanted 
the Canada pension plan to run like a private pension plan.  In 
response we have provided that the fund will be managed 
independently from government by a 12 member investment board. 
The investment board is accountable to Canadians and their 
governments through regular reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will be subject to investment rules similar to other 
public and private funds in Canada.  Therefore the transparency 
for Canada pension plans of the future is the same transparency 
in private plans throughout the rest of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that Canadians will start to receive regular 
statements on the pensions they are earning.  We intend to 
provide annual statements to all contributors as soon as it is 
feasible.  Canadians will receive an annual statement which will 
show how the Canada pension plan is progressing.  Canadians will 
have the opportunity to see year to year the retirement future 
their contributions are building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February in the House of Commons the Minister of Finance 
tabled the first draft of Canada pension plan legislation, in 
case the member for Calgary West was unaware.  In response to the 
comments received further refinements were made to the 
legislation and revised draft legislation was released in July 
for further comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures proposed in the bill today will become law once the 
legislation is passed by parliament and support orders in council 
are received from the provinces that are party to last February's 
agreement.  This will permit the changes to take effect on 
January 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to take this opportunity to answer some of 
the critics of these changes.  There are some who advocate 
scrapping CPP and moving to a privatized system with mandatory 
retirement savings plans.  I believe they do not understand two 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, Canadians want the Canada pension plan to 
remain.  Canadians want a public pension plan that is available 
to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Canada pension plan provides protection not 
available through private RRSPs such as disability benefits and 
survivor and death benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is part of our public pension plan 
system along with old age security and guaranteed income 
supplement. Together these three pillars ensure that all our eggs 
are not in the same basket.  The changes reflect the long held 
Liberal values of providing stability for and protecting those in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Liberal government that introduced the Canada pension 
plan over 30 years ago in 1966, and now this Liberal government 
is making the necessary changes to ensure the future of the 
Canada pension plan for all Canadians.  This allows all Canadians 
to prepare for their future together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my comments are sparked in part by the last member who spoke and 
some of the other members who have spoken today, in particular 
those on the Liberal side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very ironic and kind of sad that they would stand and 
talk about Reform's plan when obviously they have never read it. 
They have never opened the book, or they read it and they chose 
to ignore it, to say things they know are not stated in the book 
and to ignore the things that really are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate they would prey on the fears of Canadians, 
those who have already retired and those approaching retirement, 
to try to sell a very bad plan of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned today that it started at 5%.  They were 
told it was a wonderful plan and that it would never go up.  Now 
it is doubling from that early start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about one aspect of the plan, the impact of the 
raising of the payroll taxes to 9.9% on business, in particular 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking again of false comments made by the government, its 
members seem to want to imply that Reform's plan is to scrap CPP 
and instead simply have people put their money into RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who think like this are the ones who have not actually 
read the plan.  The plan is an RRSP type system changed over from 
the existing Canada pension plan.  It is not paid out of rich 
profits from a high paid job but in fact paid by the same 
deductions that are going into the Canada pension plan right now, 
money that has been squandered, money that has been spent and 
still results in a $600 billion liability on the part of the 
Canada pension plan.  I just want to make sure people understand 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members opposite listen to this example.  I welcome 
heckling when I am speaking.  I actually feed on it.  Sometimes 
it gives me some good stuff to carry on with in my speech.  When 
all their friends are away, I hope they get a chance to think of 
this one point personally and consider it from a non-partisan 
point of view.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I came to this place I had a small construction company 
that built about eight houses a year.  During that time I was 
doing other things.  My company, which was primarily myself, made 
a profit of about $6,500 per house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I employed carpenters, plumbers, electricians, excavation people 
with their equipment, roofers, drywallers and any number of 
people.  I bought supplies from people all over town and 
throughout my region.  It was a good economic engine for the 
small community and the region I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had three people who virtually worked full time for me.  If I 
consider the number of people who worked for me as I needed them 
for drywalling, roofing or some other components, it worked out 
to be the equivalent of about 10 full-time positions.  It was as 
if I had 10 people full time who, if they had the particular 
talents, would have been able to do all the jobs.  It would have 
created an annual income for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Liberal plan the wages I paid those people 
would be subject to this new payroll tax for the purpose of CPP. 
It would amount to $650 per head.  What would be the impact on a 
small company? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I made about $6,500 a house and I had the equivalent 
of 10 full-time positions.  As the employer my share would have 
been $650 times 10.  The gross profit for one-eighth of my 
productivity as a builder would have gone to pay the increased 
CPP premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I had people working for me they liked to maintain some 
form of standard of living.  They were pretty reasonable people. 
If I was still running my company and this increase came along, I 
suspect many of them would have come to me and said “We know 
times are tough.  We know that the economy is tight.  We are not 
looking for a raise but we certainly cannot afford a cut in pay. 
What we need is enough of a raise to pay the increase in our CPP 
premiums”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were hard workers.  I would have been hard pressed not to 
have given it to them, but had I done so it would have been 
another $650 per employee for the equivalent of 10 full-time 
employees or $6,500, the gross profit from another house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a viable small business and the increase in the Canada 
pension plan premium, a payroll tax, would have taken 25% of my 
gross profits from that construction company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will say that it is a government bill and 
they have to vote for it.  I understand their dilemma.  A member 
of the House who does not happen to belong to the Liberal Party 
any longer voted according to the way his conscience and his 
constituents directed him.  Consequently he sits on this side of 
the House because the Liberal Party threw him out.  They are not 
allowed to vote the way they think is in the best interests of 
Canadians in general or their constituents in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope government members will raise this matter in caucus, 
speak to the minister and speak to the critics who deal with the 
Canada pension plan.  If that is what would have happened to the 
small business I operated in Castlegar, in the interior of 
British Columbia, think what it will do to countless hundreds of 
thousands of businesses across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about job creation.  How in God's name can 
jobs be created when they increase a payroll tax on people which 
will ultimately result in 25% of the profit from a small company 
going out the window?  It will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that each of those members will say that they did not 
look at it from the point of view of employment.  They are saying 
they looked at it from the point of view of rescuing the plan. 
There are much better ways to rescue the plan than simply 
throwing more money at it and in doing so destroying the economy 
of the country by destroying a lot of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spouting the rhetoric thrown by the minister down to 
them they should read Reform's plan.  It is an alternative.  It 
is not the destruction of a pension plan.  It is looking at it 
from the point of view that we have to ensure an income for 
people in their retirement and we have to make it affordable not 
only in terms of premiums but in job creation and sustainability. 
They look at it and say the 9.9% now will be the be all and end 
all to save the plan.  It is the same thing that Liberals of days 
gone by said when it was brought in at 5%.

do, I promise that I will not try and roast them by saying they 
were wrong.  I will congratulate them on their re-examination and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your new office. This is the 
first chance I have had to speak with you in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listen to members opposite, particularly members of the 
Reform Party, it becomes more clear that we are dealing with two 
very fundamentally different visions not only of the Canada 
pension plan but of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History would make it clear that Liberal governments have put 
people and their communities first. I suggest the Reform Party 
would take us back decades when it was not so important that 
people and communities worked together for the good of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party attempts to make an issue of sustainability 
with regard to the changes to the CPP and the program being in 
place in the future.  I think it has much more to do with the 
kind of society we want for ourselves, our children and our 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the last term of office and through the election 
campaign I did not hear much from the constituents in my riding 
of Algoma—Manitoulin calling for a privatized super RRSP for the 
future.  If I heard concerns about the pension plan for the 
future they were to make sure that what Canada has such as the 
CPP and OAS will be there for us when we retire and for our 
children and our grandchildren. Their worry centred around the 
sustainability of the program and that it be available in the 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Reformers can argue that a super RRSP, according to their 
arithmetic, will be better for Canadians, when we get to fine 
details it is a much different story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite a couple of examples.  The Reform Party claims to be 
the party of families, a fact which is quite disputable.  Its 
proposal would not cover workers who take leave to look after 
children, which runs contrary to the fact that CPP does.  Working 
poor families would have difficulty paying mandatory RRSPs and 
the extra insurance to replace the disability and death benefits 
provided by the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a society where there is a general consensus to move toward a 
national drug plan, a pharmacare plan, and society is moving 
toward sharing the wealth in a reasonable way, Reform would have 
us go back to the beginning of the century when it was quite the 
opposite.  In its plan we would forget the working poor family, 
the spouse who for one reason or another had to stay home to take 
of children. I use this as only one example of where the Reform 
plan would break down and the CPP would be there for spouses who 
stay home for children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers also neglect to point out that in a super RRSP plan a 
tremendous public subsidy is required.  As we all know, when you 
invest in an RRSP, as all Canadians are able to do if they choose 
to and have the funds to do so, there is a commensurate tax 
reduction to reflect that investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system costs billions of dollars per year. It is a 
system whereby Canadians are redistributing their wealth.  In a 
system totally dependent on RRSPs those with most of the wealth 
would be benefiting from most of the tax loss as a result of the 
tax deduction.  In the current system which is a balance of 
RRSPs, Canada pension plan, OAS and the supplement, there is a 
broader range of pension options available to people. If we 
provide a pension plan based solely on the RRSP system there will 
be a much greater demand on the tax system than what we see right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on the Reform Party to make it clear that its 
system does not come without tremendous cost.  I submit to the 
House that the cost will be much greater than what we are seeing 
right now.  The CPP is not intended to be the only source of 
income for seniors, although by necessity it is for many. The 
overall pension system in Canada is designed to provide Canadians 
with a chance to blend several vehicles as they prepare for their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much is made about the fact that premiums are going up. The 
Reform Party uses the word tax.  Tax is not the correct word. The 
correct word is investment.  When an employer through a payroll 
deduction makes a contribution to the CPP he is making an 
investment in the country for sure but also in the workers who 
work for him.  When the employee makes a contribution to the CPP 
he too is making an investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker from British Columbia mentioned his 
construction firm and the number of houses he made per year.  If 
he asked his employees they would not see it unreasonable that 10 
employees would see their premiums matched by the profit, just 
the profit on one of eight homes.  They might see that simply as 
sharing the benefits that come with a capitalist society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to move in the direction that is proposed by the 
official opposition we would see a deterioration in a significant 
way of Canada's social safety net which is made up not only of 
our pension system but of the employment insurance system and the 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension system is one of the very important three pillars 
that make up the social safety net.  It is in the nature of our 
society and the reason we are envied throughout the world, it is 
in our nature to be compassionate to one another.  That 
compassion is reflected in the fact that our pension system makes 
sure that in every reasonable case Canadians can provide some 
income for their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the cost of administering the Canada pension 
plan versus millions of private super RRSPs I do not think it 
takes rocket science to figure out that administration costs 
would be approximately $20 per person through the CPP versus $150 
or $200 per person in a private RRSP plan.  When it is all added 
up, a 10:1 ratio in favour of the CPP makes a lot more sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we be spending pension dollars unnecessarily on the 
administration of a pension plan?  The fact that these amendments 
include the creation of a board to ensure the CPP fund is 
invested in the most appropriate way for Canadians makes a lot of 
sense.

of spending our money.  We have made changes that will ensure the 
sustainability of the CPP into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current government has seen fit to take charge of this 
issue and to move us forward in a way that most industrialized 
nations have not yet be able to do.  I am pleased and proud to

to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-2 on the reform of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is usual, I would like to begin by thanking all those in the 
riding of Argenteuil—Papineau for their vote of confidence in once 
again sending me to represent them in this 36th Parliament.  I will 
continue to uphold their rights as staunchly as I have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reform of the Canada pension plan is of particular interest to 
me because I am the Bloc Quebecois critic for seniors and also because 
it affects me as a member of that generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have risen many times in the House to uphold the rights of 
seniors, one of society's most vulnerable groups.  The Bloc 
Quebecois agrees in principle with the contents of Bill C-2 at 
second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now going to give a brief history of this bill.  The 
government introduced a preliminary bill in February 1997, followed by 
a revised bill last July.  Amendments proposed by the federal government 
were approved by at least two thirds of provinces representing two 
thirds of the Canadian public, as required by law.  Eight provinces in 
all, including Quebec, approved the proposed changes.  Only British 
Columbia and Saskatchewan voted against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, the Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with the 
primary objectives of this reform, with a few reservations. 
Indeed, I cannot help but mention that, on March 9, 1994, I asked 
a question to the then Minister of Human Resources Development 
concerning the reform of social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official critic on seniors issues, I also made the following 
statement in the House, again in 1994, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 9, the minister indicated in this House that he 
wanted to review old-age security programs. Following the 
general outcry caused by this announcement, the Prime Minister 
decided that the review would be limited to the Canada Pension 
Plan and RRSPs. This review was to be tabled last June but the 
government has clearly delayed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: Can the minister tell us why the 
government has delayed announcing its intentions by tabling 
the review promised for last June? 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following was part of the answer was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are presently speaking with a number of groups and organizations 
throughout Canada, particularly as they represent seniors, to get 
their point of view. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to wonder what the government's true intentions were, 
since it called an election before making good on that commitment. 
However, we realize that some changes have become necessary, because of 
the financial implications and of the plan's sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had been forecasted that there would be no money left in the 
fund by the year 2015, at which time contribution rates would have gone 
up from 6% to 14% for the Canada pension plan, and from 6% to 13% for 
the Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform is also more of a concern to Canadians than to 
Quebeckers, since less than half of one per cent of Quebec residents 
receive CPP benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the bill proposes the establishment of the CPP investment 
board, which will be quite similar to Quebec's Caisse de dépôt et 
placement. The Quebec government introduced Bill 149 to deal with the 
Quebec pension plan and to amend various related acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to reiterate the remark made by my hon. colleague from 
Mercier, who indicated that the Government of Canada and every province 
except Quebec should have taken Quebec's lead in 1964-65 when it 
established the Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bloc Quebecois supports this reform's objective, which is 
to preserve this public pension plan, increasing contribution rates 
faster than initially planned will cause an increase in benefit funding. 
We believe that this in turn will reduce intergenerational inequity by 
charging more to baby boomers, who, generally speaking, have another 20 
years to put in on the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to emphasize the changes proposed by the 
federal government with respect to the disability pension. Under 
an existing ministerial directive, any person over the age of 55 
who is unable to perform the duties of his or her own job can be 
declared disabled.  Now the federal government wants to repeal 
this directive, thereby making the administration of the plan 
much stricter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never had any such directive in Quebec. The federal 
government wants to limit eligibility to those who have contributed to 
the plan for four of the past six years, which should make the plan 
considerably less accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, those who have contributed for two years out of the past 
three, five years out of the past ten or half of the contribution period 
are eligible for disability benefits. Unlike the federal government, the 
Government of Quebec is about to recognize a proportionately larger 
number of persons with a disability. The Bloc Quebecois cannot support 
this part of the CPP reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's proposal to establish a super RRSP is based 
in part on the model developed in Chile.  According to the 
example provided by this country, however, the administrative 
costs of such a system are far higher than for the present ones. 
The Quebec pension plan devotes the equivalent of 1.7% of the 
amount paid out in benefits to plan administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this system of super RRSPs, the government will have to 
guarantee an acceptable base income at the time of retirement, in 
the form of either a minimum pension or a separate assistance plan. 
In both cases, considerable costs are associated with this type of 
guaranteed minimum income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Reform Party position leads me to the position of the 
government, which is trying to worm out of it by shifting the 
administration of a government plan to a local administration. 
The Reform Party proposals will enable the government to assume 
the same attitude toward its responsibilities, as the example of 
ADM, Aéroports de Montréal, clearly illustrates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Argenteuil-Papineau, I have spoken out on 
numerous occasions in defence of the development of Mirabel 
airport, which is located in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand the similarities, we must start with a 
brief review of the history of ADM.  This is a not-for-profit body, 
or as it states in its letters patent, a corporation without share 
capital, constituted under part II of the Canada Corporations Act. 
The government is washing its hands by handing the airports over to 
this body, because it refers any taxpayer claims to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party proposals relating to the reform of the 
Canada pension plan place the federal government in a similar 
position, since it can always answer that, in future, this plan is 
privately administered and is similar to the registered retirement 
savings plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has, moreover, never called for termination 
of the Canada pension plan, and I would refer you to my speeches in 
the House, which have always been along the same line: do not touch 
seniors rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The younger generations must also be able to benefit from a 
public pension plan.  Our approach is the opposite of the Reform 
Party's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to repeat my position on seniors rights and to point 
out that October 1 of each year will always be a memorable day, 
because the United Nations have designated that day to mark the 
important role seniors play in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the UN has decreed 1999 to be the international year 
for paying homage to seniors.  Its theme, “Toward a society for all 
ages” is aimed at raising public awareness of the essential role 
seniors play in all sectors of activity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
today to challenge the flawed reasoning by my opponents across 
the way and to demonstrate why our efforts to reform the Canada 
pension plan are far superior to any of the opposition plans and 
are much preferred to doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is exactly the kind of preventive action that Canadians 
demand from their governments to avert future crisis in the 
Canada pension plan.  While our opponents would rather we do 
nothing and let the program collapse, we are moving forward in a 
decisive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I reiterate the benefits of the government's well 
considered plan, I will refute the feeble assertions and the 
rhetorical rantings of our opponents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to power in 1993 we inherited a mismanaged plan 
from the Conservative government of the day.  The procrastination 
of the Conservatives showed their unwillingness to act.  If they 
had acted to repair the Canada pension plan in preparation for the 
growth in seniors then, we could have capitalized on the massive 
economic boom of the late 1980s.  Instead, they did nothing. They 
believed that the issue was best left for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar way the Tories ran their platform in the last 
election, they essentially said they would do what we would do 
but they would put it off longer and make more substantial 
increases in the future.  Apparently they were not ready to let 
the future begin for Canada pension plan reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I heard the NDP critic, the hon. member for Kamloops, 
compliment our efforts to reform the Canada pension plan as the 
economy changes.  I thank him for his support of our plan and 
remind him that when he has the conversation on the Canada 
pension plan with his parents they or any other senior today will 
not be affected by any changes in the plan.  We can put that 
yellow herring aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP's plan during the election was just not practical.  It 
wanted to maximize the payout while limiting the potential growth 
in the fund and its viability.  This meant that some day 
Canadians would be forced to borrow to cover the difference or 
abandon the plan.  This we find irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the Reform plan and the super RRSP.  This is 
not what Canadians want.  The Reform plan would break the 
covenant that was laid down when workers first began to pay into 
the pension plan in 1966 by breaking the pledge made to those 
workers by previous governments that the Canada pension plan 
would be there for them when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory Reform plan calls for higher increases in 
premiums, higher administrative costs and an additional private 
cost by Canadians to cover the private insurance for disability 
and death coverage.  Reform plans to take this away.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In total it adds up to higher payments for young Canadians than 
our plan.  In the name of intergenerational equity espoused by the 
member for Calgary Southeast, their fresh start on pensions is a 
false start for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> speaks of the plans already 
under way. The future reform of Canada pension plan would enable 
the baby boomers out of the work force to reduce the unemployment 
of young having difficulty— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Talk about your own plan instead of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  I have just heard the booming voice 
of the biggest teller of tall tales we have ever heard in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done is avert a crisis and we are doing it 
responsibly.  Our government acting in co-operation with our 
provincial partners took the lead to restore financial footing of 
the plan.  We held 33 sessions in 18 cities, hearing more than 
270 former presentations from Canadians on the plan including 
young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and young Canadians in particular have no hesitations 
in asking us to preserve the plan, strengthen its finances, 
improve its investment practice, and we are doing that.  This 
bill addresses the concerns raised in our national hearings and 
again we thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance for 
their visionary leadership on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, do not take our word for it.  Listen to the words of 
others. The minister of finance of Ontario, a hero to many 
Reformers, on February 15, 1997 stated: “We have protected 
benefits for pensioners and secured a sound financial future for 
the plan and the people who need it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Christopher Clark of the Canadian Council on Social Development 
says: “It is highly ironic that proponents of dumping the Canada 
pension plan for private RRSP schemes often defend the idea in 
the name of intergenerational equity because it would be cheaper. 
It is neither equitable nor cheaper.  As is the case with most 
quick fix privatization proposals, it sounds too good and easy to 
be true, and it probably is”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of Business Council on National Issues agrees with him: 
“This agreement places Canada at the forefront of industrialized 
nations with problems linked to an aging population”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allan Tough, an actuary from Alberta, states in the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I> the importance of acting now: “With any problem it 
is better to face up to it now rather than later. The longer you 
delay, the worse it gets. A 9.9% contribution rate sounds 
definitely better for my children than going to 14% later”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Crane of the Toronto <I>Star</I> commented: “The 
announcement of higher premiums for the Canada pension plan 
should reassure Canadians on the long term viability of the plan 
to which all workers contribute”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP has become a key component of our national pension 
system.  The amendments to the plan contained in Bill C-2 are 
designed as a package to stabilize the plan and ensure that it 
will continue to meet the needs of Canadians.  If we continue 
forward ignoring reform to the pension system we can guarantee 
there will be no pension for Canadians and that is simply not an 
option.  That is why I stand in my place and support this bold 
move to save this cherished covenant with working Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak for a few moments on Bill C-2, an act to 
establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend 
the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. What a title and what a 
problem the government is creating with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been indicated by previous speakers, this bill 
attempts to do a number of things, namely to discontinue the 
Canada pension plan advisory board and establish a Canada pension 
plan investment board, the main function of which will be to 
manage and invest Canada pension plan funds, to amend the 
contribution, benefit and funding provisions of the Canada 
pension plan, to tighten the eligibility for disability benefits 
and the rules for combining survivor and disability benefits and 
survivor and retirement benefits.  It reduces the death benefit, 
it reduces the maximum CPP retirement pension through its formula 
for calculating retirement pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing this bill attempts to do involves harmonizing.  We 
in Nova Scotia know that dreaded word, harmonizing, very well 
because we have the harmonized sales tax.  This bill attempts to 
harmonize the CPP disability benefits with provincial workers 
compensation benefits and various other benefits, including those 
received from municipalities and private insurers.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well Bill C-2 amends the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age 
Security Act with respect to information sharing, investigations 
and penalties.  Indeed some of the clauses regarding information 
sharing and investigations require close scrutiny but that will 
be done at a later time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say for now that we are opposed to this bill 
because it erodes the public pension system and the universality 
of that system.  It erodes the system that was established in 
1966 to provide all members of the paid labour force in Canada a 
base upon which to build their retirement income, as well as 
provide benefits in the case of serious disability or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the public pension system as proposed by this 
bill continue the trend of the Liberal government of penalizing 
the most vulnerable members of our society:  low income workers, 
many of whom are women, the disabled and seniors. Again with 
respect to seniors, the changes proposed by this bill regarding 
OAS and GIS have profound implications for seniors and the income 
they can look forward to under the new seniors benefit proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is creating more difficulties for people by 
introducing a bill that will force low income workers to pay more 
in contributions, that will cause fewer people to obtain benefits 
by tightening the eligibility for disability, that will create 
greater clawbacks on seniors' incomes, that will take away a 
person's right to have his or her own benefit by consolidating 
the income of both spouses.  Rather than creating these kinds of 
difficulties through Bill C-2, we believe the government would be 
better advised to spend its time correcting the problems which 
already exist in the Canada pension plan rather than creating new 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring specifically to the kinds of problems which we 
see every day in our constituency offices.  By far the largest 
volume of case work in Halifax West concerns Canada pension plan 
disability.  The same I believe is true in other NDP metro 
ridings and I am sure across the province and perhaps even across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main complaint is the lengthy process and red tape which 
applicants must go through before a final decision is rendered. 
First is the initial application with numerous forms and medical 
reports to assess eligibility.  Apparently almost everyone is now 
rejected at this initial level in keeping with a decision over 
the last few years to apply the definition of severe and 
prolonged disability more strictly for eligibility purposes, and 
Bill C-2 would put further restrictions on eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a rejection at the first level there is an appeal by 
way of a request for reconsideration which must be filed with the 
minister within 90 days. Then there is a second level of appeal 
to an independent, note the word independent, review tribunal. 
This must be filed within 90 days but may be extended at the 
discretion of the minister. Finally, applicants or the minister 
may appeal a decision of the review tribunal to the pension 
appeals board within another 90 days. Claimants dissatisfied with 
the board's decision may then ask for a reconsideration within 90 
days but this would entail more waiting and would likely be to no 
avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative procedures and hearings involved in all of 
these are long.  It is not uncommon to have applicants waiting 
for years before a final decision is rendered, sometimes with sad 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent applied four years ago and has since developed 
terminal cancer.  Last month he was told his application had been 
approved but even now it appears that the department is 
backtracking and wants more clarification on a range of items. 
This person is suffering with terminal cancer and is still unable 
to get disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency assistant had a meeting with two CPP officials 
last Thursday.  He was informed that there has been an attempt, 
which started last June, to speed up the process by regionalizing 
the services somewhat.  However there is still a backlog at the 
pension appeals board level.  The board is backlogged and is 
unable to hear cases expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures that we have obtained from Human Resources Development 
Canada suggest a trend starting in 1995 to reject most of the 
applications for CPP disability.  In 1993 they approved 69%. This 
was down to 44% in 1995 and sank to 33% in 1996. I am told that 
Nova Scotia has the highest per capita CPP disability claimants. 
If that is the case, this trend of rejecting applications is 
particularly harsh in our province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A major problem with this program is that the minister can and 
often does automatically appeal any decision below the appeals 
board level.  When the independent review tribunal has ruled in 
favour of an applicant the minister can appeal that decision, and 
the matter becomes bogged down in a time consuming process. No 
doubt the primary reason for this tactic is to save money, but 
this is being achieved on the backs of the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another troubling issue is that recipients of CPP disability 
benefits who try to work are penalized.  Benefits are withdrawn 
if they work for over three months.  This is most discouraging to 
the disabled who usually have to go through considerable personal 
sacrifices to supplement meagre benefits with a meagre income. 
The system should be working to improve the lives of the 
disabled, not to penalize them for trying to seek a more active 
and productive life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we cannot support Bill C-2 as it does nothing to 
correct the problems that are currently experienced, but rather 
introduces measures to make life even more difficult for low wage 
workers, women, young people, seniors and the disabled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be modified by inserting after the words 
“young Canadians” the following: “and more particularly, to

low income Canadians”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the largest riding in the ten provinces of Canada. 
It covers an area of over 802 square kilometres and has a 
population of 92,000.  To give you an idea of its size, it is 
equivalent to more than half the province of Quebec. 
There are four PQ members of the National Assembly doing the same 
work I am as a federal MP.  In other words, in the riding of 
Abitibi, there are four provincial MNAs and that costs four times 
as much.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the bill, in compliance with the law, changes 
to the Canada pension plan must be approved by at least two thirds 
of the provinces representing two thirds of the country's 
population. This requirement has been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents a significant step toward preserving, as 
we said we would, the Canadian income and retirement system.  The 
changes will ensure the plan's viability over the long term while 
making it fairer and more affordable for future generations of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They recognize that the Canada pension plan is fundamental to 
the public pension system.  The proposed changes will strengthen 
our system to permit it to continue to provide Canadians with the 
opportunity to create for themselves new and sufficient 
retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the future of the Canada pension plan for all 
Canadians, last February the federal and provincial governments 
agreed on changes to the plan to ensure its long term financial 
viability, while making it more fair and more affordable for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes have the support of the federal 
government and the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec especially, Ontario, 
Manitoba and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I must point out that Quebec administers a plan which 
parallels the Canada pension plan, that is, the Quebec pension 
plan.  The Government of Quebec, through the Hon. Lucien 
Bouchard, recently announced amendments to the Quebec pension 
plan comparable to the proposed changes to the CPP, with the 
result that premiums will be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at this new investment policy.  There are 
approximately two years' worth of benefits in the CPP at the present 
time.  The assets not immediately required to pay benefits are placed in 
non-negotiable instruments issued by the provinces.  The provinces pay 
interest on these loans at the rate of long-term federal government 
bonds, as set at the time they were issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater capitalization of the CPP will result in significant 
growth of the assets from approximately two years of benefits to 
four or five years of benefits over the next twenty years.  A new 
investment policy is necessary to get the best return possible in 
the interests of contributors.  A higher return on the plan's 
assets will help hold the line on increases in premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of all provinces, including Quebec, agreed on the 
following measures.  The assets of the CPP will be invested in a 
diversified portfolio of instruments in the best interests of the 
contributors and beneficiaries.  This new policy is consistent with that 
of most other pension funds in Canada, and in particular with that of 
the Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assets will be managed in a professional manner, independent of 
governments, by an investment board, which will periodically report to 
the public and to the various governments on its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to investments, the board will be subject to 
rules similar to those applying to other pension funds in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that schedule II contains a comparison of existing CPP 
provisions and the proposed changes.  This is something we should also 
mention:  early retirement, from age 60, no change; normal retirement, 
at 65, no change; late retirement, up to 70 years of age, no change. 
There is no change in the new bill to the maximum annual earnings with 
pension entitlement, indexed to salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no change to the ceiling for the combined 
survivor's and pension benefit in the new bill. All benefits, 
except death benefits, are now fully indexed. There will be no 
changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several stages to go through still. The bill complies 
with the terms and conditions agreed upon with the provinces in February 
regarding such things as a move toward fuller funding, with the new 
investment policy, changes to the formula for calculating certain 
benefits and a tightening of the administration of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always important to keep our people informed of what goes on 
in Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the 
first time in our history a whole generation of Canadians is 
unsure that it will be able to enjoy the same quality of life 
that their parents did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians worry that some of our most fundamental 
institutions and values, such as health care and the Canada 
pension plan, might not be there for them and their families when 
they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that they can no longer count on the federal 
government for everything.  There was a time when they did, no 
matter which political party was there.  We all know that. 
Everybody was looking for the government to take care of them, 
and the political parties were only too happy to promise 
everything. Canadians have every right to expect the federal 
government to set the right priorities and policies, and to chart 
the right course to achieve what they need for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an innovative, realistic plan that sets new priorities 
for government as part of a long-term vision for our future.  One 
of these priorities is security of retirement for all Canadians, 
and more especially, the restoration of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for leaders that are committed to 
maintaining the CPP as a central component of our social safety 
net.  They want obligations of the CPP to be clearly defined. 
They want it to be put on a sound financial footing, and they 
want it to be managed efficiently now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with the CPP?  For one thing, it is bordering on 
bankruptcy.  The rapid aging of our population is one of the main 
reasons.  I know that because they just have to take a look at my 
grey hair. My hon. friend across the way might have a little dye 
in his—I am not sure—but I think he is almost as grey as I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, for every person of retirement age there are five persons 
of working age.  In 20 years, there will be one person of 
retirement age for every four persons of working age. When 
today's youth retire 40 years from now, that ratio will be just 
one to three.  We have young pages sitting here.  We want to make 
sure that they have a good retirement pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 30 years, the average age of Canadians will be higher than 
the present average age of the population of Florida, with no 
corresponding adjustment in temperature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lower birth rate and increased life expectancy along with a 
sharp rise in disability claims also puts new stress on the CPP. 
The CPP has also been jeopardized by inadequate contribution 
levels and inefficient plan management as a consequence of faulty 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP funds, for instance, have been lent to the provinces at the 
rate Ottawa pays on its 20-year bonds.  This is less than what 
the provinces pay other bond holders.  It is also less than what 
private sector plans earn. No wonder Canadians think the 
government cannot add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP must be changed now if it is to provide pensions in the 
future. Older Canadians have earned the right to a secure 
retirement. Middle class workers cannot afford to pay more, and I 
know that because I had a young mother come to me just last week. 
She came with her husband and said “It will cost us $700 more, 
Mrs. Wayne.  We have two children.  We are trying to save every 
month for their education.  We don't want any handouts but we 
can't afford that $700 more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger Canadians want the CPP to be there when they need it, 
and they expect it to be flexible.  They expect government to 
plan for the future in the same way Canadians plan for their 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are some proposing to preserve the CPP?  The Liberal plan to 
fix the CPP is an $11 billion tax hike on working Canadians and 
employers over the next six years.  This is coupled with already 
punitively high EI levels which the Minister of Finance has 
refused to lower, despite a substantially high fund surplus. Such 
a traumatic tax grab would have a devastating affect on job 
creation.  This is an attack on the middle class taxpayers, 
families and small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform's plan is even simpler.  Just scrap it and replace 
the CPP with super RRSPs.  That is even more scary when we 
remember that at its last convention the Reform Party advocated 
eliminating the RRSP plan.  I do not know whether it has any plan 
at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Reform Party's plan Canadians would be given 
recognition bonds to reflect the CPP credits they have already 
earned.  This approach would leave young Canadians paying for the 
CPP benefits of their grandparents, for the recognition bonds due 
to their parents and for their own retirement savings.  On top of 
all of that, it fails to provide any numbers as to how it will 
pay for its proposals.  It reneges on a commitment to Canadians 
made by successive governments.  It ignores the profound 
attachment that Canadians have for this social program in favour 
of an extreme ideological position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals also have to assume the risk of inflation in their 
investment decisions under the Reform Party's plan.  The 
disability coverage now included in the CPP would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Liberal Party and Reform Party solutions are 
shortsighted and self-defeating.  The security, affordability and 
stability of the CPP are an integral part of the Progressive 
Conservative Party's plan to address the economic and social 
insecurity felt by so many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set out three key benchmarks to do so.  Make the CPP 
self-financing, offset premium increases with tax cuts and 
encourage more RRSP savings.  How would we meet these objectives? 
We would increase CPP contribution rates to levels adequate to 
ensure the long-term viability of the plan.  However, these 
increased contributions would be offset by the substantial 
reductions of personal income tax rates and EI premiums.  This 
means putting more money into the plan without asking Canadians 
to pick up the tab and without creating more threats to job 
creation.  We would also make provisions to finance the extra 
cost per year of seniors benefits resulting from demographic 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also need to know that never again will their pension 
funds be mismanaged the way they have been in the past.  They 
deserve a greater return on their investment. To ensure this we 
would transfer all CPP funds to a separately managed Canada 
pension trust as is already done in Quebec.  We would structure 
the Canada pension trust to be completely independent of the 
government of the day.  We would select the Canada trustees on a 
non-partisan basis, recruiting experts in the financial business 
and actuarial community in consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Canada pension trust and its trustees would 
be to advise the government on required contribution levels and 
to select the best private managers acceptable to the industry to 
invest the funds growing surplus to secure long-term returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most important that we guarantee all our young people 
today, not just the ones who are sitting in the House, but those 
across the country that there will be a retirement plan, a Canada 
pension plan for them.  It is up to each and every one of us in 
the House to make sure that this happens.  Now it is our 
generation's turn to become nation builders.  Part of that 
responsibility is to ensure that Canadians of all ages and all 
circumstances can count on a secure retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to debating this issue in the future because this 
must take place.

congratulations on your selection as Speaker.  We hope all 
members of the House will co-operate with you.  I know you are 
doing a very fine job with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from the Miramichi.  This is my first speech since the new 
Parliament began.  Today we in the Miramichi have heard of the 
resignation of our premier.  His absence from New Brunswick and 
the political scene in Canada is certainly going to be a great 
loss for all of us as Canadians.  I want to pay tribute to the 
many years that Frank spent, some 15 years, representing 
Miramichi, and for the past 10 years as premier of the province 
of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over that period of time he had to exert a good deal of effort 
looking at the pension funds in the province of New Brunswick and 
trying to find some solutions to their funding for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today as we consider the Canada pension plan, my constituents 
and Canadians in general would be shocked to hear some of the 
statements that are being made by members opposite.  I have heard 
very few complaints about the plan not being effective.  I have 
heard very few concerns about people not wanting to participate 
in the plan.  It is looked upon as a very important part of that 
great income security system that the Liberal Party and Liberal 
governments have made for this country over the past several 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Canada there are approximately five million Canadians 
who in one way or another are receiving payments from the Canada 
pension plan.  We have approximately 3.7 million plus another 1.2 
million under the Quebec pension plan. Of that group some 2.4 
million Canadians and 800,000 under the Quebec plan are receiving 
retirement benefits. In the disability portion of the plan we 
have some 300,000 Canadians in other provinces along with another 
50,000 people in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good plan.  However, in the next few years the plan will 
need more money to support future Canadians as they require the 
benefits from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear of the demands of the opposition that we should move 
away from a Canada pension plan and toward a system of RRSPs I 
have to remind the House that RRSPs do not have the great 
benefits that are shared by those who participate in the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today contributions to the plan are some 5.85% shared by 
employees and employers.  However, future contributions will 
eventually reach some 9.9% to be shared by those two groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP does not only include retirement.  It also includes a 
great number of other benefits to the Canadian people. Those who 
pay into the plan are protected against disability.  Those who 
pay into the plan have their spouses protected in case of death 
or disability.  Those who participate in the plan have their 
children protected until they either finish school or if they 
continue in school, until they are 25 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is essential and is regarded as being essential by 
most Canadians.  It is a form of income security.  There is a 
basic understanding among the Canadian workforce that workers 
will be able to receive benefits if they become sick for an 
extended period of time, if they become injured and they cannot 
work or if they eventually are not able to participate for other 
given reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to share in the great benefits the 
economy of this nation has.  We must make sure as members of 
Parliament that we indicate to Canadians that we are willing to 
participate in a program where all Canadians can share in the 
benefits of our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are private plans out there.  When the committee 
looks at the Canada pension plan bill it realizes that it has to 
look at some of the concerns that are being expressed here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint John, for example, recommended that we 
should look in terms of maybe trying to reduce income tax as we 
increase Canada pension benefits.  Certainly this might be a fact 
that could be considered by our Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might also look at how various calculations are made.  It is 
certainly important that we look at how the plan will affect us 
in the future and how the calculations will try to make sure that 
we get the optimum level of interest in terms of where that plan 
is invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is good that we are moving away from the system 
whereby the funds were available to the provinces at very low 
interest rates.  It certainly will give a better return to the 
investment.  We have an investment of nearly $40 billion and 
probably through a better system of investing on the open market 
the plan can gain more money for future people involved with 
Canada pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope, in terms of the eventual outcome, as it goes to 
committee we can look at the many suggestions that are being made 
to the House today, that we will eventually come up with a good 
system by which all Canadians can participate and by which all of 
us, in terms of being members of this Parliament, can ensure that 
Canadians are guaranteed a safe and secure pension plan that will 
apply to all workers in the country.

Mr. Speaker, this is the first opportunity I have had to speak 
since the election.  I want to thank Herb Grubel who represented 
Howe Sound before me.  I know Herb served this House very well in 
the one term he was here.  He is now back at Simon Fraser 
University and working with the Fraser Institute.  I know all 
members would like me to wish him well. I would like to, on 
behalf of all the constituents, thank him for the job he did 
while he was here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your 
re-election and the election of all the deputy Speakers.  I was 
here 25 years ago making a speech in this House in 1972 as a 
Conservative member of Parliament.  It is quite interesting to 
listen to the speeches in this debate.  In 25 years some things 
do not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the constituents of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast for 
sending me back.  As my youngest son said to me, that was a 
quarter of a century ago.  It was before he was even born, but I 
have six other children who were already born.  I am not sure 
they enjoyed my time when I was here before because it is a lot 
different when you are 30 years of age with five children and be 
a member of Parliament than it is when you are 55 years of age 
and you have all your family grown up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can thank my constituents for sending me here.  I know I am 
going to enjoy this session.  I am certainly enjoying being a 
Reform member of Parliament.  When I look back and read the first 
speech I ever made in this House, I could say most of the same 
things today.  A lot of things do not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Canada pension plan.  I heard my good friend, 
the member of the Tory party, speaking a couple of times before 
me talking about what the Tories would do and I listened to what 
the Liberals would do, yet this plan is $560 billion in debt. 
Some things just do not change.  We have a major debt in this 
country and we have a pension plan that is not working very well 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the people in this country, as this debate goes along, 
are going to start really wanting to know what is happening with 
the Canada pension plan.  Where are they going to be when they 
want to retire?  I think it is pretty scary.  It is scary when I 
hear Liberal members on the other side.  I heard a member from 
the Conservative Party talking about how Reform wanted to cancel 
the RRSP.  The election is over.  They should get that nonsense 
out of their heads.  This party never said it was going to cancel 
RRSPs.  Our plan for the Canada pension plan is one that should 
be listened to by the Canadian people and should be listened to 
by all sides of this House because it makes a lot of common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member on the other side the other day talking about 
Bre-X because our plan would involve using the private sector. 
What would happen to all these poor pensioners if they had been 
involved in Bre-X?  Even the member does not know how pension 
plans invest their money or it is just a straight scare tactic. 
There are bad companies every year in the stock market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies that invest in the stock market do not just invest in 
one company.  The Ontario teacher's pension plan in 1995 was 
worth $25 billion, in 1996 $35 billion and in April 1996 was up 
to $41 billion.  It probably had shares in Bre-X.  Most Canadian 
pension plans did.  It was on the Toronto stock exchange. Thank 
God it was not a BSE stock or we on the west coast would have 
taken all the heat for that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bre-X was a disaster as far as a stock is concerned.  But all 
the pension plans went up last year even with the Bre-X 
situation.  If we look at the average return, the Ontario 
teacher's pension plan has earned 16.7% in 1997 so far and over 
four years it averaged 12.1%. That is not a bad return. The 
overall performance in the private sector is 8% to 10% but the 
teacher's plan is 16.7% and the CPP, 2%.  By the year 2000 it 
will be 1.8%.  How can we expect any Canadian to think they can 
retire on a pension plan that is going to give them 1.8% to 2%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector in this country does a good job. Why are we 
here not more concerned about a government that wants us to do a 
CPP that will only give a small amount of money? The CPP is going 
to have $10 billion annually by the year 2003.  It is a tax grab. 
It is like the EI. There will be a few billion in the bank. Where 
is going to come from?  It will come from the people who work, 
the people who want a fair pension when they retire. Every member 
in the House knows what they think about our pension plan. This 
plan does not come anywhere close.  Most guys who retired after 
the last election get as much in a month as these people will get 
in a year with this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Quebec pension plan is better managed than the CPP.  It 
is a province that has its own pension plan and it has done a 
better job than the federal government.  Maybe my province of 
British Columbia should look at opting out the CPP and getting 
its own pension plan.  Maybe it could do a better job.

per year, and this is what the average Canadian has to think 
about.  To the average taxpayer that is a lot of money.  We are 
talking about $700. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people are probably a bit jaded about the money, but to 
the average constituent $700 is a lot of money. If there are two 
people working that is $1,400, over $100 a month. We in the House 
have to start thinking about the average Canadian and not 
relating to our pension plan which is what we are doing overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are average Canadians going to do when they have to put out 
this extra money?  How are they going to look after their 
families?  We in the House do not seem to think much about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the young people to assume a national debt of $600 
billion and now we are asking them to pay the CPP debt at the 
same time.  Young people in this country are getting very 
frustrated because they cannot get ahead. They want a better 
pension plan and a better tax system. We all know that.  The 
debate in this House in this session is the lead off to why we 
are going to see a revolution in this country to change the tax 
system.  The CPP is just going to be the start. People are fed up 
paying more and more money to the government for fewer services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal minister said they are going to get a better return 
on investment by setting up a new CPP investment board appointed 
by cabinet.  Even the Liberals laugh at that because they know. 
At least they could bring it to the House or to committee so we 
could all look at where it was going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some of the best companies in the world here in Canada. 
Some American companies have been bought out because they have 
been very successful in the mutual fund business.  Why are we not 
using those companies just we are suggesting?  Use the companies 
in Canada to help us invest the CPP.  Put it right into the 
private sector which has done well.  A politically driven board 
is not going to solve the CPP problems in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP needs an overall review.  It was a nice thought when it 
was started because we all wanted a pension plan.  But it has not 
worked and people cannot live on $8,844 per year.  Anybody who 
thinks they can is not looking at reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern day pension plans are defined contribution plans.  These 
take many forms, but in these plans the contributor personally 
owns the contribution and the accrued growth.  That is what is 
extremely important and the public should remember that, defined 
contribution plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is looking at this type of plan to help Canadians get a 
plan which will give them something they can retire on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking employees and employers to increase 
their CPP contributions.  That will hurt small business.  If we 
took a portion of that money and put it into a private sector 
plan, instead of retiring on $8,000 a year the numbers could get 
up to $24,000, $30,000 or $40,000 based on what people have been 
investing in mutual funds over the last 100 years since they have 
been available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of the House who has RRSPs in a mutual fund company 
will know that they have grown a lot more than the CPP in the 
last few years.  Why do we not give Canadians the chance to have 
their individual account where they can see the money going in 
every month and receive a statement every month showing the 
growth in the plan, which would be protected by both the 
government and the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not believe in that it does not believe 
in this country.  It does not believe in the private sector which 
runs this country.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to take some responsibility for their own plans 
and the way to do that is by allowing them to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Ontario teachers pension plan and 
other major pension plans in the country.  Those plans are doing 
better than the government pension plan.  They are being run by 
the private sector.  Even the most socialistic of groups that 
have a pension plan run by the private sector is doing better 
than it would with the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to listen to what is being said in the 
House.  Let us look at the pension plan which the Reform Party is 
recommending to Canada.  Let us ensure that this debate goes on 
long enough so that Canadian people will know that this plan is 
the second biggest tax grab in our country's history.

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK233">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to 
amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment and the 
amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast on his maiden speech in this House 
after an absence of 25 years.  Perhaps there was a good reason 
for his return to debate the retirement system of Canada. I know 
the member opposite has a distinguished career in public service 
in British Columbia and I welcome his return to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-2, an act to establish the 
Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada 
pension plan.  This bill is a very important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot let our seniors down and we have to ensure that all 
Canadians have a sound pension plan for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized some time ago that the Canada pension plan was not 
on very sound footing.  We also understand that Canadians look 
to the federal government for leadership when it comes to the 
retirement income systems of Canada.  We realized that the Canada 
pension plan is not unlike many pension plans around the world, 
whether they be private or public pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew we had to put the plan on a sound financial footing. 
There are many pension plans facing the same challenges.  With 
changing demographics, changes in the birth rates and increasing 
life expectancy many pension plans in the public sector and in 
the private sector are facing challenges. It is not uncommon in 
the private sector to have unfunded pension plans, which only 
recently companies are beginning to address.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the situation we found ourselves in with respect to the 
Canada pension plan was nothing that we are particularly proud 
of, it is not unlike many situations in many countries and in 
many private pension plans.  Our government is taking the lead by 
making amendments to the act and by putting the Canada pension 
plan on a sound footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized that we had to make the plan fiscally sound, so we 
began consultations across Canada.  We spoke to all Canadians. 
Canadians told us that they wanted the federal government to play 
a leadership role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked with the provinces and basically we began to look at 
three different scenarios.  One scenario was that we increase the 
contributions to the Canada pension plan.  The second alternative 
was that we decrease the benefits under the Canada pension plan. 
The third scenario was that we look at some combination of the 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sat down with Canadians, we sat down with the provinces and 
we came up with a solution that I think is the fairest and most 
reasonable solution.  In doing so we have avoided radical changes 
to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to contributions, the rates will rise over the next 
six years to 9.9% of contributing earnings.  That is 4.95% for 
each employee and employer.  We avoided the increase of 14.2% 
that was actually estimated by the chief actuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 will establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
which will allow the invested funds to be put to uses that 
typically most pension funds have the capacity to invest in. They 
will not be restricted to debt instruments. They will have the 
capacity to look at equity and in so doing, they will be able to 
earn a greater return from the pension plan funds that are 
invested. This legislation will allow that to happen. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Canada pension plan until this 
point in time has not had the flexibility that other pension 
plans would be permitted, the pension plan has still yielded an 
average of about 10% which is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the opposition parties rant and rave about this 
hopelessly inadequate Canada pension plan I think they should 
sharpen their pencils.  They talk about a real rate of return of 
6%.  A real rate of return is the nominal rate of return minus 
inflation.  They say their self-directed super RRSP given that 
kind of return will put the Canada pension plan system on a sound 
footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canadians are saying that they want a public pension 
system. Canadians are saying they want the federal government and 
the provinces involved. If Reform members say they want a real 
rate of return of 6%, then a lot of pension plans would be doing 
very well with a real rate of return of 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at the experience of other countries. There 
are some small countries that have experimented with the proposal 
that Reform discusses.  What we have determined is that the 
administration costs for these super directed RRSPs or private 
plans are approaching 10% even though we do not have a lot of 
experience with them. There are only a few years of experience. 
Compare that with the administration burden of the Canada pension 
plan at 2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal by the Reform Party would certainly make a lot of 
stockbrokers, investment advisers and retirement planners very 
rich and wealthy, but I am wondering what it would do for 
Canadians. In a self-directed RRSP would the average Canadian 
citizen have to sit there at night and work over all the numbers 
or hire some investment counsellor?  What about the Canadian 
public not all of whom have the sophistication of the investors 
sitting opposite? How are they going to deal with securing their 
retirement future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it would do very well for all the friends of the Reform 
Party, their investment brokers and counsellors.  Perhaps that is 
where they have been getting these suggestions from.  Have they 
actually been listening to Canadians?  I doubt it very much.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another irony is that with the Reform proposal even though 
Reformers will not put it out very publicly, contributions will 
go to 14% whereas our contribution rate maxes out at about 9.9%. 
It will do very well for all the investment advisers and 
stockbrokers in the Reform Party's constituencies, but what about 
the average Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private plan Reformers are proposing does not have the 
features of a public pension plan. For example, what about people 
who become disabled?  Is that part of their plan as well?  Will 
they look after them?  What about survivor benefits?  Does their 
proposal contemplate that scenario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our legislation on which we have a consensus of the vast 
majority of the provinces does not affect people who are 
disabled.  It treats them in a fair and equitable manner.  It 
contemplates survivor benefits.  And it does not affect anybody 
over 65 years of age as of December 31, 1997.  The benefits will 
remain fully indexed to inflation and all the current retirement 
ages remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have struck a very reasonable balance.  In fact if we 
look at the ratio of the changes we made to the benefits as 
opposed to the contributions, 25% can be attributed to the 
changes in retirement benefits and 75% can be attributed to 
changes in the contribution rate and also the actuarial estimates 
of the income that will come from this more advantageously 
managed fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who say that the CPP is a tax grab either do not 
understand economics or they do not understand tax.  The 
contributions to the Canada pension plan go into a separately 
administered fund.  They never hit consolidated revenue ever, 
ever, ever.  Members should read the estimates and they will 
discover that the Canada pension plan is a separately 
administered pension plan. It goes nowhere near the revenues of 
the government.  If that is not political hyperbole to say it is 
a tax grab, I don't know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this plan is going to secure the future for all 
Canadians.  It is going to make sure that we look after our 
current seniors.  I am hoping that all members of this House will 
support this very important bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take 
part in the debate on the act to establish the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board and to amend the Canada pension plan and the Old Age 
Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is now at second reading, the stage at which we deal with 
the underlying principles of the legislation. Like all Bloc Quebecois 
members who spoke before me, I fully agree with the principle of the 
bill, since the overall objective of the reform is to preserve the 
sustainability of a public pension plan. I insist on the word “public”. 
The Reform Party would rather have private plans. Yesterday, their 
leader tabled an amendment which basically says: let us stop considering 
the bill. 
The Reform Party is opposed to this legislation. It would prefer a super 
RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my fifth year here, but I am still surprised at some of the 
things I see in this House, such as the tabling by the NDP of an 
amendment to the amendment by the Reform Party. As I understand the 
rules, the purpose of an amendment to an amendment is to improve the 
original amendment and it implies that we agree with it. 
It is quite surprising to suddenly see the NDP agree with the 
Reform Party to reject a proposal from the Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was among those who congratulated the member for Madawaska—Restigouche, 
first for defeating the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development during the last election—which is a praiseworthy 
accomplishment in itself—but also for his speeches on employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intention may be good, the means used create confusion, 
unless the words “women”, “disabled”, etc., are added, because it 
implies that the two parties agree with the Reform Party's amendment 
seeking to reject the idea of a public pension plan for Canadians, 
including a number of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out for the benefit of those who are listening that 
less than 1% of Quebeckers are affected by this bill, since the Quebec 
pension plan is in effect in our province. That figure is made up of 
Quebec residents who, at one time, worked in another province and came 
back to live in Quebec, and of people who served in the armed forces or 
the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, at this stage, the issue is whether or not we support the idea 
of a public pension plan. 
As for the Bloc Quebecois, I reaffirm that we are in favour of a 
public pension plan, because it is not true that everyone has the 
possibility individually, over his or her lifetime, to prepare for 
retirement by contributing to an RRSP.  This is not the case for 
low wage earners, and I am also thinking of those who are becoming 
more and more common, unfortunately, the single mothers—and single 
fathers too—who have difficulties the whole time they are raising 
their children, even when the children have reached young adulthood 
and are still pursuing their studies.  It is hard for many people, 
therefore, to contribute to an RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We absolutely must have a public pension plan so that 
opportunities at the time of retirement are as equal as possible. 
I would therefore invite the new NDP members to reflect on this, 
for I am sure that it falls in line with their usual values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is in favour of something, and has very little time, 
there is no point in arguing the point further, but I would like, 
as the member for Lévis, to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Charlotte, on a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, under the rules of the 
House, there should be a minister present and I believe that is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  According to someone 
much more familiar with the rules of the House than the Chair, 
there is no such requirement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the members of the Conservative 
Party with little to say are interested in points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two initiatives from groups in the riding of Lévis are 
similar.  While they agree with the principle of a public pension 
plan, they want people to prepare for retirement as early as they 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Association des coopératives d'économie 
familiale (ACEF) in my riding yesterday invited me to attend the 
launch of a training course intended to help people of all ages 
prepare for retirement.  They will of course get information to 
prepare them to save, even a little.  I think this applies not only 
to the people in my riding, but to all ridings, because even if the 
program is the creation of the south shore ACEF it will be 
available to all the ACEFs in the various regions of Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite those interested to contact the ACEF.  The entire 
program is aimed at enabling people to come to terms increasingly 
with the need to prepare for retirement.  In 1996, seniors groups 
met at a summit in my riding.  Among other things, they discussed 
at length the issue of information on retirement and the ACEF 
responded to their need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about this.  Members who sat in the last 
Parliament will recall that I was the training and youth critic. 
Since then, I have aged and, since May 15, at 50 years of age, I 
have been eligible to join seniors clubs. 
I know many of our colleagues opposite are also in the same position, 
which means they are able to plan for their own retirement and, more 
importantly, to help other people do the same, and walk them through the 
process. As members of Parliament, we have a duty to monitor 
legislation, and this one in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we support this legislation because it is designed to 
help future generations plan ahead so they are not faced with an empty 
fund at some point in time. Had the government not introduced this 
legislation as it did on September 25, action would have been deferred 
unduly and we would have found ourselves in a situation where the 
financial security of those coming after us might have been jeopardized. 
That is why we are in favour of immediately making changes to the plan 
by, first, increasing premiums because fuller funding is required right 
away to build a fund out of which pensions can be paid to those who will 
come after us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, members from Quebec, are pleased to note that, from time to 
time, the federal government imitates the Government of Quebec. As you 
know, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec is in charge of making 
sure that the revenue from premiums is invested in businesses to produce 
the best possible return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of this bill is to have the board see to it 
that the amounts collected in the form of premiums are invested in a 
such a way as to produce the best possible return to ultimately make the 
retirement fund grow. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, have nothing against 
that, since, in Quebec, the Caisse de dépôt et placement—which dates 
back to 1964, I think—has worked wonders and, moreover, fosters 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by repeating that we are all in favour of this. At 
the same time, while being in favour of a public pension system, I think 
individuals should be encouraged to plan for their retirement, within 
their means, as early as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in this debate.  We are discussing the 
future of our national retirement plan, the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was introduced after talking to Canadians.  We 
asked them about their future and they responded.  They asked us 
to preserve the Canada pension plan.  They told us that they 
needed to know it would be there when they retired or if they 
became disabled.  They also told us they wanted to see some 
changes.  They asked for better financing of the plan.  They 
asked for improved investment practices.  They asked that the 
growing costs of benefits be slowed to ensure the long term 
stability of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has addressed those concerns.  We have put 
forward a bill that has the support of each provincial government 
representing two-thirds of our population and three political 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite that the bill was first introduced in 
February 1997 and was a result of joint provincial consultations. 
It is a first class example of participatory democracy.  I cannot 
think of a better testament to the government's determination to 
find a solution with broad based support.  It goes to our 
commitment to building and working in partnerships as we confront 
the challenges facing us on a daily basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that the governments of Saskatchewan and British 
Columbia could not see it as the only viable way to guarantee the 
future of the Canada pension plan, a program I know they value as 
much as I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is a public plan funded by employer and employee 
contributions.  It is jointly managed by federal and provincial 
governments.  The plan provides retirement pensions and a range 
of survivor benefits for a family in the event of death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan provides a fully indexed pension system. 
It provides replacement of a quarter of insurable earnings.  It 
provides benefits that are portable and universal. It provides 
protection against periods of low or no earnings including years 
spent raising children.  It provides benefits to workers who are 
unable to work due to disability, and death and survivor benefits 
including benefits for dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told us they wanted their plan fixed now, not 
scrapped, not privatized.  We have come up with a solution that 
is fair, equitable and balanced.  I am proud to stand here in 
support of it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our loudest critics are the members across the way.  They claim 
we are ripping off the taxpayer, but the funds generated by this 
premium increase will not be put into a general revenue fund. 
They will be held for the sole purpose of providing future CPP 
payouts.  While the fearmongers among us would have us believe 
this is a sinister tax grab, I remind them that these premiums 
are no less than a prudent investment in the future of retiring 
Canadians who are most in the need of this portion of their 
retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critics say they have an alternative.  Let us look at their 
alternative for a moment.  Their super RRSP is a fully indexed 
tax deferred trust fund similar to the conventional RRSPs that 
promise to pay more with lower contributions, but their scheme 
does not take into consideration any volatility in the market. It 
assumes that all investors will make wise investments.  It puts 
all the risks on the worker.  It does not provide benefits for 
children.  It does not provide a child rearing drop out provision 
and it will not provide indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has not indicated a clear plan of how it would implement 
the system.  For example, what contribution would the employers 
have to pay, if any?  How would they deal with seniors who are 
already benefiting from the CPP?  Who would pick up the tab to 
provide protection for these pensioners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform says it will guarantee benefits for current seniors, but 
it does not say how it will provide funding for it. Obviously 
workers will have to pay twice:  once for their RRSP and once 
again to guarantee the benefit for current seniors.  The estimate 
of the funding that would be required is $18 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested under their proposal that a retiree might 
collect $117,000 more over the course of 30 or 40 years, or about 
$25 a week.  This scenario is only correct if they do not drop 
out, if they do not get disabled and if they actually make their 
contributions.  Let us consider how many actually make RRSP 
contributions now.  It assumes they invest wisely.  It assumes 
they will not be ripped off by a disreputable financial adviser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to administer over 10 million individual RRSPs and 
insurance plans would be greater than the administrative costs of 
the CPP.  In 1994 administrative costs of the CPP were $20 per 
contributor while the administrative cost of an RRSP plan are 
between $125 and $175.  The administrative cost of the Chilean 
system the Reform holds out as being the model actually costs 10% 
compared with 2% for the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform would create jobs to profit the insurance industry and 
RRSP sellers, but it would not provide a better deal for workers. 
Under the Reform proposal workers would be asked to put all their 
eggs in one basket, one RRSP account.  We support a mixed system 
where workers receive a basic benefit from the public plan. Under 
the CPP individual workers can add RRSPs for extra retirement 
income if they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform plan would require families to purchase separate 
insurance to cover disability and death benefits already provided 
under the CPP.  This insurance would be expensive.  Reformers do 
not tell us about that when they tout the effectiveness of their 
RRSP plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian pension plan is family friendly, something I 
thought the Reform Party cared about.  Our plan covers people who 
leave the workforce temporarily to look after their children. It 
is a good example of how Canadians help each with special needs. 
Under the Reform Party everybody looks after themselves.  The 
Reform Party stand on this issue contradicts its commitment to 
represent its constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say it is a real pleasure to discuss the bill in 
the House but I cannot. However, I can tell you how disgusted I 
am with the government for moving closure on what is probably the 
most important bill it will bring before parliament in this 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had eight hours of debate and already the government has 
moved closure.  Hon. members in the Reform Party, and no doubt in 
other parties as well, will tell the House that when people come 
to their town hall meetings the issue that is highest on their 
agenda is the issue of pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the government does not think it is important enough to 
allow parliamentarians to debate this issue.  After merely eight 
hours it has said “Enough, we are going to close off debate”. 
That is absolutely disgusting, anti-democratic and typical 
Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last time around the Liberals jumped all over the Tories who set 
a record for introducing closure. This time around the Liberals 
have already gone well beyond what the Tories did.  It proves the 
old adage of my friend, the member formerly for Beaver River, now 
from Edmonton North, Liberal-Tory, same old story.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak now to the essence of the bill.  First, the 
Canada pension plan is in serious trouble.  Everybody knows that. 
It has a $560 billion liability.  We know that in order to deal 
with the problems of the plan, the government is raising the 
premiums by an astounding 73%, the largest tax hike in Canadian 
history, a $10 billion tax hike by the final year that the new 
premiums go into effect.  Despite that $10 billion when people 
retire they will still only get a pension of $8,800. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about their MP pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  In other words, people will pay in 
some cases $3,300 a year for 47 years if they happen to be 
self-employed, and at the end of that time they will get a measly 
pension of $8,800, and that is the best case scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a you happen to be a widow, under the government's plan, 
after your husband has paid into the plan for 47 years at $3,300 
a year, you can count on $460 a month. That is absolutely 
disgusting.  And the government says that this is some kind of 
reform as though it is good?  No one believes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not the worst of it.  It also raises the huge 
issue of the inter-generational transfer.  Many members know, if 
they have talked to young people, how cheated young people feel 
by what is being proposed in this legislation. Young people are 
asking why in the world they are being asked to contribute to 
something that they will never draw from.  That is their 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that hon. members know if they will examine their 
hearts that in a few year's time when young people form the 
majority in this country they are going to be sorely tempted to 
change the plan to ensure that they will get some of the benefits 
that will now only go to some people who are currently in the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has set up a plan that is going to set young 
people against their parents. It knows this is one of the 
problems with the plan, but it has done nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I do not have a lot of time, I want to talk about the 
Reform Party proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friends across the way have tried to scare people, which 
is their typical way of dealing with these things, by suggesting 
the Reform Party plan is something radically new.  I would point 
out to my friends across the way that not only have about 25 
different countries around the world adopted this sort of plan, 
countries like the U.K., Switzerland, Denmark, Australia now has 
a version of it, and Argentina.  The U.S. is looking at this 
right now.  It is talking about going to this sort of plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the point that the Reform Party is simply taking the best 
of what is being offered around the world and offering it to 
Canadians. Why are Canadians second class citizens to this 
government? Why can they not have some of the great benefits that 
this plan has brought to other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that Singapore has had this plan or a 
variation thereon since 1955.  It has the highest savings rate in 
the world.  Eighty-five per cent of the people in Singapore own 
their own homes.  It is because there is a tremendous amount of 
prosperity in that country, due in part to this plan.  We need to 
talk about these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government members held consultations did they want to 
hear about this sort of plan?  No.  Their consultations were 
limited precisely to the type of plan they wanted to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite my friends to consider what the Reform Party would do 
if it was in government.  First, it would bring in tax relief. 
Now, that is novel for the government to hear, tax relief.  Under 
the Reform Party plan it would take 1.3 million Canadians right 
off the tax rolls.  That would do something to deal with the 
problem of the hike in premiums that the government is proposing 
and 300,000 seniors would be lifted right off the tax roll.  I 
think that is important to talk about.  The Reform Party would 
target seniors benefits so that people on the low end of the 
income scale would get more through the seniors benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also guarantee that existing seniors would get the CPP 
benefits which were promised to them.  We would bring in an 
improved survivor benefit.  Under Reform's super RRSP we would 
have the situation where we could actually turn over the entire 
amount of the annuity to the surviving spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend from Calgary pointed out earlier in the day, under 
the Reform Party plan, if the mandatory CPP premiums were put 
them into an RRSP, and accumulated in an account in the 
individual Canadian's name, at the end of the 40 years they would 
have an annuity of over $250,000, paying them an income of about 
$24,000 a year.  That is three times what the government plan 
offers.  It would be a tremendous benefit which would be turned 
over entirely to the surviving spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why government members do not want to adopt 
something like that instead of paying a measly $436 a month to 
the surviving spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that Reform would provide the super RRSP plan so that 
people who are just coming into the system would start to pay 
into an account in their own name.  As I mentioned a minute ago, 
that would build up over a period of time.  It would give them a 
tremendous retirement nest egg, far greater than what the 
government is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we would start to contribute a bit into the 
existing CPP because under successive Liberal and Tory 
governments it has run up a $560 billion liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I point out that the Reform Party plan would give 
Canadians the power of choice.  It would allow them to direct 
where their money was to be invested.  That is a novel idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the government plan we know where the money would go.  It 
would go to the super investment board, which would probably 
represent the largest intervention in the Canadian economy since 
the second world war.  The government would be directing about 
$130 billion. We would have a team of bureaucrats or political 
appointees, chosen by the finance minister, to direct where $130 
billion would go in the economy.  That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the House today and in previous days how 
corrupt are some of the things that go on in this government. Do 
we really want to turn over the keys to the vault to these 
people?  We are talking about $130 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people forget to whom that money belongs.  These people 
think it belongs to them.  They think it is their God given right 
to tax it out of people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that is wrong.  That money belongs to the Canadian 
people.  It is their hard earned money and it should accumulate 
in an account in their name, far from the grasping fingers of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is time for the government to wake up and realize 
there are other options.  Just because an idea comes from the 
opposition does not automatically mean it is wrong.  Maybe it is 
time to look at alternatives.  The government should start to 
look at the alternatives which exist around the world.  If it did 
that it would begin to realize that the Reform Party is on to 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To force closure on this issue eight hours into the debate in a 
brand new Parliament sets a precedent which I believe will 
resonate throughout the entire mandate.  I hope my friends across 
the way will seriously consider the impact that moving closure on 
a bill of this magnitude will have on this Parliament.  To me it 
speaks to the anti-democratic nature of the government.  I trust 
that very soon it will be punished when Canadian voters once 
again get the chance, just like it was punished in the last 
election when it lost 30 members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, for the benefit of members opposite, there are 
changes in the wind.  I guess it was Heracleitus, the Greek 
philosopher. who said “Nothing in the world endures except 
change”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must amend some of this legislation to make it better, more 
propitious, more benevolent for the wonderful workers of this 
great country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in front of me a few questions that have been asked of 
ordinary Canadians.  I did not realize until tonight that some 
members opposite could not participate, would not participate or 
were prevented from participating in this debate.  I am truly 
sorry for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the friendly giant across, the hon. member from 
Munchkinland.  I see him sitting on the steps over there so he 
can see what is going on.  Perhaps I will lend him my fedora 
because I am getting blinded here.  He suffers from premature 
“defolication”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it was the hon. member for Calgary Southeast who say 
that business was suffering as a result of the CPP.  I beg to 
differ.  I am at variance with that.  I come from the field of 
business.  What hurt business in the last 10 to 20 years more 
than anything else was high interest rates.  We now have the 
lowest interest rates in 35 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP has not prevented me from hiring anyone unless they were not 
good workers.  Perhaps some of the members opposite might fill 
that bill.  It was not the CPP that was stopping me from hiring 
people.  It was the high interest rates, and now we have the 
lowest interest rates in 35 years and doing a remarkable job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do the proposed changes make the CPP more sustainable, 
affordable and fair for Canadians?  Just the simple fact we have 
raised these premiums a bit, it is sustaining everything for our 
entire lifetime.  Some members opposite could live to be 75 or 80 
years of age, although some of them already look like they are 
octogenarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on now to the affordability.  Certainly it is 
affordable.  We have six years before it gets up to the top 
premium price of 9.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it fair?  Certainly it is fair.  I want some of the hon. 
members opposite who are under the age of 30, mere pups, to take 
advantage of the wonderful system we are putting in place.  The 
hon. member for Elk Island will not be around that long to look 
after it, but some of the younger members under the age of 30, 
still in diapers, will be able to look after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question is will the CPP be there for me when I retire. 
I am having so much fun here I do not think I will ever retire. I 
will not have to take advantage of this.  With the system we have 
put in place to look after the pension plan, it will be there for 
one and all when we retire, if we so choose to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the question the Reform Party is very interested in.  It 
was asked at many committee meetings.  Instead of making changes 
why don't you scrap the CPP?  Can't better pensions be provided 
through RRSPs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My answer is simply that Reform Party members have clearly 
indicated through their own actuaries that the RRSP program is 
more expensive than the CPP.  Why?  Not only would they be 
contributing to their own RRSPs.  They also must pay for the 
benefits that have accrued through the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself should be clear evidence to the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  It is quite obvious I agree with that. 
One would not have to be a rocket scientist.  A mere cerebrally 
challenged farmer such as myself could figure that one out.

the throne speech correctly outlined that a country that has

successfully will have a better future.  I believe this to be 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government have made tremendous strides in our attack on 
child poverty.  For example the government has demonstrated its 
commitment by increasing its contribution to the Canada child tax 
benefit by $850 million a year, with higher payments to families 
beginning July 1, 1998.  We need to do more. We need to focus on 
child hunger. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a teacher, I am well aware that a hungry child does not do well

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police, I know 
firsthand that these children often start down the path of 
delinquency and end up as young offenders or worse. In a country 
as wealthy as Canada, it is unacceptable that 20 per cent of our 
children live in poverty and an estimated three million children 
arrive at school hungry. People in our communities and schools 
are ready, willing and able to assist to ensure that nutrition 
programs are in place for all Canadian schools that need one.

examine this issue and explore ways and means available to ensure 
that child hunger is no more by the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Waterloo—Wellington, who is already beginning to make his mark 
in the House with very poignant and very incisive interventions, 
that as far as the federal government is concerned, in Canada 
childhood is for children. As Canadians we want our children to 
enjoy all the opportunities that Canada has to offer both in 
childhood and as they grow into adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to seize the opportunity early in the lives 
of our children to nurture their development and to help them 
prepare for the years ahead. The growing body of research 
evidence is clear.  Children's early experiences have long term 
effects on their health, intellectual development and well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While families are the ones who are first and foremost 
responsible for the development of their children, they are not 
the only ones who must assume some responsibility. Governments,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
draw to the attention of the House and the government the grave 
situation facing students in this country who are reeling under 
student loan debt and the crisis which is in our post-secondary 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a question in the House last week and asked the 
minister responsible what the government was prepared to do to 
provide real financial assistance to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that post-secondary education and student loan debt 
has now reached a crisis proportion.  Despite the recommendations 
and announcements of the government on its intentions in the 
throne speech, the crisis continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge gap in the reality of what the government is 
saying, what it is purporting to do and what the reality is that 
is facing our institutions and students in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government is truly committed, as it repeatedly 
says it is, to access an opportunity for young people in Canada, 
then why have we seen a cut of more than $2 billion in our 
post-secondary educational institutions since 1993?  Why has 
there been a cut of $550 million this year alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the government has shown by its actions, not 
by the rhetoric but by its actions that it does not care.  It 
does not care about the student loan debts which students are 
facing in this country.  It does not care that it is more 
difficult for our post-secondary institutions to deal with the 
financial crisis which is upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Canadian Federation of Students produced a major 
report called the “Blueprint for Access ”.  In that document 
they pointed out that the average debt load will be $25,000 for 
students by June 1998.  That is up from $13,000 in 1993 when the 
Liberals took office.  This is an appalling and shocking fact and 
shows the real lack of commitment this government has shown to 
young people and students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 more than 7,800 students who received Canada student 
loans declared bankruptcy.  Is this a healthy system?  Does this 
demonstrate to us that students are coping in the institutions? 
The contrary is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another astounding fact is that tuition fees in Canada have 
reached a national average of $3,100 which surpasses the average 
of publicly funded institutions in the United States.  This is 
something Canadians are not aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has the government responded to this crisis?  We have heard 
vague promises of the millennium fund.  There was no consultation 
and this fund will not help students today who are graduating 
into poverty.  What we need are national standards for 
accessibility.  We need a real commitment of leadership from the 
government to help students today with financial assistance and a 
flexible program that will relieve the debt load.  We do not need 
some vague promise about a scholarship fund in the millennium 
which will not help students who are in grave difficulty today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on the government to end the rhetoric and to put into 
action accessibility as a national standard and to show 
leadership by providing the financial commitments to assist 
students today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
accessibility of post-secondary education for young Canadians is 
and always has been a priority of the Government of Canada. 
Recognition of the importance of post-secondary education in 
helping Canadians build their careers is demonstrated by the 
Government of Canada's investment in post-secondary education 
through the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial jurisdiction together with the fact that the federal 
transfers to provinces for post-secondary education through the 
CHST are provided as a block fund means that there is no direct 
connection between the federal transfers and provincially set 
tuitions.  Provincial spending priorities will determine the 
level of funding to post-secondary education and other social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Government of Canada does not directly influence the 
level of tuition fees, it does however play a major role in 
helping students cope with costs and in facilitating access to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 budget the government increased federal support for 
higher education and skills by improving interest relief and tax 
measures.  The period of interest relief was extended from 18 to 
30 months allowing low income borrowers to defer repayment. 
Further the government is working with interested provinces to 
explore the implementation of income related repayment schemes to 
help reduce student indebtedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, there are many proposals and projects on the go 
with the Government of Canada and the provinces and this will 
continue as we help students get an education in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the past few days we have heard a lot of talk in 
the House about passports.  I asked one of the questions last 
week.  I want to outline one case tonight that has happened in 
the last couple of days.  It will let the Canadian public know 
that we have a serious problem in this country with passports, 
how they are inspected and how they are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A gentleman by the name of Alan Winter was convicted in 1987 of 
sexual assault in Abbotsford, British Columbia.  He was declared 
a dangerous sexual offender and was sentenced to 16 years on 10 
counts.  After having served five years he was paroled in 1992. 
We might wonder why he was paroled. It was a condition of his 
parole that he return to his native England and not return to 
Canada until at least the expiration of his sentence in 2003.  He 
was granted a valid British passport and returned to England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has returned to Canada.  A Canada-wide warrant for his 
apprehension was issued yesterday for breaking parole.  John 
Denham, a British member of Parliament, said “I can't believe 
that Mr. Winter was not fit to be released into Canadian society 
but he was fit to be released into my country. How could they 
have not told us?”  Canada did not advise the British people 
that this man was convicted as a dangerous sexual offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear that Mr. Winter used a Canadian passport to get back 
into Canada.  Where is our criminal check and record of parole 
conditions?  This man is back on the streets of Canada, a danger 
to young people.  He is a dangerous sexual offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kinds of checks are we doing at our border with our own 
passports and foreign passports?  I know that the RCMP in 
Vancouver have modern digital hand checks that they can do right 
away.  Do we not have these checks for people?  We check their 
passports, but again in this case something has slipped through 
the cracks.  I hope some serious offence is not happening in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no conditions on these.  It is a joke but a sad joke. 
I implore the government to sit down and look at the whole issue. 
The passport affair in Jordan was unfortunate, but this is an 
even worse situation.  In our own country somebody has been let 
back in either with his British passport or a Canadian passport. 
He is a criminal.  Maybe the police will arrest him.  Perhaps by 
talking about it tonight people will realize who he is and he 
will be arrested and will be off the streets and back in jail 
where he belongs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast for the question.  I will take 
notice of the specific facts of the case he has raised and we 
will see what we can find out.  If he will allow me, I will turn 
to the larger issue that he raised about the passports and the 
attack in Jordan a week ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the passports of the two persons making the attack had 
been reported as being Canadian, our consular officials in Jordan 
were allowed by the Jordanian authorities to see the passports 
and they then concluded they were forgeries.  We have since 
obtained physical possession of the passports and submitted them 
to forensic examination by our own Canadian experts.  This 
scientific examination has confirmed that the passports are 
indeed forgeries and further that they were manufactured from 
materials not available in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the prime minister and foreign minister have stated, we have 
registered our concerns loudly and clearly to the Israeli 
government.  We have recalled our ambassador from Israel, and 
that is the most serious step in international law and diplomacy 
short of breaking off diplomatic relations altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Israeli foreign minister has apologized to us on behalf of 
his government and has undertaken to set up processes, in 
consultation with our government, that will ensure that Canadian 
passports are not again misused in violation of international law 
and Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to repeat what we have already said in the last several 
days.  There has been no prior knowledge of or complicity in this 
whole incident on the part of the Canadian government.  Any 
speculation to the contrary is false, and I know the hon. member 
is not part of this speculation. It is also thoroughly 
irresponsible in so far as it might endanger Canadians travelling 
in the Middle East at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
