	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this past weekend I had the honour of participating 
in the events to mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day.
<P>
	Standing next to some of the Canadians who sacrificed so 
much for our freedom I could not help but feel overwhelmed 
with pride. Because of them and thousands more like them, 
many of whom sacrificed their lives, our country is a living 
example to the world of how diversity, tolerance and generosity 
can build a peaceful, prosperous society. These are the values 
Canadians fought for in two world wars and these are the values 
we continue to uphold.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	The weekend before last I also took part in an event organized 
by Canadians to commemorate a group of people who, while not 
Canadians, nonetheless sacrificed their lives in the hope of 
achieving the values we in Canada hold so dear. I took part in 
ceremonies commemorating the fifth anniversary of the tragic 
events of Tiananmen Square.
<P>
	I was honoured to have been asked to lay flowers at the 
monument at the University of British Columbia  which was 
erected by the Alma Mater Society of UBC, the Chinese Student 
and Scholar Association of UBC, and the Vancouver Society in 
Support of Democratic Movement to commemorate the tragic 
events in Tiananmen. Respect for human rights was one of the 
principal reasons I became active in Canadian politics and it is 
with this philosophy that I am proud to stand as a member of this 
government.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs outlined in a speech last 
week, this government has a very clear framework when it 
comes to the conduct of our bilateral relations with China. This 
framework is based on four pillars: economic partnership; 
sustainable development; peace and security; and human rights 
and the rule of law. We do not sacrifice one at the expense of the 
other. Indeed they are mutually reinforcing. Today I would like 
to focus on the human rights pillar.
<P>
	Respect for human rights is an essential part of Canadian 
foreign policy. Our relationship with China cannot be reduced or 
simplified to trade versus human rights arguments. We believe 
systematic and wide ranging contact will lead to calls within 
Chinese society for greater openness and freedom.
<P>
	Surely there is evidence that increased political flexibility is a 
byproduct of economic liberalization, and governments that 
have opened their markets to international trade are more 
sensitive to the views and reactions of other countries.
<P>
	An inward looking society that depends little on trade and 
international investment is less likely to respond to concerns 
raised by foreigners. Trade reduces isolationism. Trade also 
expands the scope of international law and generates the 
economic growth required to sustain social change and 
development. Economic liberalization also leads to the 
pluralization and the empowering of interest groups in society.
<P>
	Nevertheless it is imperative that we as a government 
continue to raise the matter of human rights with those countries 
we believe to be in violation thereof at every opportunity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5058"> 5058 </A></B>
<P>
	While we respect time honoured traditions and cultures our 
position has always been that the best guarantee for stability and 
prosperity is a government that is responsive to its people.
<P>
	As a matter of policy this government will continue to work 
with other countries to ensure that China respects its obligations 
under the United Nations declaration of human rights. This was 
affirmed in the resolution voted on three weeks ago in my 
party's policy convention.
<P>
	On a bilateral basis we have also expressed our concerns on 
human rights to the Chinese leadership. Indeed, during the visit 
of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua to Canada I personally voiced my 
concern about human rights in China and I raised specific cases 
with the vice premier. This was also done by the Prime Minister 
and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the meetings with Mr. Zou.
<P>
	At the same time we intend to engage in constructive projects 
and dialogues with the Chinese government on this question. It 
is for this reason that our government will be funding joint 
research projects like the one between the University of 
Ottawa's human rights centre and Beijing University.
<P>
	I believe this kind of dialogue and co-operation will help to 
bring about greater understanding and will be of assistance to 
the Chinese government in its efforts to reform its legal and 
judicial structures.
<P>
	CIDA's China program has contributed to China's economic 
reforms and gradual opening mainly by creating links between 
people and institutions, transferring skills, knowledge and 
technology, and exposing thousands of Chinese to Canada, its 
values and government.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Canadians expect their elected representatives to abide by the 
democratic principles on which our society is built. The Liberal 
Party has always taken an innovative and effective approach to 
its dealings with China.
<P>
	It was a Liberal government in 1970 that took the bold and 
imaginative step of recognizing the People's Republic of China. 
I believe this helped to create the conditions for China to embark 
on a process of economic reform and opening to the outside 
world, a development which has had a tremendous positive 
impact on millions of ordinary Chinese citizens.
<P>
	As one who has been actively involved in the democratic 
movement, I want to assure this House and all Canadians 
concerned about human rights that dialogue and engagement 
will best serve Canada's interests and those of the Chinese 
people. This is the policy of this government and I believe it is 
the right one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise this morning and to mark on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois 
the sad anniversary of the massacres in Tiananmen Square. 
Thousands were killed there when  the repressive Chinese 
regime crushed the student democracy movement.
<P>
	In spite of the hopes that had been raised by this vast 
movement, democracy is still no closer to being a reality five 
years later. In Shanghai, the 5th anniversary was marked by the 
arrest of dissident Bao Ge after he had filed papers with the city 
to register a human rights organization.
<P>
	Mr. Bao Ge, who had been under permanent police 
surveillance, was one of the few human rights activists who had 
not been detained or forced to leave the big cities.
<P>
	In Beijing where particularly repressive security measures 
have been put in place, the police, terrified by the idea of public 
demonstrations, ringed the square where the tragedy occurred.
<P>
	Memories of the crushing defeat of the democracy movement 
during the night of June 3 and 4, 1989, are still vivid. According 
to dissidents and foreign observers, thousands were massacred.
<P>
	The first image that automatically springs to mind is that of 
the student facing down the tanks which literally crushed the 
uprising. One would think that here in Canada, the federal 
government would have decided to mark this event by making 
radical changes to its human rights policy, a policy which the 
secretary of state is defending this morning with great 
conviction.
<P>
	Indeed, a great deal of courage and conviction is required to 
defend this government's 180 degree turn. From now on, human 
rights will apparently take a back seat to this government's 
commercial interests.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition stated in a question to the 
Prime Minister: ``Canada is relinquishing its historic 
responsibility, since the Prime Minister knows perfectly well 
that polite comments behind closed doors will have no impact 
on foreign leaders who systematically violate human rights''. 
Would you care to hear the Prime Minister's answer, Mr. 
Speaker? He answered to the effect that China would laugh in his 
face if he adopted a hard-line position.
<P>
	I think we are the ones who are being laughed at now. If we 
want respect, we must have a conscience and that conscience is 
what has earned Canada the worldwide admiration it currently 
enjoys.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	We have heard the ministers of this government take turns 
telling us that human rights are no longer tied to trade and 
market logic.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve stated 
before this this House on March 22 last, and I quote: ``The 
Liberals had promised a more 'we'll go it alone' Canadian 
foreign policy, one more in line with Lester B. Pearson's vision. 
Let the naive think again! The Liberal government is trashing a 
long-standing tradition of defending human rights, reducing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5059"> 5059 </A></B>
<P>
Canada to the  condition of petty trading nation without any 
vision, or heart or soul''.
<P>
	This morning, the secretary of state reaffirmed the very clear 
framework of bilateral relations with China recently described 
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. There is clearly a double 
standard regarding human rights violations, with Canada 
applying a very harsh policy in the case of poor countries-let us 
just think of Haiti-but a lenient one, one of turning a blind eye, 
as far as rich countries are concerned.
<P>
	I listened carefully as the secretary of state praised the four 
pillars on which the government has decided to base the conduct 
of its relations with China.
<P>
	Allow me to reply to some of his remarks. The secretary of 
state said, and I quote: ``We believe systematic and 
wide-ranging contact will lead to calls within Chinese society 
for greater openness and freedom''.
<P>
	The problem is not so much prompting Chinese society to call 
for more freedom as having the courage to pressure the Chinese 
government to stop repressive action against all those who do 
call for this freedom.
<P>
	The secretary of state also indicated, and I quote: ``-during 
the visit of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua to Canada, I personally 
voiced concern about human rights in China and I raised specific 
cases with the Vice Premier''.
<P>
	We believe that the Chinese are expecting much more from 
Canada than a mere expression of concern. Why not have voiced 
outrage? Why not have voiced it publicly? Why not have 
condemned the ongoing repression? God forbid that the 
government jeopardize its relations with China and prejudice 
any contract by daring to be insistent in any way!
<P>
	The secretary of state told us about no specific multilateral 
action that the government intends to take to make up for its lack 
of leadership in bilateral relations. I challenge the secretary of 
state when he tells us that the Liberal Party has always taken an 
innovative and effective approach in its dealings with China. 
The Liberal Party is certainly not innovating today; if anything, 
it is going backwards.
<P>
	I will remind him that an extremely significant step was taken 
at the Francophone Summit in Dakar in 1989, when Canada led 
the 42-country Francophonie in adopting a resolution making 
protection of human rights a ``fundamental objective'' of the 
international community.
<P>
	It also mentioned that not only Canada but also the other 
leading nations had to take account of the behaviour of the 
receiving countries-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I hope that the hon. 
member will excuse me, but it is a principle of equality and 
parity. You do not have more time than the minister.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the hon. member to 
continue for a few minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps I should make the point again. 
There is an understanding that if a minister goes, for example, 
15 minutes, the spokespeople for the two other parties can go as 
long as he or she does, but not longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today 
to stand in front of the House and honour the brave men and 
women who sacrificed their lives in Tiananmen Square five 
years ago.
<P>
	Like the minister, I often think about the huge square standing 
in front of the forbidden city, with its overpowering picture of 
Chairman Mao overlooking what has happened through history 
in that square.
<P>
	It was mentioned by one of my colleagues that looking back in 
history we can often learn some things. Certainly one of the 
things that might take us back to the thirties was listening to the 
commentary regarding the rise of the Nazis and what happened 
in Germany. It only emphasizes the difficult decision we have to 
make today, whether we isolate or do we get involved.
<P>
	All of us look forward to the day when China joins other 
countries that respect freedom and democracy for its people, 
respect and accept the human rights standards that exist for all 
countries of the world. In the interests of security in Asia it is 
vital that we work with these people and that we work from 
within as the minister has suggested.
<P>
	We too would agree that the interests of China's people will 
best be served in the long run by our participation in China. The 
only real choice the people of China have for more humanitarian 
and democratic treatment is for us to help them become less 
economically dependent on the Government of China and with a 
vision of what is really happening in the world outside.
<P>
	I cannot help but think of the first time I visited China 15 
years ago. It is unbelievable the changes that have occurred 
within that country in a relatively short time. It stands as some 
proof of exactly what happens when the western society gets 
involved. China has made changes and the people have achieved 
more freedom. It is not perfect but at least they do have a better 
quality of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5060"> 5060 </A></B>
<P>
	While we would like to have a perfect world, that just is not 
possible. All we can hope is that we can have influence and that 
over time things will change. This is our opportunity to play a 
leadership role based on our early recognition of China and our 
continued dealings with China over the years.
<P>
	We must become more aggressive in our approach to China 
and be certain that we take every diplomatic opportunity open to 
us to press for more human rights. We look forward to the day we 
can stand in the House and truly congratulate the Chinese people 
on having achieved true and complete democracy.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is introduced to correct an

Nations issues medals to Canadians who serve on peacekeeping 
activities. At some time after the issue of  that United Nations 
medal, the Governor General declares that medal to be a 
Canadian medal. Many of our peacekeepers feel that this is not 
truly a Canadian recognition and therefore there is a desire 
among them to be recognized by the issue of a Canadian medal.
<P>
	Also included in this bill is the clasp which would provide 
visual recognition of the great honour that was bestowed on 
Canada by our peacekeepers when they won the Nobel peace 
award on September 30, 1988. This bill would provide a clasp on 
the medal which would show those people who had earned that 
award.

peacekeeping and it is fit and proper that we provide pure

<BLOCKQUOTE>That, commencing on June 10 and concluding on June 23, 1994, on

provided that proceedings pursuant to Standing Order 38 shall, when 
applicable, be taken up between 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in proposing this motion I would first 
like to thank the House for its generally co-operative approach 
to the legislation that has been put before it.
<P>
	I must say I have been assisted greatly in my work by the 
Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs, the hon. member 
for Beauséjour, and my parliamentary secretary, the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands. I should also like to thank 
the chief government whip, the hon. member for Saint-Léonard, 
and the deputy whip, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, for their similar efforts.
<P>
	I have other thanks to offer. I want to say I would be quite 
remiss if I were to fail to indicate as well the important roles 
played by the House leaders of the opposition parties. I refer to 
the hon. member for Roberval and the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. They have both demonstrated the 
important parliamentary skill of combining tough and vigorous 
partisan-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5061"> 5061 </A></B>
<P>
ship with a civil and courteous approach as well as an 
understanding of the public's expectation that the House carry 
out its business in a reasonable fashion.
<P>
	Although we have had a number of significant philosophical 
and policy differences, we have been able, most of the time, to 
overcome these differences in order to work together to organize 
the business of the House in a more orderly manner than I have 
seen in much of my own career in Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	I say this not to seek praise for myself as the leader of the 
government in the House, but to demonstrate that at least part of 
the message of the election of last October 25 has been heard and 
understood here in this House. Canadians, regardless of their 
political inclinations, want Parliament to function in a more 
civil and open manner and, at the same time, to be a place of 
vigorous debate and exchange of ideas.
<P>
	It was with this in mind that the government has sought to 
restore the importance of this House of Commons as the central 
institution of Canadian government through its program of 
reform of the rules of the House. These were implemented with 
all party co-operation right after the throne speech debate 
earlier this year.
<P>
	One objective of this was to give the House of Commons and 
its members a greater role in the initial stages of policy 
development.
<P>
	For this reason major studies by committees of our foreign 
policy, our defence policy, our social policy and the goods and 
services tax are presently under way. In addition, the House has 
had a number of general debates, on the initiative of the 
government, using time set aside for government business, in 
order to give the government a sense of where members of 
Parliament stand on such matters as peacekeeping, cruise 
weapons testing and on agriculture before the cabinet makes 
decisions in these matters.
<P>
	The results of many of these initiatives will be seen only some 
months later on. In many cases they will result in legislation and 
some of the resulting reports no doubt will be quite contentious.
<P>
	The government has been criticized in some quarters for 
embarking on some of these studies, but they involve consulting 
the Canadian people on matters crucial to them before 
introducing legislation. I hope some of those who have voiced 
these criticisms will not succumb later on to what we would 
argue to be contradictory claims, when we bring forward the 
resulting legislation, by attacking us then for moving too 
quickly.
<P>
	Even though this government is a new government I submit it 
has brought forward a considerable legislative program; some 
38 bills to date with another half dozen to be introduced before 
we adjourn for the summer. We have already passed half of these 
measures. These include such matters as the federal-provincial 
fiscal arrangements bill, the budget implementation bill, a 
number of tax measures coming from the recent budget and from 
previous budgets and a wide range of other  matters from 
fisheries to railway safety to government re-organization.
<P>
	I want to thank the House and, I repeat, I want to thank my 
fellow House leaders for the great co-operation shown in this 
regard.
<P>
	We face the crunch now, the run up to the long summer 
adjournment. Bills that were referred to committees earlier in 
the spring are beginning to pour back into the House and we 
must deal with most of them before starting the long summer 
break.
<P>
	These bills include Bill C-28 regarding financial assistance to 
students, Bill C-30 regarding fisheries workers, and Bill C-12 
revising and updating the Canada Business Corporations Act.
<P>
	We must also conclude debate on the two bills pertaining to 
tobacco, C-11 and C-32. Bill C-32 is particularly important 
because it authorizes the making of rebates of tobacco excise 
tax, rebates that have been long awaited by small businesses 
across this country.
<P>
	We also need to finish Bill C-22 regarding Pearson airport, 
Bill C-16 regarding the Sahtu Dene land claim, Bill C-25 
concerning petroleum resources, the two environment bills 
C-23 and C-24, and Bill C-18, legislation which will enable us 
to update the process of revising electoral boundaries. There is 
also Bill C-35, the legislation to permit the reorganization of the 
new Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We also have to deal with Bill C-33, the Yukon land claims 
legislation and Bill C-34 regarding native self-government in 
Yukon. I want to mention that I have been receiving many 
representations from not only native groups but from the 
premier of the Yukon saying that these bills represent a 
consensus in the Yukon territory after some 21 years of effort. 
They urge, therefore, that we consider and adopt these bills as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there are a number of other what you might call 
smaller items for which we will also seek passage.
<P>
	In addition, before the House adjourns the government wants 
to have second reading of Bill C-37, the young offenders 
legislation. We also want to move into committee Bill C-38 
respecting marine transportation security and the lobbyists 
legislation which will be introduced next week.
<P>
	This is an extensive list. Of course our precise scheduling is 
dependent upon the timeliness with which our committees 
complete their work on the legislation before them. I think 
however that the proposal before us for additional hours will 
permit the House to complete all of this business. After all, three 
and one-half hours each day, Monday through Thursday over 
two weeks seems to me to be a comparatively easy means to add 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5062"> 5062 </A></B>
<P>
what is the equivalent of an additional week of time for 
government business.
<P>
	To conclude I again want to thank my colleagues, the 
Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs, my parliamentary 
secretary, the member for Kingston and the Islands, the chief 
government whip, the member for Saint Léonard, and the deputy 
whip, the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and at the 
same time the opposition House leaders and their whips for their 
co-operative efforts. These have enabled this House to proceed 
in a manner reflecting the desire of the Canadian public for a 
more open and active House, one with a co-operative 
atmosphere, but which at the same time is a place, as I have said, 
for vigorous debate and exchange of ideas.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a continued good atmosphere 
here in the House that will enable this House to complete its 
agenda. Therefore I ask for the support of members for this 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
what the hon. Leader of the Government in the House said 
earlier about the opposition leaders and especially about the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, I should return the 
compliment. I also want to underline the leadership the hon. 
Government House Leader has exercised-in co-operation with 
the opposition-and his always pleasant dealings with us 
regarding the agenda of the House. It is easy to understand, 
when we look at the actions of the Government House Leader, 
why he has survived a 32-year career in politics.
<P>
	Now that the compliment has been returned, allow me to have 
a slightly different vision from that of the hon. Leader of the 
Government, especially with respect to the business of the 
House.
<P>
	We in the Official Opposition were elected on October 25. 
After the election writs were returned in the following days, we 
asked that Parliament be summoned immediately because we 
saw our friends waving the red book and demanding action.
<P>
	As early as mid-November, we were ready to meet here to 
consider government policies, initiatives and bills, and to 
implement the program they were elected on.
<P>
	Despite repeated requests, we had to wait until January 17 to 
meet. Of course, we worked in our ridings, met with our 
constituents and prepared our arguments, but we could not deal 
with any legislation because the government had decided not to 
convene the House.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I must say that, when the House first met, it looked like a 
larger, more visible Spicer Commission. It introduced motions 
on various issues which we debated, but where was the 
legislative agenda? Where was the beef then and where is it 
now?
<P>
	We then had bills without deep significance which generated 
little debate because many or all members could easily agree to 
them. We are now coming to the end of the session and they table 
a motion to extend  sitting hours. It is standard parliamentary 
procedure. It gives the public, the voters, the people of this 
country and of both countries, the impression that there is much 
to be done in the home stretch in this country.
<P>
	If the parliamentary agenda had been planned differently, if 
we had started sitting last November, we would not have to 
extend sitting hours during the last two weeks, so that members 
will have to work for 12 hours in the House and the committees, 
respond to their constituents' requests and lead rather hectic 
lives here.
<P>
	However, we will do it. The Official Opposition does not at all 
intend to oppose the motion tabled by the Leader of the 
Government in the House, but it must be recognized that the 
planning of our agenda could have been done in such a way that 
this motion would have been unnecessary, especially since the 
government is announcing, somewhat hastily and at the very end 
of the session, bills which have not yet been tabled.
<P>
	The Government House Leader referred to the Young 
Offenders Act, an omnibus bill which should be tabled shortly. 
He also announced legislation on lobbyists, as well as a bill on 
sentencing. Moreover, the government may want a second 
reading vote on these bills, some of which are not even on the 
agenda yet. As you know, it is not always a good thing to take on 
too much, because you sometimes end up not being able to do 
everything.
<P>
	We must dispel the impression that we have to hurry because 
we have not done anything so far. The opposition is at the mercy 
of the government's agenda. Every day, we have worked with 
what the government put before us.
<P>
	The government, through its House leader, referred earlier to 
Bill C-18, which we will look at for the last time this afternoon. 
This legislation on electoral boundaries readjustment and its 
impact is another example of bad planning. Indeed, Bill C-18 
was tabled a bit late, with the result that, in some cases, 
provincial electoral boundaries commissions had to redo some 
of their work, while others had to start from scratch. This is an 
example of the mess we are in.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, what really surprised me, in a pleasant way, was 
to hear the Government House Leader say that he wanted us to 
have full dress debates, and that this House was the place to have 
such discussions. I am pleased to hear this from a person who 
has so much authority, because I was somewhat perplexed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5063"> 5063 </A></B>
<P>
yesterday when I read and heard that the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is the Deputy Government 
Whip under the Government House Leader, was encouraging 
people to sign petitions to keep us from debating the real issues 
for the two countries which are to be found in Canada.
<P>
	I am therefore reassured and pleased to hear the hon. member 
for Windsor West and Government House Leader say that he has 
absolutely no intention of setting aside major issues so as to 
avoid a debate on them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition will do its job to the very 
end, and will work the extra hours required to fulfill the mandate 
given to us by our constituents, in spite of the disruptions to our 
daily schedule.
<P>
	Consequently, if there is a vote, we will support the motion 
tabled by the Government House Leader.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion before us today. I thank the 
hon. government House leader for his kind words and the hon. 
member for Bellechasse for his complimentary words regarding 
the co-operation House leaders have achieved during the first 
few months of the 35th Parliament. I also express words of 
appreciation for the co-operation and goodwill expressed 
among us.
<P>
	However I too have some concerns. I rise to speak to the 
request of the government for an extension of the sitting hours of 
the House. My party, the Reform Party, has endeavoured to 
bring a different approach to the opposition benches of the 
House. The hon. government House leader alluded to it. We did 
not come to Ottawa to oppose de facto all government policies 
and motions. Instead it is the goal of my party to offer 
constructive criticism and even support government bills and 
motions we deem to be in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	On that basis then we will not oppose the motion to extend the 
hours. Our hope is that these extended hours will be used 
profitably for the good of Canadians. I trust this hope is based on 
reality and not idealism on our part.
<P>
	However the government's request to extend the hours of 
sitting of the House brings some questions to my mind. I cannot 
help but wonder-and I am sure many Canadians have the same 
questions as I have-why the government feels it needs to 
extend the hours. There is really only one reason it is necessary 
for the government to lengthen the time we spend in the House. 
The reason is that the Liberals have let down Canadians by 
wasting our time with relatively unimportant housekeeping bills 
for most of the time we have spent in the House thus far.
<P>
	Allow me to outline the reasons for my thinking, Mr. Speaker. 
Since the election last October that elected the Liberal 
government, 225 days have passed and 82 days have passed 
since the date of the election and the initial convening of the 
House. Since then the House has also been sitting for a total of 
82 days. During those 82 days we have been presented with 38 
bills, with notice having been provided for 11 more.
<P>
	Let us review the performance of the Liberal government for 
those 82 sitting days. Unlike other parties, the Reform Party is 
not adverse to giving credit to the government when credit is 
due. The government  deserves some credit for a few changes it 
has made so far. Despite some disagreements on the various 
details of its legislation, the Reform Party is willing to 
commend the government for some changes proposed to the 
young offenders and student loans acts; for empowering the 
committee to make changes to the standing orders; for 
reviewing policies surrounding social programs, foreign, 
defence and peacekeeping policies; and for allowing special 
debates on topics such as agriculture and the situation in Bosnia.
<P>
	Despite our role in opposition to oppose, the Reform Party is 
willing to acknowledge that the government is following 
through on some of its campaign promises, such as the 
cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter deal and the Pearson 
International Airport privatization deal.
<P>
	If nothing else, we congratulate the government for sticking 
to its word in these areas. The Liberal government appears to 
have followed through on its promise to reduce the size of 
budgets of the offices of the Prime Minister and cabinet. Its 
promise to create a youth job initiative, even though we fear it 
will be ineffective in light of the jobs it creates at considerable 
cost to taxpayers, was at least an attempt to keep a promise.
<P>
	However I must admit that my praise is rather faint. We are 
disturbed at the amount of time being taken by the government 
to put its plan in place. How much time does the government 
need to study and consider important Canadian issues? When 
will the government admit that the time for talk is over and that 
the time for action has come?
<P>
	Two troubling statistics have come out of my examination of 
the bills introduced by the government. The first is that of the 14 
bills left on the Order Paper at the end of the last session under 
the previous Conservative administration, eight have been 
recycled or reused with minimal changes. The Liberals said that 
they were going to be different. Instead they have shown they 
are an old line party from the same old system of politics of 
which Canadians have grown tired. In fact it is impossible to see 
how the government is different from the previous Conservative 
administration subscribing to Marshall McLuhan's idea that 
politics is a means by which to offer yesterday's answers to 
today's problems.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The second troubling statistic is that of the 38 bills introduced 
thus far, at least 13 have been of a housekeeping nature. We seek 
not to question the fact that many of these housekeeping details 
needed to be taken care of. Rather we seek to question why the 
government has tied up the business of the House with details of 
lesser importance than the truly great issues facing the majority 
of Canada. The issues I speak of are the promised Liberal 
programs dealing with jobs and job creation; the deficit and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5064"> 5064 </A></B>
<P>
debt crisis; with justice system overhaul; and with reform of the 
pension plans for MPs.
<P>
	The Liberals seem to be inclined simply to put on the guise of 
action. As I have mentioned 38 bills have been introduced of 
which 16 have been passed, 3 have gone to the other place, one 
has been returned to the House by the other place, and that was a 
real government fiasco, 12 are at committee and 5 are at second 
reading.
<P>
	To an outside observer this gives the appearance of action. It 
is like the Liberals have just inherited the family farm but do not 
want the neighbours to find out that they do not know what to do 
with it. Instead of putting in a crop they are driving around in 
their tractors, spinning its wheels, or they are rearranging the 
equipment in the shed.
<P>
	The Liberals cannot claim lack of experience. In the campaign 
they offered a list of star candidates and they even have several 
old hands from the Trudeau era. Perhaps this lack of ability to 
introduce substantial legislation is a result of the Liberal 
government not really wanting to make any changes at all, 
preferring rather to revere the memory of previously inept 
Liberal administrations.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I remind members on 
the government side that nobody heckled the government House 
leader when he was giving his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, Liberal Party members cannot 
blame the neighbours for their lack of advice or input. We know 
it is just a matter of time before the government comes to realize 
it needs help in getting its farm up and running. They only need 
to ask. As the farmer across the road, the Reform Party is willing 
to help provide the direction required.
<P>
	Of the 38 bills brought before Parliament only 16 have been 
passed. Of the 16 bills that have been passed into law the Reform 
Party has supported 10 of them. Let it not be said that the Reform 
Party seeks to obstruct the legislative process of the 
Government of Canada. Rather the Reform Party has sought to 
be and has become a constructive force and good neighbour in 
the House of Commons. It is unfortunate, however, that we have 
not been given the opportunity to deal with very much truly 
substantive legislation.
<P>
	The result of the election that brought all of us to Ottawa was 
an obvious expression of the desire of the Canadian people for 
change in government. Canadians elected over 200 of the 
current members of Parliament to the House for the first time. 
The Liberal government could have taken this past election as an 
opportunity to make the changes it promised in its so-called red 
ink book.
<P>
	While the Reform Party does not support the majority of the 
policies put forth by the red book, we recognize the democratic 
voice of Canadians in providing the Liberals with the mandate to 
make those changes. Instead of representing the change 
Canadians expected, the government has chosen to waste its 
time on these housekeeping matters and put off the real 
decisions  seemingly to an indefinite time, preferring to remind 
us how to do politics in a tired old way. The government has let 
down all Canadians. It has given Canadians exactly what they 
voted against: the status quo.
<P>
	The Liberal Party campaigned on a platform of job creation 
and economic stimulus. Unfortunately campaign is the only 
thing it did with most of its promises. The Liberals have shown 
themselves to be politicians of the old order. The Liberals are 
politicians who, like their predecessors, promised change and 
delivered nothing.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not object to sitting late and working 
for Canadians. The Reform Party has been co-operative in 
supporting 10 out of 16 bills passed in this session. It must 
therefore be the fault of the Liberals that virtually nothing 
substantive has been put forward by the government. With this 
in mind we cannot help but wonder what justifies the rush when 
no hurry has been exhibited by the government to implement its 
program thus far.
<P>
	I am the member for the riding of Kindersley-Lloydminister 
in Saskatchewan. A large part of my riding was devastated by 
the great depression of the 1930s. The people survived by 
sticking together in a spirit of teamwork and mutual support. It 
is with that spirit I offer advice to our Liberal friends on the 
other side of the House. Perhaps the Liberals can take a few 
ideas from the common sense suggestions of the Reform Party. 
Hopefully Liberal egos will not get in the way of common sense.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	First and foremost the Reform Party feels the need to remind 
the Liberals of the massive debt crisis facing the country and 
specifically future generations of taxpayers. The Liberals may 
not care about future generations but the Reform Party does.
<P>
	The young people of Canada are being cheated by the 
government. Deficit spending is a discriminatory tax on youth. 
The unrestrained deficit spending of the last two decades has 
placed a heavy burden on Canadian youth. It is they who will be 
taxed throughout their lives to make interest payments on the 
national debt which is now over half a trillion dollars. Growing 
at over 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5065"> 5065 </A></B>
<P>
$1,500 per second, the national debt amounts to over $18,000 
per capita. Debt and taxation levels in the country have gone up 
so fast that the government is soon likely to price Canada right 
out of the world market. This cannot continue.
<P>
	Where are the bills to reduce federal spending in every 
department from every minister? Why is there not balanced 
budget legislation instead of a budget that increases total 
government spending by $3.3 billion?
<P>
	The debt is the most critical problem facing Canadians and 
their social programs today. The irony is that we can afford our 
social programs. It is the debt we have accumulated that we 
cannot afford.
<P>
	According to the public accounts for the year ending March 
31, 1993, the interest on the national debt amounted to some 
$38.793 billion. In fact government accounts show an operating 
surplus but for the interest payments being made on the long 
term debt of the country.
<P>
	In the absence of debt and the resulting interest payments, we 
would have a program of expenditure surplus and tax levels 
could in fact be reduced without any threat to social programs. 
The government does not seem to care. Last night it refused even 
the most moderate reductions to the estimates. The Liberal 
government, along with the Bloc and the NDP, voted against 
reducing the estimates by only $20,000. What an awful sign that 
sends from Ottawa.
<P>
	The government has forecast a deficit in this fiscal year of 
approximately $40 billion, making no effort to curb the 
spiralling deterioration of the fiscal situation in Canada. This is 
why last week Moody's, the investment rating company, 
downgraded the rating on foreign denominated Canadian bonds. 
This is also why Reformers feel that the debt and the deficit are 
the most important issues facing Canadians today and why we 
would not hesitate, as the Liberals have obviously hesitated, to 
deal quickly and with conviction regarding the financial 
problems facing Canada today.
<P>
	Reformers do not wish financial slavery on their own children 
or on the future generations of Canadians. Why are there not 
bills before the House that would restore investor confidence, 
small business optimism and taxpayer hope for tax relief?
<P>
	Why did the government scratch out the following words from 
the Reform Party's motion on national unity? I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-remain federally united as one people, committed to strengthening our 
economy, balancing the budgets of our governments, sustaining our social 
services, conserving our environment, preserving our cultural heritage and 
diversity, protecting our lives and property, further democratizing our 
institutions and decision making processes, affirming the equality and 
uniqueness of all our citizens and provinces, and building peaceful and 
productive relations with other peoples of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another area of concern to Canadians and to the Reform Party 
is the extravagance of pensions for members of Parliament. 
High on the list of suggestions I would offer to our Liberal 
counterparts is the reform of MPs' pensions. As the member for 
Calgary Centre mentioned the other day, the pension package 
for politicians has created a two-tier pension system  
completely out of line with the private sector. This system must 
be reformed and brought into line with the pension programs in 
the private sector.
<P>
	The government is talking about making changes. It is waiting 
for studies when no studies are needed and has made no 
substantive proposals. Could it be that the Liberals are trying to 
protect the wealth of their pensions for themselves? After all, 
will they need them when a disillusioned public turfs them out 
of office after the next election? I doubt they are needy; maybe 
they are greedy.
<P>
	Canadians are frustrated by the fact that there are more 
barriers to trade and commerce in an east-west direction in the 
country than there are in a north-south direction. For many 
businesses it is easier to carry on business with companies and 
customers in the United States than it is to carry on business 
with other provinces in Canada. These barriers to the free 
exchange of goods and services within Canada work against 
economic growth and development of business relations in our 
country.
<P>
	The government promised to work quickly to eliminate 
interprovincial trade barriers by a date this month. However 
these barriers to trade within our country still stand and it 
appears no progress is being made in this area. How long will the 
government wait to put business in any and all provinces and 
regions on an equal footing?
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Let us talk briefly about justice. A few weeks ago Barb 
Danelesko, an Edmonton housewife, was murdered in her own 
home by intruders who turned out to be young offenders. Her 
death has brought to the national stage the fact that the Liberals 
have been slow to act on this issue.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the justice system should 
place the punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding 
citizens and their property ahead of other objectives. This 
principle should apply to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The current treatment of young offenders still derives from an 
outdated 19th century idea that youth are morally incapable of 
criminal wrongdoing. The policy consequences of this idea deny 
justice to young offenders, to the victims of their offences and to 
citizenry at large. Reform MPs have illustrated this point with 
case after case of documented youth offences, but they have not 
moved the Minister of Justice and his government to introduce 
responsible legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5066"> 5066 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Justice did introduce some changes 
to the Young Offenders Act. Unfortunately these amendments 
do not go nearly far enough to provide for the protection of 
society. Most noticeably, it failed to lower the age at which 
youth will be held responsible for their actions. It is unfortunate 
that the House will spend many hours debating inferior 
legislation like Bill C-37.
<P>
	Another issue that concerns Canadians is the fact that the 
traditional representatives they elect to Parliament seem to have 
become spokespersons of the government to them rather than 
ambassadors of their electors to the government in Ottawa. It is 
time that all members of Parliament began to truly represent 
their constituents.
<P>
	Reformers want to make it possible for members of 
Parliament to represent the wishes of their constituents. We 
believe that the failure of a government measure in the House of 
Commons should not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government. Defeat of a government motion should be followed 
by a formal motion of non-confidence, the passage of which 
would require either the resignation of the government or the 
dissolution of the House for a general election.
<P>
	This practice has been successfully followed in the United 
Kingdom for over two decades and it could be introduced here. 
No constitutional or legal change is required, just a declaration 
on the part of the Prime Minister. He has failed to make this 
declaration.
<P>
	This bold act would break open what scholars have called the 
iron cage of party discipline. Members of Parliament could 
begin to vote for what their constituents really want instead of 
what a small cadre of cabinet ministers wants. This would open 
up the institution of Parliament and revitalize respect for 
politicians who would have the opportunity to truly serve the 
people who elected them.
<P>
	The only substantial parliamentary reform has been to change 
the standing orders, allowing committee and report stage of bills 
prior to second reading. However, absolutely no bills have 
followed or gone this route to date. Why would the government 
make these changes and then not follow through on using the 
new procedures? I would like to suggest that this is perhaps a 
sign of a deeper problem within the Liberal Party. I trust the 
Liberals will have more use for changes they make in the future.
<P>
	Therefore, not only does the Reform Party question the 
government on what it has been trying to pass off as important 
business during the last session of Parliament, but we have 
concrete ideas and proposals that we believe would be in the best 
interests of Canadians. If the government wants to admit that it 
does not know what to do by dredging up old Tory legislation, 
the Reform Party will be glad to help point the way.
<P>
	Let us not waste our time on cursory housekeeping matters but 
get on with the truly important matters that need to be urgently 
dealt with. The deficit, justice issues, MPs' pensions and 
representational matters are issues  that affect Canadians to a far 
greater degree than migratory birds or the National Library.
<P>
	Right now I feel like the woman from the now famous 
``where's the beef'' commercials. I believe the hon. member for 
Bellechasse mentioned a similar concern. This government's 
approach to reform is to talk about it, study it, promise it and 
quibble over it but when we come to sink our teeth into it, we 
find there is nothing there. We have missed the point.
<P>
	It is with reluctance that I support this motion. I support it 
because Canadians need reforms legislated soon. I do it 
reluctantly because the government has proposed so little 
substantive legislation to this point.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote Allan Fotheringham's 
column in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> dated June 5, 1994. In it he addresses 
the Prime Minister with these words: ``Start fulfilling your 
mandate. You're the Prime Minister. Act it''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTSUSPENSIONACT,1994">ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT 
SUSPENSION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 3 consideration of the motion 
in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-18, 
an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a good thing I have a glass of water. I am quite busy 
this morning.
<P>
	Today I have an opportunity again to rise and speak about the 
changes the other place is proposing to Bill C-18. I am glad we 
have a chance to revisit this issue.
<P>
	Bill C-18 as it was originally envisaged by the government 
was a very serious breach of the fundamental principle of 
democracy, namely preventing the intervention of political 
parties in the design, conduct and outcome of elections in 
Canada.
<P>
	The electoral process in Canada is probably the most fair, 
unbiased and most professional in the world. Our electoral 
process is not perfect and I hope we will have the opportunity to 
discuss some improvements at a later date.
<P>
	The original intent of Bill C-18 not only threatened the 
non-partisan aspect of our democratic process but it jeopardized 
the reputation that Canada enjoys internationally as a country 
that could be counted on to set high standards of impartiality 
with regard to the electoral process.
<P>
	Witness that Canada is very often called upon to supervise or 
observe elections around the world. The Ukrainian and South 
African elections are two recent examples of this. I cannot 
emphasize enough the damage that would be done to Canada's 
international reputation if Bill C-18 were to have passed in its 
original form.
<P>
	It should be obvious that Reformers were correct in their 
analysis of the bill. The government should have accepted our 
amendments.
<P>
	The reasons this bill had to be amended are many but the 
concept of preserving a Canadian sense of fair play was 
certainly the most important. It is of paramount importance that 
all aspects of the electoral system be conducted at arm's length 
from the government and all political parties. This will ensure 
the fair play ideal that Canadians hold.
<P>
	It is somewhat ironic that the body that is moving to protect 
democratic principles in Canada is the Senate. The formation of 
the upper House is about as undemocratic as one can imagine. 
The principle of appointing legislators in the British 
parliamentary system is not only undemocratic but it is outdated 
and not in  keeping with the tide of democratization washing 
over much of our globe.
<P>
	The old vice of the monarch choosing half the Parliament has 
now evolved to the point at which the Prime Minister 
recommends senatorial candidates to the Governor General. 
This is unacceptable to most Canadians. This makes senators 
nothing more than political hacks who have no legitimacy in the 
eyes of the nation.
<P>
	Senators have become the focal point of Canadians' desire to 
democratize their country. Senators are the tip of the patronage 
iceberg and many Canadians, including loyal Canadians on this 
side of the House, want to remove this liability to democracy.
<P>
	Many may ask, if the Senate is an undemocratic chamber why 
did it act to protect Canadian democracy? It almost sounds like 
an oxymoron, just like Progressive Conservative, or fiscally 
responsible Liberal.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Was this action of the Tory senators an indication that they are 
more democratic than their Liberal counterparts? Not at all. It is 
clear this was an attempt by the Conservatives to do the right 
thing for once and stick up for Canadians since they blew the 
opportunity to do that while they were in power for nine years.
<P>
	The elected part of this party is now gone. In desperation the 
patronage recipients of a discredited Tory party are trying to 
restore credibility to their very discredited party. All I can say to 
them is good luck but do not hold your breath.
<P>
	The issues of Senate reform, democratic principles and 
redistribution are inextricably linked. There is much concern 
from Reformers and in the country in general that we must 
reform the two component parts of our bicameral Parliament to 
balance adequate regional representation with the democratic 
principle of one person, one vote. It is impossible to accomplish 
this balance without including Senate reform.
<P>
	With the current undemocratic Senate there is only one truly 
democratic chamber in Parliament, the House of Commons. 
This Liberal government and all previous governments strive to 
balance equality of individual Canadians with regional 
representation within this House. As time goes on, this issue is 
getting under the skin of more and more Canadians in all parts of 
the country.
<P>
	As a result of the constitutional floors accorded some 
provinces with regard to the electoral district allocation, true 
equality of Canadians is already precluded. Many of the reasons 
for these floors can be traced to the sad reality of an unelected 
Senate.

<P>
	There is a constitutional law that no province can have fewer 
elected members in the lower House than unelected members of 
the upper House. For instance, Saskatchewan is guaranteed six 
seats. Nova Scotia is guaranteed 10 seats and Prince Edward 
Island, 4 seats.
<P>
	There is also an accepted convention that the redistribution 
process will not result in any province having fewer seats than it 
had in 1976. This results in Manitoba and Saskatchewan being 
guaranteed 14 seats each. Newfoundland is guaranteed seven 
and Prince Edward Island, four.
<P>
	These limits make it almost impossible to cap or reduce the 
number of seats in the House in an equitable way over the long 
term. Nobody seems to mind the fact that most provinces have 
more MPs than senators. Perhaps this is because the MPs have 
legitimacy and senators do not because they are not elected.
<P>
	The question then becomes: How do we give senators 
legitimacy, provide for a regional balance among the provinces 
and protect the principle of one person, one vote? The answer is 
a triple-E Senate, a Senate that is elected, has an equal number 
of members from each province and is effective in protecting 
regional interests. It is a Senate that has an equal number of 
members from each province to provide regional balance, 
elected by the people to give them legitimacy, and therefore 
effective in safeguarding provincial and regional interests. This 
leaves the House of Commons free to be the guardian of the rep 
by pop, one person, one vote system.
<P>
	A triple-E Senate would also provide an opportunity for 
internal regional balance within large provinces. For example, 
in Ontario the population of the golden triangle region can be 
represented equally with the north. In provinces like 
Saskatchewan the urban and rural areas can achieve more 
equitable representation. A triple-E Senate could be a real 
problem solver for many issues that alienate Canadians in many 
parts of the country.
<P>
	I believe very strongly that the problems arising with the 
redistribution process are a direct result of the refusal on the part 
of traditional parties to reform the Senate. The fact that an 
unelected Senate ensures the requirement for constitutional 
floors on the numbers of seats guarantees that some Canadians 
will be better represented than others in the House.
<P>
	It follows that electing senators and an equal number from 
each province will allow more equitable distribution of seats in 
the House of Commons based on the principle of one person, one 
vote. It would allow the redistribution process to more 
accurately reflect the population distribution of the country.
<P>
	One of the consequences of an ineffective Senate is the power 
vacuum created in balancing regional interests. This is 
supposedly the mandate of the upper chamber. However, first 
ministers conferences have grown in importance and power as a 
result of this vacuum. The increased frequency and authority 
given to such meetings have put far too much power in the hands 
of two smaller  groups of individuals to be called democratic and 
responsible.
<P>
	Canadians are weary of hearing that 11 men and women 
behind closed doors have come up with another proposal. 
Perfect examples of this are the public's reaction to the Meech 
Lake and Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	It is also worth mentioning that the House has given the 
procedure and House affairs committee the mandate to 
investigate the possibility of capping or reducing the number of 
seats in this House. Some very simple mathematical 
calculations make it obvious that guaranteeing certain provinces 
a minimum number of seats regardless of population will make 
it all but impossible to properly carry out the mandate over the 
long haul, unless we are willing to live with an even larger 
discrepancy in the number of people represented by MPs from 
different provinces, a difference that is already more than a 
factor of five.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, the riding of Cardigan, Prince Edward Island 
has a population of 29,150 while the riding of Brampton, 
Ontario has a population of 162,610, more than five times as 
many. That means a Canadian living in Cardigan has five times 
as much say as a Canadian living in Brampton. A triple-E Senate 
would then allow for a reduction or capping of the number of 
MPs without lessening the representation for sparsely populated 
areas of the country.
<P>
	Canadians are outraged that the government continues to 
support an outdated 19th century appointed Senate. We are 
currently studying ways to move this House into the 21st 
century by investigating the matter of electronic voting and by 
allowing laptop computers into the House. Why then does the 
government refuse to update the 19th century upper chamber, 
which is a far more serious matter?
<P>
	There are currently two vacancies to be filled in the other 
place, one for Manitoba and one for Quebec. Both of these 
provinces will be having provincial elections in the near future. 
Why will the Prime Minister not encourage the people of 
Manitoba and the people of Quebec to choose their own senators 
at the same time as their provincial elections are being held? 
There is no constitutional barrier to doing this, as was shown by 
the election of the late Senator Stan Waters, Canada's first and 
only elected senator.
<P>
	I challenge the Liberal government with its red ink book and 
its rhetoric about a more open and democratic Parliament to 
practise what it preaches and to move toward Senate reform. I 
challenge it to do something that will give it a revered place in 
history.
<P>
	I challenge this government to stop the patronage 
appointments to the Senate. I challenge it to take a stand and say 
that an unelected Senate is unacceptable and that this 
government will allow elected Canadians to sit in the upper 
chamber. Ending the patronage appointments is the right thing 
to do. This government now has a chance  to do the right thing. 
The Tories before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5069"> 5069 </A></B>
<P>
them missed their chance to do it and we know what happened to 
them.
<P>
	There are likely to be another eight or nine senators who will 
reach retirement age before the next federal election. That 
means eight or nine more opportunities for the government to 
show if it is committed to democracy or addicted to patronage. 
The hon. member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
thinks there might be more if some of them pass away. Let us see 
if this government is committed to democracy or if it is addicted 
to patronage.
<P>
	Once we get the elected part right, there will be more goodwill 
created toward the Senate. The constitutional changes that are 
required to ensure the democratic equality of all Canadians will 
be more achievable.
<P>
	I would hope for the sake of Canada, our democratic system, 
the wish of Canadians for a reformed Senate, and to avoid future 
problems and disagreements over redistribution formulas that 
the government will move to democratize the upper chamber. 
There is no reason other than partisan self-interest why it could 
not do so.
<P>
	The government is proposing moving the date that the 
redistribution process would resume to June 22 from February 6. 
This has the effect of creating a 12-month period to review the 
redistribution legislation. The government had originally 
proposed 24 months and the other place proposed six months.
<P>
	When this bill was debated the last time around in this House 
the Reform Party proposed an amendment that provided 
for-guess what-a 12-month period. The Liberals 
unanimously voted it down. Now they are proposing the very 
same thing. This shows two things. First, they are not willing to 
support a common sense idea if it comes from this side of the 
House. Second, they are admitting to feeling a little 
embarrassed about the ridiculous nature of what they tried to do.
<P>
	Even the media has acknowledged the Liberal retreat. An 
article in the June 3 <I>Toronto Star</I> reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberal government has backed away from a confrontation with the 
Senate, agreeing to extensively amend a bill that would have prevented 
riding redistribution before the next election. The government House leader 
proposed the compromise yesterday, winning tentative support from senators 
and Reform MPs who had strongly objected to the original bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We've given the matter further thought. We've listened to public 
comment-We're a government that's ready to listen, the government House 
leader told reporters. But the proposed amendments also help the 
government. British Columbia, which stood to gain two House of Commons 
seats prior to the bill, objected to it strongly. Even rank and file Liberals 
were against it at the party's national convention last month.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The move to pass the original Bill C-18 was so unpalatable 
that even the Liberal's own party membership could not support 
it. Had the Liberals taken our advice in the first place we could 
have saved a lot of House time.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps we would not have had to deal with the motion just 
prior to this one, where we extended the sitting until 10 o'clock 
every night until the House recesses for the summer. Let us have 
some common sense here so we do not have to introduce these 
motions at the last minute to accomplish the business we need to 
accomplish. Had the Liberals taken our advice in the first place 
we could have saved a lot of House time and allowed for more 
constructive legislation to be considered before the summer 
recess.
<P>
	Also, the bill as amended will allow for the redistribution 
commissions to complete their hearings and report to the Chief 
Electoral Officer by September 16. Again this is what we 
proposed the first time around and the government rejected it. It 
almost seems that it rejected the ideas we presented out of pure 
partisan spite only to reintroduce them under its own name.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is clear the Liberal government came up with 
a raft of bad ideas regarding C-18. As a result those of us on the 
procedure and house affairs committee are left to repair the mess 
that has been created. The Liberals have a majority on that 
committee as well as in the House. Will they attempt to force 
their predetermined wishes on the committee or will they begin 
to listen to some of the excellent proposals offered in good faith 
by Reform MPs? They have now admitted through their 
amendments to the bill that we were right the first time. Perhaps 
they have learned that we do have something to offer.
<P>
	This country is far too precious to play politics with. 
Democracy is not free. It comes at a very high price. Last 
Monday we honoured those who gave their lives to protect 
democracy 50 years before on the beaches of Normandy. We 
owe those who fought that day more than we can adequately 
express. It would be a terrible shame for their sacrifice to be 
wasted on petty partisan attempts at boundary gerrymandering.
<P>
	In Canada the principal tenets of democracy are something we 
should be proud of. They are not something to be tampered with 
to suit the needs of the government.
<P>
	I would support the bill as amended because it is basically 
what we had proposed in the first place. I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-18.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
carefully followed the proceedings on Bill C-18 at all stages and 
also joined in the debate at all stages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5070"> 5070 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata just made a 
comment I did not quite understand, and I am afraid I was 
momentarily distracted.
<P>
	As I was saying, Bill C-18-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> -was introduced by the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons and considered at all 
stages, where I took part in the debate, and to me it was clear that 
the government wanted Bill C-18 to be adopted as is, without 
major amendments in this House.
<P>
	In fact, the Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons said so on several occasions, not only from his seat 
here in the House, but also when he appeared, at least twice, 
before the Senate, to defend his amendments. I read and reread 
what was said by the government House leader in the Senate, 
and his replies to questions from Senators Prud'homme, 
Lynch-Staunton and others were a clear indication that he did 
not intend to add any amendments.
<P>
	What happened between the time Bill C-18 was passed in the 
House and today? Basically, two things happened which made 
the Government House Leader change his mind.
<P>
	We had the Liberal convention which voted on a resolution 
requesting that redistribution take place in time for the next 
election.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Resolutions on the subject all had the same goal. There was 
also the position taken by the Conservative majority in the 
Senate. The Conservative majority, seems more like a Reform 
majority. We now apparently have a reform majority in the 
Senate, since comments made in the Upper House by hon. 
senators who defended the majority position reflected the same 
arguments used by Reform members in this House. We can say 
there is a kind of strange osmosis between Conservative 
senators and Reform members. I think they are starting to find 
out they have things in common. The missing link lies 
somewhere between the Reform Party and the Conservative 
Party. The family is getting back together.
<P>
	Just as the phoenix rose from his ashes, apparently the Reform 
Party has benefited from an electoral infusion of Conservative 
support. We shall see.
<P>
	I am very sorry to see that the government caved in to the 
wishes of a House that is not elected and is dictating to us its 
concept of a democratic approach to setting electoral boundaries 
and guidelines for electoral boundaries readjustment, since 
basically, that is what we will have to do on the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	All things being equal and the government having consented, 
despite denouncing what the Conservative senators appointed 
by former Prime Minister Mulroney had done with the GST, 
despite all this, today we realize that the more things change, the 
more they stay the same. Once again, the government bent to the 
will of the other  house. This is one time too many since at the 
start of its mandate, the government had the unique opportunity 
to send a very clear message to the Senate and to show that the 
Upper House was and is the embodiment of democracy, 
according to the classic definition. The government missed this 
unique opportunity to make it very clear not only to the Senate, 
but to all Canadians that decisions are made in the House of 
Commons by the elected representatives of the people.
<P>
	Of course, the other house may from time to time make some 
technical adjustments or indicate that a bill may have been 
poorly drafted. At times the Senate may serve this useful 
purpose. I also believe that a few extra legislative advisers could 
achieve the same results. The role of an unelected Senate in 
1994 is not to propose such substantive amendments to a bill. 
For this reason, my colleague from Richmond-Wolfe proposed 
yesterday that funding to the other house be cut off, which to all 
intents and purposes amounted to proposing the abolition of the 
Senate.
<P>
	Virtually everyone in this country objects to the idea of an 
appointed Senate like the one we now have. Since there is no 
chance whatsoever of reforming this institution either in the 
short or medium term, abolishing it outright is the simplest 
solution.
<P>
	When we, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, have fulfilled 
our mission, working with Quebecers, to achieve sovereignty 
for Quebec, then of course the debate on whether Canadians 
want an elected Upper House, or a Triple E Senate, as mentioned 
by my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster, can be 
reopened. However, it will be quite another matter to convince 
Ontario which will account for probably more than half the 
population of Canada to agree to having one-ninth of the 
senators. I wish them good luck, but it will be their problem. 
That debate will take place in Canada. We will have our own 
debate in Quebec.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, given that the Bloc 
clearly stated its position, supported Bill C-18 as originally 
introduced, listened to the Reform Party argue that Bill C-18 
should be amended and finally, voted against these 
amendments, we will not change our position. We stand by the 
original version of Bill C-18.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	If the government has decided to bend to the will of the 
Senate, then so be it. Let it live with the consequences of this act 
of weakness. So as not to delay the work of this House, we will 
consent to the bill being passed on division.

	The House resumed from June 1 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-34, an act respecting self-government for first 
nations in the Yukon Territory, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really do not 
have a long prepared text for my speech this morning.
<P>
	This long and detailed bill on the First Nations 
self-government act which has been introduced by the 
government deserves a great deal of consideration. It is a 
lengthy bill and has major ramifications when it deals with the 
granting of self-government to large parts of our country by 
creating a new level, a new idea, a new vision of government by 
certain classes of people.
<P>
	It is a little bit different than the whole vision we have always 
had that Canadians are exactly the same from coast to coast, that 
we are going to set up some kind of self-government for one 
particular class of Canadians.
<P>
	Reformers very much believe in the equality of all Canadians 
from coast to coast and this type of bill requires a great deal of 
consideration. We cannot move ahead too quickly on this and the 
House should take the opportunity to look at the bill and 
examine it in great detail.
<P>
	In the deliberations the government and the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development have had with the 
aboriginals in the development of this bill I hope the wishes of 
the rest of Canadians have been taken into consideration. It will 
have ramifications for natural resources and on how we govern 
this country. It could become unmanageable to have another 
level of government introducing its opinion into the 
development of the country. We already have three levels and a 
fourth  level is going to make it more and more difficult. 
Therefore I hope the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development can give us his assurance that this bill is 
advancing the cause of Canadian aspirations rather than causing 
roadblocks and problems in the years ahead.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to discuss the problems of Bill C-34 and its attempt to help 
the Indian communities in Yukon to achieve the kind of 
economic and social aspirations which I think is their legitimate 
right and which I would like to support.
<P>
	Unfortunately I believe this bill will not achieve this 
objective. In fact, it is my judgment this bill will do a great deal 
of harm, much like policies of the past have done an 
unfortunately large amount of harm.
<P>
	In my saying that the basic principles underlying this bill are 
false, I do not wish to suggest that I have an answer to the 
complex problem on how to help the native population of our 
country. Nevertheless, I am in the kind of situation where I do 
know there is an illness and that the medicine which is being 
proposed will not help alleviate the problems but in fact will 
make them worse.
<P>
	Let me say what I mean. All of us-it is a human 
condition-dream about having a rich uncle who pays us a 
guaranteed, generous income so we can retire somewhere on 
some south sea island and be happy ever after. It is part of the 
human condition that we all have these kinds of dreams. 
However, in our experience, as we have matured, we have 
known that this is a dream which cannot be fulfilled. The rich 
uncle, even if he gave money to us, even if we could go to the 
south sea island, would not help us be any happier than we are. 
Often in fact we would be forced to leave.
<P>
	Studies have shown that people who have the means to engage 
in this kind of fulfilment of their dreams come back unhappy and 
resume their old lives.
<P>
	This is why we as parents typically, even if we could afford to, 
tell our children: ``No, your education is finished, you cannot 
count on more support from me, from my family, from your 
parents. You will from now on be on your own''. The rich 
families of this world establish trust funds to say: ``At age 35 or 
40 you will be able to draw on this money''.
<P>
	We understand it is in the human condition that we need an 
obligation, that we need a job, that we need to work. We have 
refused to give in to our children, yet we have been misguided 
when in the past we have given in to the demands of the native 
community to give them more physical goods, to allow them to 
live on their south sea island equivalent. This is my judgment of 
what is going on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5072"> 5072 </A></B>
<P>
	I have read a sociological economic study of conditions on 
these reservations. Let me tell you the story of what is known on 
these reservations as the lazy house. In the olden days, when 
families lived in their traditional ways the man in the house had 
a task. The man had to cut wood, make sure that his family was 
comfortable. He went out to hunt and fish to supplement the 
food supply. The housewife, the mother, was fully occupied 
doing the kinds of chores we have all seen our wives doing and 
we in fact have participated in helping in the family.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Of course with modern houses you do not have to go and cut 
wood. Electricity or gas supplies the heat. You do not have to stir 
the wood in the stove in order to cook meals. Instead of having to 
tend a garden in the summer you just buy the food from the 
supermarket.
<P>
	I can understand it. When I was in my twenties I was saying to 
my parents: ``Hey, listen, you know you can afford it. Give me 
some more''. These people have come to the Government of 
Canada and said: ``It is our right''. It has been supported by 
people like those heckling me saying: ``Yes, of course you poor 
people, we will give it to you''. Well, we give it to them.
<P>
	This is what I read has been the consequence of this policy. 
They would not do it to their children but they do it to the 
natives. The lazy house now means the mother has so much time 
on her hands she does not know what to do with it. The father, his 
very existence, the meaning in life has gone away, just like the 
meaning of life has gone away from people who go to the south 
sea islands and have the option to come back.
<P>
	This is the interpretation that I read of what is wrong with the 
native communities. I do not have to repeat what is wrong with 
the native communities. The books are full of it. My wife, the 
doctor, treats the wounds, treats the cigarette burns on the arms 
of the people, of the wives who have been mistreated by men 
whose meaning of life has gone because we were like the rich 
uncle who says: ``Oh my poor teenage nephew. He needs a 
steady flow of income''.
<P>
	I know I am going against the conventional wisdom by 
suggesting that it is short-sighted for the government to do what 
many of us have decided is short-sightedness of supplying our 
children with ways which lead to complications of the sort I 
have described.
<P>
	I do not know the answer to the native communities and the 
problems which persist. If we go back 50 or 100 years, every 
year the answer is to give them more resources and they will be 
happy and will get rid of the problems. We give them more and 
more and more.
<P>
	I have the budget here. We already are increasing 
expenditures at a time when all the other spending programs are 
being cut, for example, to old people. The future is being 
burdened by increasing debt. We are increasing spending on 
natives by $300 million a year. That has been going on over the 
last 100 years.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I hear people saying: ``You do not know what you are talking 
about. You mean to spend even more''. The problem has not got 
any better. From what I know, it has been getting worse all the 
time. That is why we are now going for other institutional 
innovations. Now we have to make this absolutely permanent so 
they never, ever have to do certain things that I believe are the 
essence of human dignity, of a life worth living on this planet.
<P>
	It is the natives who have called those houses lazy houses. We 
have seen what happens if we do this.
<P>
	Sometimes the best thing we can do for our children is to say 
no. I believe that even though we do not have the answers, 
saying no would mean that we are not giving more medicine for 
the cure of this problem which I think history over the last 100 
years suggests is the wrong medicine.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions or comments? Perhaps some 
of the members who were heckling would have the courage to 
get up and ask a question or make a comment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the hon. member and his 
reference to the Yukon legislation and the four First Nations that 
are involved. His reference to lazy house is a reference to the 
aboriginal people of those four First Nations. Maybe he could 
clarify this. He is in fact saying they are lazy, they live in a south 
sea environment and the men go around burning their wives with 
cigarettes.
<P>
	Is it his intent to leave that on the record?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to suggest 
that the native people are in any way inferior to us or any other 
people in the world. It is my considered judgment from reading 
history and evidence on the sociology and the problems of these 
communities that the state and well meaning people like the 
minister who just spoke have created conditions and institutions 
with the best intentions, filling the short run demands of the 
individual just like we were likely to do when we were teenagers 
or in our twenties.
<P>
	I am suggesting the evidence I have seen is that these 
institutions have produced not what the teenager wanted, not 
what the natives wanted but something that is now creating the 
difficulties all of us feel so terrible about. From what I hear life 
is awful on these reservations.
<P>
	We all want to help. I am not here to denigrate or in any way 
insinuate that the aboriginal peoples of this country are in any 
way inferior. They need our help. The question is, are we giving 
them the right help?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5073"> 5073 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe we must look at how we got where we are. How did 
we get there? How does the proposal to give even more 
resources to these people differ from what our predecessors in 
the last 100 years said: ``Here is a problem. Let us throw more 
money at it''. Let us make sure that this is a cure, that the 
responsibility we have for them is even more permanent and 
fixed.
<P>
	I did not invent the words lazy house. It was discovered by the 
natives themselves. When they get the things they have they do 
not quite turn out the way they expected.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	You remember when you had your first bicycle, your first 
motorcycle, your first car. As you were fighting for it, you 
thought: ``If only I could have that, I would be happy forever and 
ever''. We now remember. Sometimes the things we want, when 
we have them, are not really good for us.
<P>
	Let me sum up. I am not in any way insinuating that the people 
themselves are lazy, that they are in any way inferior. Any 
problems that society has I believe should be looked at 
realistically by asking: ``How did we get there?'' If we decide 
that all we need are more resources, I urge members to go back 
and see why proposing all those resources in the past, increasing 
all those resources available to them, has not solved the 
problem. From what I hear and read, it has made it worse.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say as a member of this House that I am 
appalled at the message we are receiving from the hon. member 
across the way. I say that because the hon. member is constantly 
asking how we got there.
<P>
	This government is taking an initiative of listening to the 
native community. Our Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development has been into communities across this country 
listening to the people. The people want a vision for themselves 
and part of that vision is what we are talking about today.
<P>
	It is about economic growth and jobs within the First Nations 
community. The member opposite is criticizing and opposing 
what we are doing on this side of the House. What is his agenda 
for the First Nations of this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you indicate to me how much 
time I have.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> About two to three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear we are facing a very 
complex problem.
<P>
	I do not pretend to have the answer but I can tell the member 
that I have read studies. One of them had a wonderful title. In 
fact the author and I were colleagues at the Australian National 
University for a long time. It was called <I>The Affluent 
Subsistence Economy</I>.
<P>
	The south sea islands are so far away from all markets that the 
south sea islands will never be able to be industrialized and have 
the kind of living standards we have in our industrial country. It 
is simply a physical  impossibility. I wish it were different. I 
wish we could fly. It is not in the cards.
<P>
	Why am I using this example of the south sea islands? It is 
because that is something we can relate to. I certainly come from 
a temperate climate. This has always been my dream.
<P>
	The areas in the north are very much like the south sea islands 
that have been studied. There was no great interference in many 
of them from the outside. They all have a reasonably good 
living. They are healthy. They have their traditions. They are 
from all descriptions of sociologists a happy, well-balanced 
society.
<P>
	However they now all want radios, televisions and other 
things. One of the tragedies of our lives, of the reality of this 
world is that there is no way that by staying on these islands they 
can have these things. I did not invent it. The analysts did not 
invent it. It is simply a fact of life. There are distances and they 
cannot have this.
<P>
	They have a choice. Either they continue to have their affluent 
subsistence with all the satisfaction, all the dreams and romantic 
attributes that are associated with that kind of a life or, dare I say 
it, they leave. They go to the big island and they join the big 
cities with all the problems that go along with it.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Time is too limited to draw the parallel of what that analysis 
implies for the native people of our country. I can tell you there 
will never be in the centre of Yukon an industry sufficient to 
maintain the people there by their own work at a living standard 
corresponding to that which we have in Toronto or in Vancouver. 
I believe that it is a contradiction, that we are not serving them 
by giving in to their demands. I do not deny that the hon. 
minister has been listening to them.
<P>
	They say they want enough resources in the centre of Yukon 
so that they can live as well as the people in Vancouver. It is not 
possible. I believe the sooner we come to that realization and tell 
them they have a choice but they cannot have it both ways, the 
better off they will be and we will be.
<P>
	That is an outline of the solution I have. I know it is not 
popular, but I have not been elected to keep on talking about 
what is popular. I was elected to speak out and to say things the 
way I see them after 30 years of spending my life reading, 
writing and thinking about these matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-34 which is before the 
House today. The legislation allows for implementation of the 
land claims agreement entered into by the Government of 
Canada, the government of Yukon territory and a number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5074"> 5074 </A></B>
<P>
First Nations residing within Yukon territory. I am pleased 
because this is very important legislation that was a long time in 
coming and that deserves the full support of every member of 
this  House including, I would hope, the member from 
Capilano-Howe Sound who just spoke.
<P>
	I am disturbed by some of the remarks that I have just heard. I 
would simply say in prefacing my remarks today that I think it is 
time all members of this House stopped thinking in terms of 
something as ours to give someone else. We must understand 
that we as people in this nation share a tremendous resource and 
that in sharing that resource we recognize that some people have 
as much right to that resource as others. Members of this 
Parliament do not have the right to give something to somebody 
that in fact they possessed long before it was removed from 
them.
<P>
	The aboriginal people of this country have a claim not only on 
our resources but our economy that has long been denied them. 
It has created a great deal of the problems that have been 
identified by the member for Capilano-Howe Sound. It is only 
in that recognition that we will in fact achieve the ability to deal 
with the crisis that occurs within the aboriginal communities. 
That is one of the points that this legislation addresses. I would 
hope that the member for Capilano-Howe Sound in 
recognizing that would in turn support the legislation.
<P>
	I want to thank the House for allowing me a few minutes to 
speak today. I will not take up much time. This space was 
originally allocated to my leader, the member for Yukon, who 
was called away today on other parliamentary business. She 
asked me to say a few words on her behalf. I appreciate the 
indulgence of the House, the member for Vancouver Quadra and 
yourself, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me this time.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I wish to say a couple of words about the member for Yukon 
today. She has worked closely with the Government of Yukon 
and the Yukon First Nations during the negotiations which led to 
the signing of the claims agreement. She is certainly very well 
informed about the nature of the agreement. She is firmly 
committed to assisting the House in approving the legislation 
which will allow that agreement to be implemented.
<P>
	On her behalf, on behalf of myself and on behalf of our entire 
caucus in the House of Commons, I ask the government to 
proceed as quickly as possible through all stages of the 
legislation. It has been thoroughly discussed, carefully thought 
out and properly negotiated. Agreements have been reached. It 
would be a real shame if all levels of government that have 
worked so hard to get to this point were to see things stalled 
simply because the government and Parliament could not 
conclude matters before heading off for a summer recess.
<P>
	I said before and I simply repeat for the benefit of the House 
that the legislation has been a long time in coming. It is the 
result of more than 20 years of very frustrating negotiations at 
times. There have been delays as governments changed and 
priorities shifted, but it is a piece of legislation that not only 
rights the bitter wrongs  of the past but holds out the key to the 
future, a future which I think all members of the House would 
understand, a future which all Yukoners, aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal alike, could look forward to with pride and with 
hope.
<P>
	It is a historic agreement. When we look at the umbrella 
agreement we see that it directly affects about 8,000 Yukon 
Indians and involves a total of about 16,000 square miles of 
land, some of which comes with surface and subsurface rights 
and some with surface rights only but including the rights to 
material such as sand and gravel, economic opportunities in 
Yukon.
<P>
	There is a little more than $242 million in compensation 
available to the 14 First Nations affected, to be paid out during a 
15-year period. There are provisions ensuring that the Yukon 
First Nations receive full rental revenues from surface leases 
and royalties from the development of non-renewable 
resources. These are very important provisions for the future of 
the people of the Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	I recommend all members of the House review the umbrella 
agreement. It has sections that deal with wildlife harvesting, 
wildlife conservation and land use management proposals, as 
well as provisions dealing with the preservation and promotion 
of the culture and heritage of the people of Yukon.
<P>
	The agreement is a tremendous example of what can be 
achieved when governments sit down to discuss these matters, 
when they have respect for each other's history and tradition and 
for each other's needs.
<P>
	The final umbrella agreement was signed on May 29, 1993. 
Today is a little more than one year later and I believe this is the 
time to get the legislation out of the House and put it to work in 
Yukon where it will do the most good.
<P>
	I certainly look forward to having some time during the brief 
committee stage discussions to have a further look at some of 
the more specific clauses for the benefit of some members of the 
House. However I will conclude immediately by urging the 
government and all members of the House to get the legislation 
through this stage and completed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little disturbed by 
some of the comments of the hon. member, his overwhelming 
enthusiasm for the bill. Companion Bills C-33 and C-34 in my 
view legislatively and constitutionally entrench a form of 
apartheid in the country. The fact that the people who are being 
segregated will perhaps have greater rights than the segregators 
is a bit unique. They are ensuring perpetual divisions within the 
country, as well as, as my hon. colleague has stated, ensuring 
that for the future and perhaps for all time the people who will be 
segregated from us will be condemned to a life that has no real 
meaning.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5075"> 5075 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Let me explain what I am getting at. In the 1950s and early 
1960s I spent most of my time working in the bush with native 
people. They were very self-reliant, hard working and proud. 
They did what they could to support their families. They did not 
ask the government for anything. By and large they were happy 
and successful people. They built their own cabins; they hunted 
their own food. They did not ask us to send them more money, 
give them control over more resources and they would be happy. 
They never thought of themselves as being unequal because they 
were our equals. Now we are going to make them something 
different.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe or does he not in the equality of 
all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I cannot 
agree with many of the comments my friend and colleague from 
the southern part of Saskatchewan has put on the table today. I 
do not believe that anything could be further from the truth than 
segregating people by this legislation.
<P>
	If the member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
would look carefully at the agreements that have been signed, he 
would realize this is an integration of aboriginal people into full 
participation in the economy of Yukon. We are not just talking 
about the equalities of people. We are also talking about equality 
of opportunity for all people.
<P>
	We have to find a way in which the aboriginal people, not only 
of Yukon but all across Canada who in his words want to be 
self-reliant, hard working and proud, can participate in an 
economy that has been denied them for many years because of 
policies of previous federal governments. The treaties signed in 
other parts of the country have actually reduced the ability of 
our aboriginal people to participate in the economy as equal 
partners in the way in which they deserve to be treated.
<P>
	We have to find ways, as this agreement has done, to bring 
together equality of opportunity. That is a more important 
question than the one the member asked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am curious and 
rather amazed at the comments of my hon. friend. Anyone who 
has looked at the Indian Act will realize that for years and years 
it has denied the treaty Indian people of the country their 
equality with other Canadians.
<P>
	As we look at this document we must ask ourselves whether or 
not we are simply eliminating one piece of legislation that has 
created inequality on behalf of Indian people and replacing it 
with another, except the rules have changed. The rights and 
privileges granted Indian people are going to supersede those 
which other Canadians enjoy.
<P>
	I ask the member to consider these points. At the time the 
treaties were signed, it was not so much the treaties but the 
application or the administration of the treaties  that caused 
inequality in the country for so long for treaty Indian people.
<P>
	Would the hon. member focus his attention on this question: 
Are we or are we not at risk in that we are creating laws that will 
grant special rights and privileges to Canadian people based 
upon their race and ethnic background?
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I think the member has things 
a bit backwards here. I recommend that he have a look at the 
agreements reached in Yukon with regard to the legislation we 
are trying to implement today.
<P>
	First, we are not talking about treaties in the case of this 
agreement. Second, one part of the agreement does away with 
the provisions of the Indian Act which have caused many of the 
problems in the past.
<P>
	We recognize that over the years federal government policy 
and other policies developed by provincial and territorial 
governments have actually removed the aboriginal rights to the 
land and the benefits the land provides. Those rights have been 
encroached upon by others who had no claim on them. The 
agreement recognizes those rights were encroached upon to 
begin with and returns them to where they rightfully belonged in 
the first place.
<P>
	I do not accept the premise of the hon. member's question at 
all. I certainly wish he would study the issue a lot more closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps we should return the debate to Bill C-34. We have been 
all over the world. We have been to the south seas in search of 
some mystical blue lagoon. We have been to pre-democratic 
South Africa in search of a regime I would have thought was 
totally foreign to anything we have seen in the application of the 
law currently before the House.
<P>
	As real Canadians, not inhabitants of some mythical isle but 
as native Indians, founding nations or whatever, we are dealing 
with Canadians getting together in a new act of law making. I 
thought it delightful when I read it-and I asked whether I could 
meet with the public servants who actively engaged in the work 
on the bill-that it was not an exercise in abstract law making.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5076"> 5076 </A></B>
<P>
	To use another metaphor, one was not building castles in 
Spain or seeking to do so. One was not seeking the sermon on the 
mount which is so rarely realizable in concrete life. One was 
venturing on a concrete act of problem solving. One was trying 
to solve problems for particular people. I would have thought 
there was the difference. May I say it is the theatre of the absurd 
to compare it to apartheid, a regime of state imposed draconian 
police measures and enforced segregation.
<P>
	Here we are dealing with a free act of consensus. The players 
are all coming together, not simply the government and not 
simply native peoples. If we look at the files we see local 
communities, chambers of commerce and an amazingly wide 
degree of consultation in the process. We see peoples coming 
together and freely deciding on a new system of government.
<P>
	The search for constitutional absolutes, abstract principles 
which read very nicely in platforms but do not often correspond 
to reality if we examine constitutions around the world, has been 
avoided. One could have spent hours, days and months 
discussing the concept of the inherent right to self-government 
which so baffled the former Minister of Justice and the late 
Prime Minister. She never could understand it.
<P>
	When it was first launched in 1980 in the Trudeau patriation 
round, it was a simple statement of the obvious: people have 
rights not because some government gives them but because of 
their nature and their capacity as human beings. It is what Locke 
said. It is what Rousseau said. It is the basis of our constitution 
making and our constitutional system.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	What you have is a constructive involvement of native 
peoples by their own free consent negotiating with the federal 
government and reaching an agreement which might serve as a 
model for future agreements but which does not have to be 
applied rigidly, inscrutably to other problem areas in the future.
<P>
	The charming thing, the wonderful thing here, is law in the 
making, a sense of a dynamic creation of new norms of law. The 
way it is done is to limit oneself to the particular problem, not to 
attempt to solve the problems of the day after tomorrow but to 
set in place a structure and process of self-government.
<P>
	Self-government is not an abstract norm, it is something that 
happens to people as Dewey recognized in his theory of truth. 
You make the events happen. You work together. I look at this 
and I see pragmatism, I see empiricism, I see problem solving. I 
congratulate the players and it is not simply the federal 
government, it is the Yukon territorial government, it is the 
native Indian leaders, the people, it is the local community 
people. I look at the steps that are taken, the recognition that 
self-government without an economic base is no more than 
tinkling cymbals.
<P>
	This is why Bills C-33 and C-34 go together. You need an 
economic base or self-government is meaningless.
<P>
	Then you go on to the issue of self-government and what 
form. You can begin as so many people did between the two 
world wars by creating a beautiful constitution. The history 
books are littered with these beautiful constitutions that were 
enacted and were never seriously intended, or sometimes were 
seriously intended but the people did not bother to follow them 
up with the machinery necessary to implement them.
<P>
	When I look here, there is the concept of incorporation of 
native Indian peoples to create their own companies, to create 
their own commercial organizations, to develop resources, to 
develop wealth, to share it among the population. That is 
something the European constitution makers between the two 
world wars forgot. It is present in this bill. It is a key part of it.
<P>
	The Indian act will continue to apply outside Yukon. This is a 
special experiment. If it succeeds others will copy it. If it does 
not fully succeed it can be modified. The power to tax is a 
necessary element of self-government. You do not rush into it in 
the sense that we will enact an abstract law tonight and it will be 
in force tomorrow. It is not to apply for three years. What that 
envisages is a continuing process of consultation and 
discussions with experts and government officials, finding the 
correct formula for taxation before it is concretely 
implemented.
<P>
	I was particularly impressed by the provisions on the 
administration of justice. I have seen in too many newly 
independent countries or too many countries newly freed from 
subjection to some form of government, communist or 
otherwise, not particularly constitutional, the attempt to create 
the blueprints before one has examined how to make them 
operational.
<P>
	The thing that is impressive here is that the staggered stage by 
stage, step by step approach that the full administration of 
justice will occur by the year 2000. One has avoided the 
temptation to rush into a law that will be in force tomorrow but 
that does not have the concrete underpinning to sustain it 
operationally.
<P>
	There is something very impressive in this, the recognition 
that there are many roads to Rome in terms of self-government. 
Here is a model that the native Indian leaders have worked out 
with federal officials and local community groups and they are 
going to try it out. That is very important.
<P>
	The temptation, as they say, was there to go for the abstract 
blueprints. It has been avoided in a mature exercise in 
constitution making in favour of this pragmatic, empirical, 
problem oriented, step by step approach here, resting all the 
time on continuing negotiations between the parties.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="5077"> 5077 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	There is an act of faith here, a sense of faith and trust not 
between parents and children, as somebody suggested in a 
metaphor that was ill placed, but between free citizens. The trust 
is very important to the further progressive development of the 
self-government concept.
<P>
	When I look at this bill I do not see anything that changes the 
structure and system of government in Canada as a whole. The 
impressive thing is that this is achieved within the Canadian 
Constitution. It is within the parameters of the Canadian 
Constitution. It is subject to the Canadian Constitution. It is 
subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Do not create imaginary scenarios, worst case scenarios that 
would in effect take us out of the Canadian constitutional system 
when neither the parties wanted it nor is it present in the act. 
These two acts are very well drafted. I say this without being 
presumptuous. I say this from an earlier free, prepolitical role. 
They are carefully drafted, problem oriented and there are no 
hidden traps here.
<P>
	There is no reason for worrying about hypothetical situations 
that do not exist; a decision made within the Constitution, within 
Canadian federalism, a special approach to federalism, the 
concept of pluralistic federalism. We have always recognized 
within Canadian federalism that equality does not require a 
rigid, abstract application of laws identically in all situations.
<P>
	It is the large concept of equality that the United States 
Supreme Court recognized. It has spread throughout the world. 
It is building people up to a level where concretely, in terms of 
their rights and obligation and duties, they are as one.
<P>
	I commend this law. I would say to those who feel that they 
must search for the blue lagoon somewhere, let us come back to 
Canada. Let us herald this as a first step, so generous in many 
respects because it breaks new ground within the Constitution 
and subject to the Constitution. The nice thing in it is that it has 
its own dialectical process, the capacity for further growth. The 
capacity for change, for amendment is there if the parties agree 
to it.
<P>
	That is something transcending the issues of party politics. 
We can say congratulations are in order to the minister, to the 
civil servants, to the native Indian leaders. This is good. In a 
certain sense when federalism is under attack for other reasons 
in Canada today it makes one feel very confident in the future of 
our federal system and its capacity, the continuing dynamic 
growth in relation to new problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	It is important to point out that no one in this House surely is 
going to say that the native peoples of Canada should be denied 
any type of rights, certainly not, and no one has said that today.
<P>
	What we have commented on is the extension of rights 
exclusive to the native peoples under Bill C-34, exclusivity of 
rights not applicable to other citizens of Canada, rights that 
would be available to them under their own Constitution and in 
fact outside the Constitution Act of Canada.
<P>
	Nowhere in this bill is there a reference that the Constitution 
Act of Canada would be supreme over any provisions of this bill. 
To suggest that there are people in this House who would want to 
deny rights to native peoples is a misstatement for certain.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to put any 
fears of the hon. member opposite to rest on this. It is not 
necessary in a law of Canada to recite, to repeat, the self-evident 
that the Constitution and the laws of Canada are supreme. The 
Constitution of Canada applies to all laws enacted by the 
Parliament of Canada. The source, the grundnorm in legal 
terms, if I can use the technical term, of this new 
self-government is an act of Parliament of Canada. It is subject 
to the Canadian Constitution. It is subject to the Canadian 
charter of rights. There is no room for doubt on that. I hope I can 
put any fears the member may have to rest on that.
<P>
	I do not see here any notion of exclusiveness of rights or 
particularization of rights, priorization of rights in relation to 
other citizens. I would have thought this is an attempt to put all 
Canadian citizens on the same level but if there is doubt as I say 
this is part, this is a law enacted within the Canadian 
constitutional system and it is therefore subject to the Canadian 
Constitution and all its parts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am wondering 
if the hon. member who has just spoken would accept an 
amendment that would remove all doubt with regard to the 
application of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to this 
agreement.
<P>
	I think that as members of Parliament and those involved in 
law making we must flush out every corner to ensure that no 
mistakes are made and that nothing is overlooked so that the 
document when it finally receives the great seal of Canada does 
the job it is meant to do.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member would support an 
amendment where it clearly states that within the document the 
charter of rights of Canada does apply and will continue to 
apply.
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to comment on such an 
amendment and whether he would be prepared to support such 
an amendment?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5078"> 5078 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not the author of this bill 
and so I am not authorized to make any arrangements on behalf 
of the government.
<P>
	I would, however, caution against the pursuit of perfectionism 
in its extreme and pathological form. I recollect the legislature 
of a province which I will not name enacting within the 
preamble to every law at a certain point ``this statute is not 
subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''.
<P>
	I do not think this is a good way to make law remembering that 
law is designed to be educational too. The statute states very 
clearly in its preamble that it is subject to the Constitution of 
Canada. It is quite clear. It is quite explicit and it is true in any 
case as a matter of general law.
<P>
	To be very frank, if the member has any concrete problems 
they will very quickly be tested before the courts I am sure and 
the self-evident clearly expressed. It is not simply self-evident. 
It is evidenced in writing and will apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to address Bill 
C-34, a bill which deals with the self-government provisions of 
the aboriginal peoples of Yukon.
<P>
	Clearly there has been a great deal of confusion over the term 
self-government in this House.
<P>
	On February 7, I questioned the Prime Minister on this topic 
and specifically whether aboriginal self-government in his 
mind, in his government's mind, in its definition, would exist 
within federal or provincial jurisdictions, jurisdictions which 
apply to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	He chose not to answer the question directly. Further, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the 
Minister of Justice have made conflicting statements with 
respect to the application of the Criminal Code and the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms as it would pertain to aboriginal 
self-governments.
<P>
	Clearly the federal government has absolutely no idea of the 
definition of self-government, nor does it have any idea where 
these self-government agreements will lead. However, this has 
not deterred them from putting forward Bill C-34, a bill which is 
unprecedented in relation to the scope of powers and privileges 
it delivers to self-governing institutions, a bill which for all 
intents and purposes confers a type of nationhood on the 
affected bands.
<P>
	If we look at the specifics of Bill C-34 I believe that we can 
easily envisage the creation of four new nations in the Yukon, 
with a further ten yet to be established. These nations, within the 
nation of Canada, according to the bill, will convey the same 
powers that federal and provincial governments exercise upon 
four new nations with a combined population of only 2,600 
people. These  new nations may, in fact, exist outside the 
authority of federal and provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	I believe there is ample evidence to establish that the 
government is stumbling blindly into agreements which will 
create a patchwork of sovereign aboriginal nations across 
Canada.
<P>
	For the pleasure of the members of the House, I will now 
begin to present the reasons for supporting this belief.
<P>
	The government on a number of occasions has committed 
itself to the belief that aboriginals have an inherent right to 
self-government. With agreements such as this bill, the 
government obviously believes that amendments to the 
Constitution are unnecessary as aboriginal inherent rights could 
be interpreted as being included under section 35(1) of the 
Constitution Act.
<P>
	But what exactly does this constitutionally protected term 
inherent mean? An inherent right is something beyond a legal 
right, since the latter is dependent on the existence of some other 
government. Therefore, an inherent right to self-government 
puts aboriginal governments beyond the reach of federal and 
provincial governing bodies.
<P>
	If we go a step further, we can see an inherent right leading to 
claims of international sovereignty, or more likely, the 
possibility of the aboriginal peoples under this bill choosing to 
opt out of federal laws. It is the term inherent that is the rationale 
for the government producing Bill C-34 and it is the term 
inherent that will allow aboriginal governments to challenge the 
authority of federal and provincial Parliaments.
<P>
	The federal government saw fit to insert section 15(2) in Bill 
C-34 to ensure that the Federal Court of Canada remains 
supreme over future aboriginal justice systems. This is good. 
Why not a similar section to allow for the supremacy of the 
Canadian Parliament over future aboriginal self-government 
institutions? What does the government gain by permitting the 
term inherent to go unchecked in this legislation?
<P>
	Nevertheless, this huge omission is only the beginning. The 
powers awarded to aboriginal governments, coupled with their 
inherent rights, can only further my claim that these new 
governments could actually be new nations existing outside 
provincial and federal jurisdictions. According to section 8(1) 
of Bill C-34 these aboriginal governments are to have their own 
constitutions which will set out the structure of their legislature 
and their democratic processes. It will establish a citizenship 
code and determine the rights and freedoms of those citizens.
<P>
	Does this sound familiar, Mr. Speaker? Well, it should. These 
are the same powers exercised by the federal government 
operating as the nation of Canada, the very same powers. The 
powers delivered to aboriginal governments are a mixture of 
federal and provincial powers as defined by sections 91, 92 and 
93 of the Constitution Act of Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5079"> 5079 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Arguably these small numbers of aboriginals have been 
awarded the combined powers of our present federal and 
provincial governments under this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-34 allows aboriginal control over everything from 
marriage to education to justice to peace, order and good 
government. Does that phrase sound familiar? In short, this bill 
represents the possibility of another order of government in 
Canada, something that we questioned the Prime Minister on 
early this year. Not only have they achieved legislative powers 
that represent the best of provincial jurisdictions, but they have 
also achieved the right to draft their own constitution and 
establish their own citizenry.
<P>
	If this does not represent the distinguishing features of a 
nation within a nation then I do not know what does.
<P>
	The scope of Bill C-34, coupled with the government's 
interpretation of section 35(1) as including and protecting the 
notion of inherent right will surely supersede section 91(24) of 
the Constitution which conveys power to Parliament over 
Indians and the land reserved for Indians. This is a giant step for 
band councils which to this date have simply exercised 
municipal-like powers.
<P>
	After the implementation of Bill C-34 these councils must 
create a constitution which, among other things, will include the 
creation of a legislature. According to section 8(1)(b) of Bill 
C-34, the aboriginal constitution will determine the 
composition, the membership, the powers, duties and 
procedures of any governing bodies. This appears to be very 
dangerous considering the broad spectrum of powers awarded to 
these new possible governments.
<P>
	I have some questions. Will this new government be 
democratically elected? Will it hold regular elections? Will all 
citizens be permitted to vote and run for office? Surely questions 
like this must be answered before this legislation is passed. All 
of these questions are left unanswered and are to be determined 
by their own constitution.
<P>
	Section 9(2) is particularly disturbing since it allows the 
delegation of law-making authority to one person if it be 
consistent with their constitution. Everything from democracy 
to oligarchy to dictatorship to nepotism could be completely 
acceptable if it is consistent with their constitution.
<P>
	Perhaps this is why the government did not include any 
provision for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Bill C-34. 
Could this be the reason?
<P>
	Any deviation from democratic principles would be 
disallowed under sections 3 and 4 of the charter. These sections 
deal with democratic rights and ensure that, first, every citizen 
in Canada can vote and qualify for membership in a legislative 
assembly; and, two, that no legislative assembly shall continue 
for a period of more  than five years. The government has given 
absolute leeway to the wishes of these new nations.
<P>
	Undoubtedly aboriginals do not want Canadian citizens 
involved in their government. Perhaps they do not want 
elections, at least every five years either. Indeed, they have 
absolute control to the point where the Canadian charter has 
been excluded and the aboriginals can draft their own charter of 
rights and freedoms.
<P>
	We are creating two nations here. Entrenching the principles 
mentioned could perhaps infringe on the form of government 
envisaged by aboriginals and their respective nations.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I would hope that the federal government has not 
compromised the existence of democracy and basic human 
freedoms in these new nations by excluding aboriginal 
adherence to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Another factor which leads me to the conclusion that a 
number of new nations will be created in the Yukon is the fact 
that Bill C-34 refers to aboriginal citizens. Section 8(1)(a) of 
the bill states that a citizenship probe will be developed by the 
yet to be drafted aboriginal constitution. The only level of 
government at present that controls citizenship is of course the 
federal government of Canada. It is the only authority that has 
the right to control citizenship.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the way it should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> With the implementation of this bill aboriginal 
governments will have the power over the national concept of 
citizenry. As a matter of fact they will have the absolute power 
over the definition of who qualifies for citizenship.
<P>
	What is the basis for creating a new brand of citizenship 
within Canada if it is not for the purpose of specifically defining 
new nations in Canada? For it is clearly within the purview of 
nations to have their own citizenry and the definition thereof. 
That is what nations are all about.
<P>
	The exemption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms from 
this agreement can also be understood in light of this new power 
over citizenry. Equality rights are defined in the charter under 
section 15(1) whereby all citizens of Canada have equal 
protection and benefit of the law without racial consideration. 
That is in our charter.
<P>
	Any future aboriginal justice system as provided in section 14 
of Bill C-34 would be in violation of our Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms since it would provide a judicial system for particular 
citizens based on racial considerations. It is in violation of our 
Constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5080"> 5080 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the federal government looking forward to legislatures and 
court houses which are reserved for those of a particular race? 
This is clearly where Bill C-34 is leading and therefore it must 
be the desire of the government.
<P>
	Even the much hated Charlottetown accord included a 
provision whereby the Charter of Rights and Freedoms would 
apply immediately to the governments of aboriginal 
people-even the dastardly Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	As demonstrated, this bill goes out of its way to avoid the 
charter. Otherwise the government would have to include a 
provision like the one that existed in the Charlottetown accord 
or conversely it would not have included section 8(1)(d) 
allowing aboriginals to draft their own charter.
<P>
	This governing party, a party that drafted the charter and 
placed so much faith in its existence, is now willing to cast it 
aside in order to establish new nations, new governments, new 
homelands based on race. I must question the wisdom of this, 
considering third world nations that have been struggling with 
apartheid, with separation.
<P>
	The power of taxation goes along with these expansive 
legislative and judicial powers. These new nations will have the 
ability to raise revenues through property and personal taxation. 
However, that ability is not limited to what is in this agreement. 
Further tax powers or exemptions may be negotiated with native 
governments at a later date. The power of taxation exists despite 
the presence of a financial transfer agreement. This represents a 
transfer of funds from the federal government that will maintain 
the present level of band funding, provide for incremental 
funding of self-government operations and will provide for land 
claim implementation funding.
<P>
	Moreover, section 24 of the bill guarantees a blank cheque for 
the funding of any self-government operations. All of this 
funding plus $242.6 million is to be awarded over 15 years in 
general compensation. The tax base is very small. These new 
governments would be dependent on continuing financing from 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps it is through this measure that this government 
believes it may in fact exercise control over these new nations. 
However, I doubt Parliament could or would ever threaten to 
withhold funding since it has been perpetual through DIAND. 
Of course to withhold funding would be viewed as cruel and 
unusual punishment.
<P>
	While they have been awarded vast legislative powers, 
control over resources and powers of taxation, these new nations 
will remain dependent upon the federal treasury. This agreement 
does little to break the cycle of financial dependency in which 
aboriginals have become entrapped.
<P>
	Continued funding from the government will in no way put 
aboriginals on the same economic level as all other Canadians. 
This agreement represents profound political emancipation but 
fails to address the issue of aboriginal economic disparity.
<P>
	Finally, another issue of importance in this process is the 
interest of third parties. Who speaks for the non-natives in this 
agreement? Those who may be affected by settlement claims or 
self-governing powers have not been included in the 
negotiations. Neither non-natives, members of the public, MPs 
nor MLAs have any say in the proceedings which have led to the 
existence of this unprecedented document.
<P>
	Moreover, the government has ensured that in the future bills 
such as the one before us today will not even come to this House 
for consideration or debate. They will not even get to this House.
<P>
	Clause 5(2) of the bill states that any self-government 
agreement reached between the federal government and the 
remaining 10 Yukon bands shall come into effect only by means 
of an order in council. A government that promises openness 
and transparency is now committed to establishing new nations 
in the Yukon by way of the secret workings of cabinet. Does this 
sound familiar?
<P>
	If these agreements are in the best interests of Canadians, why 
then does the government include clause 5(2)? What is the 
government afraid of in not allowing an informed debate to 
occur in this House on future settlements? I believe that as 
demonstrated in the past, this government is afraid of the 
question: How? How is self-government going to work? How 
will the government protect democratic freedoms enjoyed by 
the native people to date? How will the government ensure that 
the rights and freedoms of these new aboriginal citizens will not 
be extinguished?
<P>
	The government cannot and will not answer these questions. 
It blindly allows for the creation of new constitutions which 
create new legislatures, new judicial systems, new rights and 
freedoms and new citizens. Ultimately, this leads to the 
formation of 14 new nations within the Yukon alone, 14 nations 
within our nation of Canada.
<P>
	The precedent Bill C-34 sets for future self-government is 
astounding. With the implementation of Bill C-34 and the 
incredible amount of power vested in these new aboriginal 
governments, what other aboriginal band would settle for less 
than Bill C-34? With some 600 aboriginal bands across Canada, 
each demanding self-government, the potential for a patchwork 
of 600 new nations in this country is very real under the terms of 
this agreement.
<P>
	Again I must question the government on its rationale for 
allowing new constitutions, new legislatures and new citizens to 
be created within this one nation, this great nation of Canada. Is 
this nation, this Constitution, this Parliament, this Canadian 
citizenry so inconsequential  that it may be tossed aside in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5081"> 5081 </A></B>
<P>
favour of new legislation, new legislatures, a new Constitution 
and new citizenship?
<P>
	Is our existing law so inconsequential? Is this the message the 
federal government is trying to deliver to the Canadian people, 
considering that a separatist party sits in official opposition? Is 
this the message?
<P>
	William Lyon Mackenzie King said this in this very House. 
He reminded us that a divided Canada can be of little help to any 
country and least of all to itself. We should ponder those words 
very carefully.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Opposing Bill C-34 may not be politically correct in the eyes 
of those who support this bill. As a servant of the Canadian 
people, I am duty bound to question the necessity of this bill and 
the possibility for founding new nations within this one nation 
of Canada.
<P>
	Therefore I and the Reform Party must oppose Bill C-34.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I heard the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley, he asked who speaks for the 
non-natives. As I understand the policy of the Reform Party it is 
to heed the people's will. If it conflicts with the Reform agenda, 
then the people's will is paramount.
<P>
	This particular legislation has involved 21 years of 
negotiations. It is supported by the Government of the Yukon. 
The leader, Mr. Ostashek, is a non-aboriginal. It is supported by 
the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, by the mayors that I talked 
to, and by the mining association. As a matter of fact the Yukon 
has already passed mirror legislation. It is supported by all of 
the Liberals in this House, by the Bloc, by the Conservative 
Party and by the NDP.
<P>
	When I stack that up against the 50 Reform members sitting 
over there in the corner who are asking who speaks for 
non-aboriginal people, my question for the hon. member is: Do 
you not think there has been sufficient non-aboriginal 
contribution to all these negotiations which have been open and 
transparent and going on for 21 years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I live in the north central part of 
British Columbia where we are surrounded with pending land 
claims and with negotiations for self-government.
<P>
	As I travel throughout my riding and talk to people, the 
number one question I get from the non-native people in my 
riding is: ``Who is asking us about how to settle these land 
claims, about how to negotiate aboriginal self-governments? 
Who is asking us?'' The fact is no one is asking them.
<P>
	This legislation came to our party the morning it was 
introduced in this Parliament, nine inches of documentation, 
and was expected to be debated that day. We are pretty good over 
on this side of the House but the hon. minister and this 
government expected us to come  up with informed debate as a 
result of reading the documentation of this bill in a matter of 
hours. Something is amiss in the thinking there.
<P>
	We intend to speak for the rest of Canada, the non-natives in 
this country. We intend to speak for the taxpayers in this country 
and we intend to speak for the native people in this country.
<P>
	There will be nothing more damning to this country than if 
Bill C-34 is passed and the creation of new nations operating 
outside federal-provincial jurisdictions is allowed to take place. 
There will be nothing more damning to the unity of this country.
<P>
	If you think we have a problem, Mr. Speaker, having a 
separatist party sitting in the House as the Official Opposition, 
that is nothing compared to what this will do to our country.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief. I have three brief questions that I will 
put to the member.
<P>
	He talked about speaking to the non-aboriginal people in his 
constituency. I wonder if he has spoken to aboriginal people in 
his constituency and can he tell the House what the aboriginal 
people in his constituency are saying.
<P>
	Second, in his remarks he addressed the question of not liking 
the inherent right to self-government included in the 
legislation. Does this mean that he does not believe at all in the 
inherent right to self-government in this legislation?
<P>
	Third, he uses the Constitution of Canada as a basis for most 
of his arguments in his speech today. I am wondering in terms of 
the consultative process that occurred in this country if he would 
recognize that when the constitution was written prior to 1867 
and agreed to by the parties that there were no aboriginal people 
at the table.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I have spoken to 
aboriginal people in my riding. Certainly they did tell me that 
they want the opportunity to become self-sufficient.
<P>
	This is not the way to convey self-sufficiency upon them. 
Self-sufficiency has to come from within a people. We have to 
extend to them every right and freedom that exists for every 
other Canadian, rights to education, rights to justice, rights to 
equality, the very things that are contained within our Canadian 
constitution now.
<P>
	We do not want to separate the aboriginal people with a series 
of patchwork provisions for them to establish their own nations. 
We want them to be involved in the country of Canada with 
every right and every freedom that Canadians currently enjoy.
<P>
	In answer to the member's second question regarding the term 
inherent right to self-government, a close examination of the 
term inherent right to self-government could fundamentally 
mean answerable to  no other authority as inherent right to 
self-government has always existed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5082"> 5082 </A></B>
<P>
	If we are to pass legislation in this House that would be not 
answerable to the supreme authority of the Government of 
Canada, the Constitution of Canada, the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in Canada, where are we going as a nation?
<P>
	The third question, the constitution act, of course the 
aboriginal people were not at the table. The constitution act of 
Canada was to create a nation of Canada, a nation where people 
of all races, all cultural backgrounds, all heritages can live with 
equality, opportunity and freedom. That is our constitutional 
act. People who came to this country after the constitutional act 
was created were not at the table either but those people from 
other countries who are now citizens of Canada and even 
non-citizens enjoy the fruits of that constitution act as it applies 
to aboriginal people.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada is probably the most sacred 
document that exists in this country because it provides for 
equality and freedom to all citizens of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for 
giving me the floor.
<P>
	I would like to start by telling my colleague from the Reform 
Party that, if he is going to attack the separatists, as he calls us in 
his speeches, he could at least make sure to give us a little time 
to reply.
<P>
	I have two comments. First, the term ``separatist'' does not 
exist in international law. That is why we use the word 
``sovereignty'' and its derivatives all the time. We make no 
secret of the fact that we want to become a ``sovereign'' nation. 
That is the first point I wanted to make.
<P>
	Second, the question before us-and the minister can confirm 
it because he said so himself earlier-has been under review for 
21 years, I think.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	So, Bloc members who want Quebec to become sovereign as 
well as Liberals-while holding opposite views-are capable of 
looking at this and saying: ``What the natives are requesting in 
here makes a lot of sense and after 21 years, it is about time that 
we delivered''. Let us not get sidetracked by lip service. That is 
what I wanted to get across to my colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I used the term separatist very 
clearly. It is my opinion that any person or group of people 
wanting to destroy the Confederation of this country, wanting to 
secede from this nation are indeed separatists. I will never 
retract that statement.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about 21 years of study and so it has 
to be a good document. I would like to remind this House and the 
hon. member that we studied the  creation of a nuclear bomb for 
longer than 21 years. Did that make it a good result?
<P>
	Length of time in study does not necessarily yield a fruitful 
result. I have pointed out the disparities in this bill. If the hon. 
member will take the time to go through this bill clause by 
clause, I am sure he will be inclined to agree with me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Pardon me for interrupting the debate, but I call upon your 
wisdom with regard to the use of the word ``separatist''.
<P>
	I know that we are allowed in this House to use terminology 
which may not be recognized in international law. However, I 
would like to know whether the term ``separatist'' should be 
allowed to be used to excess? More specifically, for your 
guidance in considering this point, Mr. Speaker, how can we be 
referred to as separatists when we were involved in building this 
country? Why is it that our right to consider getting out of it is 
not recognized? That is the point of order I wanted to make.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Frankly, I think the point of order was 
quite clear. As the hon. member indicated, however, I will have 
to think about it. I will get back to the House with a specific, 
precise and hopefully clear opinion shortly. Meanwhile, I 
recognize the hon. member for Okanagan Center.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honour for me this afternoon to enter into the debate on Bill 
C-34. It is a landmark piece of legislation that is being proposed 
to this House and I commend the minister for bringing forward 
legislation that deals with a very significant and serious matter 
that will affect all Canadians.
<P>
	Regardless of whether we consider the advent of the 
Europeans into the territory we now know as Canada to have 
been fair and just, since then a lot of time has passed and the 
passing of time has brought tremendous change into this country 
and in the way we relate one to another.
<P>
	Some of those changes have been cultural and today Canada is 
a multicultural country. The changes have been economic and 
today Canada is a developed nation. More significantly, the 
changes are irreversible. We cannot go back. We cannot go back 
because we must think about each of the 28 million people who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5083"> 5083 </A></B>
<P>
today call themselves Canadians, native or non-native, French 
or English, black or white.
<P>
	Any original injustice when might was right set an immutable 
course which has brought us here where the dominion of some is 
now the dominion of many. To recognize this is to recognize that 
despite history the present rests on compromise. Compromise 
means that we can acknowledge with the deepest respect both 
the indigenous peoples who gave this land its spirit and the 
dreamers and builders who later came here and created Canada, 
as it is today.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	In this House compromise comes to us in the form of Bill 
C-34 this afternoon; agreeing with which grants 
self-government to the First Nations in the Yukon territory.
<P>
	Government is right to pursue such a compromise. 
Compromise under Bill C-34 affirms the right of the Yukon 
Indians to determine how they will live culturally and 
spiritually, and that is right.
<P>
	Compromise under Bill C-34 means the Yukon First Nations 
people will determine how they will govern themselves and how 
they will determine their economic future, and that too is right.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves questions. Does Bill C-34 further the 
common good for Canada and does it respect the equal nature of 
the rights and privileges of every citizen in this country? The 
question is twofold. Does it further the common goal of Canada, 
the common good for Canada? In any situation that requires 
compromise it must seem so. Government and natives are 
carving out a way to solve a disagreement that has carried on for 
many years. Many feel, and I am inclined to agree, that this 
agreement and others like it place doubt in the value of 
nationhood, citizenship and democracy.
<P>
	Nationhood is the way we define who we are. We value 
nationhood because it gives us a strong identity and emphasizes 
that each of the citizens who make up that nation are members of 
that nation and are therefore equal.
<P>
	Bill C-34 proposes to create a nation within a nation. Why? 
What of the nationhood that already exists? What of the equality 
of those citizens who live within this nation? Creating a nation, a 
first nation, within a nation does nothing to advance the equal 
status of First Nations people with other Canadians. Instead, 
establishing a first nation creates a bias based on ethnic origin, 
something which Canada and many others have worked very 
hard to eradicate from the political practices of mankind.
<P>
	No matter in whose favour one pursues the bias, it remains a 
bias. It emphasizes what is different and makes it conspicuous 
rather than allowing our varied ethnic identities to form a tightly 
woven and colourful background that identifies us as Canadians. 
Is that good for Canada? How can it be?
<P>
	This bias breaks the link that forms nationhood, the link of 
citizenship and the relationship between an individual and his or 
her country, the implication of freedom.
<P>
	In Bill C-34 a new language has been created where words 
like nation and citizen have been redefined as they apply to 
native Canadians. By redefining these words we place doubt on 
the value of the original nation and the original citizen. This new 
language says this is my land and that is your land. It says this is 
my nation, the first nation, and that is your nation, the nation of 
Canada. It says in this nation I am a citizen of the first nation. In 
your nation you are a citizen of Canada.
<P>
	The new language erects boundaries and cuts holes in a land 
where First Nations live. Like the main sail of a ship the holes 
work to weaken and cause a greater chance for larger tears and 
cease to protect from the winds of change. Once nationhood and 
citizenship are redefined, the very pillars of democracy begin to 
crumble and that is not good for Canada.
<P>
	Does Bill C-34 respect the equal rights and privileges of 
every citizen in this country? In part I have answered that 
question in my previous remarks. Bill C-34 emphasizes an 
ethnic bias simply by acknowledging it. No other citizen in 
Canada receives rights or privileges on the basis of ethnic 
origin, although our colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois are 
seeking that very thing.
<P>
	By setting this precedent in Bill C-34 I fear that we are 
fueling the fires of those who would separate, who can now 
argue that they like the First Nations people have the right to 
special status based on their ethnic origin.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	It is further evidenced that special status does not accomplish 
what it intends. It does not strengthen, it serves to weaken. Some 
may argue that Bill C-34 gives First Nations people no more 
rights and privileges than any other Canadian. Why is it 
necessary to entrench these rights and privileges in legislation 
by naming them?
<P>
	First Nations people are citizens of Canada and as such are 
given the same rights and privileges under the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms as any other Canadian-we heard this in this 
House just a few moments ago-except for one. By creating land 
claim agreements and subsequent self-government agreements 
we give to the First Nations people something that no other 
Canadian has a right to, namely the right to own property.
<P>
	No other Canadian is allowed to realize that because it is not 
enshrined in the Constitution. By giving First Nations people 
ownership over their lands, we have now set a precedent which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5084"> 5084 </A></B>
<P>
would allow others to claim ownership for any number of other 
reasons, a certain one of which comes to mind readily.
<P>
	Is this the way we ensure that all Canadians are treated 
equally and fairly under the Constitution?-no. Does this 
respect the equal nature of the rights and privileges of every 
citizen in this country?-no. Is this the way democracy is meant 
to function?-no.
<P>
	Democracy says we all shall have a voice and that no one 
voice should be louder or stronger than any other. Democracy is 
meant to serve all, not a chosen few. Bill C-34 is a far cry from 
the agreements of long ago which placed First Nations people on 
reserves with limited lands and limited responsibilities and 
capabilities.
<P>
	In our minds such legislation should speak with more dignity 
and find a way to bring together two sides in what has been a 
long and venerable argument. For the sake of both sides it is 
important that we use the same democratic principles that form 
the foundation of any legislation in this country. If we do not, 
that legislation is weak from the start and vulnerable to failure.
<P>
	We owe it to native and to non-native Canadians to make Bill 
C-34 and any self-government legislation or land claims 
agreement sound, for if we are going to go forward we must do 
just that. The right legislation will respect all of us and will 
acknowledge the very thing that makes us the same.
<P>
	We all want a home where we are free to explore our personal 
identities and spirituality and culture, but it has never been right 
to pursue this at the cost of others. There will be a cost if in our 
haste to find a compromise we pass legislation that has the 
potential to create more division.
<P>
	In a strong, confident and democratic environment 
distinctions are valuable and positive, but in a fragmented one 
they become razor sharp, manipulated to cut here and there, to 
sever. The differences of Canada have great potential to hurt us 
if we continually uphold them at the cost of what is true, that we 
are all first and foremost citizens of Canada.
<P>
	I believe Bill C-34 is guilty of this. I believe that Bill C-34 
forgets that while it seeks to solve the past discrepancies faced 
by native Canadians, it affects all Canadians. Bill C-34, which 
provides self-government, Yukon self-government, must seek 
to reaffirm the citizenship of everyone, our nationhood, our 
confidence in democracy.
<P>
	Bill C-34 must bring an end to the beliefs that put greater 
importance on who was here first or how we came to be here 
rather than where we are now. All Canadians seek a place of 
belonging unfettered by intellectual and physical boundaries. 
All Canadians seek citizenship in its truest form in a place where 
we uphold that all people are created equal.
<P>
	Let us not jeopardize this by passing weak legislation that 
forgets our nationhood, our citizenship and democracy. Let us 
affirm this again and again above all else because this place 
exists, this country exists, and that place is Canada.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not wishing to delay the discussion at all, I will be very 
brief in my question.
<P>
	While listening to the hon. member's comments I could not 
help but think about the treatment of aboriginal people over the 
years since the settlers and the immigrants arrived on the shores 
of North America. The member is committed to the words he has 
chosen to use, the words of equality and citizenship, very 
important words for a minority but very difficult words for the 
majority.
<P>
	Could he tell us when in Canadian history these words spoken 
by non-aboriginal people came to have such strength? I think 
about the days when the treaties were being signed and the 
community leaders were being asked to participate in an 
economy that was being built in Canada. The chiefs and the 
community leaders at the time when aboriginal peoples' lands 
were being removed from them were saying to the people they 
were negotiating with that they were prepared to work in equal 
partnerships with the immigrants and the settlers, that they were 
prepared to share the resources of the land, that they were 
prepared to share what they had for 6,000 to 10,000 years with 
those new to their shores.
<P>
	Within a very brief period of time or 100 and some years in the 
country most of the sharing the aboriginal people engaged in has 
disappeared and the Reform Party and others are now saying that 
we are all equal and all live as citizens in one country, a country 
that was created to suit the needs of the immigrants and the 
settlers.
<P>
	Could the member tell me at what point in our history the 
words changed from those being spoken by the chiefs and 
community leaders to those now being spoken by immigrant 
representatives?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question.
<P>
	We have to be very careful how we deal with a subject that far 
reaching which affects virtually every Canadian as I indicated in 
my remarks: Indian, non-Indian, native, aboriginal or 
whomever.
<P>
	The concept of democracy, the concept of freedom, the 
concept of equality and the concept of being a citizen of a nation 
are very fundamental. I in no way want to suggest to the member 
or to anyone listening to the debate this afternoon that 
everything was always right in the past. Indeed it was not. There 
were many times in the history of Canada where we treated one 
another very poorly, where we did not treat one another equally, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5085"> 5085 </A></B>
<P>
where we did not give the kinds of rights we should have given 
and where we did indeed deny people certain rights because of 
their ethnic or other backgrounds.
<P>
	That does not make me proud. The fact remains that we are at 
a point in history today where we can rectify some of those 
things, but let us not rectify them in such a way that would create 
new inequalities and would deny the very things we want to 
rectify. Let us create strong legislation. In no way do I disparage 
the direction in which the legislation is headed or the spirit that I 
think is intended in it. That is not my concern.
<P>
	My concern is that we create a Canada where Canadians of 
whatever description, no matter where they live in the country, 
no matter whether they came here as immigrants or were born 
here, are Canadian citizens, are equal and do not have particular 
rights because of a particular ethnicity, language, religion or 
anything else. That to me is key. If the legislation can be 
improved to reflect that, I am completely in favour of it.
<P>
	I am suggesting there are unanswered questions in the 
legislation. It does not give the kind of equality I stand for and 
the freedom I want to promote.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on that 
question of the NDP member because I do not think it was 
answered.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about equality and citizenry. The 
people we are talking about had been there for 10,000 years. 
They were citizens. They had their own laws. They had a 
religion which we took away. They had customs which we took 
away. They had a system in place.
<P>
	When the non-aboriginals came to the area, as has been 
expressed by others in the House, they came with a certain 
amount of avarice in their hearts. They wanted to take the land, 
the mines and the lumber, and they did.
<P>
	Now we have a situation where we have the wealth and they 
have the poverty. That is the situation. We have before us 21 
years of negotiations drawing aboriginal people back into the 
process honourably with a lot of transparent and open 
negotiation, bringing them back to sharing resources with us, 
which was the original intent.
<P>
	Where specifically does the hon. member think the legislation 
falls short?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, in part I believe the shortfall 
comes in the new language that has been created. Somehow we 
now have two kinds of nations; we have two kinds of citizens. If 
we think the relationship will be changed simply by writing new 
words it is false. Nation means something to me that is somehow 
separate from other nations. It creates a difference. I do not 
think it is possible to have two kinds of nations within a nation, 
and that is what has been created.
<P>
	We have used the terms nations and First Nations. We have 
used the term nation. We have citizens. That is where the 
confusion lies. If that could be clarified so that a citizen of a first 
nation is like a resident of Alberta or a resident of British 
Columbia, if that is what is meant, why would we use a new kind 
of language? This is  confusing. It needs to be clarified. It needs 
to be recognized that they are equal people who share the same 
kind of rights and privileges the rest of us share; nothing special 
or nothing denigrating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
introducing the bill the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development has urged the House and pressed for ``the speedy 
passage of this important piece of historic legislation''. I simply 
cannot understand why the government is attempting to ram the 
legislation through the House in the same manner as the 
Conservatives did in 1993 with similar legislation regarding the 
Nunavut deal, Bill C-132.
<P>
	The minister has stated it has taken 20 years to formulate the 
legislation and the last few months to draft the agreements. 
Again I cannot understand the logic of rushing through 
legislation in a matter of days when it has taken us years to get 
this far. It begs the question: Is there another or what is the real 
government agenda? When this agreement which took 20 years 
to evolve is now being pushed through the House, we have to ask 
what is the rush.
<P>
	Bill C-34 represents only four agreements of a possible 
fourteen. These future agreements will be negotiated behind 
closed doors if the bill passes. No doubt we can expect more 
Yukon bills to be pushed through the House.
<P>
	Where is the new style of government the Liberals promised 
in the red book? For example, section 52 allows the other land 
claim agreements to be ratified by cabinet rather than by 
Parliament. Again it means it will be behind closed doors, not in 
the House as we are doing today. It means Parliament will no 
longer be involved. Again where will it be? It will be behind 
closed doors. So much for the open government promised by the 
Liberals. I expect they have to read their red book with rose 
coloured glasses so that only the parts they can deliver show 
through.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Another area I would like to touch on is the issue of 
constitutional recognition. In section 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982, there is provision on native rights stating that existing 
treaty and aboriginal rights are recognized and affirmed. Yet 
there is no definition of native rights other than to say they are 
defined as rights in present and future land claim agreements.
<P>
	The fact that these extremely vague rights are supposedly 
affirmed by the Constitution brings into question how readily 
and easily these rights can be changed. How could these rights 
be constitutionally entrenched when they are so vague that they 
can easily be altered at the whim of each new government or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5086"> 5086 </A></B>
<P>
cabinet? The definition of constitutional entrenchment is loose, 
to say the very least.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that there are many problems in 
the definition of a native citizen as established in the bill. The 
bill sets out that the definition of native citizens is determined 
by the constitution of First Nations. In so doing the agreement 
provides for a completely separate level of citizenship distinct 
from that of non-native Canadians.
<P>
	It appears the government is setting up a two-tier system with 
two levels of citizens and two nations. At a time when the rest of 
the world is striving toward equality as evidenced by what we 
saw in South Africa, the government is trying to establish a 
two-class system based on race.
<P>
	It appears the Prime Minister has forgotten his days as Indian 
affairs minister. His so-called progressive report of 1969 
proposed that Indian citizens should become equal citizens of 
the provinces and of the country. Now his government is 
proposing to relegate natives to a separate status from those of 
other Canadians.
<P>
	As Indian affairs minister the Prime Minister wrote a report 
which argued for ``the fundamental right of Indian people to full 
and equal participation in the cultural, social, economic and 
political life of Canada. To argue against this right is to argue for 
discrimination, isolation and separation. No Canadian should be 
excluded from participation in community life and none should 
expect to withdraw and enjoy the benefits that flow from those 
who participate''. That was considered to be progressive in 
1969. Compared to the implications of this agreement, I would 
say it still remains progressive, with the current proposed 
legislation regressive.
<P>
	This agreement does not guarantee full and equal 
participation in Canada. Far from it. It sets up an entirely 
separate regime. The Prime Minister talked about ending the 
legal distinction between natives and other Canadians with a 
movement toward equality of all Canadians. Now his party 
affirms ethnic and racial distinctions. This is a step backwards. 
Our native people should be equals in every respect as should all 
Canadians. Racial distinctions are no longer justified or 
tolerated in today's society. It is clearly the wrong way to go.
<P>
	The treatment of our native people to this point has been 
unequal in many respects. They have been subject to 
inequalities based on race. To remedy the situation by 
legislating more equality does not make good sense.
<P>
	The agreement would affirm and strengthen racial 
inequalities by establishing a two-tier system, by setting up 
another level of citizens separate from other Canadians. How 
could the government justify the obvious unequal treatment 
which the bill will create? We simply cannot allow the 
legislation to pass in its present form.
<P>
	The fight for discrimination has gone on for centuries. In the 
18th century William Wilberforce, as an MP in the British 
House of Commons, fought to free the slaves. On another front 
we have witnessed our American neighbours struggle through 
the civil rights movement.  We have all witnessed the downfall 
of the two-tiered system in South Africa.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Systems based on racial inequalities are wrong and history 
has shown that they do not and cannot stand up to the test of 
time. Why is the government trying to set up these same barriers 
in Bill C-34 by establishing two levels of citizenship?
<P>
	This agreement sets up two separate and distinct societies 
within the boundaries of Canada. In addition, this system sets up 
a bureaucratic nightmare in the territory of Yukon. At present 
Yukon has two levels of government, federal and territorial.
<P>
	This agreement opens the way for another possible four levels 
of government with ten more to follow when the ten native 
bands are dealt with. This means Yukon could be subject to 
many varying law-making bodies.
<P>
	Curiously, according to the present Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
would apply to native self-government. Yet the justice minister 
of the same government has suggested that the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms will not apply. Who are we to believe? There is no 
requirement in this agreement that laws will be subject to the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	When the Charlottetown accord was drafted, it included 20 
provisions for native people. An amendment to the Canadian 
charter was proposed that would apply to laws made by 
Canadian people. This clause said that the charter should not 
diminish any rights or freedoms relating to the exercise or 
protection of the languages, cultures and traditions of native 
people.
<P>
	There was another clause in the Charlottetown accord that 
clarified that the equality of native men and women would apply 
to all respects of native rights, including the right to 
self-government. I question that any such rights will extend to 
native women in this agreement. Will the rights of native 
women, the rights which native women demanded to have 
protected in the October 26 referendum be protected in this 
agreement? It certainly does not appear so.
<P>
	The minister of Indian affairs claims that the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms will apply to natives. If this is so, why did 
the previous government find it necessary to include such 
provisions if the charter already applies? The answer is that if 
the charter is not included in this bill then it does not apply. As it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5087"> 5087 </A></B>
<P>
is not mentioned, I suggest it does not apply to native 
self-government.
<P>
	Let me recount some history for hon. members. In 1982 the 
Assembly of First Nations when appearing before the 
parliamentary committee on aboriginal affairs said that: ``As 
Indian people we cannot afford to have individual rights 
override collective rights. The Canadian charter of rights is in 
conflict with our philosophy and our culture''.
<P>
	In 1992 the Assembly of First Nations published a report 
which rejected the charter of rights. This report recommended: 
``that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms shall not 
override First Nations' law''. Does this philosophy still stand? 
Is it the intent of Bill C-34? Will the Canadian charter of rights 
apply to native people? If not, this concerns me and will be of 
great concern to many Canadians.
<P>
	Perhaps members will remember that many women's groups, 
particularly the Native Women's Association of Canada insisted 
that native self-government without the protection of the 
charter would be dangerous for native women, stating that 
violence against women on reserves was widespread.
<P>
	The 1989 Ontario Native Women's Association report stated 
that while one in every ten Canadian women have experienced 
some form of abuse, eight out of ten native women have been 
abused or assaulted or can expect to be abused or assaulted.
<P>
	Section 28 of the charter guarantees protection of sexual 
equality. Yet all native councils would be shielded from charter 
protection of guaranteed sexual equality. There is nothing in this 
agreement to guarantee that the rights of sexual equality will be 
protected. This concerns me as I am sure it concerns many 
native women.
<P>
	Our Charter of Rights and Freedoms may not be perfect but it 
is one way in which the individual rights of each and every 
Canadian are protected. To deny any citizen of Canada, in 
particular native women, protection under the charter is not only 
negligent but deeply unjust.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to 
federal and provincial levels of government. However there is 
nothing in the charter that would make it apply to native 
self-government. The democratic rights section of the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms gives all Canadians the right to elect 
people to the federal government or legislative assemblies or to 
run for office. There is no provision in this bill to protect the 
democratic rights of native citizens as this level of government 
is not covered in the charter.
<P>
	There is no guarantee under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms that native people have the right to vote for native 
governments, run for native office or to limit the terms of native 
government. These are concerns that were raised only two years 
ago.
<P>
	There is nothing in this agreement which addresses these 
concerns and until this aspect is included in Bill C-34 it should 
not be passed.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill goes well beyond giving natives the 
right to govern their own affairs in a manner similar to what is 
presently being done by municipal governments. With its all 
encompassing law-making powers it sets up a separate nation 
within the nation of Canada, a nation subject to laws and powers 
and outside the protection of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.
<P>
	We are already experiencing separatist threats that originated 
from treating one group of Canadians differently from another. 
If Bill C-34 goes through in its present form we are setting the 
stage for even more discontent. There is room for only one 
nation in Canada, a nation where all Canadians are treated 
equally and respected by all.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> I have a question for the hon. member.
<P>
	He used words like ``ramming, listening and a new style of 
government'' which I suppose means more consultation and 
more listening. It is my information that the CYI, the leadership 
headed up by Mrs. Judy Gingell, were here for a week and a half 
up to second reading trying to arrange meetings with the Reform 
Party without success. There were no meetings until after 
second reading.
<P>
	In this broad consultation and this ramming and secret 
agendas that the hon. member has talked about, has he talked to 
any of the First Nations of the Yukon personally?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister just makes my point. 
We did not get the information until Thursday morning and the 
bill was due to be responded to on Friday. We had absolutely no 
lead time.
<P>
	I find it rather curious that the native bands were here a week 
ahead of that time and yet the Reform Party was not advised of 
the agenda of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for giving me a chance to comment and to question the member 
who just spoke.
<P>
	As the Minister of Indian Affairs said, after 21 years of 
consultation, after 21 years of thinking and talks between the 
government and native organizations, especially in the Yukon, it 
is time to act.
<P>
	I must congratulate the government on reaching a conclusion 
in its present term for good relations between the government 
and native communities. I believe that the First Nations, the 
native people, including those in the Yukon, want and demand 
their full autonomy so that they can take on more responsibility 
themselves. Unfortunately, Canadians often say that natives live 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5088"> 5088 </A></B>
<P>
at the expense of whites. I think that the native community in the 
Yukon is very advanced because today it is ready to become 
more independent and to take over some of its responsibilities 
and autonomy.
<P>
	Also, I think that the self-government which the natives 
demand will enable them to develop their resources properly 
and keep their customs.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In my riding, Charlevoix in Quebec, I have two native 
communities, inhabited by Montagnais, and as the member for 
Charlevoix, I must defend these communities as I defend all my 
constituents. Besides, my oldest child is a Montagnais boy 
whom we adopted. He will be twelve on July 10 and I consider 
him as much as the two children we had later.
<P>
	I think that the native community in the Yukon is calling for 
more dialogue between their communities and the government 
because they want to share their ideas. In closing, I want to 
commend the native community of the Yukon for claiming its 
rights and being heard by the government. I also congratulate it 
on taking charge of its economic development.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party member who preceded me think it 
possible that the Yukon natives are more advanced than the 
Reform Party?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> When speaking of evolution I guess we could 
go back a long way. However it is very clear and I pointed it out 
in my speech that equality and the evolution of equality can only 
go one direction. We have to be equal, all of us, whether we are 
from Quebec, from Yukon, from other parts of Canada.
<P>
	That was the key point to my speech and if that is part of 
evolution that is exactly what I would like to see evolve in the 
bill because the bill does not speak to it now and it should not be 
passed in its present form.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A while ago, I promised as Speaker to 
render a decision on the issue of the word ``separatist'' raised by 
the hon. member for Gaspé. The word ``separatist'' is found on 
page 148 of the 6th edition of <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules 
&amp; Forms</I>. It is considered parliamentary. I quote: ``Since 1958, 
it has been ruled parliamentary to use the following 
expressions-'' and the word ``separatist'' is among them, as I 
said.
<P>
	Nearly 30 years ago, in 1964, Speaker McNaughton said: 
``These questions are, of course, not easy to answer. I would say 
that the word used was rude; but in my opinion it was not 
unparliamentary''. He was talking about the word ``separatist''. 
Later, Speaker Sauvé said this about ``separatist'' and 
``McCarthyism'' on December 9, 1980: ``Whether one approves 
of the connotations or not, the words ``McCarthyism'' and 
``separatism'' have become part of the political vocabulary and 
therefore their applicability is a matter of interpretation and 
debate in which the Chair has no role''.
<P>
	I fully realize that hon. members will say that the usages of 
international law were not the same as those in Parliament. For 
now, it seems that such is the rule in our legislature.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
make it clear that I do not question your ruling on this subject. I 
think it was good for the whole House that this issue was raised. 
I note that the debate has been going on longer than we think. 
You mentioned 1958. The Speaker at that time said it was 
``rude''.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The last thing I would like to say for our listeners and hon. 
members is that if he wants to use the word ``separatist'', it has 
an emotional connotation; if he wants to speak objectively, the 
recognized term in international law is ``sovereigntist''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin by thanking the hon. minister for being present during the 
debate on this bill. It is good that the sponsor of a bill is present, 
particularly during a debate in which contentious issues are 
involved. I want to thank him for being here.
<P>
	I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate 
on Bill C-34 which is the Yukon self-government bill. As do 
many of my colleagues, I have a particular interest in this 
proposed legislation. During my life and my career I have had an 
opportunity to work directly with native people in a number of 
different areas.
<P>
	As a labour foreman on a hydro electric project in the 
territories, as an ombudsman for the Alberta region of the 
department of Indian affairs under Harold Cardinal and as a 
business consultant I have seen the problems of these people 
firsthand and I have spoken with them. I have lived some of the 
problems that they experience. I have experienced directly the 
discrimination that they have experienced, particularly the 
discrimination that has been levelled at them through the 
interpretation and the enactment of the Indian act along with the 
changes that have occurred to that act from time to time over the 
years.
<P>
	Therefore what I say today, I speak at least in part from my 
experience and empathy for the plight of these people. The Dog 
Rib Indians of the territories I found were some of the hardest 
working and capable individuals I have ever worked with. They 
were more than willing to work under adverse conditions of 
weather and isolation when the jobs were available. However, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5089"> 5089 </A></B>
<P>
the opportunity to work was not always there. When this occurs, 
these willing and capable people go unemployed.
<P>
	I was appointed ombudsman for the province of Alberta under 
the direction of Harold Cardinal who was a regional director 
general for the department of Indian affairs for a period of time. 
Mr. Cardinal was a prominent leader in Canada and president of 
the Alberta Indian Association for a number of years.
<P>
	It was under his leadership that what is known in the Indian 
communities today as the red paper was developed as a direct 
result of the white paper of the Prime Minister when he was a 
department of Indian affairs minister. It wanted to assimilate the 
Indian people into Canadian society and wanted to eliminate 
their reserve lands.
<P>
	Grand Chief Norman Yellowbird, a friend and associate of 
mine, delivered that red paper developed by the Indian 
Association of Alberta to the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, at 
the time.
<P>
	I have had a close look at some of the problems and some of 
the challenges faced by Indian people and I have heard directly 
from them their concerns and their viewpoints on these 
problems.
<P>
	As a consultant I have received many complaints from band 
members accusing their band leaders of corruption and 
expending funds improperly. Those same complaints have been 
brought to my attention since I have become a member of 
Parliament. The department of Indian affairs seldom, if ever, 
looks into those complaints. It has not looked into them before 
and the feedback I am getting from some of my aboriginal 
associates indicates that they are not being looked into today.
<P>
	Instead, the department apparently chooses to ignore the 
concerns of the aboriginal people at the grassroots level and 
proceed with negotiation self-government arguments with some 
of the same council leaders who have been accused of fraudulent 
and suspect practices. I am not suggesting for a moment that 
involves the leaders who were involved in this agreement.
<P>
	I point out the trials and tribulations faced by many Indian 
people at the grassroots level that have come to my attention 
through my experience with them.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I, like many Canadians, want to see Canada's aboriginal 
peoples given every reasonable opportunity to become 
economically and politically independent. I want to see their 
dignity restored by ending the cycle of dependency that has 
become so customary within aboriginal communities.
<P>
	It is no secret that the aboriginal population is among the most 
disadvantaged of all Canadians. Life expectancy is about eight 
years shorter than average. Death by suicide is about two and a 
half times more common and the unemployment rates are 
several times the Canadian average.
<P>
	I do not believe that Bill C-34, Yukon self-government, is the 
answer to the numerous problems plaguing aboriginal peoples 
and particularly if that is to become  the model for the other 
settlements, claims and requests for self-government that are 
being made by so many of the bands across the country. I am not 
confident that the aboriginal people will not be subjected by a 
new form of government under their council leaders to an 
autocratic form of government that will deny them the rights 
they now receive under the protection of the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	I believe a gradual and progressive approach must be taken to 
ease the dependency of the aboriginal people and to provide 
them with the opportunity to fully understand the terms and 
implications of self-government.
<P>
	During the Charlottetown accord I spoke to many of my 
aboriginal friends and I asked them what they thought about 
that. Of course they disagreed and they voted against the 
Charlottetown accord because they did not feel that they were 
included. They did not understand many of the provisions. There 
was not the dialogue that I think is necessary when we get into 
these kinds of negotiations. It must be suitable and understood 
by the grassroots people.
<P>
	I would recommend and support a movement toward 
autonomy which could be initiated with self-determination that 
institutes possession and control of their land. I agree with that. 
I do not support or accept Bill C-34 to establish 
self-government for the Yukon First Nation.
<P>
	The concept of self-government is too vague in this document 
and there are no real specifics that provide a definitive meaning 
to this term. I cannot support self-government until the term is 
clearly and emphatically defined so the aboriginal people 
understand, so Canadians understand and so there are no 
misconceptions about the type of agreement the federal 
government is entering into.
<P>
	Right now there are too many questions unanswered, too 
many terms undefined and too many <I>t</I>s not crossed and too many 
<I>i</I>s not dotted.
<P>
	What does self-government mean? Self-government is a 
phrase whose history predates its application to aboriginal 
governments in Canada. The British used the term when they 
arrived at the conclusion that one of their colonies was ready for 
autonomy. Aboriginal self-government has been the subject of 
many definitions in Canada. We have heard it from many 
politicians in the past. Some have defined it as being more or 
less municipal government covering the relative autonomous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5090"> 5090 </A></B>
<P>
administration of programs and services that find their roots in 
the authority of the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Alternately, self-government has been envisioned by many 
aboriginal people as a creature of aboriginal authority, of the 
legitimate authority of distinct aboriginal peoples to make their 
laws, to sign their institutions and govern themselves as they see 
fit.
<P>
	One aboriginal author writes: ``The right to self-government 
goes much beyond entitlement to practice our own culture, 
traditional customs, religion and languages or the right to 
determine the development of our own identity. It includes 
constitutionally protected powers over our lives, our lands and 
our resources, as well as the right to determine the nature of our 
ongoing relationship with the federal and provincial 
governments in Canada''.
<P>
	Not only is there divergent views of what self-government 
means between the federal government and the aboriginal 
people, the comments of Howard Adams, an aboriginal person 
and university professor of native studies, lead me to believe 
that this term may vary between the aboriginal leaders 
themselves and what he calls the rank and file aboriginal people.
<P>
	This is not unlike the Canadian situation in which the people 
of Canada have one definition of democracy and the government 
has another. I think we all know and have witnessed what 
happens when those in power allow their views to supersede the 
views of their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	In an article published in the Native Studies Review in 1992 
Mr. Adams says, referring to the Charlottetown referendum: 
``The negotiations on the constitution were not relevant or 
meaningful to the rank and file of aboriginal people. For these 
people it was an unknown and an unheard of matter because the 
negotiations involved only a few elite leaders and their 
organizations''.
<P>
	As one of my colleagues has mentioned many of the 
aboriginal women's groups from across the country have 
expressed concern about the protection that might have been lost 
under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had the constitutional 
accord been passed.
<P>
	Mr. Adams states that from his experience in speaking at 
remote Metis and Indian communities he learned: ``These 
distant people had absolutely no knowledge about the 
Constitution and the negotiations. Consequently they had no 
concern or involvement whatsoever''.
<P>
	I am concerned that this is still true today. I am concerned that 
the aboriginal people, those at the grassroots, do not understand 
nor are they aware of the agreements their band leaders are 
negotiating on their behalf. There has been no indication that 
this has occurred in this particular agreement.
<P>
	The details of what self-government will mean to them or the 
powers they may be subjected to have not been explained and 
therefore they have not had the opportunity to decide if self- 
government is what they  want. This is referring back to the 
constitutional discussions.
<P>
	Mr. Adams also believes that during the constitutional talks 
the leaders involved did not really understand what was 
transpiring: ``It was continuous confusion and vagueness due to 
lack of clarity in terminology and concepts such as 
self-government''.
<P>
	Again, how can we be sure that the council leaders were fully 
aware of what they were signing and particularly the long term 
consequences?
<P>
	An October 25, 1991 article in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> reports: 
``Canada's aboriginal people are front and centre in the debate 
over the Constitution. Their demands for constitutional 
recognition, self-government and land claims played a major 
role in blocking changes that would have allowed Quebec to sign 
the Constitution''.
<P>
	Mr. Adams states that the negotiations were nothing more 
than staged media events that provided an opportunity for the 
previous government to improve its so-called human rights 
concerns for aboriginal people and to help take the focus off the 
threat of Quebec's cession.
<P>
	Further, he believes for the self-government negotiations to 
have produced an authentic agreement there should have been 
greater participation by the masses in which the indigenous 
ideas and perspectives would have emerged.
<P>
	Nothing in Bill C-34 leads me to believe that the government 
is any further ahead in defining the term self-government, that 
the agreement is a genuine reflection of what aboriginal people 
want and that the motives for entering the agreement are strictly 
legitimate.
<P>
	According to an article on March 29, 1994 in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> the federal government has spent more than $50 million on 
self-government negotiations with native groups over the past 
seven years, yet it has produced only one agreement: ``About 
400 native communities have entered self-government talks but 
most have abandoned the process because it is long, 
bureaucratic, limited and legalistic''. This according to the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> was the finding of a federal audit.
<P>
	The audit apparently described a host of weaknesses in the 
federal policy for negotiating self-government deals at the 
community level and concluded that the process is long, 
cumbersome and expensive.
<P>
	Federal payments to native groups for the negotiations have 
jumped by 500 per cent since the process began in the 1986-87 
fiscal year. The department of Indian affairs has given $30 
million to aboriginal groups for the talks and has spent a further 
$20 million on internal operating costs. The department has 
spent $50 million creating a cottage industry around these 
negotiations in which lawyers and political leaders are the only 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5091"> 5091 </A></B>
<P>
ones who have benefited while the deplorable living conditions 
of the  individual aboriginal person have not changed as a result 
of the expenditure of these funds.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member still has time in his speech. 
We will take up the speech and the questions and comments after

<P>
	The North American Waterfowl Management Plan, originally

<P>
	Without this form of conservation, wildlife depending on

participating in the reopening of the Stoney Creek Battle Field 
Monument. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations 
to the Preserve the Monument Committee and to the community 
of Stoney Creek for having undertaken this project.
<P>
	The monument is located on the very site where the Battle of 
Stoney Creek took place on June 6, 1813. It is particularly fitting 
that this week, while we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of 
D-Day, we pause and reflect on the sacrifices made by the 
Loyalist soldiers in the war of 1812. Some paid the ultimate 
price but in doing so they helped to ensure that Canada would be

<P>
	The transportation industry is a major contributor to the 
nation's economy, whatever region of the country you come 
from. Employment, jobs, salaries, wages and export sales are 
among the direct benefits.
<P>
	Transportation serves a variety of functions. It extends 
Canadian sovereignty over an immense country, it provides 
links between regions and markets, and connects small remote 
communities to larger centres.
<P>
	In the final analysis, transportation today is about moving 
people and goods efficiently and reliably. The theme of National 
Transportation Week, as announced by the Minister of 
Transport, is ``Inter-modalism: The perfect fit''. This theme and 
the week's activities complement the regulatory and policy 
initiatives government and industry are taking to promote 
smoothly interlocking transportation services.
<P>
	The government believes that modern, improved, intermodal 
transportation systems will contribute to the long term 
economic growth by enabling Canadians to receive supplies and 
deliver goods to markets quickly and at a competitive cost.

comment on the debate held on the proposed spending outlined

<P>
	Since 1969 Parliament's annual review of the main estimates 
has resulted in a pathetic total reduction of only one-millionth 
of one per cent of the proposed expenditures that governments 
have submitted to Parliament for its approval.
<P>
	I would hope that my colleagues would reconsider their 
traditional practice of rubber stamping the government's main 
estimates. Yesterday the House authorized the government to 
spend $160.3 billion and will add another $39.7 billion to the 
national debt, without even considering modest spending 
reductions.

	Yet on Tuesday of this week the constitutional issue was back

touch of irony that the party that promised to make deficit 
reduction its top priority and swore not to talk about the 
Constitution, should be the perpetrator of such a divisive debate.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in Paris when he was attending the OECD conference 
on manpower, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
apparently said that his action plan was not ready yet and would 
be released in six weeks, in other words, not until the middle of 
July, although it was originally to be released at the end of April.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that his action plan is still not ready 
and that it will not be released until mid-July, in the middle of 
the summer, safe from public scrutiny, very discreetly, so that 
Parliament cannot discuss it before the summer recess?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I can assure the hon. 
member that my visit was more productive than the visit of the 
Leader of the Opposition, as far as Canadians are concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can say to him very clearly that the approach that we have 
been pursuing in terms of looking at the broad range of programs 
that can improve employment opportunities for Canadians was 
one that was broadly and strongly endorsed by all the other 
member countries of the OECD. This shows that we are on the 
right track and the hon. Leader of the Opposition is on the wrong 
track.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister feels his trip was productive since he 
managed to obtain the approval of other ministers from all over 
the world for his action plan. I suggest that he first obtain the 
approval of the provincial ministers in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister whether he can also confirm 
that as yet, no date has been set for a federal-provincial 
conference of social security ministers. Are we to understand he 
has given up his plans for a federal-provincial conference 
before the fall?
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic  
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the decision on our proposals is 
not under the ownership of any government, foreign or 
domestic. It is the ownership of the Canadian people who will 
make that decision. They will decide by open, transparent, 
honest debate and consultation over the next several months.
<P>
	We have committed and promised full discussion with the 
provinces, full discussion with the Canadian people and full 
discussion with all the major stakeholders. That is our 
commitment and we will live up to it.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the only group of people in this country 
which is opposing this attempt to reform what we are doing is 
the Bloc Quebecois and we know the reason why.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously this minister is a great democrat. He has now 
committed to having an open, vigorous public debate in 
mid-July. This is the kind of democracy we have.
<P>
	From here I can see citizens all over Canada in their cottages 
close to the lakes discussing and arguing hotly the minister's 
plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Aside from his official optimism, will the minister admit that 
by insisting on imposing his views on people and provincial 
governments that do not want his action plan, he is actually 
sabotaging his own reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Leader of 
the Opposition does not plan to work this summer and is going to 
spend all his time at the cottage beside the lake, but we will work 
all summer to make sure that we get a proper plan through. That 
is our commitment.
<P>
	I hope that in a sign of goodwill and charity the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition will return his salary for the two or three months 
he is taking off in the summer period because clearly he is not 
intending to work the way we are along with the rest of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I do not think the Leader of the Opposition understands what 
has been going on. I do not think he has any notion or interest in 
an attempt to bring about a clear, step by step approach which is 
now being considered by cabinet, that will be put forward 
publicly and that will result in major public consultations over 
the fall by all Canadians involved. That is the plan and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5096"> 5096 </A></B>
<P>
commitment that we have had. The only people who have been 
standing in the way of that have been the Leader of the 
Opposition and his members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. In his speech to the OECD on Tuesday in Paris, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development promised to 
build a new program aimed at putting Canadians back to 
work-a new program-while guaranteeing income security for 
those who need it.
<P>
	Since his statement is completely at odds with what the 
government has done about job creation, which so far has been 
limited to temporary jobs under the infrastructures program, are 
we to conclude from the minister's speech that the government 
will at last implement a pro-active job creation policy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the OECD there was a report 
tabled that was the product of two years of work and endorsed by 
all the countries involved which said that many of the traditional 
elements of development for jobs now must be sort of 
complemented or supplemented by major efforts to deal with the 
problem of structural unemployment. It is a condition faced by 
all countries.
<P>
	What we are saying and what I said is that the initiatives that 
we are taking to make major changes in the way that we give 
assistance to people to find new employment, to substantially 
support and strengthen our training and education programs, to 
give new opportunities for work, and to deal with the problems 
of young people as we provide in the youth employment 
strategy, is the beginning of that recreation. We will continue to 
do it through the judgment and negotiations during the process.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	The two have to go hand in hand. We have to stimulate the 
economy which is what we are doing through the infrastructure 
program. We have to put in place major elements of restructure 
in the economy as the Minister of Finance laid out in his budget. 
We must also make a fundamental redesign of our human 
resource policies. It is all part of a broad strategy and that is 
what we intend to do.
<P>
	It is too bad the hon. member is incapable of understanding 
how important it is that we work together to achieve that goal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
conclude that the government's job creation policy, inspired or 
not by the OECD, basically consists in cutting social benefits, as 
in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Program, in order to 
force the unemployed to look for non-existent jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic  
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, by that question it is obvious the 
hon. member has not read the OECD report. I would think that 
before anyone asks a question they should find out. I know the 
hon. member does not want to get too confused by the facts, but 
in this case it would have been very important to have read the 
report before asking the question.
<P>
	That is not what the OECD said. It said we have to make major 
changes in labour market policy and social policy to lead to a 
more active emphasis on job development, job creation and 
employment services. That is the basic thrust of the report.
<P>
	I will be very happy to send a copy to the hon. member so she 
can get up to speed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSPORTSUBSIDIES">TRANSPORT SUBSIDIES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	Yesterday rather surprisingly the transportation minister 
apparently told the media that next summer the government will 
stop paying subsidies to the railways that defray the cost of 
shipping grain to Vancouver and Thunder Bay. In the 1993-94 
year these subsidies amounted to almost $650 million.
<P>
	This is something which Reformers have advocated for years 
as part of a comprehensive, well thought out agricultural reform 
package. Yet until yesterday western farmers had not heard 
anything of this from the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	What role did the agriculture department play in this decision 
and what policies and plans does the minister have to prepare the 
grains industry to adjust to this dramatic change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Transport 
clearly indicated his view that over time the government will be 
rethinking its role in direct subsidies in transportation in light of 
Canada's international trading obligations and with an aim to 
ensuring competitive and efficient transportation systems in 
Canada.
<P>
	I have indicated time and time again in this House that a 
number of processes are under way to consult broadly with all of 
the stakeholders in the western grain transportation system to 
deal with the possibility of reform in the system. One of those 
processes is a study on transportation efficiencies being 
conducted by the Grain Transportation Agency. The report on 
that study has been received and it is being reviewed internally. 
Another study is being conducted by a group called the Producer 
Payment Panel dealing with the method of payment with respect 
to the Crow benefit under the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5097"> 5097 </A></B>
<P>
	I expect to have a final report from the Producer Payment 
Panel some time in the month of June or perhaps early July. We 
will take all of that input into account as we make decisions in 
the future. I have indicated very clearly that all of these various 
reports and studies would be the subject of further consultations 
with farmers and farm organizations across western Canada in 
particular but with all those in the country who have an interest 
before the government makes any decision. No final decision 
has yet been taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, frankly the minister's definition of over time and what 
we heard in the media report from the Minister of Transport is 
quite different in the view of most Canadians. He is talking 
about July 1995 which is a very short time, almost shorter than 
the time the minister took to answer that question.
<P>
	As the minister knows Reformers advocate consolidating a 
dozen existing agriculture support programs into three. We then 
propose redirecting some of the savings toward deficit reduction 
and redirecting subsidies under GRIP and the Western Grain 
Transportation Act to a trade distortion adjustment program, an 
expanded whole farm NISA stabilization account and a 
strengthened crop insurance plan.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Would he tell the House how 
much of the $650 million subsidy to the railways will be 
directed to some new or existing safety net program and how 
much will be redirected to deficit reduction or to something 
else?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is inviting me to 
pre-empt the consultative process which has been under way for 
a number of months across Canada. Obviously I am not inclined 
to do that because I want to see the advice before I make any 
decisions.
<P>
	With respect to the timeframe issues to which the member 
referred, the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is 
scheduled to come into effect at some point in 1995. We suspect 
it will be July 1, but there is still some discussion among GATT 
countries about what the precise implementation date will be.
<P>
	Once GATT comes into effect it requires certain disciplines 
upon subsidies to be implemented gradually over a five or six 
year period. The timeframe being referred to by the hon. 
gentleman, between now and 1995, is obviously the timeframe 
before the GATT comes into effect. Once the GATT comes into 
effect there is a phase-in period for any change that stretches 
over a following period of at least six years.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am quite confident all hon. members will be 
anxious to make their questions and answers as precise as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is June 1994 and July 1995 is very close.  By the 
time the minister is done consulting, the transportation minister 
will have implemented the changes.
<P>
	If this change to the subsidization of grain transportation had 
been made when agricultural reformers in the west had first 
advocated it instead of waiting until we were forced to make 
these changes by a GATT agreement, Canadian farmers would 
have had a much better chance to adjust. This is part of the price 
that prairie farmers are paying for a Liberal government that is 
playing catch-up ball instead of getting ahead of the game.
<P>
	What is the government's plan and timetable for enabling 
western grain producers to adjust quickly to market based 
freight rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may not have 
noticed but the period of time since the original passage of the 
Western Grain Transportation Act in 1984, I believe, until 
November 4, 1993 was occupied by a different government of 
Canada. If he is concerned about delay during that period of time 
perhaps he should exercise his questions elsewhere.
<P>
	With respect to the process I now have under way, I indicated 
within days of assuming my responsibility as minister of 
agriculture-and certainly during the throne speech debate back 
in January, in other speeches in the House and in addresses I 
have given to farm organizations from one end of the country to 
the other-that the government has a very active agenda in 
terms of developing the competitiveness, profitability and 
future success of Canadian agriculture.
<P>
	We have laid out that agenda very clearly. The hon. member 
will see in the weeks and months ahead a very vigorous agenda 
on the part of the government in dealing with the pressing issues 
confronting Canadian farmers.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
backgrounder to the budget concerning proposed changes to the

Minister of Human Resources Development will present an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5098"> 5098 </A></B>
<P>
action plan for reform in April, and the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development will soon begin public 
hearings, culminating in a report to Parliament in the fall. New 
legislation will be introduced before the end of 1994''.
<P>
	Considering the delay in releasing his action plan and fierce 
opposition from the provinces to his social security reform, does 
the Minister of Human Resources Development still intend to 
table changes in the legislation before the end of 1994, as he 
promised when the budget was brought down?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I confess I do not share the same 
crystal ball as the hon. member.
<P>
	He talks about strong opposition of the provinces to a plan 
which has not yet been tabled. How does he know? They have 
not seen it. He has not seen it. We have not tabled it yet.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member, going all the way back to last 
December at the meeting of all provincial premiers, that they 
were the ones who asked for major changes to our programs. We 
have been working closely with them and talking with them 
during January, February and the spring. We will be talking with 
them further before we table the report.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	For the hon. member to try to speculate there will be major 
opposition once again simply shows that the interest of the Bloc 
Quebecois is not in having a serious debate. The interest of the 
Bloc Quebecois is in trying to stall the process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
minister say he will be able to be on schedule as planned, when 
at that time Quebec will be in the middle of an election 
campaign and many provinces, I may recall, are strongly 
opposed to his social security reform strategy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize the hon. member has 
not been in the House for a very long period of time. He should 
understand that we do not set agendas here according to 
provincial elections. We set them according to what is right for 
Canadians and how we can get Canadians back to work. That is 
what we had a mandate to do last October.
<P>
	One of the key elements in doing that is to make sure that we 
have more effective employment programs and more effective 
social security programs. I believe we will have a willingness on 
behalf of all Canadians in all regions to work with us to obtain 
that objective.
<P>
	I keep coming back: the only group that consistently, 
perpetually and continually says it does not want any reform, 
any change, or any improvement is the Bloc Quebecois.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Over the past six months both the House and the committees 
have scrutinized the spending estimates. Numerous proposals 
have been put forward to reduce spending estimates even further 
than contained in the minister's budget. Yet none of these 
proposals for reducing spending have been supported by 
government members. In fact last night even a modest proposal 
to reduce by $20,000 was defeated.
<P>
	Would the minister please stand in the House today and tell all 
hon. members, those to the left of him, those to the right of him, 
those behind him, those in front of him, that it is okay to vote in 
favour of reductions in spending that go beyond his budget, that 
this is the nineties and not the seventies, and that he would 
welcome action by his colleagues to reduce spending levels 
below those contained in the budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, government members of the House 
fully understand and share the views that it is necessary to cut 
the deficit, that it is necessary to cut government spending in 
order to do so, and, as we have said on many occasions, that it is 
very important to get Canadians back to work because that is the 
best way to cut the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
members wanted to demonstrate that, the way is not through 
words but by supporting some of the motions to reduce spending 
below budget levels.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the minister. Earlier this 
year the government changed the standing orders to allow 
committees to make recommendations on next year's spending 
provided it was done before June 23.
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that he welcomes such 
recommendations and that he is predisposed to support them, 
including proposals to reduce spending below those that the 
departments may desire?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

<P>
	The minister has said on numerous occasions that he intends 
to consult the public before devising a 10-year immigration 
plan. However the minister has also repeatedly pledged to carry 
out the red book promise to increase immigration to an annual 
rate of 1 per cent of the population.
<P>

formulation of an immigration plan or to stick to the 
immigration targets already set out in the red book?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister has 
been very clear on what his plan is.
<P>
	The minister has put in place the largest immigration 
consultation in the history of Canada. That consultation will 
culminate in a national forum in September, at which time the 
plan will come forward. If the member has some patience she 
will find out in due course.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the Montebello meeting the president of Ekos 
Research, Frank Graves, reported that a majority of Canadians 
believed that immigration levels were already too high.
<P>
	The minister's plan to increase immigration levels to 1 per 
cent is clearly not in line with the views of Canadians. I say this 
is not a consultation plan. It is a public relations plan.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the real reason he is spending $1 
million Canadian is to change people's opinions rather than 
listen to them?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member. I guess I have to say that if we could change people's 
opinions with a mere $1 million, life would be a little easier for 
all of us in the country.
<P>
	This is a very broad based consultation. It is going on in every 
major centre. One person that the hon. member has brought 
forward says that immigration levels are too high. Admittedly 
other people say that too, but many other people who are 
frontline dealers with immigration say differently.
<P>
	Our promise in the red book was to keep it at 1 per cent. We 
are consulting with members of the public across the country.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Transport yesterday very clearly declared that the 
federal government would put an end as of next July to all 
western grain transportation subsidies which total some $600 
million.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
in hearing this statement admitted very clearly that no final 
decision by cabinet has yet been taken. Therefore, the statement 
by the transport minister has, at the very least, surprised and 
embarrassed the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport justify his surprising 
statement about putting an end to western grain freight subsidies 
while visibly his colleague for agriculture was not informed, 
being that he underlined last night and in the House today that no 
final decision has yet been taken by cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
just to make sure the hon. member understands what was said 
yesterday, I indicated, as Minister of Transport, and as the 
budget document did, that we were looking at reducing 
subsidies from the Department of Transport for various forms of 
transportation.
<P>
	I also clearly indicated that the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and others have been involved in the consultative 
process that has been described by the minister today with a 
view as to how we can continue to support the farm community 
in Canada.
<P>
	It is prudent, in view of our international trading agreements, 
to make sure we give a clear signal that changes will be made on 
how the WGTA is paid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Transport did in fact specify that as of July 1 all 
subsidies were to be withdrawn because of GATT. He knows or 
does not know that there is no direct link between the subsidies 
in the west and GATT.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Transport not recognize he is being very 
insensitive regarding a program which has wide implications for 
both animal and grain production between the east and west? 
Does he not recognize that in the past such talk has always 
provoked violent outcries from the farming community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am sensitive enough about the situation in the west as it relates 
to the Crow that I do not have to read my questions as the hon. 
member just did.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that when we dealt with the 
question of what was going to take place on July 1 next year, we 
were very careful in stating that the Department of Transport 
recognized we had to change the way these subsidies were being 
paid, taking into account our international agreements.
<P>
	I know the hon. member's background very well. If the hon. 
member is not familiar with what the implications of the 
international trading agreements are on how we are going to 
have to administer these kinds of programs, then he needs to do a 
little bit more homework and get caught up on what he was doing 
15 years ago when he thought he knew something about 
agriculture.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. Since Tuesday, the 
opposition has been claiming that the lives of two children were 
seriously endangered after the drug ALG was administered to 
them. As a mother of two myself, I am quite concerned.
<P>
	When did this incident happen? And is it true that the lives of 
these two children were threatened by this drug?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
Official Opposition's thoughtless allegations are serious indeed. 
First, the incident in question occurred five years ago at 
Sainte-Justine Hospital, in Montreal.
<P>
	According to the hospital, two children out of fifty or so had a 
mild allergic reaction to the drug. Both were successfully 
treated and their transplanted kidneys were not rejected. Today, 
these two children are healthy. Justine Lacoste-Beaubien, who 
founded Saint-Justine Hospital in 1907, must have turned over 
in her grave hearing the Bloc talk in such a way about an 
institution she founded to save the lives of children in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	I am responsible to Canadians for health, Mr. Speaker, and the 
Official Opposition has responsibility in that area as well. It 
should use some of its research budget to check its facts before 
alarming the Canadian public needlessly. If they want to launch 
a political attack on me, that is one thing, but they should not use 
children to do so.

my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In 1991 the federal government ratified the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since that time a debate 
has been under way in Canada regarding the right of parents to 
spank their children. Section 43 of the Criminal Code currently 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5101"> 5101 </A></B>
<P>
protects parents who use reasonable physical force to discipline 
their children.
<P>
	Can the minister advise this House whether or not he is 
currently considering a repeal of section 43 of the Criminal 
Code?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware that like most 
things involving the justice system, section 43 is under review in 
the Department of Justice.
<P>
	I can also tell the hon. member that I know of no plan at 
present to propose a change to the section. If the situation should 
alter, I can let him know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on March 22, 1994 the Toronto <I>Star</I> reported that 70 per cent of 
Canadian parents stated they believed it is sometimes necessary 
for parents to use physical force to correct their children's 
behaviour.
<P>
	We are given to understand that the federal government is 
currently reviewing section 43 of the Criminal Code. Can the 
minister advise the members of this House who is conducting 
the review, the cost of the review, and when members of this 
House can receive a copy of it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the review is being 
conducted within the Department of Justice.
<P>
	On how much it is costing, I do not know that it is separately 
costed. I think it is part of the mainstream work of the 
department's professional staff but I can confirm that. As to 
what might become of the review, that is a matter for decision. 
No decision has yet been made whether proposals are going to be 
brought forward, whether discussion is going to be encouraged 
publicly, or whether a change is going to be proposed.
<P>
	I can only respond by saying that like much of the justice 
system in general, that section is under consideration. No 
decision has yet been made whether a change will be proposed.

question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The practice of foreign-flagging Canadian ships to bypass 
Canadian legislation has deprived Canadian sailors of jobs and 
the public treasury of revenues. The Minister of Finance will 
surely agree. Although this practice hurts Canada, some 
Canadian shipowners resort to it.
<P>
	My question is this: How can the Minister of Transport justify 
the fact that two ships, the <I>Bluenose</I> and the <I>Atlantic Freighter</I>, 
which belong to Marine Atlantic, a company wholly owned by 
the Government of Canada, operate under the Bahamian flag?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his question. It is certainly 
something that should be looked into. I want to  assure the hon.

were transferred, because we know that Marine Atlantic has 
been in business for a long time and that the <I>Bluenose</I> in

	In outlining this business I would caution the House that there

	There are ongoing discussions as to whether we might be able 
to do this bill at all stages. If we are not able to do so we will 
merely complete second reading. This will be followed by Bill 
C-23, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, and Bill C-24 
concerning wildlife.
<P>
	I understand that there may be a disposition if there is time to

<P>
	We would then begin the report stage of Bill C-22 regarding 
the Pearson airport.
<P>
	In order to accommodate the critic for the Official Opposition 
on this bill who cannot be here on Wednesday, if the other 
business is moving less quickly than expected during the day we

	If this is not feasible, after consultation we could return to 
consideration of Bill C-37, the Young Offenders Act, a bill that I 
understand will require a considerable amount of debate.
<P>
	On Thursday we will call Bill C-38 regarding security of 
marine transportation. It is the intention of the government to 
make this bill subject to the new Standing Order 73(1); that is, to 
refer it to committee before second reading.

any other spill-over from earlier in the week.

	We expect to introduce the lobbyist legislation late next week 
and to devote Friday to a consideration of a motion pursuant to

second reading as well.

all agreed to when we passed an order to update our standing 
orders a few months ago shortly after we adopted the throne 
speech.
<P>
	In any event, it may be presumptuous to attempt to project 
into the last week the House will be sitting, the week of June 20, 
but I can at this time indicate to the House that the government 
intends to place before it during that week Bills C-32, C-30, 
C-25 and C-7, as well as a bill implementing miscellaneous 
statute amendments already reviewed by the justice committee 
in addition to asking the House to complete any unfinished

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-34, an act respecting self-government for first nations in the 
Yukon Territory, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we had been 
debating prior to the break, Bill C-34, I was pointing out that the 
department of Indian affairs has spent $50 million creating a 
cottage industry around the negotiations on land claims and, of 
course, the inherent right to self-government. This has simply 
benefited the lawyers and the political leaders, while at the same 
time the deplorable living conditions of the individual 
aboriginal person have not changed one iota as a result of the 
expenditure of these funds.
<P>
	Fifty million dollars later and the introduction of Bill C-34, 
we still have so many unanswered questions. Topping the list is 
the question: What is aboriginal self-government going to look 
like? Does it mean a transfer of power, or just a transfer of 
administrative responsibilities? Will it mean that 30, 40, 50 or 
100 nations will each have their own governments, and power to 
pass their own constitutions, their own laws and their own 
citizenship status?
<P>
	It is simply going to add a new layer of government to what we 
have now, and it is going to result in more duplication, taxes and 
debt.
<P>
	Will the federal and provincial governments be overwhelmed 
by the demands of many small and inefficient governments?
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	How will the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
apply? Will they have their own constitution, their own system 
of justice and education? These are all things that are promised 
within this document. I would like to just touch for a moment on 
the area of the Constitution.
<P>
	They are granted the right to create their own constitution. 
The very definition or the very words ``inherent right to 
self-government'' would indicate that the laws passed by either 
the federal or provincial governments will not apply to them. 
How in the world can we expect them to create a constitution 
that will direct their inherent right to self-government if that 
constitution is not independent of the Constitution of Canada 
including the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5104"> 5104 </A></B>
<P>
Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  That question has not been 
answered by the creators of this bill.
<P>
	Will non-aboriginal peoples be subjected to the powers of 
governments that are beyond their control? What kind of 
self-government rights will aboriginal people have when they 
are not on an aboriginal land base? Will I need a passport when 
entering these new territories? The questions go on and on.
<P>
	I feel that I cannot support this bill, although I support, as 
many of my colleagues do, the direction in which this bill goes. 
However the questions that we have raised in this debate so far 
have not been addressed. Before this bill can be supported we 
must make sure that we know exactly where we are going with 
the bill, the rights and obligations attached to this bill and the 
responsibilities of not only the two senior levels of government 
but also the responsibilities of this new form of government that 
we will be forming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure here to speak on Bill C-34 
which represents the settlement of four self-government 
agreements in Yukon with the native peoples.
<P>
	There are 10 more self-government agreements that still have 
to be settled. This bill if it is passed will give further agreements 
to be ratified by cabinet alone and therefore does not have to 
come under the scrutiny of Parliament and therefore the scrutiny 
of the Canadian people.
<P>
	The purpose of this agreement is to deal with aboriginal 
self-government to a vast and sparsely populated part of 
Canada. I think it is worthwhile for us today to discuss some of 
the salient points of this bill, what it would give the native 
people, vis-à-vis the Canadian people, the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-34 gives special rights and special privileges to some 
of the native peoples of the Yukon Territory. As a representative 
here of all Canadians I have some problems with this. This bill is 
divisive. It will define the citizens of the First Nations as a 
separate group of citizens. Therefore what we would have in this 
land are two citizenships, citizens with different rules and 
regulations pertaining to each group.
<P>
	As a result of this we are setting up separate governments for 
separate nations within the borders of this country, new 
governments with broad legislative powers, independent 
legislative powers of the rest of the country.
<P>
	Native peoples see themselves as separate nations and not part 
of Canada. This I recognize. It is obviously a philosophical point 
of contention. To see oneself as a nation that is separate from 
another within the borders of this country may sound good to 
some, but I think that it is only divisive.
<P>
	The native people should ask themselves if this is indeed 
going to improve their social and economic  situations or will it 
be divisive and counterproductive. The rest of Canada must also 
ask whether they are prepared to accept this within the borders 
of their country.
<P>
	Yukon I believe, as most Canadians believe, belongs to all 
Canadians. Let us elaborate on some of the nitty-gritty of these 
bills. Bill C-34 will increase the number of governments in 
Yukon right now up from two to sixteen. This would produce an 
increase in bureaucracy, in taxes, in rules and regulations for 
only 7,300 people, 20 per cent of the people who live there. This 
is apartheid. It smacks of the old South Africa. In effect we are 
creating separate nation states within the borders of our own 
country. This is a new brand of Canadian apartheid.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Apartheid, as we know, means separateness or apartness for 
those who do not realize it, not togetherness, and this at a time 
when above all else we need to work together. It is wise to reflect 
on the meaning of this when we look at what will be happening 
to the Yukon if these bills are passed. It will mean a division 
among people.
<P>
	Another question that has not been asked concerns the 
structure of the legislative body that would have the ability to 
pass laws and legislations within the Yukon. This has yet to be 
finalized but would be left up to the native legislative body. I can 
say this though, it does enable the body to give the power to a 
single person to enact legislation. There are no rules and 
regulations concerning democratic institutions in this bill and 
this concerns me greatly.
<P>
	Who will be paying for this self-government? The Canadian 
taxpayers and the native people together will be paying for it. 
However the Canadian taxpayer will be footing the major 
portion of the bill. Then they must also have a say in what will be 
the outcome of the negotiations on this bill. The cost would be 
far greater than that which is borne today by the federal 
government to provide services to the aboriginal people in this 
area.
<P>
	We must stand back and look at the larger issue here, in fact 
the most important issue, the welfare of the native people. No 
one disputes the ability of any individual to exercise his or her 
democratic rights and freedoms. I do not think anyone has a 
problem with enabling any group of people who live in an area to 
govern themselves by municipal powers, the same municipal 
powers that are given to any other area of the country.
<P>
	However will providing these vast, expansive special 
agreements to the rest of Canada, a part of Canada that belongs 
to every Canadian, help the welfare of the native people? Let us 
get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5105"> 5105 </A></B>
<P>
down to brass tacks here and call a spade a spade. Many of the 
native communities tragically are wracked with very high rates 
of suicide, alcoholism, substance abuse, unemployment, 
depression and sexual abuse.
<P>
	As a physician I have spent much time in northern British 
Columbia working with native people. The plight of these 
individuals breaks my heart. I have seen individuals raped, had 
their heads put through walls, beaten up, smashed up, shot and 
killed, people who have suffered the ravages of alcoholism. I 
have seen them go for years, suffering these ravages only to have 
to pronounce them dead on the gang plank of an emergency 
department.
<P>
	It is intolerable for this to have occurred and it is intolerable 
for it to continue. Part of the blame rests on the non-native 
population and in particular Canadian governments that have 
continued to treat people in a paternalistic fashion by providing 
for them many of their basic needs without trying to do much to 
stimulate self-reliance.
<P>
	Whenever you give an individual or group their basic needs 
they will lose their desire to fight for these things and therefore 
lose their self-respect, pride and self-reliance.
<P>
	I also put a large part of the blame squarely on the shoulders of 
the native population and native leaders who in my opinion have 
been unwilling to take the bull by the horns and ask what they 
can do to pull their communities out of these tragic situations.
<P>
	Do the native peoples' leaders truly think that settling these 
land claims and self-government in a different fashion from 
anybody else-it is important to emphasize different-is going 
to do much to alleviate these tragedies? Are they trying to carve 
out an area of Canada for their people based on history and have 
them live like they did 150 years ago? If so, do they think that 
their people want or need this?
<P>
	If you want to go back to living off the land so be it, but you 
cannot expect to do that and still have a VCR, car, CD player and 
many of the other amenities of 20th century, first world 
lifestyle. In other words, you cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	Over time and history, groups of individuals have moved from 
one area to another, expanded and taken over certain areas where 
others live. This has occurred, whether you are speaking of 
Canada, America, Australia or England. It has been a fact of life 
and a fact of the history of mankind. It is something that none of 
us here can do anything about. We must look ahead, look into the 
future and determine how all people in the country can have 
their socioeconomic situations improved. This is particularly 
important for the native people because their socioeconomic 
situation is the poorest in the land.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	However it is incumbent on the native people to ask 
themselves what they can do to help themselves. In my 
discussions with native people, it has been sorely lacking. They 
speak about getting back pride and self-reliance. I can tell 
members that the only way to get back pride and self-reliance is 
if you earn them yourself. You only achieve these things through 
your own hard work, your  sweat and your desire to fight for 
your basic necessities and your life.
<P>
	Pride and self-respect are not things that are given to 
someone, paid for or bought. They are only things that come 
from within your heart and soul and only from your ability, as an 
individual or community, to fight for your own life. I do not 
mean this in a pugilistic sense or by taking up arms. I mean this 
figuratively and in a spiritual sense.
<P>
	When one works hard and fights for one's life in this world, 
win or lose, one develops a sense of pride, self-respect, 
self-reliance, self-esteem that nobody can take away. It is the 
only way that this will come to the native communities.
<P>
	As I have said before, it must come from within the people. 
Canadian governments and provincial governments have done 
too much to pander to the communities. They have taken this 
desire away from them, this fight to become the best that they 
can become.
<P>
	Cultural, social and linguistic integrity does not have to be 
lost but again the responsibility for this resides squarely on the 
shoulders of the native population. Canada's cultural mosiac is a 
great benefit to every citizen. For the native population to lose 
its history and its culture would not only be a disservice to them 
but to every citizen, native and non-native.
<P>
	Rather than dealing with trying to buy out the native 
populations with these huge land claims, perhaps it would be 
better for us to determine ways that together we can work toward 
helping the native population becoming self-reliant. Of course 
this does not preclude the concept of municipal governments in 
areas where there are native populations but these rights are the 
same for every Canadian, non-native and native. I will reiterate 
this again. The rules, regulations, laws, responsibilities and 
privileges of a citizen of our country must be equal for 
everybody, native or non-native together.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
guess I am somewhat puzzled by the statement of the member 
from the other side.
<P>
	He said that he has worked with First Nations' people as a 
medical doctor and has talked to them. It seems to me that he 
really has not listened to them, nor has he learned anything 
about them. He talked about self-government but he has talked 
about it in a somewhat befuddled way. If he were to truly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5106"> 5106 </A></B>
<P>
understand what self-government is about, he would change a 
lot of the statements that he just made.
<P>
	I had the honour of sitting in a meeting with a group of chiefs 
from across the country. A very articulate chief from the west 
spoke about self-government. He spoke about his relationship 
with the Department of Indian Affairs. He spoke about the 
problems that native people have because they do not have the 
same rights that many Canadians take for granted.
<P>
	Moneys that are generated through leases and economic 
activity in their communities goes to the department. They have 
to apply for moneys through budgets. These budgets can be 
turned down. He gave a very eloquent and poignant description 
of this life and he looked to me and said: ``Self-government is 
just a way of having the same basic rights that other Canadians 
enjoy''.
<P>
	I am really at a loss to come up with a question for the member 
on the other side. I only have a suggestion and that is to open 
your mind and your heart-
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that in 
debate people feel a great deal of conviction and are very 
committed to the issue they are debating. However I want to 
remind all members that it is in the best interests of all members 
in the House to direct comments in a less personal fashion 
through the Chair.
<P>
	I would ask all members to keep that in mind throughout the 
day.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the member to 
think about some of the experiences he has had, open his mind 
and his heart and really listen to what people are telling him. He 
should investigate what it is like for people in native 
communities and the kinds of relationships they have right now 
and really explore what self-government is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
very much appreciate the comments of the hon. member. 
Whether she believes it or not what she is saying is supporting 
what I have said. I agree with many of her comments.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs is paternalistic, does not 
serve the native people at all and should be eliminated. They 
agree with that and I think many people in the House do. It is 
insulting for them to have an institution such as that govern 
them in the way it does. They do not deserve it.
<P>
	I will reiterate it again as I did at least twice in my speech that 
we in this party stand for equal rights, equal status and equal 
opportunity for all Canadians, natives and non-natives. We 
should concentrate on investing our efforts collectively, natives 
and non-natives together, to determine how every individual 
who lives within this beautiful country can become the best they 
can.
<P>
	We have to dismantle some of the barriers for native people. I 
would ask whether settling these land claims is going to do that. 
An economy cannot be created in some of the far away places 
where these land claims are to be  settled and expect individuals 
to improve their socioeconomic situations. It will not happen. 
We must provide a helping hand to enable native peoples to 
become the best they can become. I am sure that we can do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-34, an act respecting self-government for the First 
Nations in Yukon Territory is a bill which I would very much 
like to support.
<P>
	I would like to support it and I say this with absolutely no 
malice toward the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development because I personally look forward to the day when 
the Department of Indian Affairs no longer exists. When that 
day comes it will mean that people born on Indian reserves or 
people born of First Nation parents have assumed their full 
rights and responsibilities as adult citizens rather than living 
under the not always benevolent dictatorship of some distant 
white parent figure in the federal government.
<P>
	I would also like to support Bill C-34 because I know that 
men and women around the world regard aboriginal peoples as a 
world treasure. Any modern nation which can bring its 
aboriginal peoples into full partnership in the modern world will 
be deserving the world's praise and gratitude.
<P>
	I would like to support Bill C-34 if I could because it is only 
right and just that as the First Nations people demonstrate their 
readiness to take over their own affairs, that right should be 
handed over to them in a reasonable and efficient manner.
<P>
	Finally if it were possible I would support Bill C-34 because 
the policy of the Reform Party of Canada passed by our many 
thousands of members at our regular assemblies supports: 
``Processes leading to the early and mutually satisfactory 
conclusion of outstanding land claims negotiations-enabling 
aboriginal individuals, communities and organizations to 
assume full responsibility for their well-being by involving 
them in the development, delivery and assessment of 
government policies affecting them''.
<P>
	Given my own commitment to those four reasons for 
supporting progress toward native self-government, it was with 
real disappointment and mounting frustration that I read the 
reasons why I cannot support Bill C-34.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The incredible twists and turns of this bill have created a 
strangely complex administrative trap set to ensnare well 
meaning officials of both the involved First Nations and the 
Yukon territorial government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5107"> 5107 </A></B>
<P>
	I have no wish to say anything bad about the motives of the 
people who put Bill C-34 together. No doubt they had the best 
intentions. Regardless of their good intentions, they have started 
Canada's long desired progress toward native self-government 
by making two fundamentally wrong assumptions.
<P>
	I am deducing their assumptions by looking at what Bill C-34 
provides. In its schedule III, parts I, II, III and IV, Bill C-34 
provides these First Nations with jurisdiction over virtually 
every item relating to creation, preservation and defence of 
peace, order and good government that would be granted to a 
nation such as Canada.
<P>
	For example, the First Nations will have jurisdiction over 
manpower training, which the province of Quebec has long been 
seeking but was not granted. Additionally Bill C-34 provides 
these First Nations with jurisdiction over the control or 
prohibition of the possession and use of firearms and other 
weapons and explosives.
<P>
	Part III, number 21 gives this a power which has been 
reserved for the federal government and not even given to 
governments at the provincial levels. With the passing of Bill 
C-34, that right to make firearm laws will be handed over to 
these four First Nations.
<P>
	As a third example, portions of Bill C-34 relating to 
administration of justice point out that some interim agreements 
must be concluded, but once such agreements expire these four 
so-called First Nations shall have the right to administer justice 
including imposing fines up to $5,000 and imprisonment for up 
to six months.
<P>
	In other words, Bill C-34 is taking very literally the term 
nations when legislating to these four groups of natives. Is this 
reasonable?
<P>
	I am not a student of world geography, but I frankly cannot 
recall reading about any nation in the world which has a 
population of under 10,000 people. In Canada our towns, 
municipalities and regional districts have more than 10,000 
people and those administrative levels of governments are often 
hard pressed today to pay for the kinds of things required from 
municipal level governments; for example, to pay for the 
salaries of building inspectors to be sure that new construction 
complies with standards for things like electrical wiring, 
soundness of building foundations and fire safety.
<P>
	Bill C-34 regards each of these four so-called First Nations as 
being a nation with virtually all the rights and responsibilities of 
a modern developed country like Canada, whose population is 
28 million.
<P>
	Bill C-34 extends the special rights, privileges and duties of 
nationhood to these groups whose total population is 
approximately 7,300 native people, divided into 14 bands and 
scattered across some of the most sparsely populated land 
remaining on our planet.
<P>
	Again I must ask my colleagues of the House: Is this 
reasonable? From my personal point of view it is so far from 
being reasonable that it seems tragic. I say that Bill  C-34 is 
tragic because by expecting far too much Bill C-34 dooms one 
of Canada's first experiments in native self-government to 
failure, for on to the shoulders of these 7,300 natives will fall the 
responsibility to administer some 16,000 square miles of land 
equivalent to about 75 per cent of the province of Nova Scotia 
which the land claim agreements of Bill C-33, the companion 
piece of this legislation, will hand over in fee simple ownership.
<P>
	In case some hon. members may doubt what I am alleging 
here, let us look at some of the other responsibilities which will 
fall on the small native population. On that piece of land, 
three-quarters of the size of Nova Scotia, they will be 
responsible for all use, management, administration, control 
and protection. That is part III, item 1.
<P>
	They will be responsible for all allocations and dispositions 
of rights and interests in that land for the use, management, 
administration and protection of natural resources for all 
businesses, professional and trade licensing, for all 
construction, sanitation planning, zoning and land development, 
for controlling operation and use of vehicles, local services and 
facilities, for preventing pollution and protecting the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	In short, nobody needs feel concern over unemployment in 
this area of Yukon because virtually every adult will be getting a 
job from the new First Nations government.
<P>
	At a time when the people of Canada are complaining about 
being overgoverned, Bill C-34 carries overgovernment to 
undreamed of extremes.
<P>
	One incorrect assumption of the people who drew up Bill 
C-34 is that the term nation should be applied literally to these 
tiny isolated groups, reserving for the federal government only 
such limited functions as postal service, international 
agreements, military defence and the jurisdiction of the federal 
court.
<P>
	The second bad assumption which the drafters of the 
legislation apparently made is that these native groups are fully 
ready for such an advanced stage of self-government. To return 
to the Reform Party policy on the subject, because it has the 
unusual merit of making plain common sense, unlike Bill C-34, 
the Reform Party supports: ``The establishment of a new 
relationship with aboriginal peoples beginning with a 
constitutional convention of aboriginal representatives to 
consider their position on such matters as the nature of 
aboriginal rights, the relationship between aboriginal peoples 
and the various levels of government, and how to reduce the 
economic dependence of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5108"> 5108 </A></B>
<P>
aboriginal peoples on the federal government and the 
department of Indian affairs''.
<P>
	To the best of my knowledge none of this preliminary 
groundwork has been completed. I believe it is particularly 
important for native peoples to work out agreements with 
neighbouring municipal level governments with which they 
could share the cost burden of providing that more realistic level 
of self-government services.
<P>
	I would like to draw to the House's attention the question of 
drawing up a constitution for these First Nations as probably the 
most essential missing pieces of Bill C-34.
<P>
	Regarding creating a constitution, many people around the 
world have been impressed by the process used by the new South 
Africa in moving away from its old white race dominated system 
of government to a new country based, at last on the 
fundamental democratic principle of one person, one vote.
<P>
	Once the political will was there, South Africa accomplished 
this transition fairly quickly by establishing, first of all, a 
temporary constitution to determine how the election should 
take place, some soft boundaries for the future nine provinces, 
and the rough framework whereby the newly elected federal 
officials, balanced by an equal number from each of the nine 
new provinces, will gather to draw up South Africa's long term 
constitution, subject to ratification by the people.
<P>
	In order to establish these four Yukon First Nations, to the 
best of my knowledge and research, no such constitutional 
details have been spelled out.
<P>
	What Bill C-34 does provide is some standards which must be 
included in the constitution of these First Nations, including 
what is required for citizenship and procedure for determining 
whether a person is a citizen; what shall be the governing bodies 
of the First Nation, including such things as membership, duties 
and procedures; a system for these governing bodies to be 
financially accountable to the citizens; a way to recognize and 
protect their rights and freedoms; a way to challenge the validity 
of laws and quash the laws seen as not valid; a way to amend the 
constitution.
<P>
	Unfortunately a number of key questions are not discussed. 
For instance, who is to draw up these constitutions for each of 
the four First Nations involved? What time frame are they to 
follow? Do the native people get to vote on their own proposed 
new constitution? If so, how? Will our Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms be followed in these new nations?
<P>
	On all of these essential points, Bill C-34 is silent.
<P>
	However the legislation does contain something which does 
not, in my opinion, properly belong in any bill which a 
responsible government asks members of this House to support. 
Bill C-34 asks Parliament, by passing this one piece of 
legislation, to give blanket approval, sight unseen, to 
self-government agreements for 10 additional Yukon bands, 
according to Clause 5(2): ``Where a self-government agreement 
is concluded with a First Nation after this act comes into force, 
the  governor in council may, by order, bring the agreement into 
effect and add the name of the First Nation to Schedule II''.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe this particular clause is the height of irresponsible 
behaviour by the present government. In the way of things, 
another government altogether may be in place before the 10 
other self-government agreements have been concluded.
<P>
	Members of today's Parliament could be giving this blanket 
permission to a cabinet not even yet elected. I submit to my 
colleagues that this simply is not a conscientious way to fulfil 
our obligations to all the people of Canada. It is at best a 
slip-shod kind of behaviour which no conscientious people 
would exercise in the conduct of their own personal affairs, 
much less the affairs of this great nation.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to suggest some positive 
alternatives to Bill C-34, which I regard as having such serious 
flaws that it cannot be remedied even by numerous amendments.
<P>
	In the very desirable process of going along with our 
aboriginal peoples as they follow the road to self-government, I 
believe that we must simply start at the beginning of the road 
and not leap with little caution toward the road's end. The 
beginning of the road to aboriginal self-government is holding 
an aboriginal constitutional convention at which the native 
peoples spell out what conditions they want to live under and 
what responsibilities for government and administration they 
want and are ready and financially able to assume.
<P>
	For example, I doubt that the people of Canada would 
question or deny the aboriginal right to administer First Nation 
affairs and operation and internal management of the First 
Nation, together with the management and administration of 
rights and benefits realized by the aboriginals' agreement with 
Canada.
<P>
	I feel certain that the people of Canada would be pleased and 
proud to see natives assume full responsibilities for programs 
and services relating to their spiritual and cultural beliefs and 
practices as well as the preservation of their aboriginal language 
and culture. However, far too little thought and planning has 
been devoted to the ways by which our native peoples would end 
their financial dependence on the rest of Canada.
<P>
	There is no joke about the golden rule, that he who has the 
gold makes the rules. In our society to be regarded as a 
responsible adult is to take full responsibility for one's self. In 
my book that does not mean negotiating such huge settlements 
of land, cash and resources that the most minimal common sense 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5109"> 5109 </A></B>
<P>
about investment will allow the beneficiaries to pursue their 
own chosen lifestyle forever.
<P>
	In the rest of Canada people with many types of handicaps 
pride themselves on being able to work to be as self-supporting 
and independent as possible. Frankly, to say that for some 
reason our native people are not equally able to become 
self-supporting and independent seems to me to be racism of the 
worst kind.
<P>
	I look forward to the day when a responsible government will 
bring to Parliament the kind of legislation enabling aboriginal 
self-government that all members of this House will be pleased 
and proud to support. Unfortunately, Bill C-34 does not fit that 
description.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you 
for the opportunity to speak on this very important topic this 
afternoon.
<P>
	I spoke a month ago on Bill C-16 which laid out a settlement 
for land claims with the Sahtu Indian bands. I stated at that time 
that I was opposed to the bill on the grounds that it was overly 
generous. I also stated my concerns that the bill was setting a 
dangerous precedent. My thinking on these two bills before us 
today is much the same.
<P>
	I support the concept of self-sufficiency and self-reliance 
inherent in the successful land claim settlement process. In no 
way do I argue with these in principle. I also encourage this 
government to dismantle the department of Indian affairs and let 
the people involved conduct their own affairs.
<P>
	This approach develops responsibility and places decision 
making in the hands of those most directly involved.
<P>
	Bill C-33 will validate land claims entered into between Her 
Majesty, the Government of the Yukon Territory and certain 
First Nations of the Yukon Territory. Bill C-34 is an act 
respecting self-government for the First Nations of Yukon 
territory. These two bills represent only four land claim 
agreements and four self-government agreements. There are 10 
more of each to come in the Yukon. I might add there are about 
six pending in my riding of Peace River.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The 14 land claim agreements would convey fee simple 
16,000 square miles of land for these 14 bands. As my 
colleagues have said, that is equivalent to roughly 
three-quarters the size of Nova Scotia. The Government of 
Canada also agrees to pay $243 million in 1989 dollars over a 
period of 15 years. That is very substantial.
<P>
	Clause 5 of Bill C-33 would allow the other 10 land claim 
agreements to be ratified by the approval of cabinet rather than 
by Parliament as a whole. In much the same way, clause 5 of Bill 
C-34 allows the self-government agreement to be ratified by 
cabinet as well.
<P>
	At the present time, law making in Yukon is entrusted to two 
legislative bodies in Canada: the Parliament of Canada and the 
Yukon legislature. When this bill is passed, the number of 
governments having the right to  pass laws in Yukon or parts of 
Yukon will go from two to sixteen. This means there will be 
more bureaucracy, more taxes, more laws and more rules and 
regulations. How can this possibly be in the best interests of 
Canada? We have just heard from my colleague from Okanagan 
that some of these are very small in terms of the amount of 
people involved and the efficiency of skills certainly cannot be 
achieved.
<P>
	A number of questions need to be addressed. Will the new 
self-government have to function within the provincial, 
territorial or federal framework? That is a very important 
question that needs to be answered for Canadians. Why is it not 
spelled out explicitly that the self-governments must respect the 
authority of the Parliament of Canada?
<P>
	Does the Canadian charter apply? Obviously it does not. Why 
is it not specifically spelled out in this legislation that the 
Canadian charter should apply?
<P>
	The population of Yukon is about 32,000. To accommodate 20 
per cent of that population, some 7,300 people, we are going to 
have 14 new governments. That does not make any sense to me. 
Who is going to pay for these governments? The country is 
already borrowing heavily abroad to finance the excessive 
spending of our federal government. Do we really want to ask 
the Japanese or the Americans to finance 14 more governments?
<P>
	Let me read to members clause 24 of Bill C-34 which deals 
with funding: ``The minister may, with the approval of the 
governor in council and subject to appropriations by Parliament, 
enter into an agreement with a First Nation, for the provision of 
funding by the Government of Canada to the First Nation over 
the period of time and subject to the terms and conditions 
specified in the agreement''. To me, that sounds like a blank 
cheque and I do not think Canadian taxpayers will buy it.
<P>
	Frankly, I am not prepared to commit my children and my 
grandchildren to who knows how many millions of dollars in 
future payments. I am not prepared to set this kind of precedent 
for future aboriginal self-government agreements.
<P>
	As a member of the Reform Party I support the expeditious 
settlement of land claims leading to self-sufficiency. That is a 
very important distinction, self-sufficiency. I also support a 
modest form of municipal style self-government. That is a very 
important first step before we embark on any other notions that 
it may be federal or provincial. Bill C-34 goes much beyond 
that. I simply cannot support the direction in which these two 
bills are taking us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5110"> 5110 </A></B>
<P>
	I further object to the underhanded way in which these two 
bills are being pushed through. The Liberal red book promised 
integrity in Parliament, yet these bills were introduced only last 
week. Surely there is more time. This House has to work 
effectively. One week is certainly not enough time for MPs. 
These bills were introduced only last week with second reading 
occurring today. How can MPs properly prepare a response and 
debate a very complex package that took some 21 years to 
prepare in such a very short time?
<P>
	The agreements made so far which Parliament is now asked to 
ratify are nine inches thick. That gives some perspective of what 
is involved here and how complex they are. They represent only 
four of fourteen land claim agreements and only four of the 
fourteen self-government agreements.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	If Bills C-33 and C-34 are passed, only cabinet will have to 
approve the other 10 yet to come. There is something seriously 
wrong here. I will vote against these bills and I urge my 
colleagues in this House to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party has said on several occasions this 
afternoon there was not enough time to prepare for this debate. 
Was the Reform Party not aware that this agreement was signed 
a year ago and that implementing legislation would have to be 
brought to the House at some point? Did Reform members not 
prepare and do their homework prior to the introduction of the 
bill so they would be prepared for the debate knowing it was 
coming forward?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have that question 
asked. We have been trying to find out from this government, the 
minister of Indian affairs and the Prime Minister himself. On 
many occasions we have asked them to define what native 
self-government means and we have been unable to get any kind 
of a direct answer. They have been very evasive.
<P>
	The most important question that needs to be asked is: What 
does native self-government really mean? Is it municipal 
government, provincial government or federal government? 
Those kinds of parameters have to be spelled out before we can 
embark along what we know is going to be a very long trail 
because a lot of other land claims are going to be coming before 
us.
<P>
	I still think we need to defeat this bill. I hope the Senate will 
have enough common sense to send it back to the House and 
make this government define more clearly what 
self-government means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that the question of the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake has gone unanswered. This 
agreement has been signed for quite some time now and I 
believe the hon. member mentioned it has been about a year. 
Could he not have asked for this agreement  in order to get ready 
for this debate? We would like a direct answer to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that when this 
government wants to implement something it agrees with like 
native self-government, it seems it can be done very quickly, 
but when it comes to cancelling the Pearson airport deal that is 
another matter. The former government was wrong and lot of 
blame was put on it. Now this government seems to be hiding 
behind the skirts of the former government in that the deal was 
negotiated so now it has to be finalized. I do not think that is a 
good enough argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, we need to put this 
whole issue in a different perspective. For the last three months I 
have been involved in the foreign affairs review. We have been 
looking at different countries and the property disputes, future 
disputes and the ethnic and racial tensions that have developed. I 
can see many of the things we have looked at there when I look at 
the type of legislation we have before us today. We might simply 
be trading one problem for another. We should take a serious 
hard and long look at some of the poorly thought out measures in 
this bill.
<P>
	First I should make clear that I and certainly my party believe 
the department of Indian affairs is a mismanaged, poorly 
operated bureaucratic nightmare. All of us can agree it is 
something long overdue for reform. We can also agree with the 
principle of self-government. However, before something like 
that is set up there must be the criteria and an understanding of 
what you are getting. As was just mentioned the minister has 
been asked over and over again what is meant by 
self-government and the answer has never come.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	My general overview of self-government is one where we 
have a municipal-like organization. It is one which has limited 
powers and co-operates with the other levels of government. It 
is one which is harmonized at all levels and one which leads 
certainly to a better form of government for its people. The most 
important words would be ``democratically chosen'' and 
democratically representing the entire group of people, the 
grassroots. It does not mean representation by a clique, by 
powerbrokers, by a mob-like government, which in fact can 
happen if there are no restrictions or if the people are not ready 
for that type of government.
<P>
	In examining the bill itself we see a very broad range of 
powers being given, literally an unlimited set of powers with 
absolutely no guarantee of any kind of democracy. We see more 
bureaucrats, more rules, more laws, more regulations, and more 
waste. We in fact see something possibly worse than the 
department of Indian affairs is today. Relating back to the world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5111"> 5111 </A></B>
<P>
situation, if people are not ready for self-government and are 
not prepared to work by certain criteria, which they should have 
a part in establishing, then you have nothing but disruption and 
ultimately possibly chaos.
<P>
	Also there is no mention in this bill as has been mentioned a 
number of times before about the charter of rights. I do not think 
there are any Canadians including the native people of Yukon 
who would not want the charter of rights included in any kind of 
government they might have. If those charter of rights cannot be 
guaranteed, that is how countries get into human rights abuses, 
how they get into an area where the people are not protected 
from that power clique that could potentially run the proposed 
government.
<P>
	We have to stop and look at this and get the people along with 
the experts to define what exactly we mean by self-government.
<P>
	This is setting a serious precedent for the future. We are going 
into uncharted waters and we are going to come up with 
proposals that are going to be used in other parts of Canada. Are 
we sure these in fact are the rules by which we want to play? 
Certainly by removing any future settlements and allowing 
cabinet to decide these could not be much less democratic. We 
have literally taken the people out of the equation and have put it 
in the hands of politicians. I do not think that is a decision that is 
current with the way Canadians are thinking.
<P>
	With the big picture now in place, do Canadians really know 
what they are getting? Do the natives of Yukon really know what 
they are getting? What are the repercussions later? Are the seeds 
of racial and discriminatory practices being sown by a bill like 
this? The potential is there. You just do not know enough of the 
guidelines or there are no guidelines to guarantee that will not 
happen. We have then a poorly defined self-government and the 
repercussions are for Canada entirely. There is no place that 
does not have a land claim in Canada and so the repercussions 
are great.
<P>
	Of course there is the cost. No one really has talked about that. 
We have talked about the blank cheque in clause 24 and we have 
to ask as to who pays. We have to ask about the kind of 
repercussions that could come from the Canadian taxpayers 
when they find the price tag on this kind of agreement that has 
been signed.
<P>
	This is just another case of legislation that will come back to 
haunt us in the future. It is another time when we should take a 
sober reflection and look at it before we move forward. The 
government should be happy to blame the last government for 
this kind of botched deal. Obviously the Canadian people 
believe the last government botched things pretty badly. This 
would be an opportunity then to simply reiterate that, as the 
Canadian people told us last October, go back and do it right, set 
the criteria and put this bill on the back burner until we can come 
up with something better.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to give a Saskatchewan perspective on the 
issues of Yukon aboriginal self-government and the land claims 
that are before this House today.
<P>
	What is happening in the Yukon is very important to those of 
us in our province as well. Certainly today we are setting 
legislative precedents. We must be very careful about this, 
thorough in our analysis and creative in our proposals for 
solutions.
<P>
	These issues are of real concern for people in my province. 
We have a significant and growing aboriginal population. In fact 
by early in the next century, some believe that the aboriginal 
population in Saskatchewan will approach a majority 
percentage.
<P>
	I would like to raise four specific areas of discussion taking 
place now as we contemplate the present and future factors. 
Number one is the concerns of the Saskatchewan rural 
municipalities regarding land claims. Rural municipalities in 
Saskatchewan have a deep concern about losing a tax base from 
land claim settlements.
<P>
	I sat in on a meeting of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food on April 28 past. We heard the 
concerns of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural 
Municipalities in this matter. SARM represents 297 rural 
municipalities with over 235,000 rural residents. They are 
concerned that approximately two million acres are going to be 
purchased by the aboriginal community.
<P>
	For rural municipalities this is a large tax implication. These 
lands are not going to be purchased in large blocks. It will be a 
quarter here, a half section there, a willing buyer, a willing seller 
type of agreement. These lands will go to reserve status.
<P>
	Under federal law municipalities do not pay taxes. On treaty 
land entitlements there is a compensation fund worked out but 
on specific claims or reinstatement of treaty land entitlements 
we do not have an agreement.
<P>
	If Indian people move into your municipality and they are not 
going to pay municipal tax, it is going to create unhappy 
neighbourhoods. If a person on one side of the road does not 
have to pay taxes and the person on the other side does, and 
perhaps more because the first does not, this is unfair.
<P>
	SARM told our committee that it wanted to leave a strong 
message with us: This is a big problem in Saskatchewan and it 
has to be addressed.
<P>
	This is an example in Saskatchewan of decisions and 
agreements being made without meeting the essential 
characteristics of good decisions. I fear for the same bills under 
discussion here in this House today. We must have decisions that 
are, number one, appropriate. Do these bills respond to the real 
problem? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5112"> 5112 </A></B>
<P>
Will they transform the present situation into the target state? 
Number two is attainability. Can these bills be successfully 
implemented given the resources that we have? Number three is 
attractive. Do we see these bills as relevant, feasible, 
understandable, supportable and ownable by everyone? Number 
four is adaptability. Can we modify things easily if conditions 
change or if new information becomes available?
<P>
	In order to make the best decision we may have to do what all 
good decision makers should do, slow down, retrace our steps, 
elicit new opinions, present new ideas, give a word of 
encouragement, suggest a compromise, postpone action and 
reach out to non-participants. I say this is what we should be 
doing with the bills before us here today.
<P>
	We have questions about the effectiveness of these bills and 
someone has said that questions thrown out the front door have a 
way of coming in through the side window. We do not want that 
to happen in this case. In fact we cannot afford to have it happen 
in this country.
<P>
	The second concern is the community pastures under the 
PFRA program. A second type of related issue in Saskatchewan 
was raised in our committee at the same time in late April. Some 
of the PFRA community pasture lands will also be up for 
purchase by First Nations people.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	A reasonably good process of negotiation has been put in 
place for this. The Indian band will need the agreement of 75 per 
cent of the patrons of any particular pasture in order to proceed 
to the transfer of the said lands. This process is open and 
democratic, which all processes should be.
<P>
	The third concern is the First Nations Council of Moose Jaw. 
Moving to yet another related issue, an event occurred in my 
riding of Moose Jaw-Lake Centre about a year and a half ago 
that really surprised some of my constituents. They woke up one 
morning to read the daily paper's lead headline, and I quote: 
``First Nations elect first government. Status Indians take 
charge of their destinies''.
<P>
	This was during the referendum campaign. The news story we 
read that morning said that an election held in Moose Jaw 
Tuesday should pave the way for self-government for urban 
status Indians throughout Canada. They said that their elected 
council would negotiate with all levels of government to secure 
better health care, education, employment and housing for its 
members.
<P>
	What surprised people was that this was a group of neighbours 
and friends in our city who got together, conducted a process of 
discussions, elected leaders and declared to the rest of us that 
they were a duly constituted government to which we would now 
relate in jurisdictional terms. One hundred and seventy people 
out of a city population of some 35,000 made this decision that 
the rest of us must now abide by. I have yet to settle in my own 
mind exactly how one should respond to such an initiative.
<P>
	The fourth concern was an event that happened last year in our 
riding. I have raised it before in this House. I believe it 
illustrates the importance of making sure our decisions and our 
actions are carefully thought out and applied before we take 
them.
<P>
	In our riding we are trying to work together to solve a 
potentially divisive problem. Last July 22 to 25 an indigenous 
peoples celebration was held in Moose Jaw. Soon after I was 
elected as MP in October, local business and organizations that 
had provided goods and services to this event approached me 
with the news that they had not been paid for their services. The 
problem is serious because we have identified possibly as much 
as $200,000 worth of unpaid bills. I have informed both the 
federal government and the Saskatchewan provincial 
government about this situation and the issue certainly has been 
in the local news.
<P>
	I have a deep concern that a successful resolution be found to 
this problem. I am encouraged by the patience of the business 
persons involved as we work through this problem and by the 
openness and the responsibility being taken by the newly 
selected aboriginal leaders in Moose Jaw. I am hoping we can 
carefully reach a successful conclusion to this matter. I have 
said that I will keep this House informed. I am of the distinct 
persuasion, however, that this problem ended up being harder to 
solve than it would have been to prevent by careful planning.
<P>
	A wise person once said that one should make sure they count 
the costs before undertaking an initiative. I am concerned that 
this is what will happen in the debates about the far-reaching 
and significant implications of the legislation that we have 
before us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments that were 
directed toward this legislation.
<P>
	It is often easy to ask a lot of questions about self-government 
legislation. Questions have been asked of the government to 
define self-government. When an agreement like this is put 
forward does that not aid the members of the Reform Party to see 
what the government means by self-government?
<P>
	Second, if there are perceived problems with the legislation 
what specific measures would the hon. member propose to deal 
with situations like the comprehensive land claim issue?
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments and questions.
<P>
	The one key element that is missing from this agreement, as I 
see it, is the inclusion of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
From looking at the bill and studying it in some detail, that to me 
sticks out more than anything.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5113"> 5113 </A></B>
<P>
	The other part of the question that I would like to answer is 
what we would do or how we would involve this. I do not think 
anybody on this side of the House, certainly in our party, is 
against the theory of some sort of native self-government. The 
problem as I see it is that the process has not been a very open 
process. In my mind it is something that has been rushed for an 
issue of such significance. I think it needs to be opened up to all 
Canadians regardless of what part of the country they live in or 
what their particular personal heritage might be.
<P>
	That is probably the key to this whole issue, that we must 
bring all Canadians into this type of decision-making process. 
Anything short of that will certainly spell disaster for some idea 
or theory that may in fact be a good idea to start with.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.

please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>During the ringing of the bells:</I>
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(5)(a), I have been requested by the chief government 
whip to defer the division until a later time.
<P>
	Accordingly, pursuant to Standing Order 45(6) the division of 
the question now before the House stands deferred until Monday 
at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment at which time the bells 
to call in the members will be sounded for not more than 15 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Pursuant to 
our rules the vote now has to take place on Monday. From our 
position while the bell was ringing we could not ask otherwise. 
However, now that we have officially reconvened I wonder if the 
Chair would seek to determine whether or not there is 
unanimous consent to have the vote at the ordinary time of 
adjournment on Tuesday if there is such consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that Bill C-33, an act to 
approve, give effect to and declare valid land claims agreements 
entered into between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, 
the Government of the Yukon Territory and certain First Nations 
in the Yukon Territory, to provide for approving, giving effect to 
and declaring valid other land claims agreements entered into 
after this act comes into force, and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise 
to address the House on Bill C-33, the Yukon First Nations Land 
Claims Settlement Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government's red book clearly stated our commitment to 
the resolution of outstanding land claims, a commitment we 
intend to meet whenever we can.
<P>
	By settling land claims in a way that is responsible and 
equitable, the government will resolve former differences with 
the First Nations and ensure that old grievances between native 
and non-native people will gradually disappear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nowhere is the need to act more evident than in Yukon. The 
council for Yukon Indians land claim entitled``Together Today 
for our Children Tomorrow'' was accepted by the Government 
of Canada in 1973. It was among the first of the land claims 
accepted by the government and its settlement is long overdue.
<P>
	We have come close in the past. An agreement in principle 
was reached in 1984 but was not ratified by a sufficient number 
of Yukon First Nations to move the process forward toward 
negotiations of a final agreement.
<P>
	Based on the 1988 agreement in principle the Council for 
Yukon Indians and the Governments of Canada and Yukon were 
able to negotiate the Yukon Indian final umbrella agreement. 
That agreement was signed by all three parties in May 1993 and 
is the basis for Bill C-33.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5114"> 5114 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members should realize that the approach to resolving 
land claims in the Yukon clearly differs from what has been done 
elsewhere in Canada. This is due to the simple fact that the 
Yukon is different from all other regions.
<P>
	It is unique in that, first of all, most aboriginal people do not 
live on reserves. As a result, programs and services are 
dispensed by the territorial government with which a close 
relationship exists.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because of the unique situation in Yukon the negotiation of 
the final umbrella agreement was only the first part of the 
settlement process. It remained to conclude land claims 
agreements with each of the 14 Yukon First Nations; four such 
agreements have been reached and will be given effect through 
Bill C-33.
<P>
	Also as part of the settlement process, certain Yukon First 
Nations will be negotiating transboundary agreements to 
resolve overlapping claims with aboriginal groups in the 
Northwest Territories and British Columbia.
<P>
	Throughout the negotiations that have taken place over the 
past two decades, the effected interest groups and the public 
have been consulted extensively. The end result is that we have 
territory-wide support for the settlement agreements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Numerous public hearings were held to discuss the contents of 
the final framework agreement. The Yukon Legislative 
Assembly also set up a special committee on land claims and 
self-government. Based on the favourable response it received 
during its visits to Yukon communities, the committee strongly 
recommended that the four agreements negotiated to date be 
approved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Interest groups have also had direct input to the settlement 
process. A good example of this occurred during the selection of 
settlement lands by the four First Nations that have reached final 
agreement.
<P>
	As part of this process, the Yukon Outfitters Association 
whose members will be affected by the designation of 
settlement lands was widely consulted and was able to negotiate 
compensation for provable losses under the final umbrella 
agreement.
<P>
	First Nations are continuing to work with this association to 
minimize any commercial hardship that may result should the 
agreements come into force during the outfitting season.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We also sought the views and backing of groups representing 
the energy and mining industries. We consulted with all 
municipal governments, churches,  chambers of commerce, 
recreational associations and other groups, and heard some very 
valid comments.
<P>
	With your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote from 
several letters which the government received from Yukon 
organizations. The person signing each letter expressed firm 
support for the land claims settlement agreements and urged 
Parliament to move quickly to pass the enacting legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Anglican Bishop of Yukon, the Right Reverend R.C. 
Ferris, has written to the government on behalf of his diocese. 
Right Reverend Ferris asked that the settlement legislation be 
brought forward without delay and expressed the community's 
distress after so many years of struggle on the part of all parties 
to achieve an acceptable agreement. Settlement legislation is 
not yet a reality.
<P>
	Mr. Dan McDiarmid, chairman of the Mayo District 
Renewable Resources Council, wrote to the minister in April 
stressing the importance of the land claims agreements to 
everyone in Yukon, requesting that the government introduce 
and approve settlement legislation at the earliest possible date.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Yukon Chamber of Mines noted that the land claims 
settlement agreement had the support not only of Yukon natives, 
but also of many other territorial groups, and among others, of 
the mining industry.
<P>
	Mr. Steven Powell, the president of the United Keno Hill 
Mines Limited, sent us the following message: ``Thanks to this 
agreement, Canada will be able to close the door on a difficult 
chapter in the history of its relations with aboriginal peoples. 
Therefore, I urge you to press your colleagues in the Commons 
to debate the matter in a level-headed manner and to endorse 
these agreements''.
<P>
	The entire Yukon Legislative Assembly urged the government 
to act. On April 27, the assembly passed a resolution calling 
upon the minister to urge Parliament to enact the land claims 
settlement legislation. Furthermore, the resolution called upon 
the members: ``-to act expeditiously to adopt the Yukon First 
Nations Land Claims Settlement Act which will safeguard the 
rights and interests of the Yukon's first nations and enable the 
territory to move into the 21st century''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the most candid and compelling letters the government 
has received came from Chief Robert Bruce, Jr., writing on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5115"> 5115 </A></B>
<P>
behalf of the Buntut Gwychin tribal council whose final 
agreement will be given effect by Bill C-33.
<P>
	In his letter to the Prime Minister Chief Bruce stated: ``The 
people of Yukon and the Government of Canada have worked 
very hard to reach the compromises and innovative concepts 
that are embodied in these agreements. It is very important to 
see these efforts translated into action now while enthusiasm 
and expectation are high''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in light of all these comments, it would be 
inconceivable for the House to reject Bill C-33. Clearly, all 
sectors of Yukon society overwhelmingly support the land 
claims settlement act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is good reason for that support. The first four nations 
final agreements that will be given effect by Bill C-33 are good 
agreements. They will bring many social, economic and 
political benefits to the affected Yukon First Nations. They will 
also provide many substantial indirect benefits to 
non-aboriginal residents of the territory.
<P>
	Yukoners are now calling on Parliament to do its work, to give 
this legislation speedy passage so that it can get on with the job 
of building a stronger, more prosperous future. I can see no other 
reasonable or responsible course of action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised this evening at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra-Rwanda; the hon. member for Verchères-Trade; the 
hon. member for Peace River-National Defence.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have something to ask you. My 
hon. colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley must catch 
a plane and, if you have no objection, I agreed to give him the 
floor immediately. I would like to come back and respond to the 
speech given by the hon. member on behalf of the minister. I 
would be very grateful if you told me whether I can use up to 40 
minutes which are allotted to me for a reply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Certainly I am only too 
pleased to follow the agreement. I thank all members for that 
sense of co-operation in the House and I will recognize at this 
time the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my deepest appreciation to my colleagues from the 
Bloc. I really appreciate that.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	We are debating Bill C-33 today. It is probably appropriate, 
and it would be the best possible direction to take on the bill, to 
draw some comparisons between Bill C-33 and Bill C-16.
<P>
	I know the Yukon natives involved in the negotiation of Bill 
C-33 overwhelmingly support the bill. There is no doubt about 
that. It appears that they would be more than satisfied with this 
settlement. However I believe that we as parliamentarians, as 
duty bound by the people of the country, would be more than 
negligent, as have past parties in the House, if we did not address 
some of the problems contained within Bill C-33.
<P>
	Certainly my colleagues and I in the Reform Party are most 
willing to entertain the concepts of aboriginal self-sufficiency 
and aboriginal self-determination, but only in situations and 
only under the clear focus that aboriginal people or the Yukon 
natives will come to a position of self-sufficiency within 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Most unfortunately Bill C-33 does not address that focus. Bill 
C-33 like Bill C-16 calls for more bureaucracy, large settlement 
moneys, continued DIAND participation in programs, financial 
assistance and future negotiation for self-government. The 
bureaucracy possible within the agreement is very extensive.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party greatly fear that as we proceed along 
the path to establishing land claims and aboriginal 
self-government the bureaucracy will create such an expensive 
and complex deterrent to the goal of self-sufficiency. It is 
necessary to address that.
<P>
	I want to look at Bill C-33 for a moment and talk about the 
package itself. There are some 8,000 Yukon Indians in Yukon 
out of a total population of 32,000 people. They will be 
conveyed collectively ownership of some 16,000 square miles 
or 41,400 square kilometres of land, 10,000 square miles of 
which include all subsurface rights and the remaining 6,000 
square miles of which include some subsurface rights.
<P>
	In addition, the federal government will pay some $242.6 
million in cash and the Yukon First Nations will receive rental 
revenues from surface leases, royalties and development of 
non-renewable resources. Yukon First Nations will also receive 
a preferential share in wildlife harvesting, exclusive harvesting 
over most of their settlement lands, and 70 per cent of their trap 
lines will be located in the larger traditional territories.
<P>
	On top of all this, under the bill all existing government 
programs for natives and non-natives will continue to apply. 
How could we have a focus on arriving at a settlement for land 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5116"> 5116 </A></B>
<P>
claims if coupled with that settlement are promises for 
continued future federal funding?
<P>
	The object of settling land claims is to break the dependency 
of the native people upon the federal government. We want to 
give them the opportunity to become self-sufficient. As my hon. 
colleague talked about this morning, we cannot break that 
dependency cycle if we continue to give money and funding to a 
person or a group such as the Yukon natives. That dependency 
cycle has to be broken. The goal has to be self-sufficiency. To 
include in the agreement the same federal funding that exists 
now is no incentive to create self-sufficiency.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Another area of concern is that although Bill C-33 has come 
to the House for debate, and certainly we in the Reform Party 
welcome the debate, the other 10 land claim agreements spoken 
about in the bill and yet to be negotiated need only be approved 
by order in council. In other words, we will not be given the 
opportunity in the House to debate those land claim settlements. 
We are talking about thousands of square miles of land and 
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Surely the people 
paying the bill, the taxpayers of the country, have a right to be 
represented in the House by members who debate the good 
points and the bad points of the bill.
<P>
	The bill guarantees that future land claims under Bill C-33 
would be negotiated in the offices that we cannot get to. I believe 
Canadian taxpayers deserve more than that. We are trusted by 
them. We were elected and sent here by them to look after their 
affairs. This is certainly something of major concern to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I want to talk about the constitutional entrenchment. By virtue 
of clause 6 of the bill the rights contained in the land claim 
agreements are recognized and affirmed under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. We are very uncertain as to what this 
means and we are relatively certain that the government is 
uncertain as to what this means. It may mean these rights are not 
amendable except by constitutional amendment or, at the very 
least, without the concurrence of the first nation involved.
<P>
	This would mean that these rights are beyond the reach of 
ordinary future parliamentary amendment. This adds the 
element of finality to them that does not sit well for changing 
future circumstances. The circumstances are changing all the 
time. In our Constitution we have the mechanism to make 
amendments, to be able to change our Constitution with the 
times. Bill C-33 in our opinion does not provide for changes to 
meet future circumstances which may appear. Quite frankly we 
think the government displays a tremendous amount of 
arrogance to lock in forever today's government policy. The 
constitutional entrenchment causes a lot of concern.
<P>
	I spoke about the comparison between Bill C-33 and Bill 
C-16. I talked about the boards, the commissions and the 
councils. Bill C-33 would formally constitute five more 
government boards and two government councils referred to in 
the various land claim agreements. Presumably most, if not all, 
of the functions of these new bodies are presently performed by 
the facilities of the  Yukon and federal governments. Is there a 
need for more regulatory bodies, support staff and bureaucracy 
on top of what is already in place?
<P>
	Clause 9(4) constitutes still more boards, commissions and 
councils that may be referred in future land claim agreements. 
As I stated, the bureaucracy concerned in Bill C-16 is 
predominantly present in Bill C-33. This is not the way to get 
best value for our dollars.
<P>
	The government has talked about downsizing government, 
downsizing departments and downsizing the way government 
runs so that it can be more cost effective. The government, the 
Reform Party and the Official Opposition have been talking 
about downsizing, becoming more efficient and more cost 
effective.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-33 goes exactly in the opposite direction. It calls for a 
larger bureaucracy, a larger government, more costs and less 
cost effectiveness. This is an area in which the government has 
done a flip-flop if it believes in downsizing. It has done a 
complete about turn.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the transfer of full 
ownership. The implementation of full ownership of the 
property has gone far beyond what any court in Canada has 
found to constitute aboriginal title. No court in Canada of which 
I am aware has decided that an aboriginal interest in land goes so 
far as to entitle aboriginal people to fee simple or full 
ownership. At best our courts have found the meaning of 
aboriginal rights and title to include those traditional activities 
carried on by native communities prior to colonial contact. 
These include hunting, fishing, et cetera.
<P>
	These rights have been characterized by the courts as not, 
strictly speaking, being interest in land but all special rights 
unique to the native people. This represents a cloud on the 
crown's title. The courts have gone on to say that the cloud can 
be removed by the exercise of crown sovereignty through 
legislation that has a clear intention to remove the aboriginal 
interest.
<P>
	There is a challenge to the aboriginal land claims presently in 
the court of B.C. It is a challenge to a ruling by Chief Justice 
McEachern in which his decision was that there was no valid 
legal basis for the land claim in question. The fact the 
government now proposes to bypass an undecided court ruling 
by means of Bill C-33, a ruling that is still under appeal, causes 
a lot of concern for us.
<P>
	I said that the focus of land claims should be on the 
eventuality of self-sufficiency for the aboriginal people. No one 
can deny that every Canadian wants to see that come about. It 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5117"> 5117 </A></B>
<P>
not come about until the aboriginal peoples of the country are 
given an opportunity and the dependency cycle would be 
broken.
<P>
	In other words, we have no problem with settling land claims 
with aboriginal people whatsoever. We have a problem with the 
inclusion in land claim settlements that government funding 
would continue exactly as always. This is an area of concern. I 
urge the government to do the right thing: to help aboriginal 
people become self-sufficient.
<P>
	The government has the power to break the dependency cycle. 
That is what it should be doing. It is like when I was trying to 
teach my children the value of becoming independent and 
responsible for their own lives. What if I had continued giving 
them everything they wanted without asking them to take 
responsibility and to begin to understand what it means to strive 
and to work and the value of education to make themselves more 
independent? If I had not done that they would be still dependent 
on me and, quite frankly, at the age my sons are I am looking 
forward to the time when they will be independent of me. That is 
what I have been striving for. That is what the government has to 
do in connection with these land claims. They have to break the 
dependency cycle.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I strongly want to urge members of the House to focus on that. 
Let us not be swayed by the emotional part of this whole native 
issue. Let us focus on what should result out of this process. The 
aboriginal people should have the opportunity to become 
self-sufficient. Let us break the dependency cycle. Let us not 
make agreements or contracts that will drive a wedge further 
between Canadian society and the aboriginal people. Let us seek 
to tear down the barriers that exist and that does not mean 
continuing to fund native programs forever and ever.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see members seeking the 
floor. The House might keep in mind that the first three speakers 
on this legislation at this time have up to 40 minutes to speak 
without question or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, true to 
form, I will state forthwith the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Following discussions with appropriate authorities, the Bloc 
will support Bill C-33.
<P>
	I take this opportunity, while the cameras are on me, to pay 
my respects to the people from the Yukon both at home and in 
the gallery. Their perseverance is rewarded today, after twenty 
some years of discussions, with agreements that will be given 
effect by Bill C-33.
<P>
	As I said when I spoke to Bill C-34, perseverance is one of the 
characteristic traits of native culture. We often think in terms of 
future generations and these peoples must be commended for 
their perseverance. Year after year, decade after decade, they 
persevered in their pacific approach toward a potential 
agreement. Here it is today. I am pleased to greet and 
congratulate them.
<P>
	A number of things were said in this place this morning as 
well as this afternoon. I may have given my speaking time up to 
my colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley but 
understandably, it does not mean that I agree with every single 
remark he made.
<P>
	I heard someone say: ``I gave my son a bicycle as a child; 
then, he asked for a motorcycle''. To listen to the people across 
the way, you would think that native peoples, Indians and first 
nations are nothing but spoiled children. I want to make it quite 
clear that I do not agree with that opinion.
<P>
	I think we must bear in mind the social contract they have 
concluded with us, white people, people with our own laws, 
procedures and parliamentary democracy. We must also bear in 
mind that we settled on their land. Let us not forget that these 
nations have been established in the Yukon Territory for 10,000 
years. They were here long before us. Yet, we have enjoyed the 
use of that land. Regarding the financial compensation provided 
for in this agreement today, I do not think it is really a matter of 
giving them everything they want and them more or less rubbing 
us of these $240 million. It is more a matter of recognizing the 
fact that for generations, for decades, in fact since the Europeans 
set foot on this continent, we have enjoyed the use of this land 
and are now granting appropriate compensation.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, the native peoples are no spoiled 
children. They are people perfectly capable of negotiating. They 
are very good at it too, as I have seen for myself on many 
occasions. Having been a negotiator myself for 20 years, I must 
admit that while being pacifists, they are formidable 
negotiators.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We must also understand that with an agreement such as the 
one before the House today and with this enacting legislation, 
the objectives of the two parties have not been fully met. At best, 
they agreed on a common denominator, this agreement before us 
which to my mind is the end result of discussions between 
persons who took care to ensure that they had all they needed in 
the way of services from legal or consulting firms.
<P>
	Far be it for me to think that the first nations are merely being 
treated like children who have grown up and are finally being 
allowed to fly on their own. Basically, I believe that this is a 
good agreement for the people of the Yukon and I also think it is 
good for the Parliament of Canada. These are very important 
considerations.
<P>
	Mention is often made of ending the guardianship. I believe 
we need to discuss how to go about doing this. Some people may 
argue that the agreement and legislation before us do not end the 
guardianship and naturally, I disagree with them. I think this 
agreement enables the first nations of the Yukon to take charge 
of their own destiny, much like Bill C-34 adopted on second 
reading speaks about self-government. Certain powers are 
being given to these nations and the logical follow-up to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5118"> 5118 </A></B>
<P>
Bill C-33 would be to give them the land base over which to 
exercise these rights.
<P>
	Therefore, I feel that this agreement is one way to end the 
state of guardianship and as everyone knows, particularly those 
who took part in the negotiations on the native side, no set 
pattern of self-government or land base has yet been decided on.
<P>
	It is clear from this agreement that the land in question is 
splintered. The government did not take one piece of the 
Northwest Territories or one piece of the Yukon and say ``Here, 
this is yours now'', as it did with other agreements or with the 
Sahtu Tribal Council. In those cases, a homogenous parcel of 
land was turned over and the people were told that they could 
exercise certain powers within that territory, based on 
agreements that were reached.
<P>
	As I said, the government has not taken a general or uniform 
approach. What we have here is a splintered agreement between 
the government and four first nations of the Yukon. They have 
finalized agreements with the federal government and made 
decisions about the land involved. Ten other agreements are 
slated to follow.
<P>
	When I hear that these ten other agreements will be negotiated 
behind closed doors, I have to disagree with that way of seeing 
things. On reading the text of the four agreements before us, we 
see that they are virtually identical.
<P>
	So of course, subsequent agreements are likely to be carbon 
copies of these four ones. I think we should take the time to look 
at the contents of this agreement which the legislation enacts. 
Exactly what provisions are being enacted today?
<P>
	The agreement involves a total area of 41,439 square 
kilometres which, as I said earlier, cover a broad area. If one 
first nation was able to prove to federal negotiators that its 
traditional lands were located in area X and the government 
agreed, then these lands are included in the final agreement with 
that first nation.
<P>
	We have here before us today an final umbrella agreement 
which covers all land claims for a total area of 41,439 square 
kilometres which the federal negotiators have agreed to make 
available to 14 first nations. Four have already availed 
themselves of this right and have negotiated final land claims 
agreements with the federal government.
<P>
	Regarding the government's economic proposal, as I 
mentioned earlier, this is not simply a matter of extending 
charity. For decades, even centuries, from the moment the 
Europeans arrived on this continent, we have benefitted from 
these lands.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Today, we give back to them a number of settlement lands 
with compensation in the order of $242 million over 15 years. In 
my opinion, that does not necessarily keep these people under 
trusteeship because, as we will see later, they will have 
capabilities. They will have at  their disposal financial 
structures that will administer this money and free them from 
this dependence in which we have kept them for too long.
<P>
	We also see that the lands given back will be divided into 
Class A and Class B lands. It may be important to explain the 
difference between the two classes.
<P>
	On Class A lands, people will have not only surface rights but 
also subsurface rights, including mining, minerals and oil. That 
is not to be sneezed at either. Not only are we liberating them by 
compensating them for what we took from them before, but we 
also give them the right to administer surface and subsurface 
resources on some settlement lands. It is another step toward the 
goal of freeing them from this trusteeship.
<P>
	The agreement contains interesting clauses which I must 
point out.
<P>
	Earlier I referred in passing to the final umbrella agreement 
but I would like to come back to it. We have before us today four 
final agreements for the four Yukon nations who negotiated and 
reached a settlement with the government. All future 
agreements will always have to refer to the final umbrella 
agreement covering all 14 final agreements, one for each nation. 
It may be important to point this out.
<P>
	Regulatory agreements-this is important-will be 
guaranteed under Section 35 of the 1982 Constitution Act. 
Unlike Bill C-34, where Section 35 does not apply to 
modern-day treaties, these agreements on the land base will be 
protected under Section 35 of the 1982 Constitution Act.
<P>
	The agreement also outlines some interesting options I would 
like to point out. Among other things, people will have some 
time to decide whether or not they want continued protection 
under the Indian Act, particularly with respect to Indian 
reserves. In other words, there are two options. The people will 
have the option of preserving the Indian reserve concept for a 
while. The other option will be that of settlement lands, meaning 
that they will move away from the Indian Act and the reserve 
concept and exercise their full autonomy on settlement lands, 
which are different from Indian reserves.
<P>
	This whole agreement, of course, required a lot of mapping 
and surveying work. Today, I would like to dispel a rumour that 
circulated in the Yukon. I am mentioning it at this time because 
people in the Yukon are now watching us. The Bloc Quebecois 
has never considered for one second blocking the introduction 
and first reading of a bill because maps had not been translated. 
We admittedly consulted the party, but we never thought of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5119"> 5119 </A></B>
<P>
blocking an agreement that took decades to negotiate just 
because maps had not been translated.
<P>
	The document before us is printed in English and in French. 
As far as we know, we told the minister we would appreciate it if 
he could have the maps translated as soon as possible. But in the 
meantime, we will not tell people who have been waiting for so 
long that we will not even let the bill pass first reading. That was 
out of the question.
<P>
	I must point out today that the Bloc Quebecois did in fact 
agree to the introduction and first reading of this bill. The 
agreement also contains many interesting things such as the 
special management areas.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	You know that we whites and the natives agree on certain 
territories. There are boundaries and limits on these territories. 
This applies very well in a city or municipality, but in the wide 
open spaces of the Yukon, it is obviously hard to apply, 
especially for everything that has to do with wildlife, flora, 
fauna, the natural environment.
<P>
	I give the Porcupine caribou herd as an example. It is very 
difficult to ask the caribou herd in the Northwest Territories in 
the spring not to go to the Yukon in the fall and not to go to 
Alaska because of the U.S. border. We understand that there will 
be specialized management areas. What is interesting about it is 
that it again highlights the traditional aspect of native peoples. 
Some areas will be specialized to concentrate on the local flora 
and fauna.
<P>
	Another interesting point is the great emphasis put on land 
use. I was just telling you that it is a fragmented agreement; 
eventually 14 nations will have territories that are not 
necessarily contiguous. In some areas, native self-government 
will not apply and the Yukon first nations will not have a land 
base.
<P>
	However, the agreement provides a process to ensure 
compatibility in decision making so as to avoid grey areas where 
the local authorities could make laws or regulations that would 
impinge on their neighbours. A process has been put in place for 
that and it is worth mentioning.
<P>
	This process takes the Yukon Indians' cultural values into 
very serious consideration. It is very interesting because for 
once it lends weight to sustainable development, a concept of 
great importance to me. Our consumer society has too long 
overlooked the concept of sustainable development. We build 
and develop rapidly, often at the expense of the environment, 
and then we find that the environment has been destroyed. The 
economy enjoyed a boom and then declined when the resources 
on the surface and underground were completely used up. So 
sustainable development is a cornerstone of land use. We note 
that very great importance is given to sustainable development. 
We must be glad that this concept of sustainable development is 
in this agreement.
<P>
	There will also be a development activities commission. This 
in a way is what I have always called a  happy marriage of the 
traditional and of modern economic development. All the 
economic activities that developers want to propose on the lands 
covered by the agreement or on the reserves will have to be 
submitted to a development activities review board. Of course, 
we can see that sustainable development will be a key, as I said 
earlier, but the traditional methods and culture of these peoples 
will be taken into account. The agreement provides that 
developers will have to reduce the environmental impact of their 
projects so that this happy blend of the traditional and modern 
economic development is an everyday reality.
<P>
	I think that another very important commission for them is the 
Fish and Wildlife Management Board. In the agreement, the 
federal government agreed to set up a joint fund to restore and 
rebuild everything that has to do with wildlife, fish and flora. 
We know that unfortunate developments in some areas depleted 
the resources on the surface or underground. The Fish and 
Wildlife Management Board will seek to restore the resources 
which have characterized the Yukon for centuries.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	A great deal of attention should also be paid to their heritage. 
That is something which is not often talked about and I am 
pleased to address this subject, as I did in my speech on Bill 
C-34. All issues related to language will be extremely important 
on those lands.
<P>
	I must, once again, draw an analogy between the Quebec 
people, a French-speaking minority in the vast country that is 
Canada, and the aboriginal nations who are also linguistic 
minorities. So I am happy for them that attention was paid to 
their languages and traditions. As far as I am concerned, their 
rich traditions often add to my own culture.
<P>
	I have noticed among other things that legends are very 
important to them. What could be nicer than a legend told in a 
traditional language spoken by the ancestors? That is provided 
for in the agreement. It is not the federal negotiators, I am sure, 
who insisted on inserting these provisions in the agreement as 
such. I think these people felt their culture was very important 
and saw to it that it was protected, just as we Quebecers want to 
preserve our culture. I think we ought to congratulate them for 
their similar views on this issue.
<P>
	These people are not hegemonic because it is not a part of 
their culture. When the Europeans arrived, they did not object to 
sharing their huge territory. This attitude is reflected in the 
agreement: there will be quite reasonable access for all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5120"> 5120 </A></B>
<P>
people who want to go to the Yukon. Obviously, we will not need 
a visa or a passport to travel to the Yukon.
<P>
	By the way, I have been invited to go fishing for 25-pound 
trout in the Yukon-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Invite us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> -I will be pleased to accept the invitation and 
I will not need a passport or visa to go there. I intend to go and 
see for myself whether this is really true, because people who go 
fishing often like to brag about the fish they caught, and when 
they do not have a photograph, they often say the fish was that 
long. I intend to find out whether what they said about fish 
weighing 25 pounds is true, and I promise to get back to the 
House on this and tell you whether there was some truth in all 
this.
<P>
	Oral traditions are also a very important part of their heritage. 
Nowadays, we have the tendency to say: I'm buying a house. 
Now, I would like to see what the last contract, the contract with 
the previous owner, looked like''. They, however, have an oral 
tradition. We used to have that in our society as well, a long time 
ago, but today, that has been lost as a result of our whole legal 
perspective. But to them, oral traditions are very important.
<P>
	They often have agreements without having a contract as 
such. As far as their heritage is concerned, they reserve the right 
to emphasize such agreements, and I think they are right. There 
will be a water management board, because the waters of the 
Yukon are very special. There is very little pollution in the 
Yukon, and some people would like to take advantage of this. 
For instance, our American friends might want to import water. 
This is something we are hearing more and more in some parts of 
the United States where the water table is going down. People 
often talk about diverting certain waterways to try and get more 
water.
<P>
	The agreement states that as far as domestic needs are 
concerned, there is no problem. However, to handle specific 
needs, the people in the Yukon decided to set up a water 
management board. To me that is not a bureaucracy, because 
one-third of the board will consist of members appointed among 
aboriginal people, which is one way for aboriginal people to 
control their own affairs.
<P>
	We see this as a way to stop having all the decisions made by 
Ottawa and then transmitted to regional headquarters and from 
there to the Indians or aboriginal peoples or First Nations. And 
now, the government says the will boards will be created.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	You want boards to protect your waterways and your 
environment, so the government will ensure that most of the 
people on those boards will be local people who are 
knowledgeable about the area.
<P>
	I do not think we are getting a new bureaucracy as much as 
more effective management, because these will be local people 
who know their area, and we hope this will help to dismantle the 
Department of Indian Affairs and the Indian Act as soon as 
possible, and what the  people of the Yukon proposed is a step in 
the right direction. As I said earlier, there are provisions on fish 
and wildlife on class A lands where they will have exclusive 
harvesting privileges. The agreement maintains 70 per cent of 
the trap lines, which was very important for them because this is 
one of their traditional activities.
<P>
	Forestry is also an interesting area, and here I would like to 
draw an analogy, using forestry as an example. Aboriginal 
people often say that they see the world as a big forest. In a 
forest, there are many kinds of trees, like pine and maple, and 
they often say that the way they see the forest is more or less the 
way they see society. I wanted to draw this analogy, because to 
them, the forest is a vital resource, and the fact that this resource 
is also included in the agreement means that these people will 
have better control over their forest resources. I mentioned 
economic development, and the hon. member on the 
government side also raised the matter of transboundary 
agreements. These people will be able to take a part in 
transboundary agreements. For instance, as I said before, we 
have the Porcupine caribou herd, and these herds do not 
necessarily stay within certain borders. Since for aboriginal 
people, the caribou is part and parcel of their traditions, it is 
important for them to participate in discussions on 
transboundary agreements and the Porcupine caribou herd.
<P>
	Incidentally, we must conclude agreements with the 
Americans because the caribou herds that migrate through the 
Yukon Territory spend part of the year in Alaska, and the 
Americans are thinking very seriously about developing 
Alaska's oil and mineral resources. That is why it is important 
for First Nations in the Yukon to be able to participate in 
transboundary agreements. An example that comes immediately 
to mind is the caribou herds.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to say once again that I want to 
congratulate the First Nations of Yukon on signing the 
agreement. And I want to say to them that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-33. And as I said earlier, these people stood 
their ground, they were painstaking and stubborn and probably 
very hard on the federal negotiators who, I am sure, returned the 
compliment, and in spite of all that, there was no hostility. And 
as I said when we considered Bill C-34, and I say it again now, 
with respect to Bill C-33, there are aboriginal peoples that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5121"> 5121 </A></B>
<P>
would be well advised to follow the example of the people of the 
Yukon and the First Nations of the Yukon and persevere in their 
land claims and their demands for self-government, but 
peacefully, which can be very difficult when it comes time to 
negotiate.
<P>
	However, taking up arms in a modern society, whether we are 
talking about aboriginal people or white people, is hardly if at 
all acceptable, and these people have demonstrated in what will 
become another historic turning point, that thanks to their 
perseverance and their ability to negotiate, they concluded an 
agreement that was satisfactory to all concerned, an agreement 
that was welcomed by many people in the Yukon, including the 
territorial government and mining companies involved in 
mining exploration in the Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Once again, these people have demonstrated that 
co-operation exists in the Yukon. They made that clear, and I 
think we have cause to welcome Bill C-33.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say to the people of the Yukon that 
they can count on the support of the Bloc Quebecois for the 
passage of Bill C-33.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset let me say that the Reform Party believes in the 
self-reliance of natives in the Yukon. The difficulties that we 
have with this bill are on the generosity aspect.
<P>
	To begin with, I am concerned with the general direction of 
this bill because it sets a precedent and, along with other bills 
such as the Nunavut deal that was brought in by the 
Conservatives, C-16, the Sahtu, these are overly generous 
settlements to small numbers of people.
<P>
	If you look at the Canadian map, you start to see the jigsaw 
puzzle that is put together, individual bits and pieces. However, 
if put all together it is very clear that the area in Canada north of 
60 is very quickly being set aside in land claims. There is little 
regard for the implications on non-native Canadians because 
these agreements have implications for both native and 
non-native Canadians. We have to look at it from that aspect.
<P>
	It appears that this government may be sleepwalking toward a 
disaster with this overly generous land settlement plan. The 
generosity of this agreement is somewhat ridiculous because it 
has no basis in fact and no basis in law.
<P>
	We do not state that there should not be a settlement. That is 
not the point. We are saying that the size of this settlement is 
clearly overly generous. In fact we could say that this settlement 
is far too liberal. It is the kind of agreement that will drive a 
wedge between native and non-native Canadians.
<P>
	To give some statistics, this agreement gives 17,275 square 
kilometres or 6,670 square miles to these four Yukon native 
groups. Out of this area, 12,000 square kilometres or nearly 
5,000 square miles includes the mining and mineral rights. That 
is 6,670 square miles for 2,457 individuals or each individual 
getting about 3 square miles of land.
<P>
	This settlement deals with only four of the bands out of 14. 
There are still 10 more claims to be negotiated. If these groups 
are to realize similar agreements then I have to ask this 
government where the land will come from. Certainly to grant 
similar agreements to the 10 remaining groups will cover the 
entire Yukon Territory and possibly more.
<P>
	I will go back to my jigsaw puzzle because it is starting to 
appear that each piece is falling into place, only the whole 
northern top end of Canada is being taken up.
<P>
	What about the land rights of non-native Canadians here? 
When will this government look at the developments that are 
going on in the rest of the world? The policy that we are talking 
about here today is based on race. The rest of the world is going 
toward equality. We see it all over the world. I have to question 
why this bill and the self-government bill are going against that 
when the rest of the world is going for, the equality of all its 
citizens.
<P>
	What about the non-native Canadians who spent their lives in 
the Yukon? Where do they fit in? That is unclear. What will 
happen if some of these people are in an area where the land 
claims go through the area? What if they are displaced? Will 
they be compensated? Have they been consulted?
<P>
	On the consultation process the government has said, yes, it 
has consulted with the people. However, my understanding is 
that it is a fairly broad consultation on very fuzzy ideas like: Are 
you in favour of native self-government? Yes. Are you in favour 
of settling the land claims? Yes.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The detail of these settlements has not been made public to my 
understanding. What will happen to the current landholders? If 
you own a house, a ranch, a trapline or whatever and it is covered 
by a land claim, whose law do you answer to? Is it the Canadian 
law? Is it native law? Is it a combination of both? I can see a 
nightmare of bureaucracy running through this whole situation.
<P>
	There are not only native land claims. There are numerous 
more land claims that have to be settled. This precedent setting 
legislation that we are looking at is exceedingly dangerous in 
that each band will look at this as an agreement and say: ``We 
want at least as much if not more''. We are on the tracks heading 
to an area where we are going to have some huge disagreements.
<P>
	Some of the areas that I have talked about before like the 
Nunavut deal that covered the eastern Arctic, the Inuvialuit deal 
that was the western Arctic, the Gwich'in agreement in the 
Mackenzie River delta, are all parts of this puzzle that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5122"> 5122 </A></B>
<P>
falling into place. Again it appears that this government's goal 
is to blanket the Canadian north with these settlement 
agreements.
<P>
	Let us go back in time because Canada is a nation of 
immigrants. We are all immigrants whether we arrived here 
first, second, third or just recently landed. Every one of us 
including natives has come to this country from somewhere 
else. Some of us have come for economic reasons. Some have 
come to join loved ones and some of us have had the good 
fortune to be born here.
<P>
	Many immigrants have come here because they were 
persecuted somewhere else and Canada has opened its doors. 
What are we offering? We are offering equality for everyone. 
That is where we should be going today with these settlements. 
The first people in this country should not have any more rights 
or any fewer rights than other Canadians.
<P>
	Moreover I do not think that the government is really aware of 
the extent of this settlement. According to the final umbrella 
agreement, $242.6 million in cash compensation will be divided 
among the 14 native groups to be paid over 15 years. That results 
in about $30,000 per individual. Thirty thousand dollars is a nice 
lump sum when one's house is paid for and the government is 
still continuing to pay the other bills.
<P>
	How is this money going to be divided? When I talked earlier 
on the self-government bill, it became clear that the charter 
does not apply. We have huge sums of money and huge tracts of 
land that are going to be looked at and overseen by groups of 
people.
<P>
	One of the biggest concerns that people had with the old 
Indian affairs act was that a native on a reserve did not own the 
land. He could not go to the bank and say: ``I own this chunk of 
land''. It is going to be the same thing as I understand it with 
these deals.
<P>
	What about an individual native owning the land that he is on. 
This is where we start to get self-esteem. If it is owned by the 
band, if it is owned by an umbrella group, again we run into 
difficulties because it is not covered in the charter.
<P>
	Does this government know the potential of the mining rights 
that are given in this deal? I made some phone calls to some 
mining people to find out and they are unclear where it is going. 
They do not know the potential of the mining claims in the 
Yukon. Because of uncertainty, a lot of the claims have been 
basically set back. Exploration has been set back.
<P>
	The government does not know the value of what it is deeding 
away. Included in these four agreements is the option to acquire 
up to 25 per cent of the royalties held by the Yukon government, 
its agencies or corporations in future non-renewable resource 
development and hydro projects in the traditional territories.
<P>
	Again, can the government tell the Canadian people what the 
values of these royalties are? I rather doubt it. We do not know 
what kind of money we are talking about here. One of the 
agreements, the Champagne agreement, provides for economic 
development agreements within the federal government to 
provide  technical and financial assistance for economic 
development purposes.
<P>
	How much assistance are we talking about? Does this mean 
unlimited loans? What are the guidelines? Again, where is the 
equality here? There should be the same rights and privileges for 
natives as for non-natives in the area.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I question if this government had any idea of the actual 
proportion of transfer payments involved. In fact, I wonder if 
anyone knows. I fail to see how this government can justify the 
royalties to this House and to the Canadian people. We know it is 
going to be asked by the Canadian people to justify it.
<P>
	In addition the federal government will continue to support all 
the present and future programs. Again how are we getting to 
self-sufficiency? Getting the land, getting the money, yet the 
programs continue to be ongoing. This does not bode well for 
getting self-sufficiency of individual natives.
<P>
	The minister states that these agreements give aboriginal 
beneficiaries the means to become self-reliant, to regain a 
measure of control over their lives. My colleagues and I are in 
complete support of such an end. We recognize the need for all 
Canadians to become self-reliant and to gain control over their 
lives.
<P>
	We would support such an agreement that would actually 
fulfil such a goal that is beneficial to natives and non-natives 
alike. However, this agreement moves in a very different 
direction. The granting of all this money, all the land or 
continuing to provide the same programs and benefits will 
nurture dependency and in no way fosters any measure of 
independence. Rather it would seem that by giving out these 
huge sums of money and land this agreement removes the 
incentive.
<P>
	The agreement takes away the motivation for these people to 
gain their own self-respect and self-worth as individuals. This 
agreement does not allow the natives to make their own way and 
to succeed on their own. It is the old Indian act again.
<P>
	There is no indication anywhere in this agreement of any 
intention to phase out financial assistance and government 
native programs if the terms of the agreement prove it 
successful.
<P>
	For all the money that this agreement deals with there is no 
justification to state why this money is being awarded. What is 
the rationale? It concerns me that this agreement sets a very bad 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5123"> 5123 </A></B>
<P>
precedent for fiscal responsibility in future government 
negotiations for many, many more land claim deals and 
agreements with natives.
<P>
	There are many concerns about the management of both the 
funds and land base, concerns raised by natives themselves 
because settlement dollars and land title are not vested in the 
individuals. They are vested in the organizations as I said 
earlier.
<P>
	This huge conveyance is far too generous and the entire deal 
should be re-examined to bring the agreement into reality. I 
stress again it is the size of this agreement that we are concerned 
with.
<P>
	What are the rights of the non-natives in this agreement? That 
needs to be spelled out. Some of these agreements are providing 
for exclusive harvesting rights in the parks and in the territories. 
Where do the non-natives come into this? What are their rights?
<P>
	Natives are granted guaranteed participation in commercial 
fresh water salmon fishery and sports fishing, adventure travel, 
forestry, outfitting and campsite operations in the traditional 
territories. Does this mean that they have exclusive rights? That 
is unclear. Once again the rights are given out on the basis of 
race. When the world is moving toward equality of all its 
citizens this government seems to want to move away from that 
direction and go on to a basis of creating two nations with the 
nation of Canada.
<P>
	I am particularly concerned about the backlash from 
non-native Canadians. This government with this agreement is 
going to drive a wedge between these two peoples. What was 
supposed to be a program to assist natives in B.C. in the 
aboriginal fisheries strategy is a good example. It is native 
fishermen and non-native fishermen. Twenty-five per cent of 
the fishery is native. They worked together for generations and 
did just fine until the aboriginal fisheries strategy came in. It 
drove a wedge between those two groups of people who got 
along for years and years. This is the same type of thinking I see 
in this agreement.
<P>
	I will be very surprised if this government can provide all of 
the answers here. Hopefully when it is addressed in committee a 
number of these issues will be brought forth and will be 
addressed rather than rubber-stamped.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	There is tremendous concern on the part of all Canadians who 
are not opposed to this settlement in principle but they do not 
like the generous deals. This agreement has to be re-examined 
in committee, it has to be re-examined here, the whole thinking 
process has to be looked at again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one thing that I have noticed as I sat through the debate 
today is that the bill uses the term First Nations throughout. It 
describes these 14 bands not necessarily as bands but as First 
Nations. Similarly the members of these First Nations are 
described as citizens of First Nations.
<P>
	Although the term First Nation has been loosely bandied 
about lately and is in common practice, to my  knowledge this is 
the first time that it has been formally referred to in federal 
legislation. It gives rise to a number of questions that I have and 
I would ask the hon. member's opinion of some of these 
questions.
<P>
	First, are native people in Yukon now to have two kinds of 
citizenship extended to them under what we perceive as 
Canadian law? If that is the case, would that not be conflicting 
allegiances? This is a problem that I have had as I have sat 
through this debate today and listened very carefully.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if he would like to comment. I 
would like to hear his comments on those types of allegiance, 
and the conflict that might arise should that be the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> I thank the member for his question. It brings 
very much to the fore the tying together of these two bills, native 
self-government and the land deal.
<P>
	The member is absolutely right. We appear to be setting two 
different nations within a nation with these two pieces of 
legislation. The bills tie together, they are intertwined. I fully 
believe, as I have said a number of times, that we are going the 
wrong direction. We are only one nation. We cannot be people 
from Quebec, people from the Yukon, people from other parts of 
Canada; we are all Canadians.
<P>
	The push to pass this legislation, in my mind, is going away 
from the direction of equality toward a self-government that 
cannot be defined. We have asked the government on a number 
of occasions to please define their view of what is 
self-government. Is it a municipality? Is it provincial, is it 
federal; what is the umbrella approach? We cannot get those 
answers.
<P>
	Until we can get those answers, until Canadians can sit down 
and see what they are looking at, what we are voting on, it is so 
vague, so loose, it can be manipulated by virtually any party that 
is part of the agreement.
<P>
	It is paramount that we should be going toward equality. We 
should be going toward a fair settlement that puts all of us on an 
equal basis.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
intrigued by the questioning about First Nations. We are indeed 
talking about First Nations. These were the first people on this 
continent. They are not one nation, they are many nations, and I 
think it is only right that people have the opportunity to name 
themselves.
<P>
	I was in northern Sweden and you are probably familiar with 
the term Laplander. Laplanders did not name themselves 
Laplanders, they call themselves Sami which means the people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5124"> 5124 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a bit of confusion here around this issue. This is not 
just a trendy little name that has been bandied about; this is a 
name that the indigenous people of North America have chosen 
for themselves, First Nations, and we use it out of respect.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	When we talk about treating people equally, and that is 
absolutely the point here, we have to understand the historical 
roots of discrimination, the barriers to discrimination, the 
systemic aspects of discrimination. These are not conquered 
people. These people had treaties, agreements with our 
government and rightfully they are seeking what is theirs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> I thank the member for her question. We have a 
differing point of view which often happens in the House.
<P>
	I will not be using the term First Nation because to me it 
implies a second nation and a third nation. There is only one one 
nation of Canada. That to me is equality. It is all of us together. It 
is not a slight on our native peoples. If there is a First Nation, 
what is the second, what is the third and what are the different 
rights? There are no different rights. We are all equal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard bandied 
about the idea that Yukon people are very familiar with 
self-government, what it means and what its implications are, 
and that the Canadian people are also familiar with them.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could comment on how general is this 
knowledge and how informed people really are about the 
settlement agreements that we are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, my understanding, as I touched 
on in my speech, that the general knowledge in depth of this 
agreement is not high.
<P>
	The concept of self-government, the concept of a land claim 
deal, that is fine. People are well aware of that. But the depth of 
what is in this bill and its generosity is not general knowledge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, about a 
month ago I rose to speak on Bill C-16, the Sahtu land claim.
<P>
	At that time I told the House we were setting a very dangerous 
precedent and we are following along the same footsteps today. 
Bill C-33 gives two square miles of deeded land per person in 
this land claim. Just to put this into perspective, my family has a 
farm in northwestern Alberta. We have two square miles of land 
that we farm and it has supported a family of six people. If we 
were to work this out, two square miles per person comes to 
twelve sections of land per person.
<P>
	Let us put this into perspective for a moment. When my 
family came to Canada in 1869 from England they got 205 acres. 
We are talking about 12,000 acres here. This is a lot of land. I 
think it sets a very dangerous precedent.
<P>
	In the Peace River riding I have six land claims that have not 
been settled that we want to move forward. It seems to me that 
every land claim that is settled we start to build and build on it at 
a time when Canada has a major debt and deficit.
<P>
	I wonder if the government has given some thought to the 
implications of how this is going to play out in all the land 
claims settlements throughout the country. Thirty-five 
thousand dollars roughly per person in this particular land claim 
settlement using the model again of a family of six represents 
$200,000 plus twelve square miles of land.
<P>
	I have to ask the question, where do we go from here? We have 
a lot of land claims in the province of British Columbia that are 
coming up. Are we going to be borrowing more money from 
places like Japan and the United States to pay out on land 
claims? We have to think very carefully of the cost of what we 
are doing here and the precedent we are setting.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the costs of these land claims are absolutely enormous 
to the Canadian taxpayer. It will cost over $260 million to settle 
these four claims. Something is missing in this equation. No one 
is standing in the House today speaking about the non-native 
Canadians.
<P>
	Who is standing up and speaking for them? Who is speaking 
about their responsibilities and their ownership of other parts of 
the country?
<P>
	Is it not that Canada from sea to sea belongs to all Canadians, 
native and non-native alike? Are all of us here interested in the 
well-being and the welfare of the native peoples in this land 
claim? What will the land claims do to benefit the native people? 
Is there a better way of doing this, is there a better way to help 
the welfare of the native people? What responsibility or what 
accountability is there going to be to the non-native people in 
these land claims as they are going to impact dramatically on the 
taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. I think they are very important questions.
<P>
	We are going through a situation in my riding where 
agriculture has been hit very heavily with the trade war that has 
been going on for over 10 years. I have a lot of constituents who 
have lost their farms, lost their land and I think they would ask 
that question and it should be answered. These people are 
finding it very hard going.
<P>
	The Canadian debt is very high and it is part of the reason 
these farmers are losing their land. They are paying so much in 
taxes at a time when we are giving land to native people in big 
land claim settlements. I do not believe that can be supported 
and I do not believe that the Canadian public will support it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5125"> 5125 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to settle these land claims but we have to have some 
self-reliance and self-sufficiency built into them. That is not 
my understanding of what is being done in these two bills. It is 
sort of an open-ended arrangement where we really do not know 
what the cost is going to be. In effect we are giving a blank 
cheque. It would be one thing if they were signed, sealed and 
delivered and that was the end of it but that is not my 
understanding of the two bills that are before us today.
<P>
	Some very important questions have been raised. I think that 
has to be built into the legislation and I would encourage the 
members of government to entertain some amendments to make 
these more effective so they can be sold to the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the hon. member has any idea of the mass of land in 
the country and in the particular case of this bill what was 
available to the native people in the Yukon at the time when the 
settlers came forward.
<P>
	It has been suggested that the bill overextends the number of 
square miles, acres, whatever you want to take it in, per capita, 
per family. I would suggest that we have to consider where those 
rights were and what amount of space actually was considered as 
part of their homeland. When the early settlers came to this 
country and went to the far north in some cases they were 
welcomed and in other cases they were not. However over a 
period of years they took over and operated those masses of 
land.
<P>
	There has to be some responsibility of government, of 
members on all sides of the House, as Canadian citizens, for our 
actions today and the actions of our predecessors, our ancestors 
and our family line.
<P>
	This bill finally takes some responsibility for the people of 
today's First Nations and takes that responsibility very 
seriously. I think this government should be commended for 
finally taking those actions after these many years.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that 
question. It is a very important question and one that we have to 
give considerable thought to. Essentially when the white people 
came to Canada the Indians had all of Canada. Surely the 
member is not suggesting that we try to redo that wrong because 
it simply would not work.
<P>
	I understand that there are some Indian bands in British 
Columbia that would take back the city of Vancouver. It simply 
cannot be done. In British Columbia they tell me there is 130 per 
cent of the land mass claimed in land claims because there is 
some dispute as to which ones own certain properties.
<P>
	Therefore, you are absolutely right. We do have to have a fair 
settlement. I guess it is a matter of debate as to what is fair here.
<P>
	I have raised a family of six children on considerably less land 
and I certainly did not have any cash settlement along the way. I 
think this is overly generous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, could you 
advise me of the time that I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will be glad to indicate 
to the House that we will terminate at 5.50 p.m. and move to 
Private Member's Business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I listened to the very eloquent, warm and generous tone of the 
Bloc member who spoke a short time ago. I listened intently to 
what he had to say. As he spoke I could not help but compare 
what is happening in Yukon through this land agreement with 
what the situation would be if a similar occurrence were 
happening or the same situation were occurring in the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	I wonder what the member from the Bloc would say about that 
kind of an agreement if the James Bay Cree, if the Mohawks and 
the aboriginal people in northern Quebec had been granted huge 
blocks of land over which they would have complete control and 
an agreement that would give them the right to create their own 
constitution, to create their own legislative assemblies, to 
determine citizenship and the rights of citizens in that area, to 
determine laws that would deal with non-aboriginal people 
when they came on to that land, and the right to set up their own 
justice system and to administer the affairs of huge chunks of 
what is now the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Would it be looked upon as fair to them if this agreement were 
centred in Quebec rather than in Yukon?
<P>
	I have already in the early debate on Bill C-34 mentioned my 
concern in the particular area that all of these rights and 
entitlements contained within this document are based upon 
race.
<P>
	Like the Indian Act that was based upon race, and they were 
discriminated against based upon race as the Indian Act 
discriminated against them and the interpretations of that act 
discriminated against them, this document as well is based upon 
race. I wonder about that. I wonder if that is wise.
<P>
	They are going to have rights on the land that is designated to 
them. Are they going to be Canadians? I would hope they would 
remain Canadians. That would mean they would have rights. 
They would be Canadians plus.
<P>
	They would have all the special rights that they would enjoy 
on the land area they are granted. If they moved off that land 
which they would be entitled to they would enjoy all the rights 
they and we as Canadians enjoy.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5126"> 5126 </A></B>
<P>
	What about the rights of the non-aboriginal people who move 
on to those lands, whether it is to go fishing, as the hon. member 
from the Bloc suggested, or to set up a business or simply move 
in and establishing a home, a living quarters on that land? What 
would be their rights?
<P>
	I see this bill creating a two tier system of laws within this 
country to the benefit of the aboriginal people or one sector of 
Canadian society based upon race.
<P>
	I have the deepest feeling for our aboriginal people. This is 
going to go through. There is no question. When the treaties 
were signed so many years ago there was no real record, no real 
fleshing out of the spirit and the intent of those treaties. All we 
have on the one hand is what the white man recorded in the treaty 
and the notes and the remembrance by the aboriginal people of 
the intent and the spirit of those treaties.
<P>
	We have been arguing about that for almost 100 years. This 
time around because it has been brought into this House, 
certainly the aspects that we have had time to examine are going 
to be placed upon the record. As this program goes forward and 
as this agreement takes effect we are going to be able to then 
judge whether it is has been a wise deal or not and whether the 
wisdom of the people of this country on both sides of the issue 
has been applied to this agreement. We will be able to judge the 
fruits born by this agreement.
<P>
	Therefore, if it is a good deal it will have the support of all of 
us. If it fails we will be able to go back on the record and see 
those concerns raised by elected representatives of this country 
in this House.
<P>
	In summing up, I say to the aboriginal people who are going to 
benefit from this program, God bless you and the very best to 
you. Surely if they take over that part of Canada they cannot do a 
worse job than the governments of this country have done to this 
country when we look at our debt, our justice system and other 
matters where this country has really run amok as a result of the 
direction of the people we have elected to this House.
<P>
	I wish them the very best. I have reservations but I say God 
bless them and the very best to them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being ever so close to 
5.50 p.m. by my clock, I cannot extend questions and comments 
but I will ask members whether they are ready for the question.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.50 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf)</B> moved that Bill C-237, An 
Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act (priority of claims), be read 
the second time now and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to change the 
priority of payment of claims in case of employer bankruptcy, in 
order that the wages, salaries and pension plan contributions of 
employees, up to a limit of $9,000, be paid in priority to any 
other class of claims.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act passed in 1992 maintains 
preferred status for wage and entertainment expense claims in 
the event an employer goes bankrupt. The limit was increased 
from $500 to $2,000 with regard to wage claims, and from $300 
to $1,000 in the case of entertainment expenses claims.
<P>
	When an insolvent employer offers to restructure his 
company, unpaid wages up to a limit of $1,000 have to be paid to 
employees as soon as the restructuring plan had been approved 
by the court. The issue of wage claims in the event of an 
employer becoming bankrupt or insolvent was widely debated in 
Canada in the context of the legislative reform on bankruptcy.
<P>
	In the last bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act, which was tabled 
in 1991, the government proposed to establish a compensation 
fund for unpaid employees. Because of the opposition to the tax 
intended to finance the program, however, this measure was 
withdrawn and replaced by a simple change in priority, which 
has been granted to wage claims for years in Canadian 
legislative enactments on bankruptcy.
<P>
	When the Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act, since renamed 
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, received royal assent on 
June 23, 1992, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
stated his intention of striking a joint committee of the House of 
Commons and the Senate to examine the issue of salary 
protection in case of insolvency. This committee which was to 
table its report by June 1993 was never established.
<P>
	Now, Mr. Speaker, let me provide the House with some 
background information to put the problem with this bill in full 
context. It all started in 1919, with the Bankruptcy Act giving 
wage claims priority over unsecured debts for a period of up to 
three months before the bankruptcy. Wage claims came third at 
the time, after professional, trustees and seizing creditors fees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5127"> 5127 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bankruptcy Act of 1949, maintained the priority given to 
wage claims for a period of three months before bankruptcy 
occurred, but also set a $500 limit per claim. Travelling 
salesmen were allowed to claim $300 more for unpaid expenses. 
Thereafter, wage claims ranked fourth in the order of priority of 
preferred claims.
<P>
	Toward the end of the 1960s, a committee was appointed to 
review and report on the Bankruptcy Act. With this committee, 
known as the Tassé Committee, the government embarked upon 
a legislative reform on bankruptcy. In its report presented in 
1970, the committee recommended that the period in question 
be limited to three months, but that the limit on preferred claims 
be raised to $1,000.
<P>
	Five years after the Tassé Report was tabled, on May 5, 1975, 
Bill C-60 was introduced in first reading in the House of 
Commons by the then Minister of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs who has since become Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The purpose of that bill was to give wage claims of up to 
$2,000 per employee top priority over any other secured or 
unsecured creditor. Fiercely criticized, this ``top priority'' 
proposal was rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on 
Banking, Trade and Commerce in its report on the bill. The 
committee argued among other things that this top priority did 
not ensure employees would be compensated and could in fact 
disadvantage borrowers trying to obtain credit, especially in 
labour intensive sectors. As an alternative, the committee 
recommended establishing a government-operated employee 
compensation fund to which employers and employees would 
contribute and from which wage claims of up to $2,000 could be 
paid to employees. However, none of the three bankruptcy bills 
tabled in the Senate in 1978 and 1979 provided a compensation 
fund for employees or superpriority. Employees instead kept 
their status as preferred creditors and the amount of wage claims 
was increased to $2,000 plus $600 for business travel expenses 
and up to $500 for contributions to pension plans and fringe 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In 1980, another bankruptcy bill, C-12, was tabled in the 
House of Commons by the same minister. It contained the same 
salary protection provisions as the previous Senate bills. After 
considering it, the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, 
Trade and Commerce again recommended creating an employee 
protection fund. The committee thought that the fund which 
would pay salary compensation of up to $2,500 should be 
financed from employer contributions and administered by the 
Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The fund would be subrogated to 
all employee claims against a bankrupt employer.
<P>
	In this context, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs in 1980 asked a task force to look into the question of 
employee protection. Although the Landry Committee saw there 
was a problem with unpaid  wages, it said in its 1981 report that 
it could not determine its scope. It thought that no permanent 
solution to the problem could be found until the extent of the 
problem was known and federal and provincial policies were 
co-ordinated. The committee favoured creating a salary 
protection fund and recommended a temporary solution for 
three years during which the treasury would pay salaries due, 
including benefits, up to $1,000.
<P>
	Although tabled in 1980, Bill C-12 was only referred to a 
parliamentary committee in October 1983. The Minister of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs then proposed amending it so 
as to give superpriority to unpaid wages, not counting severance 
and termination pay, of up to $4,000 if an employer went 
bankrupt. The amendments would have allowed a bankruptcy 
trustee to borrow to pay wage claims and to secure the loan. The 
recommendations of the Landry committee were rejected 
because of budget constraints and because of the lack of 
foolproof data on the wages lost as a result of bankruptcy and the 
problems that could arise if a wage protection fund were created. 
The minister was also concerned that if such a fund existed, 
employers would no longer feel compelled to pay their 
employees' salaries on time.
<P>
	Bill C-12 which died on the Order Paper was reintroduced as 
Bill C-17 on January 31, 1984 by Mrs. Judy Erola who was the 
Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs at the time. 
However, it did not contain any amendments respecting first 
priority. That same year, however, the Minister of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs brought in new amendments which would 
give first or superpriority to salary claims up to a limit of 
$4,000, including legal costs up to a limit of $600.
<P>
	In late 1986, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
released a working paper on proposed amendments to the 
Bankruptcy Act. The proposals flowed from the report of the 
advisory committee and from consultations between the 
minister and concerned groups and provinces.
<P>
	The working paper called for a salary compensation fund to be 
established to cover possible cases of bankruptcy or 
receivership. The fund would have paid up to $2,000 in unpaid 
wages, including statutory benefits and up to $1,000 for unpaid 
expenses incurred on the employer's behalf.
<P>
	The fund would have been financed through employer and 
employee dues and would have been administered by the 
superintendent of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the bill's provisions, 
the federal fund would have priority over provincial laws, would 
be subrogated to the rights of employees and would constitute a 
preferred creditor.
<P>
	The department estimated that the fund would pay out 
between $30 million and $50 million annually.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5128"> 5128 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In 1989, another report recommended creating a national 
wage earner protection fund. The Advisory Council on 
Adjustments, which was asked to examine adjustment issues 
arising from the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, supported 
creating a national wage earner protection fund which would 
pay workers up to a maximum of $4,000 and would be financed 
by contributions from employers.
<P>
	In June 1991, new bankruptcy legislation, Bill C-22, was 
tabled in the House of Commons. The new measures provided 
for a wage earner protection program similar to the one 
proposed in 1988. The program was included in a new act, the 
Wage Claim Payment Act.
<P>
	The bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Consumer 
and Corporate Affairs and Government Operations for 
preliminary consideration. Most witnesses appearing before the 
committee favoured a wage protection program, but many 
objected to the program being financed by a tax on wages.
<P>
	In its preliminary report, the committee rejected the concept 
that a wage protection fund was the only way to guarantee 
recovery, and it proposed a combination of superpriority and a 
wage protection fund. The committee also noted that the fund 
proposed in Bill C-22 would not protect employees who had not 
been paid because the employer had abandoned the business. It 
recommended that the government consider ways to reimburse 
wage arrears in such cases.
<P>
	The government rejected the committee's recommendations. 
Procedural problems within the Standing Committee forced the 
government to reverse its position on wage protection, however, 
and in May 1992, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs announced the withdrawal of this part of the bill.
<P>
	As a result, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act passed in 1992 
maintains the status of secured creditor with respect to claims 
for salaries and representation costs in the case of employer 
bankruptcy, but claim-limits were increased from $500 to 
$2,000 for salaries and from $300 to $1,000 for representation 
costs.
<P>
	The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provides for a review of 
the provisions of the act by a parliamentary committee three 
years after coming into effect.
<P>
	I would now like to address Bill C-237. The proposed 
legislation would amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to 
give claims arising from salaries and unpaid contributions to 
pension plans priority over all other claims in the case of the 
bankruptcy of an employer, including claims of secured 
creditors, up to a limit of $9,000. This bill reflects the 
provisions of a previous bill that would have given wage earners 
superpriority over other creditors.
<P>
	As we have seen, granting superpriority to unpaid wages 
raises a number of problems. First, superpriority does not 
guarantee that wages owed by a bankrupt  employer will be paid. 
The available assets of the bankrupt are not necessarily adequate 
to cover the amounts claimed.
<P>
	Second, superpriority of wage claims might reduce the 
amount of credit offered to labour-intensive businesses.
<P>
	Third, it might be difficult to distribute the burden of 
superpriority among creditors.
<P>
	Fourth, some lenders might be tempted to circumvent 
superpriority by demanding that the loan be in the name of an 
affiliated company that would own all the assets of the borrower.
<P>
	Finally, since wage claims can only take precedence once 
bankruptcy proceedings have started, secured creditors might be 
tempted to exercise their right outside the bankruptcy process to 
preserve their priority.
<P>
	I am sure you will agree that wage earners deserve special 
treatment when their employer becomes insolvent. For many 
wage earners, their job is their main if not sole source of income. 
One of the most common ways of ensuring that workers get their 
unpaid salaries in case of bankruptcy is to give priority status to 
their claims.
<P>
	A preferred creditor is an unsecured creditor who has the right 
to be paid before other unsecured creditors. This means that 
salaries are paid, or could be paid, out of the assets of the 
bankrupt, but before payment of secured creditors.
<P>
	Under the terms of the current Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act, salary claims and disbursements of travelling salesmen 
have priority in case of bankruptcy but, as we said, there is a 
limit of $2,000. As a result of inflation, this is a very small 
amount which does not give much protection to employees.
<P>
	Several arguments can be used to justify a superpriority of 
claims. First, the present system which gives preferred status to 
salary claims is seriously lacking, and the same can be said for 
the claims of secured creditors and preferred creditors of higher 
rank that must be paid first.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Second, with a superpriority, employees would have a better 
chance of being paid quickly. Very often they would not have to 
wait until all the assets of their employer have been disposed of.
<P>
	Third, a superpriority would enable employees to be paid at 
no cost to the government or taxpayers. Recently, some people 
proposed setting up a fund managed by the government. I 
remind you that this proposal was rejected. With a superpriority, 
it is up to the employer to pay salary claims, and they are paid 
out of his assets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5129"> 5129 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, the danger that such a superpriority would hinder a 
company's borrowing power is probably exaggerated. Some say 
that if salary claims had superpriority, companies would have 
trouble getting credit because wages would come before 
securities such as mortgages and bonds.
<P>
	The bill contains provisions limiting the impact of wage 
claims on other creditors. Employee claims would not all be 
honoured in full. Priority would be limited to wages and pension 
plan contributions for the six months preceding the bankruptcy, 
up to a limit of $9,000.
<P>
	Moreover, the present Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act now 
gives unpaid suppliers the right to reclaim their goods from 
bankrupt buyers, which in fact places them ahead of secured 
creditors.
<P>
	I believe I have demonstrated how important Bill C-237 is. 
The historical background of this issue, which I just presented to 
the House, proves beyond any doubt, that wage protection in a 
bankruptcy context has been justifiably a main preoccupation of 
the House since 1919, and especially in the past few years.
<P>
	I then clearly explained how Bill C-237 was in the same line 
as previous bills and how it avoided problems associated with a 
compensation fund and superpriority.
<P>
	Today, I am asking the House to take a step forward towards 
wage protection in a bankruptcy or insolvency context, and 
when the time comes, to support Bill C-237, and send it for 
review to the Committee on Government Operations so that 
workers in this country can enjoy the wage protection they so 
rightly deserve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in my place today to respond to the bill of the hon. 
member for Portneuf.
<P>
	Bill C-237 would adjust the priority of claims of the 
Bankruptcy Act so as to provide employees with the first 
priority of the proceeds of a bankruptcy, up to a limit of $9,000 
per person.
<P>
	I would remind the House that in 1992 the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act was revised for the first time in 40 years. There 
had been six previous attempts to reform the act and they all 
failed.
<P>
	Hon. members who were present during the last Parliament 
will no doubt recall that one of the most controversial aspects of 
the original legislation was the proposal for a wage claim 
payment act that would enable employees to obtain wages and 
expenses after a company has gone bankrupt.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The debate focused on the best way to finance the payment of 
this type of claim. Several methods were recommended. The 
original bill provided for the creation of a wage claim payment 
program, that was to be financed through a tax paid by the 
employer and collected with UI contributions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many members of the Standing Committee on Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs and Government Operations, however, argued 
against that method of financing wage claim payments. They 
maintained it was not right to impose an additional tax burden 
on business in the name of helping the employees of bankrupt 
companies. The act might only succeed in driving more 
companies over the edge and into bankruptcy and the last thing 
Canadians needed was legislation that might kill jobs. Therefore 
the government of the day dropped the wage earner protection 
provisions in the interests of getting the bill through Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must examine very carefully the eventual impact of the 
various proposals, as well as the results of the 1992 
amendments. The consequences of the priorities established in 
the new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act will help us better 
understand what works and what does not.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me provide an example. The 1992 act gives unpaid 
suppliers the right to repossess goods sold and delivered to a 
debtor if the debtor is bankrupt or in receivership at the time the 
supplier demands the return of the goods. This rights comes into 
effect when the following conditions exist.
<P>
	The supplier must demand repossession in writing within 30 
days of delivery. The buyer must be bankrupt or in receivership. 
The goods must still be in the possession of the buyer, trustee or 
receiver, be identifiable and in the same state as when delivered, 
and not have been resold or subject to an agreement of sale.
<P>
	A supplier's right to repossess goods supplied ranks ahead of 
any other claim against the goods, except that of a purchaser 
who bought the goods in good faith and for value without notice 
if the supplier has demanded repossession.
<P>
	The new bankruptcy laws make other provisions in the case of 
farmers, fishermen and aquaculturalists. Usually the goods they 
provide are perishable and the normal 30-day period would not 
respond to their needs. The goods they provided would already 
have been processed or resold. The act gives them a super 
priority over all holders of security in respect of unpaid amounts 
on inventory supplied within the 15-day period. There is no 
need to establish the existence of products supplied because 
they are perishable and will likely be disposed of shortly after 
delivery.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5130"> 5130 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether the solution proposed by the 
hon. member will help workers or make life more difficult for 
them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If workers were asked what they would prefer, super priority 
in the event of a bankruptcy or a chance that the company will 
survive and they will keep their jobs, I am sure there would be no 
difficulty getting a response. Workers might value a higher 
priority in bankruptcy proceedings but not at the expense of 
putting jobs at risk in the first place.
<P>
	Lending institutions maintained they would raise the interest 
rates they charge on business loans if super priority were given 
to wage earners. They say they would be inclined to charge 
higher rates of interest to labour intensive firms. They say they 
would be less willing to provide a loan to a company facing 
tough times and they might move more quickly, regrettably, to 
realize their securities.
<P>
	The banks might call the loan before the company declared 
bankruptcy. Calling that loan would unfortunately result in 
creating the bankruptcy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is what credit institutions said to the various committees 
that have considered this issue in the past. I do not necessarily 
agree with them on this. There may be ways of reviewing wage 
earner protection while guaranteeing the availability of capital. 
We however need more information than what is now available 
to us to understand the impact superpriority will have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time there are other issues that must be addressed 
in assessing priorities of creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. I 
wonder if the hon. member has given some thought to protection 
for consumer deposits, for instance.
<P>
	A consumer who makes a down payment to a retailer for the 
purchase price of a good or a service may be left with only a 
claim as an ordinary creditor. If the retailer goes bankrupt or 
into receivership before delivery, current law relegates the 
consumer cannot establish ownership in particular goods to 
ordinary creditor status. Consumers who pay for goods yet to be 
identified or not yet produced will be ordinary creditors as will 
buyers of unperformed services.
<P>
	Is this fair? Consumers do not intend to give credit and do not 
see themselves as creditors when they give deposits or make 
down payments for consumer goods or services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consumers are vulnerable. They cannot easily obtain 
information on the seller's financial situation. They cannot 
afford multiple risks when they buy. Neither can they 
realistically expect their deposits to be guaranteed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The argument can be made that consumers are in as much need 
of protection as suppliers and wage earners. If we give suppliers 
protection and wage earners super priority, what are we to do for 
consumers?
<P>
	Once again we get into the same difficulty. Any gain for 
consumer buyers arising out of a privilege would be offset by a 
corresponding loss for other creditors. Special treatment for 
consumers would depart from the principle of equal treatment of 
creditors. This protection might have a detrimental impact on 
the availability of credit.
<P>
	There is one more example of the complex issues that arise. 
Under the Income Tax Act the crown has a super priority to a 
bankrupt's unremitted source deductions for income tax, 
Canada pension plan and UI. Bill C-237 puts the wage earner's 
super priority ahead of the crown's right. The employee might 
get compensation for wages lost in the bankruptcy, but the 
crown would find it difficult to have funds to make UI payments. 
Premiums might have to be raised. The cost of business would 
rise and more businesses might well fail.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	It all has a ripple effect, and I do not believe the bill pays 
enough attention to the impact it would have on business 
viability or job creation. We need to examine impacts more 
closely. We need more information.
<P>
	Hon. members may be aware that the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act provides that after three years a parliamentary 
committee will review both the new provisions and the 
operation of the act. This provision was established because we 
do not want to wait another 40 years before we can change the 
bankruptcy legislation again. We want to keep the act up to date 
and successful.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to the act, the review to be conducted after three 
full years should be held in 1995. We will soon have to study 
these questions in detail but, for the moment, what we should 
consider is the big picture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To prepare for the review the government has created a 
bankruptcy and insolvency advisory committee. It is a 
representative group of insolvency stakeholders. The object is 
to bring together representatives from all interests affected by 
the law. These groups often have interests that compete with one 
another, so we want to try to build a consensus on what is fair 
and reasonable before the government introduces changes as 
part of the three-year review.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5131"> 5131 </A></B>
<P>
	Since its establishment, the committee has created eight 
working groups that have submitted their preliminary 
recommendations. This month they will review the 
recommendations and send them back to the working groups for 
fine tuning. I hope the report will be complete by the end of this 
year. The minister will then be able to use these 
recommendations to draft a new bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, we will have to answer not only 
the many questions related to the reform of the Canadian 
bankruptcy legislation but also those concerning wage earner 
protection. The fact that the previous government could not find 
a better way to protect wage earners did not make anyone happy. 
A piecemeal approach to the problem is certainly not the 
solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe the House should vote down Bill C-237 and prepare 
instead to look at wage earner protection as an integral part of 
the larger issue of bankruptcy reform we will address in coming 
months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
this evening on Bill C-237, an act to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
<P>
	I appreciate the history lesson from my hon. colleague in the 
Bloc who went through all of the trials and tribulations to tell us 
how we managed to arrive at where we are today. I also 
appreciate the comments by my Liberal colleague who 
explained the Bankruptcy Act and the fact that a great deal of 
thought went into the Bankruptcy Act as it is today.
<P>
	It is rather ironic that I stand here to speak on amendments to 
the Bankruptcy Act when I was an intervener back in 1991, three 
years ago when it was being reviewed. I guess we have come full 
circle. I now stand in the House making comments on potential 
revisions to the act when three years ago I was making revisions 
as an accountant on behalf of an organization that had an interest 
in representing its members as far as the Bankruptcy Act 
provisions at that time were concerned.
<P>
	Speaking to the amendments, I find the bill poorly drafted, I 
am afraid to say. We cannot agree and support the measures 
being put forth. We do not feel a great deal of thought has been 
put into the bill. Unfortunately I see it as being ideologically 
driven, wherein the workers have been put first and absolute in 
front of everything else with no real consideration to the other 
parties that have or may have input and deserve consideration in 
the event of bankruptcy.
<P>
	It is a socialist position, not only a position of the Bloc 
separatists. It seems to be socialist as well and perhaps the 
position of successors to the party that has one or two members 
on the backbench here.
<P>
	The first line of the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Notwithstanding any law or any other provision in this or any other federal or 
provincial Act-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This puts it as number one, right up there with the charter of 
rights or perhaps even ahead of the charter of rights. It is a 
constitutional document because it puts it ahead of all provincial 
acts at the same time.
<P>
	If every bill we debated in the House of Commons were to 
start by saying notwithstanding any other provisions or any 
other law, how would we ever determine which one would take 
precedence? It would be impossible. That is why I say even the 
wording is poorly drafted law. We cannot support the way it is 
presented.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Subclause (a) talks about giving protection to employees in 
the amount of $9,000. Three years ago the act allowed $2,000. 
We have not had inflation of the kind that we would want to 
multiply it by four and a half times to get up to $9,000 today.
<P>
	The mover of the bill is also saying that in the event of a 
bankruptcy and money owing to an employee in an amount of up 
to $9,000, that money can either be paid into his pension plan or 
paid to him in cash less normal deductions.
<P>
	It does not say which one because it says the money could be 
put into his pension plan as well as wages, salaries, commissions 
and so on. ``As well as'' does not tell us which one would take 
priority. If a trustee in bankruptcy were to put the money into the 
employee's pension plan while the employee was destitute and 
the employee was denied access to the money even though it was 
in his name, how better off would he be?
<P>
	As it is written, Bill C-237 says that the trustee has a choice. 
He can put it into the employee's pension plan or he can give it in 
cash less deductions. He does not even have to take the 
employee into consideration to see what is most beneficial to 
him. Unfortunately the act is poorly drawn.
<P>
	It rearranges the whole order. The act as it currently stands 
gives priority to secure claims. My hon. colleague on the Liberal 
side talked about the super creditors and so on. 
Notwithstanding, as it stands today first are the secured 
creditors, followed by funeral expenses, undertaker's expenses 
and so on to look after the unpleasant side of things that the 
trustee should pay for in the case where the bankrupt is 
deceased. Then it goes on to pay the trustee's own expenses and 
talks about wages and salaries.
<P>
	Wages are number four because the first three items are 
important. We would not want to pay an unsecured creditor and 
not pay the undertaker. How would we ever get trustees to wrap 
up a bankruptcy if their fees took less precedence than the 
money paid to wage earners who are unsecured creditors? Who 
would ever do the job? Who would ever pay them? That is why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5132"> 5132 </A></B>
<P>
the Bankruptcy Act as it reads today puts these things ahead of 
payments to wage earners.
<P>
	As an hon. colleague asked, what about the banks? What is 
their attitude to the situation? Let us take the situation of a good 
sized company of 110 employees. If it had not paid its 
employees it would have a liability of $1 million. That is the 
first priority ahead of all other laws, notwithstanding any other 
law, provincial act or anything else. Are the banks going to lend 
that company money? Of course not. There is no way that a bank 
is going to lend money to a company when there is a potential 
liability of up to $1 million that it will always rank ahead of the 
government or the bank security.
<P>
	Therefore business will find that it is unable to raise cash 
because of that point. Business will decline and unemployment 
will go up. There will be more and more bankruptcies created by 
this particular change in the law. I do not think that was the 
intention of the member who moved the bill.
<P>
	I do not think it was the intention of the mover to create 
unemployment. I think the mover was coming at it from the 
point of view of trying to protect the rights of wage earners. I 
have no problems with that whatsoever, but we must recognize 
that the member is actually proposing in the law to create more 
unemployment and to cause more business failures. He is going 
to deny business the ability to borrow money. By doing all these 
things the matter is being made worse rather than better.
<P>
	The member talked about the compensation plan that was 
proposed before, but who was supposed to pay for it? The idea 
was to lump the cost and pass it on to the employer.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	The employer is the guy who takes the risks. He is the guy who 
gets the money left in the till at the end of the day after he has 
paid for all other obligations, including wages to his people. If 
there is next to nothing in the till, that is all he gets for his hard 
work.
<P>
	I had an accounting business before I got into this political 
game and I used to deal with many small business people. I said 
to them that unfortunately in many cases small business people 
work twice as hard and earn half as much as the people they 
employ. They said that was right but they enjoyed the freedom of 
having their own business and they accepted the risks. 
Unfortunately I saw cases where some businesses did not make 
it. The point is that they were working hard and as best as they 
possibly could for the benefit of themselves and the people 
working for them.
<P>
	That is the recognition of the role small businesses play in our 
economy. We should not hamstring small businesses to the point 
that we expect or assume they are out to gouge their employees 
and to take them to the cleaners. I can assure the hon. member 
that in all my experiences with small business people they have 
gone to great lengths to ensure that their business is viable and 
that they can look after their employees to the best of their 
ability.
<P>
	In wrapping up, I have looked pragmatically at the bill as a 
Reformer. I recognize the hon. member is trying to protect wage 
earners, but if he really looked at what this bill would do, he 
would find that is not the case. Hopefully the hon. member will 
come around to seeing it in the same way Reformers do. 
Unfortunately the bill is not acceptable and therefore the 
Reform Party will not be supporting it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
you look closely at Bill C-237, which was tabled by the hon. 
member for Portneuf, you cannot help but think of an expression 
often used in this House but particularly appropriate in this case: 
social justice. This is what the bill is all about.
<P>
	The amendments proposed today to the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act do a lot more than would mere technical changes 
to this federal act, since they give it the human and 
compassionate dimension which it needed so badly. Indeed, Bill 
C-237 aims at giving wage claims priority over any other claim.
<P>
	The current situation regarding commercial bankruptcy is 
simply unfair to those who are the real engines of our economy. 
Workers should be the first ones to be paid when the assets of a 
bankrupt business are liquidated. I should point out that, under 
the current act, workers are not at the bottom of the priority list. 
This shows that the legislator already recognizes the importance 
of giving priority to claims related to unpaid salaries, expense 
accounts of travelling salesmen, contributions to retirement 
pensions and other benefits.
<P>
	Indeed, under the current Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 
salaries, commissions, and fringe benefits are said to be 
privileged claims. This means that they come before unsecured 
claims, but after secured liabilities. Some might say that this is 
pretty good, but the reality is that once secured creditors have 
been paid, there is often hardly any money left to pay salaries 
and commissions to workers. Consequently, the term privileged 
or preferred is misleading. One has to go beyond the semantic 
meaning of the word and see the hard reality which workers have 
to face when their employer goes bankrupt.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The status of preferred creditor is no better than if you were 
offered the most comfortable seat in a theatre, but that seat was 
right behind a big post blocking the whole view of the stage. In 
spite of its comfort, that seat would simply not meet the primary 
requirement of offering a good view of the stage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5133"> 5133 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government likes people to think it is doing a 
great job. It keeps them from noticing the big post and gives 
everyone the impression that everything is fine. This is more or 
less the situation with the current Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act. Salaries are considered a privileged claim, but that nice 
status does not guarantee at all that the creditor will get any 
money. In this case, the big post is represented by the secured 
creditors whose claims have priority over wage claims.
<P>
	Many people cannot see the stage because the government has 
not yet amended the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act so as to 
ensure that salaries are the number one priority when the assets 
of a bankrupt company are liquidated. It is certainly not normal 
to see municipal taxes having priority over people's livelihood. 
And yet, since 1919, several attempts have been made to give 
wage claims the place they deserve on the list of priority claims.
<P>
	Several task forces have looked at this issue and 
recommended all kinds of solutions designed to favour workers. 
The reports of these committees are still gathering dust today on 
the shelves of the National Archives. Also, several bills were 
presented to remedy the situation but were abandoned for lack of 
time and especially because successive governments lacked 
courage and political will. As a result, the improvements were 
timid and inconsequential.
<P>
	People who are laid off after their employer goes bankrupt 
already suffer enough from the loss of their livelihood; they 
should not, on top of that, lose the salary owed to them.
<P>
	When a bank agrees to invest in a company, it usually knows 
the risk it runs. Furthermore, the interest rates it charges reflect 
these risks of financial loss.
<P>
	Perhaps employees do not invest their money, but they devote 
themselves body and soul to their employer in exchange for a 
salary that is often too small, but that still lets them meet most of 
their financial obligations.
<P>
	Bill C-237 is thus intended to correct the injustice being done 
when a bankrupt company's assets are liquidated. This 
amendment goes further than any previous attempt in favour of 
workers' rights.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Portneuf, was not satisfied 
with reupholstering the comfortable seat behind the column; he 
is moving this seat and giving back to workers their rightful 
place.
<P>
	This is the sort of measure which the people of Canada and 
Quebec expect of their government, initiatives that reflect the 
legitimate needs and aspirations of the Canadian working class. 
Of course, the big secured creditors will surely not appreciate 
this legislative amendment since they will see their claims fall 
on the priority list of payments in case of bankruptcy.
<P>
	And the effects of the financial losses on them would be much 
less than for the average Canadian worker who, in losing his 
salary, is losing his only source of income.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, it is a question of social justice and the 
government should try to consider it more often when the time 
comes to present bills that might affect people's lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for this opportunity to join the debate on Bill C-237 which 
is presented by the hon. member for Portneuf to guarantee 
superpriority to employees in the proceeds that would be 
realized from the bankruptcy of their employer firm.
<P>
	This compelling issue, le célèbre fauteuil de mon collègue en 
face, has been the object of repeated parliamentary and 
provincial examinations before our Parliament, in seven bills 
and seven reports. Not only has superpriority been consistently 
rejected before, but also a fund from government revenues has 
been refused as was the tax.
<P>
	In 1992 the previous government was obliged to drop the 
provisions for a wage claim payment program so as to ensure 
that the other provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
referred to by my previous colleague on this side would be 
accepted. It did give workers a preferred claim to cover wages 
earned during the six months that preceded the bankruptcy, up to 
a limit of $2,000 a person. In striking contrast, the bill before us 
provides a first priority payment up to a limit of $9,000 per 
employee in the context of bankruptcy proceedings.
<P>
	What the act also did, and this is important to our debate 
today, is it instituted a three-year review to examine the matter 
of bankruptcy and debt. So it is important not to jump the gun 
and obliterate that concerted effort of government and 
stakeholders.
<P>
	With the passage of the 1992 act a consultation committee 
was struck, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Advisory 
Committee, or BIAC. The government should be given time to 
exercise the three-year review. This committee, BIAC, 
co-ordinates consultations of insolvency stakeholders on a 
multilateral basis. BIAC is enabling us to bring stakeholders 
into the policy development process early on, and keep them on 
board right through to the end in a systematic way, to look at the 
issues and then to recommend options.
<P>
	In the meantime, Industry Canada has been gathering data on 
the impact the 1992 revisions have had on the economy. We need 
to know the full extent of the problem and what is required to 
resolve it. For example, in how many insolvencies do employees 
lose wages? How much have they lost in total? Do they receive 
any of the wages owing from the trustee? How long does this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5134"> 5134 </A></B>
<P>
process take? In past cases how much money was available in 
the estate for paying creditors?
<P>
	Related issues abound, many of which are fundamental. Here 
is one example of an important issue facing BIAC. The Colter 
and Tassé committees have recommended amendments to the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to deal with the increasing 
problem of international insolvencies. Indeed, in a global 
marketplace cross-border insolvency problems are not rare. 
This possibility is gaining huge significance in light of free 
trade and the NAFTA.
<P>
	I ask you to bear with me, Mr. Speaker, as I move to a second 
point, which is one of the absolute issues arising from the 
legislation that is presented to us today, one with which you are 
abundantly familiar. As my hon. colleague has referred to 
previously, that is the priority of the crown which is above all 
would-be super priorities. The hon. member for St. Paul's gave 
us a tantalizing glimpse of the problem under this rubric. I wish 
to reinforce and amplify his remarks.
<P>
	By way of explanation, under the Income Tax Act the crown 
has the super priority to a business's unpaid deductions for 
income tax, Canada pension plan and unemployment insurance. 
Bill C-237 would put the wage earners super priority ahead of 
that of the crown.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	What is the end result if you do that? The employee might 
well get compensated for wages lost in the bankruptcy but the 
crown could find it does not have enough funds to make up 
unemployment insurance payments. Premiums would have to be 
raised. The cost of business would necessarily rise. More 
businesses already facing tighter loan money because of added 
responsibility for the wage earner super priority would face 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	In a telling metaphor the hon. member for St. Paul's spoke of a 
vast ripple effect. I do not believe this bill pays enough attention 
to the ultimate reach of that ripple effect on business viability 
and job creation.
<P>
	What is a priority? It is a moving, subtle thing that can 
apparently seem to defy logic. I will give one example, and it 
will be my final one, in an area touched by the committee on 
Canadian heritage of which I have the honour to be the chair.
<P>
	Priority becomes a far more fragmented thing within the 
information based marketplace. To put it at its simplest level, 
the government has been approached by one set of 
representatives of that market and to get to cases I mean authors 
who are often their own copyright holders.
<P>
	What happens to a copyright holder when a publisher goes 
bankrupt? An author-and I can claim to be a modest one in this 
regard-put years into writing a book, his or her whole life in 
some instances, his or her mind and spirit, and yet receives little 
or nothing if the publisher collapses leaving royalties unpaid. 
The unpaid author has to watch while suppliers quite possibly 
recover the cost of paper and ink that delivered his very book to 
print.
<P>
	There is a system in place that may shed new light on these 
many interrelated problems that must be addressed together if 
any hope for a resolution is to be realized. It is in the interest of 
this country and of its labour force, which this bill wishes to 
help, that we give our review system, the one I referred to 
previously, a chance and that we allow a solution to come forth 
from the concerted effort of government and stakeholders.
<P>
	It is equally in our national interest that we develop a global 
approach that allows our businesses to reorganize or to catch 
their second wind and have another go at it. We do not need or 
want a piecemeal approach which will only be remembered for 
its disastrous consequences.
<P>
	This government wants a concerted effort that has regard for 
all workers, creditors, consumers and of course the crown itself. 
For this reason and at this time I do not support Bill C-237.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our current legislation on bankruptcy and insolvency 
does not fit the social philosophy of our time. One could say it 
has lagged far behind.
<P>
	It provides that in the case of bankruptcy, hypothecary 
creditors take precedence over wage earners, or to put it bluntly, 
it provides that money takes precedence over human beings. I do 
not think you have to be a socialist, as the hon. member for the 
Reform Party said, to get upset about this kind of situation. It is 
intolerable that in 1994, we should still let money take 
precedence over human beings, and I certainly do not think 
Socialists have a monopoly on the indignation this kind of 
situation arouses.
<P>
	In fact, our so-called capitalist society is concerned about the 
problem, and it has been since 1919. The hon. member for 
Portneuf recalled what has been done about this problem over 
the past 75 years, but so far, all attempts to bring divergent 
interests together have failed. I would like to mention three 
particularly significant developments that occurred during that 
time.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	First of all, in 1975 we had the Liberal Bill C-60, which I 
believe mentioned for the first time the possibility of 
superpriority for wage earners.
<P>
	This admittedly generous and fair legislation met with 
objections from the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and 
Commerce which would have preferred to see a wage protection 
fund administered by the State. Understandably, there were 
bankers 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5135"> 5135 </A></B>
<P>
and businessmen who preferred to let taxpayers pay the cost of 
administering this fund.
<P>
	In any case, nothing happened, and later on-this is the 
second development I wanted to mention-we had the Landry 
Commission, which pointed out, and it was probably right, 
another drawback to this protection fund. To a certain extent, the 
fund might have been an incentive for unscrupulous employers 
not to do everything in their power, in case of bankruptcy, to pay 
their employees, since a fund would do it for them.
<P>
	The third and most recent development was in 1992, when the 
Conservatives appointed a joint committee to examine these 
issues, but unfortunately it too failed in the attempt.
<P>
	My point is that the hon. member for Portneuf is to be 
commended for resurrecting a problem that is certainly not 
recent and which so far has remained unsolved. His solution is 
realistic and humane, and here it is in a nutshell: it gives 
absolute priority to the payment of wages and salaries owed, and 
it raises the limit of such payments.
<P>
	This bill, like any bill designed to resolve differences and 
overcome opposition, is certainly not perfect. There is, of 
course, no solution that can satisfy everyone. Claimants may 
argue that the bill weakens their position. We must, however, 
admit that the employees are the people closest to the business 
and the most affected by its closing. Therefore, there is no doubt 
that, from a moral and social perspective, they must have 
priority.
<P>
	Finally, I think this bill is quite timely because it fits in with a 
new school of thought, a new trend we are happy to see emerging 
between the unions and the employers. Of course, their interests 
being at odds with each other, there are still tensions, but we 
must admit that unions look harder now than 20 years ago for 
opportunities to co-operate with business. In the current 
recessionary climate, this co-operation often takes the form of 
major concessions from the employees in the new collective 
agreements.
<P>
	This effort to bring employees and employers together to try 
to solve the problems-and we know that our society now faces 
many problems-is very much in line with today's spirit of 
understanding and employee co-operation that the unions are 
displaying more and more these days. It should not be a one-way 
street. In return, legislators should ensure that the employees 
receive what is owed to them.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The period provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96(3), this item is dropped 
from the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RWANDA">RWANDA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
May 9, 1994 I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs a question 
regarding the role of the United Nations in the continuing 
tragedy in Rwanda.
<P>
	My question then was directed to chapter 6 of the United 
Nations charter which clusters together the UN processes for 
peaceful settlement of international disputes.
<P>
	In its best known manifestation chapter 6 connotes 
peacekeeping in the classical form first suggested by Lester 
Pearson who resolved the Suez crisis of 1956 and for which he 
later received the Nobel Peace Prize.
<P>
	That is the interposition of an unarmed international peace 
force between combatants who have been in direct armed 
conflict in order to separate them and allow a necessary cooling 
off period preparatory to elaboration of a formal peace accord or 
other formalized truce.
<P>
	Peacekeeping under chapter 6 of the charter is to be 
distinguished from peacemaking under chapter 7 which 
connotes the direct interposition in military force through the 
medium of UN military contingents under UN command and 
authority and which is specifically empowered to use armed 
force to resolve conflicts.
<P>
	It is to be noted, however, there is an increasing reluctance of 
UN member states to utilize the chapter 7 processes in part 
because of recent unhappy experiences in problem areas like 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Somalia where the line between 
classical peacekeeping and peacemaking became increasingly 
blurred and confused.
<P>
	It may, however, be suggested that the problems there have 
arisen more from lack of a clear advance definition or 
instructions as to the UN roles and missions in the particular 
cases than from any defects inherent in the chapter 6 and chapter 
7 processes as such.
<P>
	In the context of Rwanda my suggestion is directed to the fact 
that once the internal ethnic strife had transcended national 
frontiers with the waves of refugees from Rwanda escaping to 
neighbouring states and thereby imposing severe burdens on 
those neighbouring states' economy and health and social 
welfare resources and personnel, the Rwanda conflicts had 
ceased to be purely internal or national, if they ever were, and 
had taken on a larger international dimension, with major 
implications in the new humanitarian international law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5136"> 5136 </A></B>
<P>
	For this reason while noting the considerable humanitarian 
aid already given within Rwanda by Canadian emergency relief 
personnel, both civil and military, to relieve the human suffering 
involved in the ethnic conflicts, I would ask the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs what further steps, 
within the ambit of chapter 6 of the charter and under the UN 
aegis, the Canadian government might recommend to the United 
Nations for purposes of collective, world community action, or 
what action we might be prepared to take on our own initiative to 
save human lives and to alleviate further human suffering in 
Rwanda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, no formal decision has been 
made concerning Canadian participation in an expanded United 
Nations assistance mission in Rwanda.
<P>
	The UN has informally asked us to provide communication 
specialists and if we decide to participate in the expanded 
mission we are considering sending some 300 such specialists.
<P>
	Countries have started to answer positively to the UN request 
for personnel and equipment. At the close of a recent regional 
summit the president of Zimbabwe stated that 14 African 
countries were prepared to respond affirmatively to a UN 
request for material and troops.
<P>
	Since the outbreak of violence in April CIDA has contributed 
$4 million and pledged another $7.6 million in emergency aid to 
Canadian NGOs, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, and the Red Cross.
<P>
	A Canadian military aircraft based in Nairobi is the only link 
between Kigali and the outside world. As a result of a new attack 
on the airport on June 5, humanitarian flights have been 
suspended until a new truce is negotiated.
<P>
	General Dallaire together with 10 other Canadians continues 
to play a key role in leading the United Nations missions, 
serving as intermediary between the warring parties and 
participating in humanitarian operations.
<P>
	The Canadian general is doing his utmost to obtain a ceasefire 
but the Rwandan patriotic front, the RPF, seems more 
determined than ever to take power by force before deployment 
of the UN force. They took the Kigali airport on May 22 and 
continue to progress. Many members of the government left 
Gitamara for Kibaye near Zaire on May 28.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs has summoned the 
Rwandan ambassador to encourage his government to negotiate 
in good faith and put an end to the killing and has sent a similar 
message to the Rwandan patriotic front.
<P>
	I wish to thank the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra for all 
his representations in helping to bring this dispute hopefully to a 
peaceful resolution as he recommends using chapter 6 of the 
United Nations charter.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, early last 
March, the U.S. government reactivated an extraordinary trade 
measure, the Super 301, which allows it to impose sanctions on 
any country which it considers guilty of unfair trade practices. 
In reintroducing the Super 301, the United States was primarily 
targeting Japan, a country with which it has a large trade deficit. 
Dissatisfied with the progress of talks on the opening up of 
Japanese markets to American goods, the United States is now 
using strongarm tactics to bring an unco-operative Japan into 
line.
<P>
	The United States and several other countries have been 
complaining for years about the non tariff trade barriers erected 
by Japan to keep out foreign goods and services. Having grown 
impatient with the lack of progress made following Japan's 
promises to open up its markets, the United States recently set 
quantifiable and measurable objectives which Japan must meet 
in certain specific economic sectors. Japan refused to go along. 
The reintroduction of the Super 301 has been denounced by the 
Secretary General of the GATT, by a number of western 
politicians and by the Canadian Minister for International Trade 
as a trade practice that is not in keeping with the spirit and rules 
of international trade. However, U.S. requirements as to 
quantifiable objectives resemble a form of managed trade and 
these too are incompatible with free market principles.
<P>
	In the past, the United States has used the Super 301 in 
response to certain trading partners whose practices were 
deemed to be unfair. These partners included Japan, Brazil and 
India in the late 1980s. Canada also got a taste of the Super 301 
in 1990 when U.S. sanctions targeted Canadian beer exports.
<P>
	Under the Super 301, the United States has until September 
30, 1994 to compile a list of countries which it feels have erected 
unreasonable barriers to keep out American products. This 
so-called black list is based on the <I>National Trade Estimates</I>, an 
annual report released by the U.S. trade secretary on March 31 
of this year. Measures will subsequently be taken against all 
blacklisted countries.
<P>
	The latest edition of the <I>National Trade Estimates</I> contains 12 
pages of complaints about a number of Canadian trade practices, 
primarily those involving beer, agriculture and domestic 
procurement policies. While the U.S. Super 301 is directly 
aimed at Japan, the fact remains that the procedure applies to 
any country found guilty of trade practices deemed unfair by the 
United States.
<P>
	It is to be feared that, to appease the wrath of the United 
States, Japan could come to favour openly the access of Ameri-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5137"> 5137 </A></B>
<P>
can products and services to its market and this, at the expense 
of other trading partners, including Canada.
<P>
	On the one hand, the verbal match between the Americans and 
the Japanese has subsided considerably over the past few 
months, Japan having expressed the intention of steering the 
course of deregulation, which should make access to the 
Japanese market easier for foreign products.
<P>
	On the other hand, the war of words between Canadians and 
Americans has picked up. The Canadian ministers of 
international trade and agriculture had a few well-chosen words 
about the scare tactics used by the Americans. Disagreement is 
obvious from agricultural disputes concerning durum wheat, 
poultry and eggs for example, disputes which undermine trade 
relations between our two countries. A fragile and incomplete 
settlement has just been reached in the Canada-U.S. trade 
dispute on beer.
<P>
	So, the fact remains that Canada is among countries that the 
United States complains about profusely. Therefore, nothing 
stops them from applying or threatening to apply their Super 301 
to some specific sectors of our economy.
<P>
	In fact, the question I put to the Minister of International 
Trade on March 25 last has not lost any of its relevance or 
topicality, since Canada appears on the list of countries found 
guilty of unfair trade practices in the latest American <I>National 
Trade Estimates</I>. The United States who have until September 
30, 1994, to complete their blacklist, could still be tempted to 
add or threaten to add Canada to their list in order to pressure us 
into settling certain trade disputes in their favour.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Canada must not give in to blackmail and intimidation. It 
must continue to protect its economic interests. That is why the 
Bloc Quebecois urges the Minister of International Trade and 
the Minister of Agriculture to oppose steadfastly certain 
American claims considered illegitimate.
<P>
	The Bloc also advises the government that it would be 
unacceptable to the people of Quebec and Canada to fall for the 
American trap and play off the interests of one region against 
those of another in hope of settling the dispute as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought when the hon. 
member raised his question we answered it fairly well.
<P>
	In his presentation he was trying to question the commitment 
of the government in protecting the interest of Canadians. I want 
to bring to his attention that the Minister for International Trade 
criss-crossed the planet probably four times, reaching out and 
trying to promote the interests of Canadian business and 
Canadian companies in order to promote trade internationally.
<P>
	This minister as well as this government are not afraid to 
stand up and protect the interests of the industry. I  would like to 
bring to his attention a few articles, one in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
with the headline stating: ``MacLaren blasts U.S. on trade''. 
Another one in <I>Le Devoir</I> says: ``MacLaren lance un 
avertissement aux Américains''. The <I>Financial Post</I> says: 
``MacLaren lashes out at the U.S. on trade''. ``MacLaren blasts 
U.S. on trade'', says the Toronto <I>Star</I>. ``U.S. risks trade shell, 
MacLaren warns'' is in the <I>Gazette</I>. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	This government is not lying dead. It is the opposite. We are 
proactive. We understand that there are problems. The hon. 
member must understand. When you have trade between Canada 
and the United States in excess of $270 billion surely you are 
going to see difficulties in certain aspects of trading with your 
largest trading partner in the world.
<P>
	If the member is suggesting we should declare war on the 
United States, I would suggest to the hon. member that those 
days have gone by. The answer for all of this is through the 
international forum, the World Trade Organization, which is 
going to take place in 1995, through GATT which is now 
functioning and through the NAFTA agreement which we have 
in place.
<P>
	Only through dialogue can we resolve some of those disputes 
which I might suggest do not account for more than 3 per cent of 
the total.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for 301, I want to tell the hon. member that the United 
States never named Canada under Super 301. They have taken 
measures against Canada under section 301 of the 1974 Trade 
Act. The current disputes with the United States are covered by 
the NAFTA dispute settlement mechanism and the general 
agreement. Canada will make full use of these agreements to 
protect its interests.
<P>
	I just want to say to the hon. member that when Minister 
MacLaren appeared before the House of Commons Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, he said that it is not 
right for the Americans to use bilateral instruments which could 
indirectly affect other countries. We continue to defend the 
interests of Canadians and of industries.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
asked for time this evening to speak because there is a big 
problem in the Department of National Defence which is not 
being addressed.
<P>
	I have asked several questions of the minister over the past 
three months that I do not think have been properly dealt with. 
The federal government moves up to 20,000 households per 
year, three-quarters of which are military personnel. The cost of 
these moves is up to $100 million. Once storage, real estate fees, 
legal charges, mortgage expenses and other benefits are thrown 
in the tab comes to well over $200 million. You would think that 
a big  customer like the federal government which accounts for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5138"> 5138 </A></B>
<P>
up to 35 per cent of Canada's moving business would pay rates 
somewhat less than the industry average. Instead, the 
government pays 23 per cent more than the CBC, Canadian 
National Railways, Northern Telecom and Canada Post. How 
can this be?
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Moves are handled by a four member committee representing 
National Defence, the RCMP and Supply and Services. This 
committee has its own bureaucracy of over 105 public servants, 
many of them located in defence headquarters.
<P>
	To begin with, what are military men doing handling 
household moves? These trained military personnel should be 
doing things like peacekeeping and organizing food aid.
<P>
	The federal moving business is tendered but it all goes to four 
major moving van lines. These van lines were convicted of price 
fixing in 1983 and fined $250,000. They are now under 
investigation again for various irregularities. The van lines get 
the government business and then dole it out to their carrier 
agents. You would think that the government could get better 
prices by tendering to more than just four companies. But the 
government's own rules prevent it from doing so.
<P>
	It requires companies that bid to have exclusive carrier agents 
in at least seven provinces capable of handling 55 per cent of the 
government's business.
<P>
	Such restrictions do not exist in the United States. In the U.S. 
local moving companies can represent up to three different van 
lines. These ridiculous restrictions guarantee the government's 
business to the four van lines, three of which are 100 per cent 
American owned.
<P>
	There are move management companies which say they can 
save the government between $10 million and $25 million on its 
moves, given the chance to prove themselves. In fact, the 
previous government disbanded this moving committee and 
ordered that the two private sector companies be given the 
chance to administer government moves in a pilot project. But 
once elected, the present government cancelled this pilot project 
which seems odd given its stated commitment to ferret out waste 
and cut costs.
<P>
	One move management company which could have 
participated in this pilot project has been doing moves for the 
House of Commons. This company says that it has saved 35 per 
cent in current tariff costs. In addition, this company collects its 
fee not from the government but from the mover. The 
government's moving committee, the one that was to be 
disbanded, said that it cost them only $100 to manage each 
move. My understanding is that the defence department's own 
audit staff has found the management costs per move to be 
significantly higher than $100.
<P>
	I wonder why this audit, which was completed in February, is 
taking so long to become public? I have  raised several points 
here which I would like to repeat: Military men should not be 
involved in household moves. Private sector move management 
companies should be given a chance to prove that they can save 
the government millions of dollars while providing the same 
level of service.
<P>
	The van lines which have been convicted of price fixing in the 
past and which are under investigation today should not be given 
a monopoly over government moves.
<P>
	I am sure the defence department is on a limited budget and 
has certainly seen restrictions. I know that it could well use this 
$25 million that is estimated to be saved in these household 
moves in areas such as better equipment for our peacekeepers.
<P>
	I would ask the minister and the parliamentary secretary to 
pursue this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to cover three areas, the cost savings, the 
tendering process that the hon. member talked about, and the 
openness of the process to public scrutiny.
<P>
	He is right, DND accounts for 75 per cent of all the moves and 
in the past four years the government tariff has been reduced by 
25 per cent, which actually represents savings of about $45 
million to the government.
<P>
	The government tariff has a special clause agreed to by the 
van line that guarantees the lowest tariff. Although you might 
have isolated examples of lower cost moves, the fact is that the 
government is guaranteed the lowest rate by the moving 
industry.
<P>
	The cost of a move can be influenced by different factors, 
such as the distance involved, the volume and weight of the 
furniture, the time of the year, the destination, et cetera. So 
making comparisons can be very difficult.
<P>
	Regarding the tendering process, no carriers in Canada are 
excluded. The 900 moving companies across Canada are 
affiliated with and represented by the van lines which bid on the 
government tenders. All will have an opportunity to share the 
government business this year.
<P>
	The current government procedures for dealing with van lines 
were thoroughly reviewed and endorsed by officers of the 
Department of Industry and they do not contradict the 1983 
prohibition order against members of the moving industry. The 
member is right. The potential bidders must meet a certain 
criteria and these criteria have been relaxed somewhat to 
encourage competition inasmuch as the requirement for the 
fiscal year 1994-95 called for local representation in at least 
seven provinces representing 55 per cent of the business done by 
the interdepartmental committee to meet departmental location 
requirements. The previous requirement was 85 per cent in all 
the provinces.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5139"> 5139 </A></B>
<P>
	The tender for the fiscal year 1994-95 closed on February 11 
this year and the results have been determined. The government 
is going to realize savings in the millions of dollars as a result of 
a reduction of over 7 per cent from last year's government tariff. 
Our officials are continuing to pursue other costs savings 
initiatives in this area and details of the winning bid will be 
made available to anybody on request subject of course to 
considerations of privacy and commercial confidentiality.
<P>
	I trust that this update is helpful to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.15 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
